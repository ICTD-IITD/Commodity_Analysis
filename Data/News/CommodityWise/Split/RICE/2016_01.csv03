District officials said the owner of the unit had been arrested in 2011 for employing bonded labourers from Chhattisgarh. Sources in the district administration admit that he managed to get bail due to slow investigation by police and resumed exploiting migrant labourers.A similar case occurred ast month in Chengalpet when bonded labourers were rescued from the same rice mill in two separate raids in the space of a month.A Kancheepuram district administration official said tardy investigation and delay in filing chargesheets allowed the perpetrators to go free. ""If the investigation is not completed within three months, the accused get statutory bail from co urt,"" he said. Despite being booked under SCST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the accused managed to escape, he added.Kural Amuthan, director at International Justice Mission (IJM), an NGO which assists in rescue missions, said police viewed bonded labour as a labour issue and not as a problem of human trafficking which is internationally classified as organised crime. ""The investigation is not done with the same vigour as a rape or murder case which have the same penalty , that is, seven years to life imprisonment,"" Amuthan said.The victims are mostly from oppressed classes and given the feudal relationship with their `owners', shy away from seeking legal representation and fear testifying against their oppressors, Amuthan added. ""This is also one of the reasons why freed bonded labourers go back and work in the same environment. If the owner is in jail, the other actors in the crime chain like middlemen and contractors threaten them,"" said Richard Ebenezer, an advocate practising in the Madras high court.The Centre is also planning to increase the rehabilitation amount for the rescued labourers from `20,000 to ``2 lakh but with a caveat that the money reaches the victims only after prosecution. ""How can victims restart their lives if perpetrators are allowed to go scot free?"" Amuthan said.NHRC notice to TNChennai: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has sought a report from the Tamil Nadu government on the rescue of 550 bonded labourers from a brick manufacturing unit in Tiruvallur district recently.The NHRC has asked the government to specify the steps taken to rehabilitate the labourers."

She said that the AIADMK took a copy of the DMKs manifesto and pasted a sticker of the Chief Minister on it.Many poll promises of the AIADMK, including maternity leave, reduction of milk price to Rs. 25 per litre, were lifted from the DMKs manifesto, she said.At ThengampudurAt a street corner election campaign meeting in Thengampudur junction, Ms. Kanimozhi said that DMK president Karunanidhi had announced and implemented Re. 1 per kg of rice and waiver of farm loans in 2006.On the July agitation by the Bharatiya Janata Party, demanding extension of education scholarship to Hindu students as given to those belonging to minority communities, why the party did not implement it even after two years of sitting in power, she questioned.When the AIADMK government kept silent even after the death of anti-liquor crusader and Gandhian Sasi Perumal, how could it implement total prohibition in the State, she said.She also condemned the attack on members of a non-governmental organisation which staged an agitation for closure of a Tasmac retail outlet in Maduravoyal in Chennai on Thursday.Ms. Kanimozhi campaigned for DMK and Congress candidates contesting in Kanyakumari district."

The grainy black and white photo that now hangs framed in his living room is his only window to the original sprawling garden bungalow his great-grandfather built in 1911.""No one in the family ever really photographed the house and the street we lived on. Like most Indian families, we never kept any record,"" says Murari, whose family is among the oldest residents of Kilpauk. ""I wish we had though,"" he says.For then, they may have had a photograph of matinee idol MG Ramachandran, who shot scenes for several of his movies at Murari's Landons Road bungalow, which even had fountains. Or those of cricketing legend C K Nayudu -the first captain of the Indian test team -who used to come by the house for a game with Murari's grandfather, T Vasu Naidu, and father, T Murari, who were avid cricketers.""I was rather young at the time,"" says Murari, now 74. ""But I distinctly remember waking up one morning and finding a chariot being driven into the house by `Krishna'. It was just one of those strange sights I would wake up to because of the number of movie shoots in my garden,"" says Murari, one of the city's most wellknown novelists today -having written books such as `Taj' and the screenplay to `The Square Circle', counted among the best films of 1997 by Time magazine.""Our garden was large and we had what looked like a jungle in the backyard, so it was a popular shooting spot. It was big enough for a full fledged game of cricket,"" says Murari, who incidentally, also played cricket in his younger days. ""Chennai of old was the same as Chennai of today . We loved our movies. We loved our cricket,"" he says.In fact, Kilpauk was home to several movie studios -New Tone, Tamil Nadu Talkies, and Citadel (now the Don Bosco College of Arts and Design), which was a few hundred yards from Murari's landmark home at 32 Landons Road.The sparsely populated Kilpauk of the 1900s -with its vast expanse of land, scattered with sprawling garden houses, rice fields, and backyard jungles -lured his great-grandfather from the over-crowded George Town.""He was tired of the noise and wanted more space. So he moved here with his extended family,"" says Murari, who now lives in a small portion of what remains of the original bungalow, which extended from Taylors Road in Kilpauk, through present day Murari Avenue (named after his father, who fought in World War II), all the way down to present day Vasu Street (named after his grandfather).Up until the '50s, there were just 12 families who owned bungalows in Kilpauk. Murari recalls the thrill he felt when his family would troop into his grandfather's Ford or Duke to go to Poonamallee High Road for ice cream.In the '40s, transport was sparse -the city's tram service did not extend to Kilpauk, and the bus routes were limited. ""The roads here were lonely and dark, and I remember the terror I felt while cycling,"" says Murari, who recalls his Kilpauk of half a century ago in his novel `Four Steps from Paradise', published in 2006.When Murari left for England in 1959 and returned 30 years later, he barely recognized the surrounding he grew up in. Century-old bungalows had been demolished to make room for a tight squeeze of highrises, of fices, shops and gover nment quarters.""I believe buildings are the anchor to our heritage and if they're gone, well, we lose so much. And that's what Kilpauk has lost,"" he says.Little may remain from Murari's memory of Kilpauk, but some things haven't changed. ""Kilpauk, I have to admit, is riddled with outdated infrastructure and sewage lines, but we've never had any flooding. Not even in the rain that hit Chennai last December. Guess it's good when some things never change.""Readers who have fond recollection of their neighbourhoods can write to ekatha.ann@timesgroup.com"

Sharma also said, ""Electronic data exchange (EDI) is necessary especially for working with copy documents and automation of documents is very important.""He said that there is a need to push Indian commerce department for an early start and set the procedure fast by incorporating VPT in the transit and rail service agreements. ""The Nepal government should establish a liaison office to facilitate trade at Visakhapatnam as Kolkata consulate general's office is too far for the port. It is necessary that the VPT and the stake holders, both government and private, visit Kathmandu and conduct a event to educate on the facilities, equipment, technology and procedures with approximate cost factors to the trade.""Speaking about the facilities required for the Nepalese traders, he said, ""We just want timely information on vessel arrivals, the procedure, time and cost must be appropriate. The liners must coordinate well with port and CFS operators and the train service providers like CONCOR. Due to better culture of the South people we are hopeful that we will get better service. The VPT must have a good understanding with shipping liver for free time to avoid detention and demurrage charges and deposit of containers to CONCOR at Nepalese ICD would further enhance the service and increase the volume.""The cargo to Nepal through India's ports include imports of clothes, electronic shipments for household use, machineries, vehicles and industrial raw materials. Also, cargo such as bulk and break bulk cargo, fertilisers and rice imports are also routed to Nepal through the Kolkata Port until now. Currently, around 700 containers make their way to Nepal from the Kolkata Port every week.He said that Nepal was provided only one port of Kolkata/ Haldia for Nepal cargo and it was felt that having an additional port would provide ""the feel good factor"" for Nepalese in case any disruption in Kolkata port like the natural calamities related to sea happens, strike or port fails to operate.Referring to issues that need to be resolved, he said, ""The cost of doing business like the CFS charges, clearing agents fees and detention charges of liners for Nepalese cargo is too high. The procedure is also lengthy and takes four to five days to clear cargo after vessel arrives. Due to bad coordination between port, CONCOR and the railways the turnaround time from the shipment arrival date to deposits of empty to shipping line yard is even today taking 32 to 35 days.""VPT chairman MT Krishna Babu said, ""We are now inviting a trade delegation of about 20-25 people to visit Vizag and see the facilities available here. We have higher draft and the deputy chairman of VPT is coordinating with railways for easy connectivity. Once they let us know of any further requirements, we will extend the required cooperation for cargo movement through VPT."""

The limited amnesty scheme is one such innovative scheme wherein a wider spectrum of people would be brought under the tax net.Under the limited tax compliance window, people can now declare undisclosed income after paying 45% surcharge and penalties, from June 1 to September 30 this year.This is expected to generate a huge revenue that will go into capital expenditure while also reducing black money in the market.In contrast, the state government did not have any out-of-the-box schemes to mop up tax revenue even though the state is staring at a huge fiscal deficit and tax collection dipping to an all-time low.""The state government came up with populist measures such as giving free rice instead of looking at new methods to increase tax revenue,"" said P Rajagopal, a chartered accountant and financial expert.The Kerala Public Expenditure Review Committee Report (KPERC) had in fact recommended an immediate registration drive to include all 20 lakh shops and establishments in the state in the tax net.""Only 3.85 lakh establishments in the state are registered till date. Surprise physical inspection of shops should have been conducted to check this massive under-reporting. The committee had also recommended a reduction in the turnover level for registration from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 5 lakh as in other states,"" the KPERC report said.The Centre has also introduced an excise duty of one per cent on jewellery items. The state had not touched this sector, despite the gross undervaluation occurring in this sector.As per the estimate of Gulati Institute for Taxation Studies (GIFT), the total turnover of gold in 2012-13 is Rs 18,456 crore which should have generated a tax revenue of Rs 925 crore at the prevailing tax rate of five per cent.""But the actual tax revenue realized from gold is only Rs 394 crore, which is only 43% of the potential tax collection,"" the report said.The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report said that tax officials were not scrutinizing the VAT returns on a regular basis.""Traders are under-reporting their returns with the help of sales tax practitioners and tax officials. Corrupt practices at check-posts could be curbed by installing surveillance cameras, scanners and adopting digitization,"" the CAG report had noted."

He had grown up in Manipur, and during his almost two decades in Bengaluru, he had to rely on visiting relatives to provide him with home-cooked food.That gave him an idea. He quit his job in 2014 and teamed up with two friends, Surchand Wahengbam and Ratheesh Elayat, to start an ecommerce platform that sells exclusive eco-friendly Northeast products from Manipur's black rice to Nagaland's handmade shawls. Today , the ir venture, Giskaa, has aro und 1,500 sellers, from all the eight northeastern states, on its platform. It sells around the world. Singh says the ven ture is profitable.A number of portals focused on products from a certain region have emerged - Kashmirbox for Kashmiri products, Jaypore for ethnic Rajasthani products, and Farsankart for Gujarati snacks.Unlike the big etailers, these portals have a significant customer base outside India - and all say they earn profits. Delhi-based Jaypore, launched in 2012 by Puneet Chawla and Shilpa Sharma, started as a premium brand for Rajasthani jewellery and handicrafts, but has since expanded to include a range of ethnic products from several regions of India. Chawla says Jaypore sees, on an average, around 8,000 monthly transactions, with an average bill size of Rs 4,800.The highest selling products are crafts like Madhubani paintings of Bihar and block printing or Kalamkari paintings of Andhra Pradesh. It recently raised Rs 30 crore from venture firm Aavishkaar to expand their reach and market their brand.While Chawla knew right from Day 1 who Jaypore's target customers were going to be, for Farsankart, an online platform that sells farsan (fried Gujarati snacks) from vendors in Vadodara, the customers were a surprise. ""Almost 90% of our overseas customers are Gujarati, but the majority of the customers in India are non-Gujarati. Which is strange. I never knew farsan was popular among people who weren't Gujaratis,"" says founder Darshan Dhruv, who started the platform in 2011.Giskaa's Singh, too, realized an interesting fact about his customers. ""Our customers were not the typical e-commerce crowd. They were in the age group of 4550 with no obvious affinity towards the Northeast,"" he says. Maybe it was helped by the fact that Giskaa includes little motifs and the history behind every particular product that is shipped.""The user gets to read why the product is famous in a particular region of the Northeast and the artisan who made it,"" says Singh."

However, residents of several village panchayats in the constituency grapple with the problem of inadequate drinking water supply.Trucks, pose a challengeWith the areas abutting those that fall in the Chennai Corporation limits being rich in groundwater resources, several packaged drinking water units have mushroomed here over the last few years. With many warehouses, rice mills and plastic recycling units dotting the locality, trucks taking the arterial roads pose a huge challenge. Various political parties have nominated key candidates who are familiar with the locality.While S. Sudharsanam of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is former vice chairman of erstwhile Madhavaram municipality, D. Dakshinamurthi of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam is ward 30 councillor. Pattali Makkal Katchis G. Raviraj is former Tiruttani MLA. As the constituency lacks parking yards, lorries transporting the produce are parked on arterial roads adding to the traffic congestion on GNT Road. The Madhavaram truck terminal, which is spread over nearly 85 acres, still awaits basic infrastructure like roads.V. G. Jayakumar, president of Madhavaram truck terminal complex welfare association, noted that nearly 9,000 lorries ply to various localities every day. But, only five per cent of the parking space is available in the area.Residents of Madhavaram also point out that the various localities, in urban or rural pockets, lack an underground drainage facility and piped-water supply.List of demandsD. Jagannathan, a resident of Pammadhukulam, said: We have to travel nearly 20 km to Chennai to reach the nearest government hospital. There is a need for more government schools in areas like Palavedu and Pandeswaram. As this is a labour-oriented area, much needs to be done to improve literacy levels. People living in village panchayats still have to endure mud surface for roads.The recreation-starved residents are also looking forward to speedy execution of projects such as creation of an ornamental garden in Madhavaram and restoration of Retteri as a tourist site.In Red Hills, motorists also vie for space with trucks bringing the produce to rice mills.M. Jayapalan, vice-president of Rice Mills Association noted that as Madhavaram constituency is the gateway to Tamil Nadu for trucks from Andhra Pradesh, motorists of fast-developing areas on either side of GNT Road vie for space with speeding lorries.A subway or a flyover is essential to prevent accidents in the locality. There is ample space to develop parking yards in the area, he added."

However, with the introduction of MMSFES, the state would procure 12 lakh metric tones of food grains which would put an extra burden of Rs 400 crore on the state exchequer, he said.GPS system on trucksTo keep a check on any kind of wrong doings in the department, the Minister said, GPS system would be installed in our trucks ferrying food grains. Surveillance cameras would also be installed at all fair price shops so that distribution of various food items can be monitored.To improve the work culture in the department, Mr Ali said, Performers will get space in the department, while the non-performers will be shown the door.He also said that the department plans to establish a scientific laboratory to check the quality of food grains in the Valley in near future.We are committed to provide quality food grains to our people. I assure you that in near future we would start a scientific laboratory where food grains would be approved after passing the set guidelines, he said. - PTI"

Si. Mani and others of his brigade had a definite impact.Mostly rural, the constituency is witnessing a plethora of problems that break the back of peasants.Like elsewhere, farmers in the area have been adversely hit by the agro economy slide and are groping in the dark as to where and when their point of profit might arrive.In fact, the constituency has the landmark Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute at Aduthurai, a pioneering institute that has produced remarkable strains of paddy seeds.If agriculture is good, then the area and people should prosper. But this is not so.Apart from agriculture, the constituency has a chunk of people involved in handloom weaving with the world famous Tirubhuvanam silk saris having its home in the region.The society is thriving as of now but handloom weavers are facing a bleak future with the youth from the traditional weaving families preferring other avocations avoiding handloom trade.The Nachiyar Koil area is famous for brass kuthuvilakku (lamp) making. Scores of small units manufacture traditional lamps and hundreds of artisans are engaged in the process - from casting to trading.They would do better if proper global marketing arrangements are made by the agencies concerned.Besides, there are numerous location-specific woes such as lack of a proper bus stand at Tiruvidaimarudur, absence of higher government educational institutions, inadequate infrastructure in rural habitats, lack of long-term industrial development plans.Sitting MLA Govi. Chezhian of the DMK seems to have sized up the situation well after being elected and had launched a handful of initiatives soon thereafter.Free freezer boxesThey included the popular idea of providing freezer boxes for the deceased as a rent-free service.It seems he has purchased five of them and helping the people. It has brought immense popularity to him.Also, he has not generated any adverse publicity all through the five years and many believe that he had done his bit despite being in the Opposition.His connect with us is simple and direct. What Mr. Bharathi Mohan as MLA did not do, Mr. Chezhian did. He is readily accessible at all times and has delivered and will be our choice, says P. Karunanidhi (52), a daily wage earner belonging to Thirupanipettai.Let down in cattle schemeOf course, the rural areas have benefited from the AIADMKs various schemes. But the bane is that town panchayats feel let down in schemes such as free cattle. This constituency is a mix of rural and semi-urban areas and yet we feel neglected when schemes like free cattle are not implemented in our areas.However, we got free fan, mixer and grinder without trouble.Despite the region being predominantly DMK supportive, there are pockets that could give hope to the AIADMK, assures N. Dharman (55), a ruling party supporter. On the chances of his party candidate Mr. Settu, he says that Chief Minister Jayalalithaas manifesto will win the day for the ruling party.The flipside of the ruling party is that R.K. Bharathi Mohan, who won in 2006, could have done better to erase his image of being an outsider.The party had to carry the cross in 2011 and might well need to repeat the endeavour in this elections too unless the electorate is carried away by the freebies on offer from the ruling establishment.It is a pity we had elected MLAs who ended up in the losing side for two consecutive terms. It stunted the growth that could have otherwise come our path, points out T. Radhakrishnan, a tea stall owner at Aduthurai adding that it would be a hard tussle between Mr. Govi Chezhian and Mr. Settu.The other parties in the fray could make a difference to the winning margin of these two contestants but could do no more."

It is also home to Chetty, the oldest healer for the Irula tribes, who sits under a large banyan tree, sporting a yellow shirt and veshti.In front of him is a display of plant stems, roots and branches of various species.To meet a tribal healer like Chetty , TOI accompanied a group of 30 Ayurveda doctors, medicinal plant researchers, botanists and zoologists, to remote tribal hamlets of the Western Ghats on Thursday afternoon, in an attempt to document some ancient medical knowledge.Although his appearance may betray his expertise, Chetty is considered one of the most reliable healers in the Chadivayal, Singapathy, Siruvani belt. Apart from learning a few things from his grandfather, he has not had any formal education.Regardless, he's an expert in medicinal plants with a herbal garden of his own.""I have all the plants and medicines needed to cure any ailment,"" he says. The man, true to his word, even managed to surprise the researchers and doctors with the ex tremely rare Indian head ginger. ""Called plant insulin, it is an exotic species used to treat diabetes,"" said medicinal plant researcher and scientist at Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, C Kunhikannan. ""Though he claims he plucked it from the mountain, it's hard to believe because the species can be naturally found only in South America,"" he said. He was also in possession of a few stems of Boikullam plant. The plant's properties to treat eye problems has been well documented over the decades. It is extremely beneficial to animals too.""During Pongal, cows and other cattle are garlanded with garlands made from this plant,"" said P Kaalichamy, a healer. This plant also has the power to dissolve kidney stones.The Ayurveda doctors also met a village healer who is an expert in conducting smooth deliveries. The healer said, ""I give the woman a little castor oil before she goes into labour. I also rub her belly with castor oil. After the baby is born, we give the mother and child a bath,"" she said. The mother is fed rasam rice which contains cumin, pepper, garlic and some chilly which helps her recover from post-partum complications, she added."

But the Rs 35,000 crore refinery, billed as a state-of-the-art monument, is viewed by experts as the stepping stone for expeditious implementation of the mega petroleum, chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) with an investment of over Rs 1 lakh crore in the port town.""The PCPIR is conceptualised to become home of a large number of downstream industries with raw material mostly sourced from the refinery. These industries will actually create a large number of employment and boost the state's economy,"" said a senior IOCL official.History is replete with Odisha's rich maritime past when Chinese traders were regular visitors to buy rice and other products and merchants from the state routinely sailed to Southeastern Asian countries hawking native goods. But the present export scenario from the state wears a dismal look. Barring iron ore, dug out both legally and illegally, aluminium products from Nalco and fish, there is nothing great happening to add to the state's thin export list.Not in the distant past there was the attempt to set up a mega steel plant in Paradip by the South Korean company, Posco. But that did not materialise. Though not officially shelved, available indications do not show signs of the Rs 52,000 crore steel project, billed as India's largest FDI, happening in the near future.In contrast to the global recession scenario, the IOCL refinery, however, is being seen as the hope for a new beginning."

It would be the second such rally by Modi in a series of four, the first being at Sherpura in Sehore district of Madhya Pradesh on February 18.BJP sees western Odisha as a potential battleground where it can significantly improve its electoral fortunes because it had done better in this region in 2014 compared to the coastal part.Most of its 10 MLAs are from this part of the state.

Some of the adventurous ones found that it was heavy. The discovery, however, soon led to panic as someone suggested that it could be a bomb. People don't just throw away utensils since they have scrap value, he argued.As more and more people rushed to the spot to have a look at the 'bomb', someone wise rang up the Muthiapuram police. Following the instructions of the police team who soon rushed to the place, sand bags were brought to the spot and placed around the 'cooker bomb'. Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad (BDDS) was summoned, who came down with bomb detecting gear. After a careful probing, the experts ruled out explosives.

The fact remains that on each kg of rice at Rs 30, the Centre gives subsidy of Rs 27 while state government gives only Rs 2. Consumers get rice by paying only Re 1,"" he said.Speaking on the lapses of the state government leading to irregularities in digitized ration card preparation, Paswan said the only action the Centre can take is stop the supply of rice and wheat, but it will affect the consumers. He said the NFSA would be implemented in all states and Union territories by April.Paswan said to ensure transparency in the public distribution system (PDS), the Centre is planning to link the digitized ration cards with the Aadhar number. He said direct cash transfer in PDS has been launched on a pilot basis in Chandigarh and Puducherry.On January 17, the BJP state unit launched a poster campaign about the contributions of the Centre and state government towards the Re 1 rice scheme.The Union minister's statement on the scheme has come as a shocker to the state government as it is believed to be the major factor behind BJD's victory in the elections. The BJD, however, said the minister's claim is politically motivated and it would have no impact on people of Odisha.Before the 2009 assembly elections, the state government had launched the Rs 2 a kg rice scheme, which is supposed to be the main reason for the BJD winning 104 seats in the 147-member assembly.

There are a number of city women who have taken up full-time organic farming. Some of them who couldn't get into farming are even doing organic terrace kitchen gardening. All have something common.They are part of the Nagpur Seed Festival Group which has members who are completely into organic cultivation and opposed to chemical farming and naturally also other modern technologies like the genetically modified (GM) farming. The group from the last four years has been regularly holding a seed festival to create awareness in masses about preservation of indigenous varieties in various crops.TOI spoke to some of the women farmers on the first day of the Beejotsav being held at the Vinoba Vichar Kendra on Friday.""After entering the field, I realized that agriculture by itself was a difficult task and especially organic. I wouldn't find workers who would listen to my instructions. But I never gave up. I read on line. I attended Padma Shri Subhash Palekar's workshops, consulted experts like Vasant Futane. But now I have enough animals also to generate farmyard manure, vermicompost and other components of organic farming like use of gomutra, cow dung and neem-based pesticides etc. Farming has become a passion now,"" said Ashwini.Shyamla Sanyal, another dedicated organic farmer from the city, has been into serious agriculture from the past six years.

I had met Dinesh Balsawar, who is into organic rice farming in Lonavala, in 1993. But after beginning with a kitchen garden six years back now I am into full time farming. I grow wheat, gram, mung, tur, onions, garlic, mustard, turmeric, fennel, sesame, vegetables and fruits etc. It was trial and error. But now I know which crops are good for my soil conditions,"" said Sanyal.Prachi Mahurkar, who got associated with Beejotsav since last two years, has a farm in Maragsur village near Katol.

It has taught me to take holistic approach in agriculture too and hence along with crops I also have forest trees like hirda, bheda and amla in my field,"" said Mahurkar.Kirti Mangrulkar left her teaching job in computer science and is also into organic farming since two years. She believes in preserving indigenous varieties and grows desi cotton, ambadi, bajra, jowar and vegetables. ""I was impressed by Futane's work and took up farming only because of him,"" she said.Seema Kaushal, Supriya Deo and Rupinder Nanda are the others who are doing kitchen gardening and are associated with seed festival group. Kaushal tells that since she was a science graduate she understood the cultivation methods in terrace farming easily. She does vermicomposting, composting, Bokashi (anaerobic composting) in her Friend's Colony house and grows vegetables.Deo now has joined the seed festival group but was initially inspired by Organic Terrace Gardening Group (OTG) of Bengaluru and Urban Leaves of Mumbai.

Opposition councillors were united in sending out a message that it was a desperate bid to win over the city's slumdwellers.The confrontation between the ruling and opposition councillors was set as soon as Congress councillor Prakash Upadhyay raised the issue in the KMC monthly meeting. Upadhyay alleged the Trinamool-run civic board announced the scheme without proper infrastructure.

Being a woman police constable, she knew she had a lot of planning to do  apply for maternity leave, look for a domestic help for the long hours she would be away from the baby and adjust her duty timings.But one raid brought her dreams crashing down. Rajashree was asked to go near Hudkeshwar in search of a con woman who had duped many. Wanting to dodge the angry mob that had gathered around the woman's house, the police team took a kaccha road which turned out to be very bumpy. In the commotion, the inevitable happened.In the uneven ride, Rajashree knew that something was not right as she started getting excruciating spasms. When she reached the station and went to the bathroom, she was bleeding and realized that she had had a miscarriage.Sangeeta, another WPC, would hardly get a chance to breastfeed her baby in her post-partum days. Her immediate senior was a woman inspector but had chosen to disregard Sangeeta's needs when all she wanted was a half-an-hour break to feed her child. The result: Sangeeta started developing clogged ducts in her breasts. One day, she lactated spontaneously and her blouse became wet in front of her male colleagues during bandobast duty. ""Nowadays, we get six months of maternity leave, but back then it was only for three months,"" says Sangeeta, still embarrassed about the incident.States have given women 33% reservation in police force but have miserably failed to even identify their basic needs. Most women cops battle every day for primary facilities like separate toilets, changing rooms, comfortable uniforms, and relief from strenuous duty during pregnancy and menstruation. Women in uniform, too, are victims of powerful undercurrents of masculinity and a callous administration.Insensitive remarks from their male counterparts only add to their discomfort. When head constable Neha told her senior that she was pregnant and would appreciate a few relaxations, she was asked, ""Did I ask you to get pregnant."" Aditi remembers a similar incident when she wanted to change her uniform during pregnancy. ""How do I know if you are really pregnant,"" her senior inspector had asked.Chaitali tells that she was seven-month pregnant when she was posted on bandobast duty at Deekshabhoomi during Dussehra four years back. ""With my huge baby bump, I found myself getting jostled in the crowd of hundreds,"" she remembers.It is said that once you don a uniform, you are no different from a man. But at the policy level, not a second thought is given to the fact that after all a woman's physique is different. ""Our palms are smaller and we don't get a good grip while holding heavy pistols. Though some women-friendly pistols were introduced, they did not have a safety lock. The pistol would fire even while we sat on the chair,"" says assistant police inspector Manjusha.They have a permanent government job, respectable position in the society and a salary as per the sixth pay commission. But, when it comes to marriage, prospective grooms are hesitant. WPC Rohini, whose parents are trying to find her a suitable match, says, ""The prospective grooms know that we won't be able to give much time to family. We hardly get any leaves and work for 12 hours a day.""Those who do get married don't get enough time to enjoy their marital life. ""It's been over two months since my wedding but I am yet to spend quality time with my husband,"" says constable Sonali who is posted at police headquarters.At many police stations, woman cops don't get a compensatory leave after working on their weekly offs. ""A weekly off is mandatory but not when a VIP is in town. If seniors are understanding, they grant us a compensatory leave,"" said some WPCs. ""Last year, there came a time when I worked continuously for 20 days without taking a day off. My family had to survive on rice as I didn't get time to buy flour,"" says another in all seriousness.Hopping between long hours of duty and home, they are bound to miss out on many things. 48-year-old head constable Pragya recalls, ""When my son said 'mummy' for the first time, I was out patrolling near Katol. My husband is a cop too and we had to leave our kids with our neighbours. There were even times when I had to bring my kids at the station on night duties.""There is a creche at the police headquarters but woman police staffers feel that there is a need for more. ""If not at every police station, creches should be opened in different areas. We can't keep our kids at private ones as they wind up in the evenings while we work till night,"" they say.In another example of gender prejudice in the police force, male cops enjoy facilities like separate barracks but women don't even get separate washrooms or rest rooms in local police stations. ""At some police stations, we have to share a common washroom with men. The cleaners don't come regularly and many times there is no water facility. Urine infection is a common complaint,"" says a head constable.At the police control room, there is just one washroom for about 50 women staffers. ""We work throughout the night and desperately need a changing-cum-resting room. When menstruating, there is no place to change our napkins or even rest,"" say WPCs working at the control room.Handling abusive phone calls from people is another bad experience they go through every day. ""Some people use very foul language while others try to engage us in dirty talk. Pranksters call up '100' only to insult women cops,"" they say.At bandobast duties especially in the outskirts, there have been times when women cops had to relieve themselves in the open like their male colleagues. ""We understand that carrying a mobile toilet everywhere is not possible. But public toilets at every main square is a must,"" points out WPC Meena.Women working with traffic police share the same problems. ""We are made to stand for hours even when we are menstruating. We don't complain about that since it is a part of our duty. Having more public toilets is the only solution,"" says traffic constable Sheela.DCP Deepali Masirkar feels that there is a strong need of both, women-centric policy-level decisions and gender sensitization in the police force. ""Women don't need any special privileges but their basic needs should be recognized. This is still perceived as a male-dominated profession but it needs to change,"" she says.She adds that efforts are being taken at the local level to make the working atmosphere comfortable for women. ""Separate washrooms are being added to the newly constructed police stations. The control room building will also be renovated soon. Recently, sanitary napkin vending machines were installed at control room and head quarters,"" says Masirkar.But, woman cops across ranks would agree that though the change has just started, there is still a long way to go to make the police force a workable profession for women.(Though women cops were very forthcoming while narrating their woes, they were hesitant in being identified for fear of being victimized. Hence, names of constables and assistant police inspectors have been changed)"

Jothi Xavier, an alumni of MS University's Faculty of Fine Arts, is working with 14 warli artists from Talasari taluka of Palghar district, Maharashtra.The warli artists according to Xavier are unaware of the modern ways of exhibiting and marketing their craft. Through the community art initiative 'Tarpart', the city-based art historian has been grooming the artist in Talasari.""Warli art is a globally recognized indigenous people's art form. The tribes in Palghar have been practicing the art for centuries now. The objective of the initiative is to help them organize their work and help them explore new markets,"" said Xavier who also plans to launch a studio in the village.The NGO has been helping tribal artists by teaching soft skills, helping them develop their portfolios and preparing them for exhibitions across the nation. It organizes workshops on multiple skills including art techniques, marketing, presentation skills and photography.The residents of Talasari have acquired the art from their ancestors. The art form which was earlier restricted to social customs of the Warli tribe is now getting displayed at different parts of the country. The artists use rice flour as ink and paint figures inspired by nature on walls.""We have been practicing warli art for years, after being trained under the initiative we have started experimenting with the art form. Earlier, we used white paint made of rice, however, now after trainings by Tarpart we are using multiple colours and mediums like cloth, paper and canvas,"" said artist Dominic Malkari.Out of 14 artists, 12 of the artists' works have been exhibited across the country. According to Xavier, warli art from Talasari was restricted to annual handicraft fairs organized by the state government.""The organization has helped us in getting visibility on a national level. Its work is helping us by getting more sales and the effort is economically empowering our community,"" said Sujit Bhurkud another artists from Talasari."

Tomorrow (Friday), I will have do a detailed review of the scheme. Only then will I comment about its implementation in the state,"" Paswan told mediapersons following his meeting with state party workers here.About subsidies on rice under the NFSA, the Union minister said on each kg of rice at Rs 30, the Centre bears subsidy amount of Rs 27, while the state government bears only Rs 2. Consumers get rice at only Re 1.Paswan also had a meeting chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the latter's residence, where Naveen demanded more rice instead of wheat for the state under the scheme. ""We have constituted a committee headed by the chairman of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to examine the issue,"" Paswan added.""The state government also demanded subsidized rice for 4.8 lakh inmates of tribal hostels, "" said state food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Dasburma."

More than a century after Prosopis juliflora, a shrub, was introduced in Indian soil by the British, scientists are now trying to use its genes to engineer rice varieties that can withstand water scarcity.After coming up with rice grains that are resistant to saline conditions by tapping genes of mangroves, researchers at M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) have now identified genes in P juliflora that help the weed withstand extreme climatic conditions like salinity and drought. This, they say, can help develop transgenic rice grains that can cope with aridity.A transgene is a gene or genetic material that has been transferred naturally or through genetic engineering techniques from one organism to another. Suja George, principal scientist at MSSRF, has been studying rice and P juliflora at the molecular level for close to 12 years now. In February, she and her team of researchers had a breakthrough of sorts when they identified specific genes in the shrub that react to stressful conditions. ""We created an environment of aridity in the lab and isolated ribonucleic acid from the shrub's leaves and roots. The team then found which genes changed their expression under stress,"" said Suja.Ribonucleic acid is a molecule implicated in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. ""Analysis of the physiological and molecular mechanism underlying stress tolerance is just the first phase of the research,"" said Suja. ""Now comes the crucial part - characterising the genes and transferring them into rice crops,"" she said.Abiotic stress - a term scientists use to refer to extreme environmental conditions such as drought, salinity, high temperature, high light intensity and nutrient imbalances -- is the principal cause of crop failure worldwide.P juliflora is a survivor. The evergreen species, native to south and central America and the Caribbean, grows fast and is tolerant to arid conditionsand saline soil. Introduced in India during the 1870s by the British, and in Tamil Nadu in the 1970s to meet firewood shortage, the shrub turned out to be a bane. It spread fast and colonised the ecosystem, creating negative pressure on biodiversity. Scientists are focussing on the weed's trait to withstand extreme conditions.The research team at MSSRF is also looking at other plants that exhibit similar stress tolerance like Avicennia marina, a halophytic (salt loving) plant and Chrysopogon zizanioides (vetiver), a perennial grass."

It is committed to uniform development of the state and the victory of Congress backed candidates in Panchayat and urban local bodies' elections is a proof that people have reposed their faith in the government,"" Singh said while addressing a press conference on completion of three years in office.He said that his government had completed three years in office on December 25, 2015 but no function or press conference could be held to list its achievements as model code of conduct was in place.The government had adopted the party manifesto as its policy document and not only fulfilled the promises but gone beyond the promises made in the manifesto, he added.Singh said the government's track record on development had been remarkable and the state has witnessed spectacular development in key sectors like education, health, irrigation, drinking water and tourism during last three years.The HP government was providing subsidised foodgrains to about 18.23 lakh ration card holders and also extending subsidy on power to all the domestic consumers.Singh said in health sector, three new medical colleges were coming up at Nahan, Hamirpur and Chamba, ""Government is all set to take over the ESI medical college in Mandi and make it functional from this year while an AIIMs is coming up at Bilaspur.""The State government has provided employment to more than 60,000 people, including 27,000 in the government sector and 33,000 in the private sector in the last three years and is committed to create more than 25,000 employment opportunities in the next two years.Besides, the government has launched Rs 500 crore Skill Development Allowance Scheme under which an unemployed youth would get an allowance of Rs 1000 per month while youth with special abilities of Rs 1500 and till now 1,07,887 youths have been benefitted.Annual Income Limit for availing benefits under various welfare schemes has been enhanced from Rs 20,000 to Rs 35,000, social security pension has been enhanced from Rs 450 to Rs 600 per month benefitting 3,63,825 aged, widows and persons with special abilities persons.Persons above 80 years of age were being provided social security pension at the rate Rs 1,100 per month irrespective of their income and over 37 lakh people are getting 3 kg wheat at Rs 2 per kg and 2 kg rice at Rs 3 per kg per person per month under the 'Rajiv Gandhi Anna Yojana', he said."
58f522707be9e01a17c93435,Agencies battle over what is 'top secret' in Hillary Clinton’s emails,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Agencies-battle-over-what-is-top-secret-in-Hillary-Clintons-emails/articleshow/50886489.cms,2016-02-07,"WASHINGTON: Some of the nation's intelligence agencies raised alarms last spring as the State Department began releasing emails from Hillary Clinton's private server, saying that a number of the messages contained information that should be classified top secret.The diplomats saw things differently and pushed back at the spies.In the months since, a battle has played out between the State Department and the intelligence agencies  as well as Congress  over what information on Clinton's private server was classified and what was the routine business of U.S. diplomacy, according to government officials and letters obtained by The New York Times.At the center of that argument, the officials said, is a top-secret program of the CIA that is anything but secret. It is the agency's long effort to track and kill suspected terrorists overseas with armed drones, which has been the subject of international debates, numerous newspaper articles, television programs and entire books.The Obama administration's decision to keep most internal discussions about that program  including all information about CIA drone strikes in Pakistan  classified at the top-secret level has now become a political liability for Clinton's presidential campaign.Some of the skirmishes over Clinton's emails reflect the disagreements in a post-9/11 era over what should be a government secret and what should not. Nonetheless, 22 emails on Clinton's server were held back from a tranche made public last week. Those 22 emails were deemed so highly secret that State Department officials in this case agreed with the intelligence agencies not to release them even in redacted form.The emails are included in seven distinct chains that comprise forwarded messages and replies, and in most cases involved discussions of the CIA drone program, government officials said.At a Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire on Thursday night, Clinton dismissed the issue, as she has in the past. She said the government was overzealously classifying information after the fact, citing as evidence the State Department's finding that two emails sent to Colin L. Powell's private email account and 10 others sent to the personal accounts of aides to Condoleezza Rice when each served as secretary of state should now be classified years after the fact. It is against the law to have classified information outside a secure government account.""This just beggars the imagination,"" Clinton said, going on to argue that the issue was merely an extension of Republican criticism over the attack against the U.S. consulate and CIA annex in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.It remains unknown what exactly the 22 emails contain, given their classification as top secret, but the officials described them generally, on the condition of anonymity. The officials included people familiar with or involved in the handling of the emails in government agencies and in Congress.Spokesmen and women for the State Department, the CIA and the intelligence agencies' inspector general declined to comment on the content of the emails.Some of the emails include material classified at the highest levels, known as Top Secret/SAP, according to a letter sent to the Senate on Jan. 14 by the inspector general of the nation's intelligence agencies, I. Charles McCullough III. That designation refers to ""special access programs,"" which are among the government's most closely guarded secrets.Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of state was first disclosed in March, and since then the State Department has slowly released 33,000 emails that Clinton and her aides determined were work-related. None of the emails sent through Clinton's server were marked as classified, the officials said, and most were written by her aides and forwarded to her. That is also true of the emails forwarded to Powell and Rice, which until now have been in the department's unclassified archives.The handling of classified information on Clinton's server is the subject of an investigation by the FBI, as well as the State Department's security and intelligence bureaus. According to the law and security procedures Clinton agreed to follow when she became secretary, such material should not even have been sent over the State Department's official but unclassified state.gov server.At the same time, the officials said, some of the classifications being sought for the emails fall into a gray area between public knowledge and secrecy. In such instances, the original source of the information  and thus the level of its classification  can be disputed, and has been, vigorously at times, they said. Other emails have been the subject of rigorous debate over what constitutes a secret and what the nation's diplomats can say about intelligence matters as they grapple with international crises and conflicts.""While the secretary of state has a duty to protect classified information, as all of us do in a position of trust, here she did not have the benefit of six-plus months of interagency classification reviews,"" said Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. ""The same information said by people in two different positions may receive two opposite classification determinations.""Although the State Department accepted the CIA's classification of the 22 emails, it has also sought to challenge accusations that it was negligent in handling secrets.During the review, the State Department has rebutted claims by at least one intelligence agency that information in some of the emails ought to remain classified.Some of those include the emails that led McCullough's office to refer the matter to the Justice Department last summer, prompting the FBI's investigation. McCullough made the referral based on an assessment that four of 40 emails that it sampled early on in the process contained top-secret information.Now, after months of review, only one of those four turned out to be classified at that level. (The State Department counts that email among the 22 of last week.) A second of the four emails has been downgraded to ""confidential,"" the lowest level of classification. The third was released last fall.The fourth involved an email sent by Kurt M. Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for Asian affairs, shortly after a North Korean ballistic missile test in July 2009. The email has not yet been made public, even in redacted form, but the State Department has challenged an assertion from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which gathers data through satellite images, that the email included information that came from a highly classified program.In a letter this past Dec. 15 to Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a State Department official said that the information could not have been based on NGA's intelligence because Campbell did not receive any classified intelligence briefings for what was a new job for him until a few days after the North Korean test.More broadly, the memo stated, diplomats working at the State Department or in embassies around the world constantly receive and pass on information from unclassified sources  so-called parallel reporting  that can involve highly classified matters. That can make it difficult to determine with confidence whether information in any single email came from a classified source.""When policy officials obtain information from open sources, 'think tanks,' experts, foreign government officials, or others, the fact that some of the information may also have been available through intelligence channels does not mean that the information is necessarily classified,"" the department's assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Julia Frifield, wrote in the December letter to Corker.Another email whose classification has been disputed was dated April 20, 2011, and was among those that prompted members of Congress and McCullough's office to begin a review of the State Department's release of the emails by court order under the Freedom of Information Act.It was from Timmy T. Davis, an officer in the State Department's Operations Center, and it conveyed to Clinton's senior staff security concerns in Libya during the war against the country's leader, Moammar Gadhafi.At the time, J. Christopher Stevens, the future ambassador to the country, was secretly traveling there as an envoy to the opposition leadership and had telephoned the Ops Center, as it is known, to advise it about his situation on the ground.Davis sent his message, marked ""SBU,"" or ""sensitive but unclassified"" to two of Clinton's closest aides, Huma Abedin and Jacob J. Sullivan, as well as to Alice G. Wells, an executive assistant to Clinton who is now the ambassador to Jordan.At issue were two sentences in the email referring to reports by Africom, the U.S. military command for Africa, describing the movement of Gadhafi's forces near the city of Ajdabiya. In a letter on Nov. 24 last year, Frifield detailed how the information in the email differed significantly from the suspected intelligence source and could well have been based on public briefings given the day before by NATO's military about the course of the war.""The conclusion that the information in the email was drawn from that intelligence product is unsubstantiated and on its face wrong, given the differences between the information in the email and the information in the product,"" Frifield wrote."

Singur, that propelled Mamata Banerjee to power five years ago, isn't her priority anymore.With just a month to go for the polls, the chief minister washed her hands of the issue on Friday saying, ""I have done my bit for Singur. We have enacted the law to return land to unwilling farmers. Now it is in court. If the court takes five years or 50 years to adjudicate we are helpless."" She was speaking in the assembly, which is meeting for the last time before polls.One of Mamata's first decisions after coming to power in 2011 was to promulgate an ordinance to acquire 400 acres of the 1,000-acre Nano factory land from the Tatas to return it to unwilling farmers. But the decision ran into legal hurdles. The case has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012. The state had moved the apex court after the Calcutta high court in June 2012 struck down the Singur Land Rehabilitation and Development Act, 2011, as unconstitutional. Unable to immediately re turn land to the Singur farmers, the CM even pro mised a Metro coach factory at the Nano factory site when her party was in charge of the railway ministry . That did not materialise either. She then tried to keep small farmers and landless labourers happy by shelling out a monthly dole of Rs 1,000 and 2 kg rice at Rs 2kg to families that didn't accept the compensation cheques.On Friday, the chief minister even buried hopes of an out-of-court settlement between her government and Tata Motors, a proposal that gained currency while the case remained pending in the Supreme Court. In fact, the legal counsel for Tata Motors had floated the proposal in public interest after the state lost the case in Calcutta high court.It is not without reason that former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee kicked off the party's poll campaign from Singur, where a large section of farmers are now left without land or money .Bhattacharjee promised to set up industries in Singur once the Trinamool government is voted out of power."

This would be supplied by women in electric autorickshaws at select points.The local body will identify women, who are in need of financial support, and let them run kiosks at places identified by the corporation. The project will use corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds.The food will be prepared without using whole flour (maida) or added colours, and oil will be used sparingly for cooking.""Only healthy food will be supplied under the project. Around 150 autorickshaws will be deployed in the first phase, which will be launched on March 8. Existing kiosks, run by women, will be renovated under the project. We have not identified the site to set up the centralised kitchen. Waste generated at these shops will be utilised to produce biogas,"" mayor Soumini Jain said.KSWDC will decide on the menu, provide training to interested women entrepreneurs and monitor the environment-friendly project.

Santosh Da was the first to flee, followed by other cadres,"" he added.During the encounter at Luggu Hill on Wednesday night, Santosh Da asked Gappu to stay in front while he opened fire at security personnel.

At a time when the maximum day temperature continues to hover around 38 degrees Celsius, records from the state agriculture department show that paddy sowing has been lesser than 2014-2015.Data shows Telangana farmers have restricted themselves to sowing paddy on a measly 2.2 lakh hectares against the average of 6.4 lakh hectares in previous two years. A shortfall of rice is on the cards, as a result of decrease in sowing, especially in the city.At present, a kg of Sona Masoori rice, is priced anywhere between Rs 45-60 in the open markets. Traders are of the opinion that the price could soar to Rs 80 or higher.""To cultivate paddy, water must be made available in copious amounts. But in the last one year, we have been facing a drought-like situation. Now, even the borewells have dried up, which is why many of us have stopped sowing paddy,"" said D Shyam, a farmer who has 30 acres of barren land in Bibinagar.However, the worst affected would be the urban consumers, according to J Jayaram, general manager, marketing, state civil supplies department, as the monthly consumption of rice in the entire city is around 1.8 lakh tonnes. But with the shortfall in paddy cultivation, farmers fear that the maximum yield that they can now achieve would barely be one-third of the monthly requirement.""If the acreage of cultivation comes down, apart from a dip in the quantity of rice, the rate for procuring the produce, milling and making it fit for consumption goes up. And, this additional price would have to be borne by the consumers,"" said Venkateshwarulu Manchu Konda, president, Rice Millers' Association, who supplies rice to several supermarket brands in the city.Not just the farmers, even agrarian experts like G V Ramanjenayulu highlight how the crop production has come down by half. ""Most of the farmers had pinned their hopes on irrigating their farms with the rainwater. But unfortunately, all their hopes were dashed,"" he said.Even, senior officials from the department said they are fast losing hope on early rains. ""It is only the farmers with access to a working borewell, who are taking up paddy cultivation,"" C Parthasarathi, secretary of the department."

A former school director, who fled from the city earlier this month, describes the tool as causing agonising pain by clipping off pieces of flesh.Fatima, a 22-year-old house-wife who does not want to give her full name, said she had finally escaped from Mosul after several failed attempts because her children were starving and Isis had become more violent and sadistic compared with a year ago, especially towards women.""The Biter has become a nightmare for us,"" Fatima said after reaching safety in Mabrouka Camp for displaced people near Ras al-Ayn in Kurdish-controlled north-east Syria. ""My sister was punished so harshly last month because she had forgotten her gloves and left them at home.""Isis insists that women be fully veiled, wear loose or baggy trousers, socks and gloves, and be accompanied by a male relative whenever they step outside their homes.Fatima said that a month after the use of this metal tool to punish her sister ""the bruises and scars are still visible on her arm."" She quoted her sister as saying that ""the biting punishment is more painful than labour pains."" Other witnesses describe the Biter as operating like an animal trap, or a metal jaw with teeth that cut into the flesh.It is difficult and dangerous to escape from Mosul, which Isis has held since capturing it from the Iraqi army in June 2014. But people from the city, who have had themselves smuggled across the border to Syria and then to Kurdish-controlled territory known as Rojava in the past two months, all confirm that living conditions have deteriorated sharply. There are serious shortages of almost everything including food, fuel, water and electricity.Isis was violent from the start of its rule 20 months ago, but public whippings and executions have become far more common in recent months. Mosul residents say that Saudi and Libyan volunteers, who have joined Isis, are the most likely to impose penalties for minor infringements of regulations in the self-declared caliphate.It is as if Isis fighters and officials are compensating for setbacks in the war by showing that they still have power over the population under their control.Ibraham, a 26-year-old pharmacist who left Mosul on 16 January, said that there is little food and only a limited supply of medicine left in the city. ""My pharmacy became half empty,"" he said. Pharmaceutical factories around Mosul have stopped production and there are fewer medicines being imported from Syria. Simple painkillers like Panadol that cost $1 (70p) for a bottle last year now cost $8, according to Ibrahim.There is a shortage of food and what is available is very costly. The ""caliphate"" is increasingly cut off from supplies from Turkey and the rest of Syria. It also has less money to spend because of air attacks on its exports of crude oil, combined with the fall in the price of oil.The Baghdad government continued to pay the salaries of public servants in Mosul even after Isis took over, but Ibrahim said that money stopped coming through nine months ago. ""I have spent almost all my savings,"" he said. ""Last year, $500 a month was enough for a family to live on, but now even $1,000 is not enough because prices are twice or even five times what they used to be.""Refugees speak of starvation spreading throughout the city under the impact of this economic siege. ""For me, I could stand the bad treatment and lack of food, but when my toddler of 11 months began to starve it became impossible to stay,"" said Fatima.Baby milk has not been available for six months and other foodstuffs are prohibitively expensive. Rice costs $10 a kilo. Nor are these problems confined to Mosul. Farmers are leaving their fields because ""there is no electricity to pump water so they cannot irrigate their crops"", according to Ghanem, 25, an unemployed plumber who is now in north-east Syria.He insists that the main reason he fled Mosul was not the bad living conditions, but Isis ""poking their noses into the details of people's daily lives with their arbitrary fines and punishments"". He speaks of the increasingly harsh treatment of women, with the Biter being used as a punishment ""on women deemed to have shown too much skin"".Popular revulsion against Isis within the ""caliphate"" does not necessarily translate into resistance or mean that its rule is fatally undermined, however. There have been few anti-Isis armed attacks in Mosul and Isis uses its well-organised and merciless security arm to target real and imagined opponents. Where tribes have risen up against Isis in Iraq and Syria their members have been hunted down and slaughtered in their hundreds. Whatever the shortages affecting the ordinary population in Isis-held territory, officials and fighters will not go without food or fuel - though falling revenues does mean that their salaries have been cut in half.The Caliphate is under heavy attack from its numerous though disunited enemies, the most important of which are the Syrian and Iraqi armies, the Iraq Kurdish Peshmerga and the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). These armies are not very large, but their fire power is greatly multiplied by the close support they receive from US and Russian air strikes. This makes it impossible for Isis to hold fixed and identifiable positions without suffering serious casualties.But Isis can still act as a skilled and experienced guerrilla force, attacking vulnerable roads such as that linking Syrian government-held Homs and Aleppo, which the group cut this week.Even so, there are clear signs of growing corruption and disorganisation within Isis. The very fact that so many people have escaped from Mosul, despite strict rules against leaving, shows that Isis is less capable of enforcing its regulations than previously, for all the terror that it still inspires. The former school director, who does not want to give his name, says: ""They threaten to kill us if we go outside Mosul"". Smugglers commonly charge between $400 and $500 to secretly transport someone to safety, though some of this may go straight to Isis which is desperate for money.Ghanem said he was frightened at first as he left Mosul for Syria, but a smuggler reassured him saying: ""Don't worry. Money makes everything possible and they [Isis] will take their share.""Isis was always a paranoid organisation, seeing traitors and spies everywhere, and this is growing worse. Anything can be grounds for suspicion: one woman, who eventually reached safety in Erbil, mentioned casually that her brother-in-law had been arrested and executed because he had once been a member of a police unit that specialised in protecting the oilfields.Wisam, a 19-year-old student, had worked in a minor capacity as a photo editor in the local TV station and for news agencies, an activity he thought might put him at risk. ""I spent more than a year working in the bazaar selling vegetables,"" he said. ""I could not work online because the internet is heavily monitored by Isis.""Mosul is returning to a pre-modern era without electricity or drinking water, say its former inhabitants. During the first year of its Caliphate, Isis made great efforts to ensure that public services worked as well as, or better than, under the Iraqi government, but it appears to have abandoned the attempt.""We only get drinking water once a week,"" said Wisam. ""Pipes are broken and need repair, but the administration in Mosul has become careless and confused over the past five months.""The mains electricity supply has likewise almost stopped and people rely on private generators, either their own or those owned by local businessmen who sell the power. This can be too expensive for many families. Fatima said that ""most areas of the city are dark and Mosul has become like a ghost town.""Dependence on generators means reliance on locally produced fuel, which is of poor quality since US air strikes have destroyed the refineries in Syria that were controlled by Isis. The fuel cannot be used in cars and damages the motors in generators, which often stop working. Isis tried a coupon system to ration fuel but later abandoned it. Ghanem said that ""we feel we are living in the Stone Age: no mobiles, no TV, no cars, even no lighting.""The pressure of war on many fronts, combined with the tightening economic blockade, has undermined the Caliphate's attempt to show Sunni Arabs that it is better able to administer a state than the Iraqi or Syrian governments. When its fighters captured Ramadi in May last year they got credit from local people for swiftly reopening the local hospital, something the Iraqi government had failed to do, by bringing in doctors from Syria.They also brought in large generators to provide electricity. In much of eastern Syria, Isis's draconian regulations were preferable to the criminality and insecurity which had flourished previously under other armed opposition movements.The testimony of refugees is inevitably biased against those who forced them to abandon their homes and flee and, while the accounts of their suffering are undoubtedly true, they cannot speak for those who stayed behind. Isis still has fanatical supporters and there is no mass exodus of deserters from its ranks, even though they are being bombed by the two largest air forces in the world.Isis was always infamous for relating to the rest of the world solely through violence and, as the tide turns against it on the battlefield, it is not surprising that this violence is becoming steadily even more extreme."

The rice mills in Ghoti now want the state agricultural and other departments' concerned to provide the special status to the commodity.This variety of rice, processed at Ghoti in Igatpuri tehsil of the district, is in high demand acorss the country and is used to make 'khichdi' and 'bhaat' (cooked or boiled rice) consumed as part of daily meal. Around 3.5 lakh quintals of rice worth Rs 125 crore are produced in Ghoti annually, including 2.5 lakh quintals of Indrayani and remaining 1 lakh quintals of Lachkari variety.GI is a name or sign used on products corresponding to a specific geographical location. The use of a GI tag may act as certification that the product is made traditionally or has a reputation owing to its geographical origin. Navsukhbhai Picha, president, Ghoti Rice & Bhagar mills association, said, ""Around 60 rice mills located in the hilly Ghoti areas process two varieties Indrayani and Lachkari. Of the total 3.5 lakh quintals of rice processed, 2.5 lakh quintals are Indrayani. This variety has a unique smell and taste too and is small in size as compared to other varieties.""In Ghoti, the yield of paddy is around 40 quintals per acre. From 100kg paddy, 48kg of whole rice and 15kg broken rice is processed. The total area under cultivation of paddy in the district is close to 75,000 hectares, including 35,000 hectares in Igatpuri."

He had declared that the CM should accept his demands during the ongoing budget session of the assembly by March 10 failing which he threatened to sit on the hunger strike from the very next day, March 11.On Wednesday, the state police machinery made its moves and directed police personnel from the neighbouring districts to make themselves available to be posted in Kirlampudi by Friday morning, the day of the fast. According to sources, nearly 5000 cops are being deployed for security duties in and around Kirlampudi and that 20 check- posts will be set up at various entry points to the village in East Godavari.The cops precautions is apparently based on intelligence inputs that Mudragada's supporters have already stored essential commodities and rice for around 500 persons at the Kapu leader's house to last for at least a month. Besides, scores of toilets have been constructed for the supporters who will camp with their leader in large numbers. The sources claimed that some of the supporters had already asked the villagers to occupy the community halls and Kalyanamandapams in the name of weddings so that they can take on the cops when required.Last time around, Mudragada along with his wife has sat on the indefinite fast and called it off in 72 hours after a TDP delegation called on him and gave his some assurances.It is not clear as to why the Kapu leader has decided to sit on a fast again barely a month after his previous one. The TDP has been alleging that he has become an agent of YSR Congress president Jaganmohan Reddy, a charge that Mudragadda vehemently denies.Already facing a demand for the inclusion of various communities in the BC and SC/ST lists, and opposition to this from those communities who are currently enjoying the benefits, Naidu can find himself in treacherous ground if Mudragadda's agitation spins out of control. Last time around, the state ignored the fast by the Kapu leader and intervened only on the third day.This time, it is not clear as to what strategy the TDP regime will adopt. A few Kapu ministers in the Naidu cabinet last week appealed to Mudragadda to not play into the hands of the opposition and politicise the issue. By deploying adequate forces in Kirlampudi ahead of the indefinite fast, the state appears to be prepared for the long haul."

Apartments and high-rises today have hardly any crevices or niches for sparrows to nest. Electromagnetic radiation from cellphone towers is another big reason that has affected birds. Besides, birds are often electrocuted by wires dangling from electric poles.Growing noise pollution is another factor that does not make birds feel safe. ""Sparrows have always co-existed with humans. You will not find the bird in the wild,"" said ornithologist KK Mishra. Sparrows have lived and bred in recesses in walls of old buildings, above the entrance door which mostly had gaps between the wooden beam and the wall, in ventilators or in open spaces used for storage in houses. Modern dwelling units, high on architectural finesse, hardly have space for 'house-sparrows'.Change in the urban plantation scheme, where ornamental varieties dominate, also does not support sparrow population. 'Desi' varieties like jamun, tamarind, peepal, neem, mango and lemon, which are fruit-bearing, and grow up to become huge trees with dense crown and crevices in their trunk, are not planted any more. Years-old roadside trees, bushes and thickets in the middle of the city, parks and green spaces in residential colonies provide space to birds for roosting. But, tree cover has been lost to concretization.""It was always believed that sparrows are the symbol of prosperity and happiness but urban homes now do not get these visitors. These homes have no food or water for the birds,"" said range officer, Lucknow city, OP Singh. In many houses earlier, it was a routine to keep aside morsels for birds and animals before people sat down for food. The tradition is almost lost now.""Sparrows have been of extreme help to farmers as they prey on harmful insects and pests,"" said Singh. Change in agricultural techniques, however, has not been favourable to birds. Farmers spray insecticides to protect their crops. Birds prey on these insects and die due to poisoning.The agriculture residue is also unfit for the bird to eat. When the bird eats grains and fruits treated with pesticides and fungicides, it dies.n Reason to rejoice:Sparrow count might be on the rise in Lucknow. A study conducted by the Biodiversity and Wildlife Conservation Lab of Lucknow University found an increase in the number of sparrows over successive years. In 2015, 5,637 birds were counted, which was up from 4,084 in 2014 and only 2,025 in 2013. The forest department, too, launched awareness programmes for sparrow conservation in 2010. ""We never had any numbers available for sparrows, so to say that the population of the bird has increased over the years is difficult. We can definitely say that people have started noticing the bird more. Sensitivity towards the bird has increased,"" said a forest department official."

This is part of the World Water Day celebrations on March 22. The state feels that due to the recent problems with water scarcity, it is of utmost importance that students understand the need to save water.Schools have been asked to hold essay and drawing competitions where the theme is related to water saving initiatives. The state government has also suggested that lectures could also be held by schools where experts can share their views. Schools can also hold exhibition related to the subject and are at liberty to use audio visual medium to impress upon students that saving water is crucial to avoiding a crisis in future.The state government's letter says water scarcity is such a serious issue that it cannot be solved unless citizens play an active role alongside authorities. It adds that this includes a variety of things such as ensuring water sources are kept clean and pollution free. The letter says that citizens have to careful and ensure that water is not wasted at all.New classes to be added to confirm to RTE normsThe state government has sanctioned a pending decision over adding extra classes to schools so that they confirm to norms set under Right To Education (RTE) Act. The state had rightly decided to add Std V in all schools that function only till Std IV, and add Std VIII to all schools that function only till Std VII. Schools were set up that way earlier because primary schools used to be from Std I-IV from while middle schools from Std V-VII. Before RTE every state had its own format of primary, middle and high school format. In Maharashtra, for Std I-X, there was 4+3+3 format which now has been taken to 5+3+2 one.Midday meal cooking cost increasedGovernment has approved increased expenditure against cooking costs of midday meals. For primary (Std I-V) the cooking cost per day/per student was Rs. 3.76 while for secondary level (Std VI-VIII) it was Rs.5.64. The government has now increased the cooking cost expenditure by 7.5% for financial year 2015-16. For midday meal preparations the government supplies rice through Food Corporation of India (FDI). Then depending on the location of the school, rural or urban area, other costs are included. For MDM schools are allowed to use domestic LPG cylinders at subsidized rate so that costs do not cross a given threshold.Exam fee waiver for SSC & HSC students in drought areasThe state government has waived off exam fee for SSC and HSC for those students who live in drought affected areas. Total 8.86 lakh students will benefit from state government's move and the state has set aside just over Rs. 32 crore for this scheme. State education minister Vinod Tawde had made this announcement last year to bring some relief to students affected by the drought."

I was told that I may earn Rs 1,500 daily like others,"" said Arun Saini, 23, a matriculate. Jogga Singh's father Amrik Singh said four youths of their village had already gone to Lebonan, inspiring many to follow suit.Four youths had paid Rs 2.75 lakh to Rs 4 lakh each to a local agent for their journey to Lebanon.They had left for Lebanon on September 24, 2014, but landed in Jordon. ""We were told that we have visa only till Jordon and will move to Lebanon by road via Syria,"" said Saini.

The previous year's revenue deficit of Rs 7831.92 crore estimated in the 2015-16 budget had to be revised as Rs 10814.49 crore in the Budget presented today.The projected revenue deficit for the coming fiscal is Rs 9897.45 crore but this had been estimated with the hope that tax revenue would grow at 20% this year.Thomas Isaac, finance minister in the LDF government, mustered some hard facts to point out that the government's populism just didn't have the foundation to even appear as populism.""For the various schemes to take wings, revenue generation needs to rise 18%. It grew under 11% in the past five years due to the financial slowdown. How can it reach 18% in the next year,"" he asked.Finance and industry experts echoed Isaac's scepticism. ""They won't be able to implement the project because the state doesn't have enough money. The expectation of a 20% tax revenue is unrealistic,"" said K N Harilal, associate professor, Centre for Development Studies.With elections just weeks away, facts weren't obviously a priority for Chandy. In a budget speech that stretched for a record two hours and 54 minutes, Chandy wasn't just wooing the poor.He chalked out an allocation of Rs 200 crore whereby the government would pay two instalments of education loans to those who pay 10 monthly instalments without default, a move seeking to appease two generations of voters - those in 40s and 50s and their wards in their early 20s.There was a slew of other sops: Introduction of Kanivu project, hiking old age pension, insurance scheme for welfare pension beneficiaries and extending widow pension to separated women were all aimed at winning hearts and votes.Big ticket projects like Vizhinjam port, light metro project, suburban rail, Kannur airport, electronic hardware project and NH bypass development also found mention in the Budget.

Union ministry of agriculture would also felicitate two progressive farmers of the state with the 'Agriculture Minister's Krishi Karman Award'. One of these farmers would be male and the other female. An official of the state agriculture department said that Haryana would be awarded Rs two crore in cash, trophy and a citation.Both the farmers would receive cash award of Rs 2 lakh each and 'Prashashti Patra'. The official added that in 2014-15, the state had received deficient rainfall of 47.9 per cent during Kharif season and excess precipitation of 50.7 per cent during Rabi season. He said that despite these adverse conditions, the State Government provided facilities such as increase in irrigation capacity, adequate availability of power, timely distribution of seeds and fertilisers and increase in storage capacity. These led to record production of 4,006 metric tonnes of paddy, he added."

This upset finance minister O Paneer Selvam and other ministers. Besides, in his felicitation, one of the ministers reeling out the party's achievements asked the audience, ""Are you receiving free rice given by our CM or not from the ration shop?""

But the registry did not allow them to stage the protest on the campus. The group then marched, raising slogans and staged a demonstration outside the campus. This prompted a batch of lawyers to remark: ""The advocates have conducted many demonstrations on the campus during which they were not restrained. Now they are keeping silent though they were denied permission. This is due to the recent stern action taken by the court and the bar council against a group of advocates.""The council meetings of the Madurai Corporation, which usually see the AIADMK councillors heaping praise on the mayor and his deeds, usually has just one exception - zone chairman Rajapandi, who though belonging to the ruling party, openly criticized the civic body and its administration for their shortcomings.

Taking note of this, the mayor, in his speech, told the commissioner that he was fortunate to have been praised by Rajapandi.

The move was termed as draconian by local politicians then, who did not even hesitate to spread false propaganda that villages in buffer areas will face relocation to pave way for tigers.""However, today the same tigers are bringing money for the 79 villages in buffer area. Buoyed by the community and monetary benefits, 15 more villages (out of the purview) have passed a resolution that they want to be part of Tadoba buffer,"" says Bandu Dhotre, honorary wildlife warden of Chandrapur.""The creation of buffer zone aims at promoting coexistence of wildlife and human activity.

These machines have been kept in Moharli. Chandrapur district being a rice belt, getting biomass will not be a problem.""To start with, we have collected biomass after removing vegetation from the firelines in Mohurli range of buffer. The pellets will be sold for 5-6 per kg to buffer villages. Surplus production will be sold out in bulk in the open market,"" said Narwane.Mohurli RFO Sachin Shinde says the units will be run by youths from EDC villages. ""This would not only help curb biotic pressure on forests but surplus production would mean self-employment to locals,"" Shinde added.If supplying LPG and other works have led to curbing biotic interferences, generating employment to locals through ecotourism has been taken up in a big way.

As a consequence, a significant portion of farm land has been abandoned leading to land degradation.A recent study conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) has found that abnormal pattern of rainfall and non-availability of water sources due to hilly terrain results in frequent crop failures and low productivity.The percentage net cultivated area to total geographical area has decreased consistently over the years from 19.07% in 1972-73 to 11.81% in 2009-10, said the report.Agriculture is the largest occupation and source of livelihood in Himachal Pradesh (about 66.71% of total population) and happens to be the premier source of state income (GSDP) (15% of GSDP comes from agriculture and its allied sector). Cultivation is mainly rain dependent (80.9%). In Himachal Pradesh, 31.3% of the area is still not irrigated and is totally rain dependent.The report said Himachal Pradesh is enlisted under the 'frequent drought (10% to 20% probability) prone area' as per Indian Meteorological Department's (IMD) classification of drought incidences from 1875 to 2004 period.A total of 23 droughts have occurred in the state over 1879 to 2009 of which 20 were moderate and three severe with the drought probability of 17% and four instances of consecutive droughts over two years.It added that there should be laws related to land use so that the incidence of degradation of agricultural land and the shifting of agricultural land to non-agricultural uses could be checked.""There is a need to identify crops which can adapt to climate change suitability and launch awareness campaigns to educate farmers for promotion of bio-pesticides, organic farming, integrated pest management technology, and soil conservation measures,"" it added.Another report prepared by State Centre on Climate Change (HP State Council for Science Technology and Environment) also revealed that abnormal pattern of rainfall over the past few years has caused great fluctuations in crop production.It said that climate change has brought forward and reduced the Rabi season due to delayed and deficit rainfall. The yield of wheat crop has been affected owing to high maximum and minimum temperature. The area under rice crop has been diverted to maize crop due to irregular rainfall, it added."

But we cant find a drop of water this year anywhere, says 75-year- old farmer Sangaiah Swamy. He and is brother Siddaramaiah Swamy are quenching the thirst of 400 families at Taj Sultanpur village from their open well, choosing not to water their own vegetable crops.The drought this year has been compared with the one in 1972, but farmers who have seen both of them as well as economists say that if there is one thing that makes the ongoing drought worse, it is the acute water scarcity. While shortage of foodgrain marked the 1972 drought, water scarcity of unprecedented scale marks the present one.Even in the places where the tanks had dried up, if one dug 10-feet deep, there was water, said Mr. Sangaiah Swamy, comparing the two drought years. What was forbidding was the price of foodgrains in the open market, which was out of reach for the poor.On that count, people say they are better off this year. Akkamahadevi Minje, an aged homemaker, says: There is no shortage of foodgrains in the market. In ration shops the poor get adequate quantity of rice at least. The central issue now is water. Even if we have money, there is no water to purchase.Development economists T.R. Chandrasekhar and Chandra Poojary agree that the present water crisis marks it apart from the 1972 situation. Prof. Chandrasekhar says while the government failed to take precautionary measures to conserve water in the tanks, society at large has been irresponsible in over-utilisation of groundwater, leading to drying up of almost all the borewells.Dry land farmingProf. Poojary says that the State, being the second one after Rajasthan to have the largest dry land area, has failed to attach the needed attention on improving dry land farming and introduce new technologies to prevent farmers from going for irrigation using the available groundwater. The farmers have not been educated about the pitfalls in taking up high water-intensive crops in lands suited only for crops grown in semi-dry and dry areas, he says.Kyambling Chikbasti, an aged farmer from Duttargoan in Aland taluk, where water is not available even after drilling to a depth of 1,000 feet, says the situation was not the same even five years back, when water was available at 100 to 150 feet.There is no shortage of foodgrains in the market  The central issue now is water.

Sources said all the stakeholders agreed that a regulatory framework should be in place to implement this provision.The government has decided to form a task force under the National Institute of Nutrition to formulate detailed guidelines, sources said. ""Once fortification is made mandatory, industry will have to follow the guidelines,"" the sources said.The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has already formulated standards for flour fortification. Food products like wheat and rice are already being fortified in some states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.The cost of fortification will be between 5 and 20 paise per kg or litre of food items, an official said, adding that the mandatory roll out of fortified food items may take 6-8 months.The government estimates show the intake of micronutrients in daily diet is far from satisfactory and over 70% of the Indian population consumes less than 50% of the recommended dietary allowances or the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of healthy people.Experts say apart from human suffering due to morbidity and mortality, malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies have a high economic cost.Productivity losses due to poor nutrition are estimated to be more than 10% of lifetime earnings for individuals, and 2-3% of GDP to the nation. Cost of treating malnutrition is 27 times more than the investment required for its prevention."

In textiles, the spinning sector is not doing well, but, on the other hand, export oriented components like garments and fabric have been seeing good business. But, the domestic performance has been poor.Labour shortage is a critical issue. With the incentives provided by the state government, industries are struggling to find labour. When workers get rice and other essential goods for free from the government, they do not have to work, which directly affects the industries.Migrant labourers alone comprise 25% of the work force. But, relying on them is not a permanent solution. Tomorrow, if Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Odisha start development projects, the labourers will return to their native states. Nobody will want to work 2000 miles away from their home town.It is not true that migrant labourers come cheap. Their salary might be lower than that of a local labourer, but migrant workers are not skilled. So, industries have to invest in training them. A migrant labourer stays in the city for 12-15 months on an average.Very much. Investments in Tamil Nadu are capped due to this. Compared to Gujarat and Maharashtra, the state does not attract as many investors due to the shortage of labour.Much of the wind power that is being generated at facilities installed by industries here is being wasted. Around 10 years ago, there were several incentives for industries to set up wind mills, and a lot of money went into setting up such facilities. This helped the state and the industries during the power crisis in 2008-2010. But today, Tamil Nadu is generating surplus power. And, almost 25% of this is being wasted. If the state government can frame policies to sell this power to those states facing a shortage, it would benefit both the government and industries.For textile industries, both the United States and Europe are important export destinations. And, it is essential that we have a free trade agreement with them. Tamil Nadu alone accounts for 35% of the total textile exports in the country.Yes, of course. We have the infrastructure and a suitable environment. What is needed is an increased awareness among youth about the possibilities. CII, at its front, has been organizing several events, seminars and talks to encourage entrepreneurs.There is excitement and interest among investors. However, they are keen only on companies that are a few months old, and have showed some signs of growth."

While the rice park is being established at Navali-Karatagi villages on the outskirts of Gangavati, the maize park is to be come up in the APMC market yard at Ranebennur.Sources told The Hindu that the establishment of the Rice Technology Park will convert Gangavati into a major agri business centre in the State and help rice growers in the region to end their dependence on mills in neighbouring States for processing paddy. Although the production of paddy has more than doubled in the recent years, the processing facility has not grown to match it. According to an estimate, more than 50 per cent of the paddy produced in the region is sent elsewhere for processing.The establishment of the Rice Technology Park will help paddy cultivators in the Tungabhadra Command Area in Ballari, Raichur and Koppal districts and also in the command areas of the Upper Krishna Project in Shahpur and Surpur taluks in Yadgir district and Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts.In the Tungabhadra Project region, the area under irrigation is 9 lakh acres and 95 per cent of it is under paddy cultivation. The farmers in the command area grow two crops of paddy in a year. The area under paddy is likely to increase with additional allotment of water in the Krishna by the Krishna River Water Disputes Tribunal. The area under irrigation in the Krishna Basin is likely to go up by another 4.61 lakh hectares.As a value addition, the technology park would have facilities for rice flour, rice rava, rice bran oil, noodles, rice-based alcohol, animal and poultry feed and paddy husk used for power generation and brick-making.With maize being the second major crop cultivated in the State with an annual production of around 4 million tonnes, there was an urgent need to strengthen maize processing units to add value to the produce and get more returns to farmers. Maize is predominantly grown in Haveri, Davangere, Ballari, Dharwad, Belagavi, Bagalkot and Chikkaballapur districts. The proposed park will at Ranebennur will have a storage capacity of 32,000 tonnes.The sources said that the proposed maize technology park being established at a cost of Rs. 111 crore would have mills for production of maize flour, maize flakes, poultry feed, dry maize, maize chips and popcorn to add value to the produce and enable farmers get better returns.

The entire money, through a co-operative, would be distributed among the poor villagers who then used to get to eat,"" says Majid.Out of active politics, Majid Master devotes six hours to his studies every day. On Saturday and Sunday, he attends classes at a study centre in a nearby college.""Most of my classmates are of the age of my grandchildren,"" says Majid, a shy smile appearing on his otherwise sober visage.Majid, who was once religious, now follows the eight-fold path shown by Gautam Buddha.But ask him about the two 'Buddhas' within his party - former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and minister Gautam Deb - his jaws become taut and his eyes betray emotions, albeit for a few seconds. ""I have nothing to do with either of them anymore. I am not in touch with them,"" he says.There is a blue and white bicycle parked outside his room, which his niece got from her school. It is one of the cycles that the Trinamool Congress has been giving to school students and has the Biswa Banga logo on it.""The social impact is already visible. It has become easier for girls in rural areas to travel to school. It has also provided poor families a vital source of transportation,"" says Majid. He continues to praise several of Mamata Banerjee's pro-poor schemes, including the distribution of bicycles.""She is giving rice for Rs 2 per kilogram. She has also kept her promise of not acquiring land forcefully. The poor are benefiting,"" he sums up."

The education department informed that 61 students were discharged and sent home and the remaining were kept under observation.The incident comes a week after 93 students from Shantiniketan School in Nagpur suffered from food poisoning after a lizard fell in the khichdi served to them as part of the mid-day meal (MDM).District in charge of MDM scheme Nilesh Waghmare said, ""All 101 students were first admitted to an Umrer hospital. Within a few hours 61 were discharged. Of the remaining 40, about five students started complaining of more discomfort and were shifted to GMCH Nagpur.""So far the education department hasn't been able to determine what went wrong with the meal served at the school. Waghmare said, ""It's too early to say and at this point it will be purely speculation. This school is in the urban part of Umrer and the education department only provides raw rice to them. All other ingredients and raw materials are purchased by the school. Some say there was problem with the spices, others point to the unhygienic cooking conditions. Let's first ascertain facts besides the hospital and lab reports after which we can reach a conclusion.""The incident has turned into a major embarrassment for the MDM department as it is yet to complete inquiry into a similar incident that happened at Shantiniketan School. Waghmare said, ""We will get laboratory test reports about the quality of food on Thursday after which we'll file a report.""Testing and tasting the food, before it is served to kids, is solely the responsibility of schools. At least three adults should taste the food and wait for half an hour before the meal is served to children. Waghmare also said that it needs to be seen why the two incidents happened at private schools in Nagpur only."

And the best part was it did not cost them a single rupee. Ever since her husband Sekhar died of a heart attack in 2005, the 50-year-old has been serving free food on his death anniversary every year as a tribute to him.Though the makeshift stall has no name written on it, everybody knows it as Sundari Akka's kadai. It's not just a business for her but a labour of love. Serving tasty food to people is a noble act, believes Sundari who takes care of everything, getting up at 4am to visit Kasimedu harbour to buy fresh fish, besides preparing and serving the food herself.The idea of opening an eatery struck her more than 16 years ago while she was having lunch at a restaurant in Chennai. ""The food they served was bad. I thought I could do a much better job and provide good, tasty food to people. I first started a tiffin stall and eventually began serving lunch with fish and mutton curry. The response was good,"" she said.Although many sell fish delicacies on the Marina, what makes Sundari different is her specially made prawn curry, mutton masala and fried seer fish. ""I make the fish and mutton items using a special masala that I prepare at the end of every month. I fry the fish only after getting the order. I don't keep them fried like many people do,"" said Sundari, after serving a plate of hot prawn curry to a customer.For just Rs 30, one can have a sizable quantity of rice with fish curry. Besides fish, Sundari's mutton curry is also very popular. Chicken is off the menu, however. ""I don't like the poultry chicken which is not good for health,"" she says.Sundari's elder son, who studied hotel management, doesn't want to take care of the stall. The younger one is working as an electrician on a ship. ""My sons are not interested in this business. But I enjoy it,"" she said. Sundari's competitors are upset that she sells a big piece of fried seer fish for just Rs100. But her customers are happy and that is what matters most to her."

India has blamed Jaish operatives for the Uri attack, and has more recently identified the attackers and the camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir they came from.The US statement came amid recrimination and criticism from some Indian commentators including retired diplomats that the Obama administration was hedging on backing India and putting pressure on Pakistan after the Uri attack. Although Secretary of State John Kerry gave Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif an earful at the UN General Assembly last week, some analysts and retired Indian officials selectively highlighted pabulum in the statement to suggest that New Delhi had taken false comfort about US support and everything was hunky-dory in Islamabad's ties with Washington.The Pakistani press had gone to town reproducing one such column to claim India had been snubbed by US, and had suffered other setbacks at the UN in its efforts to isolate Pakistan. It had cited support for its position from the UN Secretary General, China, Turkey, Gulf countries etc, ignoring the fact that President Obama avoided meeting Nawaz Sharif despite the latter's single-point agenda of raising the Kashmir issue during his UN visit.Turns out the claims were baloney, with even China circumspectly sticking to its position of asking both Pakistan and India to resolve issues bilaterally. In fact, Beijing distanced itself from Pakistani media reports that claimed that Premier Li Keqiang had conveyed China's backing to Pakistan on the Kashmir issue during his meeting with Sharif.""The issue of Kashmir is an issue leftover from history. Our stance on that is consistent. We hope that parties concerned will pursue a peaceful settlement through dialogue,"" Chinese spokesman Lu Kang said when asked about the Pakistani media reports.The US statement on the Rice-Doval call leaves no doubt where Washington stands on the latest developments in the region, with none of the comforting crumbs that lower level US officials throw out for Pakistanis to feast on, such as asking both sides to engage, recognizing Pakistan's sacrifices etc.In fact, the phone conversation, coming after New Delhi's call to torpedo the SAARC meet, virtually endorses India's decision to scupper the summit.""In the context of the robust US-India partnership, Ambassador Rice discussed our shared commitment with India,"" the readout said, with no reference to the SAARC boycott by India and three other countries, including Bangladesh and Afghanistan, both affected by Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism.The US has an observer status in Saarc, as do Australia, China, European Union, Iran, Japan, South Korea, Mauritius and Myanmar.In fact, the manner in which Islamabad used the UN pulpit to highlight its Kashmir fetish is now seen as a promotion of terrorism in some quarters. ""Disappointed to see the Pakistan PM use the @UN to praise a militant group that uses violence to promote its cause,"" US Congressman Ted Poe, who has moved a bill to have Pakistan declared a state sponsor of terrorism, tweeted on Wednesday.In a separate letter to Prime Minister Modi, two other influential senators, Mark Warner and John Cornyn, said they were ""greatly concerned about initial indication that the perpetrators of this (Uri) attack were Pakistani and that the attck emanated from Pakistan"" and ""Pakistan's possible involvement in this attack underscores out broader concerns about its use of terrorism as a pillar of its foreign policy towards Afghanistan and India.""Noting that groups such as LeT, TTP, and JeM not only launched attacks on India but also on US personnel and interests in Afghanistan, they warned that this is ""unacceptable.""Despite such humiliating public deprecation, Pakistan's official narrative fed to a pliant media is how gloriously the country is doing in raising the profile of the Kashmir struggle and how success is imminent. On Tuesday, the country's Defence Minister Khwaja Asif, who once taunted the Pakistan Army as ""losers"" in the National Assembly, once again threatened use of the country's nuclear weapons.Such periodic assertions has led Washington to conclude that Pakistan is an ""unstable"" nuclear power, compared to the responsibility India exercises with regards to nuclear policy."

The youths were identified as Ajith Babu (27) and Deepu Mohanan (27).Police said Ajith and Deepu were caught in the act in separate bedrooms with Sibi and Anitha around midnight.

However, police are probing the involvement of the house owner.""We are presently questioning the accused and the details of more persons involved in the racket can be known only after a preliminary investigation. We are questioning the house owner to ascertain his role, before taking action,"" said the circle inspector.

But then, these were best kept another day.""He was calm, as always and asked me not to hurry up. He put his hand on my head and asked me to go home and take care of our grandson,"" said Archana while entering her home at Dhirendra Nath Ghosh Road at Bhowanipore Sakharipara on Friday. ""This is the happiest day in the last few years of my life,"" she added.Alongside her was her daughter-in-law, Swati, who had been active in politics along with her husband Swarup, campaigning for Mitra in the last assembly election, which Mitra had fought from jail but had lost.""Months after I had come to this house after my marriage, baba (referring to her father-in-law Mitra) was jailed and the house lost its head of the family. This is the worst situation any newly married girl can face. I am happy after almost two years, my baba will be back home and be with us,"" said Swati.She added that the entire family had spent a sleepless night on Thursday anticipating for the order of the magistrate. ""Now as the magistrate has granted bail to my father-in-law, our faith in judiciary has been restored. In the past two years, the circle of our life has revolved around home, hospital, jail and the court. I just hope no family has to go through the kind of turmoil we have been through,"" she said.Swati added that since Mitra was jailed, the family hadn't even performed rice ceremony of her son, Maharup, who is now aged one and half years. ""With my father-in-law back, we would now conduct the ceremony shortly,"" she said.Another relative said Mitra has strictly instructed the family to ensure there is no major celebration outside his home or on his way back from the jail. During November last year, when Mitra was granted bail, his supporters had whisked him from SSKM within few hours after Mitra had learnt that CBI was gearing up to challenge his bail at the high court. Mitra was rushed in an ambulance violating one way traffic and supporters from several parts of Kolkata had come to his house to celebrate the occasion with flowers and abir. Days later, Calcutta high court cancelled his bail and Mitra was back in jail.""We haven't planned any major celebration this time. We are constantly telling supporters not to go for any over the board celebration that can send a wrong message to the court leading to cancellation to his bail like last time. We have asked cops to help us and ensure there is no gathering outside our house,"" he said. State education minister Partha Chatterjee was also heard making a similar appeal: ""Don't do anything out of excitement that can harm Mitra.""But supporters from Bhowanipore and Kamarhati kept on crowding outside Mitra's home from evening. As hours went by, the crowd continued to increase, even as police asked them to move away. At one point of time, traffic movement even came to a stop because of crowd pressure.""He is like our dada. No matter if he stays as a minister or not, he would be our hero. He is the reason we follow the party,"" said Ujjal Das, who runs a stationary shop at Kamarhati.Like Ujjal, there were hundreds of others who had come with garlands, sweet boxes and abir, but Mitra loyalists and family members time to time urged them not to distribute sweets or play with green abir outside the house.The organisers of Agradut Uday Sangha , the puja organized at the Sankharipara alley where Mitra lives, said for the last two years, their puja had lost their glitz. ""Mitra was our guardian. This puja is his brainchild. He controls the crowd, takes the final decision on the theme, gets artists to perform for the cultural function and oversees the entire puja rituals. In his absence, we struggled to manage the puja by our own. Now that he is back, we are sure to revive our old glory,"" said Swapan Roy, the club secretary. Another club member standing beside him added: ""We have already won the award even before the start of the puja. Our dada is our biggest award this puja."""

The ""rescue"" was apparently accidental as the police team was looking for a missing car.Roy's absence during the no-confidence vote at Kandi municipality on Friday allowed the Trinamool to wrest control of the civic board from the Congress.The police could not catch any of the accused.Roy, who was abducted on Wednesday from the school he worked at, recorded his statement before the Behrampore additional chief judicial magistrate on Sunday. Later Roy told reporters that after he was bundled into a vehicle, he was blindfolded and tied, making it impossible to identify the abductors. But Roy reportedly heard the driver say they had enough fuel to reach Bolpur in Birbhum; he feared that they might bump him off on reaching Bolpur. ""But I am back and safe, thanks to the people's good wishes,"" said Roy, claiming he was confined to a small room and was given rice to eat. The police said the car from which Roy was rescued was probably the same vehicle used to whisk him away.About the operation, the police said after their counterparts in Burwal registered a missing car complaint, a night patrol team, out to look for the vehicle, spotted the red car in at Majlishpur in Burwal. Though the number plate was changed (4480) from the original one (1170), it matched the description of the stolen vehicle. As the police told the driver to stop, he complied and scampered away. Even two bikers trailing the vehicle reportedly turned back and fled. On inspection, the cops found Roy inside, gagged and tied. The police later said Roy's mobile locations showed he was in and around Burwal till Wednesday night, after which the phone was switched off.Roy's rescue did little to stop the political posturing. The CPM and Congress staged a protest at the Berhampore court complex. ""The police action is riddled with loopholes. They rescued Roy and yet not a single but did not catch any of the accused. They know the abductors whom they are trying to shield,"" said a leader. But Trinamool district president Mannan Hussain rubbished it: ""They knew they were going to lose (the no-confidence vote to Kandi civic board on Friday). Now that Roy has been rescued, let cops reveal the truth.""The Congress has decided to stage a protest on Monday and Adhir Chowdhury is likely to be present.On Monday, Justice Dipankar Datta is likely to resume hearing Shantana's petition alleging police inaction. Earlier the HC has noticed some annomalies, the late registration of FIR and the absence of Arms Act sections, by the Kandi OC. The court had asked him to file a report on Monday."

The food cooked has to be first checked by the school authorities daily before being served to students. In addition, quality checks are expected to be done periodically at the food and drug administration laboratory.District primary education officer S R Chougule admitted that very few tests have been done so far, but added that plans were afoot to increase the number of quality checks on the food served to students in schools.""The number of inspections may seem low considering the total number of schools in the district. However, the department is planning to increase the frequency of inspections.

Both conditions are caused by bad nutrition and result in ill-health,"" said Shirish Patwardhan, a Pune-based gynaecologist and former vice-president of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India.He was speaking during the three-day ninth interdisciplinary research society conference (IRCON), which kicked off at the Government Cancer Hospital on Friday. The conference was attended by GMCH dean Chandrakant Mhaske, Government Cancer Hospital and organising secretary Arvind Gaikwad, former GMCH dean K S Bhople and head of the medicine department Mangala Borkar among others.""Stress, sedentary lifestyle and faulty eating habits have led to a big proportion of population fighting obesity.

This applies to our health too. Being in good physical shape is the first step towards 'get set glow'. If I was weighing 83 kg in 2006, it was because of the choices I was then making. However, I would always blame the circumstances for it. We are always served 2-3 deserts in a conference. In 2006, I would say to myself I must ensure that I attack all the deserts at least twice if not thrice. If I weigh 77 kg now, it is again because of the choices I have made. It is a harsh truth and difficult to digest since it puts the entire responsibility on you. However, the sooner we realize, the better our health would be,"" Patwardhan said.""A person should take efforts to maintain BMI in the normal range. Haemoglobin (Hb) level of more than 12 and a BMI between 18 and 23 should do the trick,"" he said.Talking about the six-point programme to lead a health life, Patwardhan said one should focus on proper sourcing of food items, correct methods of storage, right eating, regular exercise and developing deep sense of positivity.While giving tips to maintain normal BMI, he advised people to bring some changes in their lifestyle by including unpolished rice instead of polished one in the grocery, rajgira puffs (lahi), about 25 grams flax seeds every day and one gooseberry.He also advised to eat cooked food twice a day and raw food such as fruits, vegetables and sprouts in between meals and get addicted to hot water.Explaining the importance of storage of food items, he said solid or liquid food from plastic containers should be completely avoided. ""Plastic items should be banned from all household kitchens. Consuming hot or cold food or liquid from plastic containers is an invitation for cancer,"" he said.""Developing deep sense of positivity is equally important to keep your body and mind healthy, which ultimately comes from silence. Hence, a 45-minute silence per day is recommended; five minutes for beginners,"" he added."

Gore started this initiative after seeing these hapless animals being abandoned on the streets by farmers and realized that eventually they would be taken away by butchers.He decided to rescue and look after the animals and got a small plot of land in sector 12, New Panvel, along the old Matheran road. Actually he has two plots; the smaller one currently has three cows, while the larger compound nearby has 56 cows. Apart from providing them with food and water, he also needs to protect them from cattle thieves. That's where Ram, Sita and Laxman came to his rescue.Three Indie dogs, two males called Ram and Laxman and one female named Sita, have been trained by Gore to keep the thieves at bay. ""I trained them to watch the cows and keep them in the smaller shed where the rescued animals are first brought. The dogs trot with them when the cattle need a walk to ensure they return home safe,"" he said.The dogs have managed to keep the thieves away so far. ""Their relentless barking at any sign of trouble has scared people away, especially at night when the animals are often stolen by butchers,"" he added.Getting fodder for the cattle is easy from the markets with Gore collecting leftover vegetables as well as rice husk. Also, people in the area have been more than helpful. ""People give us vegetable waste and sometimes water too,"" said Gore.Some neighbouring farmers asked him to lend them the animals for farming work an offer he flatly refuses.Once these farmers have no use for them, the cattle will be dumped again, he feels. ""So I'd rather look after them myself,"" he said."

But some exceptional presence of mind has now helped the child, a member of the notorious children's squad of CPI (Maoist), the 'bal dasta', extract himself from the spiral of Naxal violence.Seeing his apprehension by police as a chance to escape, Golu refused to run away from the site of Wednesday's encounter at Luggu. And now his account has joined those of several before him to paint a grim picture of childhood sacrificed at the altar of extremism. The members of bal dasta, Golu told the police, are made to handle guns, apart from carrying equipment and cook.Maoists have for long inducted the children of their cadres in the 'bal dasta'. But of late, amid increasing pressure from security forces and losses in encounters, they have shifted their focus to children who live in villages that fall within the 'Red corridor'. In Jharkhand alone, for example, a joint raid by police and CRPF led to the rescue of 16 children from a rebel den. In 2013, six Latehar children managed to escape from the clutches of Maoists.In April 2015, the Jharkhand high court had issued notices to the Union home secretary and the police in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, seeking a report after the local media reported kidnapping of over three dozen children from Gumla and Lohardaga by Maoists. At the time, some of the children came back following police intervention.Former Latehar district collector Aradhna Patnaik, now the secretary of school education, has interacted with a few members of the 'bal dasta'.

Jharkhand has also set up 'ashram schools' to ensure education for children in Maoist-dominated pockets.Talking to TOI, a Maoist ideologue, however, dismissed as government propaganda the reports that children were used as soldiers, adding that those in police custody were coerced into propagating these stories. ""Government schools distribute uniforms and midday meal on paper, but most of it goes to the officers, and when we try to impart education to the children, they are branded as members of the bal dasta,"" said the member, who has done much to spread education in Latehar, Palamu and Garhwa between 2005 and 2009.Bokaro: Eight-year-old Gappu, one of the two minors apprehended by police during an anti-Maoist operation at Lug gu Hill under Gomia block on Wednesday , was a Class I student at a government school when he was recruited by Maoists. Narrating his ordeal to police, Gappu said he ""suffered in the Gomia jungles for three months"".Talking about his induction, he added, ""I was alone at home when (Maoist) cadres knocked on my door. Panka da (one of the guests) asked me about my parents. When they realised no one was around, they asked me to join them. I could not turn down their offer because I was scared."" In the jungle, he said, he was given boiled rice to eat and a uniform of black t-shirt and trousers to wear. ""I did not like being in the jungle but I was afraid. Santosh da (a senior Maoist) threatened he would kill me if I made an attempt to escape. I missed my parents and brother but I could not do much. Later, I made friends with the other children in the squad,"" he added.Gappu went on to add that he was asked to carry items on his back and would help cook. ""The commander asked me to guard the camp at night.Though I was not given a gun, I was told Birsen da in the squad carried an AK-47, commander Santosh da carried an INSAS rifle, and a few women cadres carried carbines and rifles,"" he said.Gappu said the squad was always moving through the jungles. ""We would cover several kilometres. There were 20 members in the squad, including two girls,"" he added.During the encounter on Wednesday night, Santosh Da asked Gappu to stay in the front while he opened fire at security personnel.(With inputs from Divy Khare in Bokaro, B Sridhar in Jamshedpur, and K A Gupta in Gumla)"

But now they invaded the interior colonies as well offering lip-smacking dishes in a good number of neatly lined up vessels prompting denizens to skip cooking at homes occasionally.From budding entrepreneurs to enterprising housewives, these takeways have become a lucrative business proposal in Vijayawada where the number of families moving is increasing gradually soon after the announcement of capital region.Majority of our customers are women and families who opt for vegetarian dishes. Changes in lifestyle, eating habits, busy schedule and other domestic issues are the reasons why many depend on takeaways these days, says M. Madhusudhan Rao, managing partner of Southern Spice, a group that runs two points in city.We started the first one eight years ago when there was little demand for outside food. But now we, on an average, serve 700 customers a day. The concept of visiting the curry points is fast catching up. To cater to the taste buds of the customers we are adding variety of dishes, Mr. Rao adds.These hygienically-maintained takeaways, along with deserts and salads, are also selling steamed rice and rotis to the college students, bachelors and employees staying in hostels. Students here depend on our food point to relish a meal instead of going to a hotel which charges more. They buy a bowl of rice and few curries for the day, says A. Tereja, a takeaway owner at ITI Road. We are yet conduct a survey on takeaways owing to various reasons. People having any sort of complaints with the quality of the food and hygiene at the stores can complaint to us, District Gazetted Food Inspector T. Sekhar Reddy told The Hindu .

Johl, Chancellor, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda while delivering his talk on ""Socio-Economic Stress in Rural Sector: Some Policy Options"" at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) today. Gurdev Singh Khush Foundation for Advancement of Agricultural Sciences organized the guest lecture and an award ceremony at PAU. As many as 11 travel grants to the scientists and the students, and 56 merit scholarships to the undergraduate students of PAU and Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU) were awarded on the occasion. Besides, one team award was bestowed on Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Patiala for excellence in transfer of technology.On the occasion, a brilliant PAU alumnus, Gurdev Singh Khush, Father of Rice Revolution; Baldev Singh Dhillon, Vice-Chancellor, PAU; Khem Singh Gill and Manjit Singh Kang, former Vice-Chancellors, PAU; and A.S. Nanda, Vice-Chancellor, GADVASU were present.In his talk, Johl pointed out, ""Two-third operational farms are under stress in Punjab. They do generate enough income and gainful employment, are capital starved, cannot meet social and economic needs, are incapable of making investment, cannot adopt improved technology, indulge in drugs out of frustration, and cannot afford good education and health benefits."" Farm suicides are also a matter of concern, he observed. Johl emphasized on generating employment in farm and non-farm sector. Besides, he stressed on creating service centres in public and private sectors with multiple machinery, implements and inputs. This will be a boon for marginal, small and medium farmers, he observed. Suggesting creating simple support complexes like playgrounds in villages and library with good books, Johl underlined the need for developing farm level entrepreneurship, and encouraging Hub and Spoke System of production, processing and marketing. These policy options will give regular employment and income to the farmers and their families; and lead to no or low diversion of loans, he added. Voicing concern over drug addiction, Johl emphasized on ""No Smuggling"" in order to do away with this menace.Khush, while congratulating the students, said ""You are fortunate enough to study in the best agricultural university of the country."" The efforts of all the Vice-Chancellors, since its inception, have provided excellent leadership and financial resources to the high standing of this University, he added. Encouraging the students to compete and achieve your dreams, Khush said, ""PAU has produced scientists who have served in various international organizations."""

He said a nation was best built with love, mutual cooperation and amity, and not mutual hatred and ill will.Idea of freedomWe need to sustain our efforts to remove poverty, illiteracy, superstitions, casteism, and communalism which are plaguing our onward march towards progress and prosperity, Mr. Siddaramaiah said. Patriotism, in its truest sense, was respecting the freedom of others to follow the practises of their choice. He said the concept of freedom was neither shallow nor narrow, and it was not merely limited to any particular field, let alone politics.Stating that the result of his governments sincere efforts in the last three years was before the people to see, the Chief Minister said it was a matter of immense pride that through the four budgets presented, his government had been able to fulfil nearly three-fourths of the promises made by the Congress in its election manifesto.Noting that his government is farmer-friendly, he said: the successive drought conditions during the last five years have left our farmers in severe distress.More rice, more dal?Mr. Siddaramaiah said proposals of providing one more kg of rice to beneficiaries under the Anna Bhagya scheme and a kg of tur dal under concessional rate to the BPL families are under active consideration of the government.The government proposed to build memorials at a cost of Rs. 3 crore in the honour of eminent Dalit personalities such as B. Rachaiah, N. Rachaiah and B. Basavalingappa.It has been envisaged to make AYUSH Department more people friendly, he said, adding that a 100-bed hi-tech panchakarma hospital and a 100-bed nature cure and yoga hospital would be set up in Mysuru city. It was also decided to set up 50-bed hospitals in Mangaluru, Gadag, Chickballapur, and Davanagere, he said.Freedom exists in the use of language, observance of cultural and traditional practices, including dress and eating habits.SiddaramaiahChief Minister"

Besides, the fluctuating prices take the cost over the budget.Also, with the current fund allotted by the State government, it is difficult to buy enough vegetables and fuel to feed the 70 odd students everyday, even if the prices are not very high, said a noon meal worker on condition of anonymity.The Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme, in 2012, had introduced a weekly menu, which included mixed rice, vegetable rice, boiled potatoes and eggs among other items in the noon meal programme. The department later increased the feeding charges in anganwadis from 56 paise to Rs. 1.13 per child for days when dal is prepared, which includes 70 paise for vegetables, 24 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. When there is no dal on the menu, the allocation is Rs. 1.35, including 80 paise for vegetables, 36 paise for fuel/cylinder and the rest for condiments. However, 5 paise is deducted from spices, as salt is provided by the Civil Supplies Department.The workers also get four subsidised cooking gas cylinders every year from the government. However, this is not at all adequate. Moreover, many schools do not even have LPG connection and they have to manage with firewood, complained N. Anusuya, member of the Noon Meal Organising Union.The per child per school day charge for children under the noon meal scheme was also increased to Re. 1.30 on days when dal rice is prepared and on other days the charge is Re. 1.70. For older classes, the allocation is Re. 1.40 and Re. 1.80 respectively.Most children come from far off places and the noon meal is their only source of energy. We cant always pay from our own pockets to buy vegetables. This has to be looked into, said Anusuya.Underweight a concernThe fifth Joint Review Mission report on mid-day meal scheme in Tamil Nadu, conducted by the Ministry of Human Resource Development and Department of School Education and Literacy in 2013, pointed out that of a total sample of 279 children, 19.7 per cent were found to be severely underweight and the percentage of normal weight children was only 12.1. Prevalence of underweight was more among girls (89 per cent) compared to boys (81.3 per cent). It had further stated that the funds allotted for purchase of vegetables could be increased due to hike in costs.In the current slab, the nutrition in the nutritious meal programme is being compromised, said S.A. Madappan, noon meal organiser and State president of Noon Meal Organising Union. To improve the situation, the Union has put forth their demands to the authorities demanding a Re.1 increase in the current allotment charge.K. Shanmugavelayutham, convener, TN-Forces added, Not only this, the allocation per child must be realistic. Only then will we be able to fulfil the true purpose of the scheme.Officials from the department said they were considering the unions demands. We also have to compare the hike in prices with previous years and other states. We shall do our best, said a senior official."

He had a fall two days back and the pain it inflicted is excruciating. To know whether it's a fracture, he needs to travel 32km to Bandwan or 39km to the Belpahari primary healthcentre. Wary of the journey, he chose to stay back in his Bokdoba home and bear the pain. But on Monday, he stepped out of his home, rode pillion and covered 7km on a bicycle to cast his vote at Minardihi.Thakuran, his wife Gurubari, son Sobharam and daughter-in-law were among 120 voters from 32 homes in their village who braved the heat and the distance to exercise their franchise. Till even a few years back, this was impossible.Thakuran's daughter, Jagori, as a teen had ran away from her home and transformed into a brutal Maoist commander in Jangalmahal. Jagori had taken up arms and mandated people not to vote. Her name cropped up after every major Maoist attack, including the Silda massacre, and she was accused in over 30 cases.In 2011 November, when she surrendered with her husband Rajaram Soren and their only child, Chandan, now 10, she gave up her arms. She also transferred her voter ID from Belpahari to her Durgapur home.""Jagori last came to meet us in April 2013. She stayed for a few hours and left,"" said Gurubari.

It adorns their non-descript home in Bokdoba now.Her daughter may have chose to repose faith in the Mamata Banerjee government, but Gurubari isn't willing to commit yet. ""I will vote for development, for a better life. Yes, we get rice at Rs 2/kg and police or rangers (read CRPF) don't question as anymore, but there is more to be done. We get an old-age pension of Rs 1000. Is this enough to lead a decent life?"" she shot back.Gurubari's nighbour Saraswati Baskey added, ""We have only one deep tube-well here. The water isn't fit for drinking. We have to source our water from a 40-ft deep well. There is a primary school here but the nearest high school is in Belpahari. The worst, for all baby births we have to travel all the way to Purulia's Bandwan.""

Several canals have been built, but most remain dry throughout the year. This year, the villagers of Dharambahal had to buy rice as the produce was not enough. The 20% irrigable area depends on lakes and dams, which are also affected in summer.Ghatsila block agriculture officer Patit Pavan Ghosh said though the government has installed tube-wells in the villages, ""groundwater level recedes by 5-7ft every year during summer and the villagers have to depend on the limited supply"".Ratan Murmu, mukhiya of Chunuri village, said, ""Recently, the SDO court has planned to dig deep boring wells, but they don't realize that this will lead to the drying up of other wells and escalate the crisis. The government formulates laws but does not realize the consequences of their implementation.""The villagers have been protesting against the state's plan to dig borewells, but without any result. When asked, Ghosh said, ""It all depends on the method of boring and if it is done properly, it will help the villagers.""In Paoro, another village in the panchayat, villagers have similar problems. S K Murmu, a local leader, said they have huge areas of land near the Burudih dam where they cultivate vegetables, ""but this year there hasn't been enough yield"".Ashok Naik, a farmer at Phuldungri, said they could not sell their vegetables to West Bengal as the produce was too low. While the state has not offered much help, the villagers recall the arrival of a team from the central government to gauge the drought situation.The Centre approved Rs 336.94 crore relief for Jharkhand last month, the villagers are still sceptical. Ratan Murmu said, ""The (relief) money always gets lost among middlemen and hardly reaches the poor. We can only wait and see if things are different this time.""But Ghosh sounded hopeful. ""We have been granted relief and several blocks in other districts have been short-listed for receiving the money. We are hoping that in a month or two, our farmers in Ghatsila will also receive the compensation,"" he added.Till then, the villagers' wait for both government and rain relief continues."

Pandian, senior CPI leader, said on Friday.Both parties had failed to uplift the State despite having been a constituent of the ruling alliance at the Centre.PovertyBoth parties have ruled Tamil Nadu for five decades now, but the extent of poverty has remained the same. As many as 1.82 crore family card holders have been languishing in Below Poverty Line for several years.Supply of free rice implies people have lost power to purchase, Mr. Pandian told mediapersons.The CPI leader said he was certain about people in the State voting the left parties to a position of strength.While the left parties anticipated only the results after election, the two major Dravidian parties were in a predicament of awaiting outcome of court verdicts in corruption cases.Unlike in the case of a few other parties that could spend crores of rupees on television advertisements, the left parties relied solely on direct interaction with people, Mr. Pandian said.He wondered why the DMK and AIADMK desisted from replying to charges levelled by the BJP and suspected that the two dravidian parties were acting in tandem with a tacit understanding.The BJPs demand for total prohibition in Tamil Nadu alone was meaningless. Drinking causes destruction everywhere; the Central government could implement prohibition in the entire country.Likewise, the Congress was unjustified in demanding prohibition here without enforcing the same in States it ruled, he said."

So much so, a fight broke out between two groups of Congress workers with one person even assaulting another with by breaking a glass bottle on his head.Later, speaking to the media, Rahman exuded confidence in the Congress government propelling him to victory. While unable to recollect the name of Anna Bhagya scheme, and terming it as only the ""Re 1 rice scheme"", the visibly flustered 32 year old tried to project his legitimacy to secure the ticket and said that he was ""100 per cent sure"" of him bagging the ticket.While steering away from his grandfather C K Jaffer Sharief being the sole reason for his re-nomination for the Hebbal constituency, Rahman said he knows the constituency as he was born and brought up in Hebbal.Protected by his overzealous ring of party workers and confidants, the dazed Rahman Sharief celebrated the filing of nomination with as much noise as winning the elections. With crackers and sloganeering, Sharief was paraded on the shoulders of a few party workers and flocked by Congress flags and banners.Earlier, the BJP candidate Y A Narayanswamy filed his nominations and was accompanied by local leader and former tainted minister Katta Subramanya Naidu, Rajajinagar MLA Suresh Kumar and Bangalore Central MP P C Mohan.Later, accompanied by former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, JD(S) candidate Ismail Sharieff Nana filed his nominations."

It will help cut the cost of irrigation, besides boosting the sowing and bringing more areas under paddy, Punjab State Farmers Commission Adviser P.S.

This was announced by PHED Minister Krishnanandan Verma. Verma is the Minister in charge Programme Implementation for Gaya district. The announcement was made by the minister in his Republic Day speech delivered in the historic Gaya Gandhi Maidan on Tuesday.Zero tillage is the nature friendly technique that causes leap in productivity without disturbing the soil. Gaya, it may be recalled, is heavily dependent on rains on account of near total absence of assured irrigation facilities. Zero tillage farming, according to the minister, would be encouraged for Rabi crops, particularly wheat production.In respect of Kharif production, more and more areas would be brought under the System of Rice Intensification popularly known as SRI system that suits rain deficient areas as it needs much less water as compared to the conventional method of paddy cultivation. Paddy cultivation is, on an average, done in 81.5 thousand hectares of land in Gaya district while wheat cultivation is done in 17.1 thousand hectares in the district.The minister also said that all grants meant for the farmers will be routed through the Direct to Beneficiary transfer scheme in the accounts of the farmers. The minister also said that 100 pc achievement in respect of Indira Awas Yojana has been made in the district.In the financial year 2014-15, the target of constructing 17,263 Indira Awas units was fulfilled.

Those studying in the town, a Malnad region, dont really have the option of going home for lunch and Hotel Ramprasad was their saviour.Even before the governments had thought of the midday meal scheme, Venkataramana Saralaya, father of Mr. Sundara Saralaya, had been offering four meals for Re. 1 back in 1938. Hailing from Panathady village in Kanhangad taluk of Kasaragod district in Kerala, the Saralayas relocated to Sullia in 1938 and started the eatery in a thatched-roof hut.When Mr. Sundara Saralaya took over the management of the hotel about 46 years ago, the service continued. But the price increased, from four meals for a rupee to three, two, one meal, and then finally, one meal for Rs. 5. Till about two years ago, Mr. Saralaya was providing meals at Rs. 5. And the meal does not just comprise rice and sambar for Rs. 10; it includes rice, rasam, curry and buttermilk.Asked the reason for the low cost, Mr. Saralaya said he was merely following in his fathers footsteps. Getting a meal is still difficult for many, particularly students, and hence I have continued the tradition, he told The Hindu . Hotel Ramprasad serves not less than 200 meals every day, including over 100 to students.Asked how he runs the show, Mr. Saralaya said he charges normal rates for meals taken through parcel (Rs. 40). Also, other food items in his hotel are priced on a par with the prevailing market price. The catering activity too brings in some income.Now his son, Raghavendra Saralaya, is in the process of taking over the reins of the hotel. Another son is running some other business, while his only daughter is married and lives in Karkala. The tradition will continue and the god has not betrayed us, he said."

Sivaraman, a member of Seed 87 Trust, which will organise the event.Floated by a group of Siddha doctors who graduated from Government Siddha Medical College in Palayamkottai in 1987, Seed 87 will hold contests on making traditional foodstuff on the occasion.Participants should register their names online at: seed87trust@gmail.com.The visitors, on paying Rs. 125, can taste the dishes to be served during the food festival.While this food festival will help the diabetics control the disorder, the younger generation, suffering from a lot of stress owing to their mechanised lifestyle, can guard them against getting afflicted by this problem, Dr. Sivaraman said. Ragi pakoda, thinai (foxtail) halwa, mudakkaruththan soup, saamai rice (little millet), kambu (pearl millet) dosa, kuthiraivaali (barnyard millet) biryani, varagu (kodo millet) sambar rice, vegetable mixture, plantain stem curd mixture, panivaragu (proso millet) curd rice, groundnut thuvaiyal, maapillai samba rice sweet aval, will be served to the visitors.Moreover, the recipe booklet on making a range of traditional foodstuff will be given to the visitors, he also said.The organisers believe that the foodstuff, made with organically grown disease-resistant traditional crops, would attract more people towards these dishes.Farmers, testing their fortune with water-intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane, will get attracted to these rain-fed crops in due course. While the demand increases for the traditional foodgrains, the production will go up to take the farmers living standards to the next level, he said.Renowned organic farmer Thatchai N. Ganesa Raja, hotelier Ramkumar, writer Krishi and office-bearers of Seed 87 were present."
