Alleging that Bihar was going through ""jungle raj"", Paswan sought the resignation of chief minister Nitish Kumar and reiterated his demand for imposition of President's rule in the state.Paswan alleged that crime, including murder and rape, had become routine in Bihar to such an extent that even journalists were not safe and gave examples of recent incidents of lawlessness and crime.Paswan, who is the Union minister of consumer affairs, food and distribution, patted the Narendera Modi-led NDA government for not allowing prices of essential commodities to rise. He said rates of most items, including wheat and rice, had not registered any hike barring cereals since their production was only 170 lakh tonnes per year as compare to the consumption of 246 lakh tonnes.He also attributed lower output of cereals in India to poor rainfall. Paswan quipped that state governments were making claims of providing cheap wheat, rice and cereals to poor people, though the reality was that it was being given by the Centre."

I had longed to read Kwans first book Crazy Rich Asians and then lost track of the book. The book blogs I follow do not steadily propel me towards South-East Asian books as often as they push me in the direction of yet another thin-as-gruel coming-of-age American novel. What a mistake that is when we could all be eating from the steamy hotpot of Kevin Kwan novels. This is not to say that Kwan is hearty. Instead, every page has delicious little titbits from the lives of the ridiculously wealthy in China, Singapore and Hong Kong that hit your bliss point every time.Continuous avariceReaders from pre-liberalisation India, these books will remind you of your confused pleasure from the books you bought from the pavements back then: Judith Krantz, Jackie Collins and other books, with big hair, shoulder pads and solitaires the size of a babys fist. Kwans stories of locust-like Chinese shopping sprees in Paris, frenetic partying in Dubai (with Gordon Ramsay manning the live pasta counter) or sports car collectors in Singapore are continuously comic. But eventually, by the time you get to the fashion blogger-daughter of a Chinese billionaire building a house to match the resort she couldnt buy  complete with climate-controlled closets and Vegas-style dancing fountains  youre in a fine stage of hotpot-induced food coma.Kwans books have almost no plot, but what keeps things moving is the continuous avarice of the older generation in marrying their children further up the vertiginous ladder. And the truest source of comedy in Kwans books is the super-wealthy Asians simultaneous ability to pour money down the drain and also penny-pinch like OCD crabs. Scene after scene deploys this contrast. Middle-aged Singaporean ladies spending millions on random tchotchkes in London, but shocked at the idea of having to spend on hotels when they could stay with distant family instead. Elderly Chinese ladies carrying Louis Vuitton trunks full of ramen packets to Paris because 25 euros for fried rice is insane. A young woman in a Singapore supermarket is on the phone with her agent who is bidding steadily higher on her behalf at a Hong Kong art auction. As she shops for groceries and keeps an eye on her son, she calmly tells her nervous agent that if she does acquire this exorbitant piece of Chinese art, she is going to donate it anonymously to her favourite museum. At the top of the bidding spiral, she and her agent on the phone agree that perhaps $195 million is just a tad too silly and exit the bidding. She hangs up and gets her super-saver coupons out of her handbag for the supermarket cashier.The kind of story about a certain billionaire that kept making the rounds was this  if he saw an uneaten katori (dish) of dal on his dining table, he apparently asked in a pained voice: who ordered this extra dal? Or that a favourite party game of the Bombay rich would be to go up to the billionaire and ask him what the price of bhindi that day was. Apparently he always knew.The comedy of Kwan and our Bombay billionaire is in the moral tale that the hot-air balloon of impossible wealth is tethered (loosely) by old-fashioned thrift. Without it (the comedy or the morality, take your pick), would we continuously read entire novels about the zombie rich and their lifeless purchases? Im not sure. Neither is Kwan because he introduces a misguided morality plot point or two such as the takedown of the extravagant Collette (she of the climate-controlled closet). As actor and comedian Arthur Chu writes about China Rich Girlfriend : The bad people are the nouveau riche, like Astrids insecure husband, or too-extravagant mainlanders like Colette. But when it comes to old-money Singaporeans like Astrid, Rachels husband or presumably Kevin Kwan himself  people who are cultured and discreet about their privilege  the book is firmly on their side.Nearly a decade ago, when Janet Malcolm wrote about the Gossip Girl novels, she remarked that its author Cecily von Ziegesar understands that the princes and princesses of fairy tales require the foil of beggars and commoners, and so, of her six main characters, only three belong to the world of the disgustingly rich. (Kwans token foil Rachel Chu is less foil and more cellophane).What money doesFiction has explored how money twists people, how the lack of money twists people (Hilary Mantels An Experiment in Love ). Fiction sometimes bitterly accepts that money can only come from crime (Honor de Balzac), or self-consciously admits to its seductions (Martin Amis in Money where the author steps in as a character to prevent the consumerist protagonists self-destruction but succumbs himself). Fiction has written about people transcending money or pointed out yet again that money doesnt guarantee love ( The Great Gatsby or Gilmore Girls ). Ziegesar does something clever too. Blaire Waldorf drove the label education of the series but she was also the over-the-top rich girl who wanted more and more, and plotted maniacally and failed. Theres of course the probably made-up but perfect exchange between Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald said: Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me. And Hemingway: Yes, they have more money.The Kevin Kwan books differ from other books about wealth in one significant way. Everything is about money in the Kwan novels in the way that everything is about sex in porn. Or in the way that the Shobhaa De novels pretend to be about sex but are all about money. One big giveaway in the Kwan novels? No sex.Nisha Susan is a writer and a co-founder of the online feminist magazineThe Ladies Finger .The truest source of comedy in Kwans books is the super- wealthy Asians ability to pour money down the drain while also penny-pinchThe truest source of comedy in Kwans books is the super wealthy Asians simultaneous ability to pour money down the drain and also penny-pinch like OCD crabs"
58f5511a7be9e01a17c97040,N for… Neyyappam!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/N-for-Neyyappam/articleshow/52479472.cms,2016-05-29,"Will the desi neyyappam win the ongoing naming poll for an Android version and go global? Malayalis have left no stone unturned in rooting for it.Malayalis have brushed up their 'collective social media skills' yet again, no, not to insult anyone this time, but for a rather 'sweet' cause. Google, which normally gives its updated Android versions names of confectionery like Lollypop and KitKat, has invited users from all over the world to suggest names for its latest version. Its CEO Sundar Pichai, a Tamilian, had stated last year that an Indian sweet can be considered for the next Android version, and that he would be asking his mother for suggestions. But there was no need for that, for an innovative Malayali somewhere came up with a suggestion, neyyappam, the popular Kerala sweet, and it was soon taken up by Malayalis all over the world. A group of Bengaluru-based Malayali techies have even created a website to campaign for votes for neyyappam, and the Kerala Tourism Department is all gung-ho over the choice and have been tweeting in favour of it.While other North Indian dishes like Naan and Nankhatai were trending initially, none had the perseverance of Malayalis apparently, and it was the modest little neyyappam which finally found a place among 'nuts' and 'nachos' in the homepage of the site.And why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. It is a sweet and it begins with an N, as stipulated by the company, thus winning over its somewhat poorer cousin, the unniyappam. ""If Nutella can contest, why not neyyappam? All others sound similar while neyyappam will stand out,"" says Manoj Thomas, a techie, while Poornima Menon, a homemaker, says, ""From a Malayali perspective  there is an instant connect because most of us have some good ol' childhood memories associated with it. Currently not many non-Malayalis know about it. Globally, everyone would be curious about what neyyappam is. Along with it, Kerala would get popular too.""Also, the neyyappam is much-loved by a huge community of tech-savvy people spread across the world! What more could the search engine giant want?Lohit Chandran, founder of Humans of Kochi has reasons to root for neyyappam and he says, ""India comes out on top globally in terms of mobile subscriber growth. Every second, a mobile connection gets activated in India. What could be a better way to acknowledge this than by naming the next Android with an Indian sweet!""Farzana Jayash, a college student, agrees, ""Android versions have always been named after generic western sweets  Cupcake, Donut, Jelly Bean etc  so neyyappam would be a fresh, fun desi alternative.""Apparently, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior Vice-President of Android has commented that they have had ""very intriguing results so far.'' Neyyappam has been branded too difficult to pronounce by many non-Indian users but if you can pronounce marshmallow why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. The final call goes to the company regardless of the polls, which is on till June 9, 12.29 pm. Meanwhile, many Malayalis have already started dreaming about Android neyyappam taking over the world, in true blue Dasan-Vijayan style, as Manoj says, ""Neyyappam is going to make us proud of being Malayalis.""The neyyappam has been an all-time favourite not just in temples but in children's literature as well. One of the most popular songs go thus:AyyappantammaNeyyappam chuttuKakka kothi kadalilittuMunga piller mungiyeduthuThatta piller thattiyeduthuVangiya piller vayilumittuEnikku mathram kittiyillallo!In case all that talk about neyyappam hasleft you craving for a bite, here is the recipe:Rice flour - 1 cupJaggery, powdered - 1 cupCardamom - 4 podsGhee - 3 tspDry grated coconut -1 tsp (optional)Oil or ghee for fryingWater - 1 cupGrind the rice flour into a thick paste. Add powdered cardamom. Add the powdered jaggery and grind again without adding water. Add ghee to the batter and mix well. If you're using ghee to fry the appams, do not add ghee in the batter.Roast the grated coconut and mix with the batter. Heat oil/ghee in a thick-bottomed frying pan. Pour small quantities of the batter using a ladle into the oil (the size of a cookie) and deep fry till it becomes dark brown in colour."

Scientists from IIT-Kharagpur and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) have uncovered evidence that the Indus Valley Civilization is at least 8,000 years old, and not 5,500 years old, taking root well before the Egyptian (7000BC to 3000BC) and Mesopotamian (6500BC to 3100BC) civilizations. What's more, the researchers have found evidence of a pre-Harappan civilization that existed for at least 1,000 years before this.The discovery, published in the prestigious 'Nature' journal on May 25, may force a global rethink on the timelines of the so-called 'cradles of civilization'. The scientists believe they also know why the civilization ended about 3,000 years ago  climate change.""We have recovered perhaps the oldest pottery from the civilization. We used a technique called 'optically stimulated luminescence' to date pottery shards of the Early Mature Harappan time to nearly 6,000 years ago and the cultural levels of pre-Harappan Hakra phase as far back as 8,000 years,"" said Anindya Sarkar, head of the department of geology and geophysics at IIT-Kgp.The team had actually set out to prove that the civilization proliferated to other Indian sites like Bhirrana and Rakhigarrhi in Haryana, apart from the known locations of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan and Lothal, Dholavira and Kalibangan in India. They took their dig to an unexplored site, Bhirrana  and ended up unearthing something much bigger. The excavation also yielded large quantities of animal remains like bones, teeth, horn cores of cow, goat, deer and antelope, which were put through Carbon 14 analysis to decipher antiquity and the climatic conditions in which the civilization flourished, said Arati Deshpande Mukherjee of Deccan College, which helped analyse the finds along with Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.The researchers believe that the Indus Valley Civilization spread over a vast expanse of India  stretching to the banks of the now ""lost"" Saraswati river or the Ghaggar-Hakra river - but this has not been studied enough because what we know so far is based on British excavations. ""At the excavation sites, we saw preservation of all cultural levels right from the pre-Indus Valley Civilization phase (9000-8000 BC) through what we have categorised as Early Harappan (8000-7000BC) to the Mature Harappan times,"" said Sarkar.While the earlier phases were represented by pastoral and early village farming communities, the mature Harappan settlements were highly urbanised with organised cities, and a much developed material and craft culture. They also had regular trade with Arabia and Mesopotamia. The Late Harappan phase witnessed large-scale de-urbanisation, drop in population, abandonment of established settlements, lack of basic amenities, violence and even the disappearance of the Harappan script, the researchers say.""We analysed the oxygen isotope composition in the bone and tooth phosphates of these remains to unravel the climate pattern. The oxygen isotope in mammal bones and teeth preserve the signature of ancient meteoric water and in turn the intensity of monsoon rainfall. Our study shows that the pre-Harappan humans started inhabiting this area along the Ghaggar-Hakra rivers in a climate that was favourable for human settlement and agriculture. The monsoon was much stronger between 9000 years and 7000 years from now and probably fed these rivers making them mightier with vast floodplains,"" explained Deshpande Mukherjee.They took their dig to an unexplored site, Bhirrana  and ended up unearthing something much bigger.

The study revealed that monsoon started weakening 7,000 years ago but, surprisingly, the civilization did not disappear.The Indus Valley people were very resolute and flexible and continued to evolve even in the face of declining monsoon. The people shifted their crop patterns from large-grained cereals like wheat and barley during the early part of intensified monsoon to drought-resistant species like rice in the latter part. As the yield diminished, the organised large storage system of the Mature Harappan period gave way to more individual household-based crop processing and storage systems that acted as a catalyst for the de-urbanisation of the civilization rather than an abrupt collapse, they say."

With adequate water sources, this region enjoys active agricultural operations throughout the year. Hence, the State government established its Rice Research Institute here. Farmers, farmhands, beedi rollers and earthenware makers form a sizable population of Ambasamudram constituency.Following Thevar community electorate, the segment houses a sizable number of Nadar, Dalit, Pillai, Christian and Muslim voters. Former Speaker R. Avudaiyappan, who has been fielded as the candidate of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, is contesting the Assembly election for the fifth time from the constituency with a winning record of 50:50.While he lost the elections in 2001 and 2011, Mr. Avudaiyappan won the battle of ballots in 1996 and 2006. Interestingly, he defeated AIADMK candidate R. Murugaiah Pandian on both the occasions and is taking on the old rival for the third time.However, defeating Mr. Murugaiah Pandian will not be so easy for him this time as sand mining and kangaroo court allegedly conducted by some of his close relatives in the constituency, especially in Cheranmahadevi area, have earned a bad name for him among Nadar and Dalit voters, and hence the former Speaker is entangled in a keen tussle at Ambasamudram.19 in the frayNineteen contestants, including Peoples Welfare Fronts Karpagam (Communist Party of India - Marxist) and Sasikala of Bharatiya Janata Party, are in the fray  the highest in the 10 constituencies in the district.No government showed keen interest in uplifting the life and livelihood of Kaani tribals living inside Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), who earn a meagre income by selling minor forest produces, tapioca and tapioca chips, pepper, etc.After the KMTR administration formed self-help groups for Kaani women, some of them are running an eatery near Papanasam dam. A regulated market for selling Kaani products will be of great help to them as it would fetch better procurement price for their produce.Wild animals, including deer and wild boar, often visit the residential school for Kaani children, which does not have a compound wall, in the nights.The famous earthenware making industry at Kaarukurichi is gradually dying as the recently promulgated regulations for taking silt or clay from dry irrigation tanks is strangulating it.The delay in acquiring land for laying Kallidaikurichi Ambasamudram bypass and commencing the work on this much-awaited project causes traffic snarls in these two places throughout the day. However, these issues have become poll promises once again."

People living in Vemulawada region were opposing their merger with Jagtial and demanding formation of separate Vemulawada district because of the importance of ancient temple shrines.Similarly, the people living in the coal belt Ramagundam region were opposing their merger with Mancherial district, and demanding the formation of separate Ramagundam district too.Either the government create Ramagundam district or retain it with Karimnagar district, many residents of the industrial belt say.The people under Manthani Assembly segment were also opposing their merger with Bhupalapalli district and demanding formation of Manthani district by merging Ramagundam and Peddapalli Assembly segments. On the other hand, the people living in Metpally and Korutla regions were demanding formation of district headquarters either in Metpally or Korutla and not in Jagtial district.The people under the Sircilla Assembly constituency, represented by Minister for IT K. Taraka Rama Rao, were also opposing merger with Siddipet district and demanding formation of separate Sircilla district with the merger of Vemulawada, Manakondur and Husnabad Assembly segments.

The couple, Bengaluru-based IT professionals, chose to tread the path shown by late scholar MM Kalburgi and break the barriers of superstition.Prof Kalburgi was gunned down in Dharwad by unknown assailants over alleged ideological differences, on August 30, 2015.The big day was different. The stage was almost bare and instead of the chanting of hymns, musicians Mrutyunjay Hiremath and Gurunath Sutar rendered vachanas composed by Sharanas, mystics of the 12th century, in simple Kannada. Scrolls of paper with vachanas and poems related to marriage formed the backdrop.Pt Narasimhalu Vadavati played the clarinet and presented the 'Lingayat Vivaha Panchaka', a poem composed by Prof Kalburgi. Litterateur Guruling Kapse, who administered an oath to the couple, affirming allegiance to the Indian Constitution and vachanas, said this marriage is ""an effort to show how our culture can be saved"".And when Vinay tied the 'mangalya' (sacred wedding chain) around Shruti's neck, she in turn tied a 'rudraksha mala' around his. ""I believe it signifies gender equality. There should be some symbol for married men too,"" he said.The guests were in for surprise when the couple walked up to each of them to seek blessings, doing away with the traditional queue where elders line up to give the newlyweds their blessings. Instead of the customary akshata (sanctified rice grains), the couple opted for a petal shower. ""The Sharanas tell us that when lakhs of people are deprived of food, we should not waste even a single grain,"" Chinnavva Vastrad, the bridegroom's mother, said.Father Chandrashekhar Vastrad, a disciple of Kalburgi, said his guru had always propagated the teachings of Basavanna. ""His 'Lingayat Vivaha Panchaka' is a poem that includes names of Sharanas from lower castes. We had followed this even during the marriage of our elder daughter Kshama, and Kalburgi had appreciated it. We're sad he's not with us this time,"" said a teary-eyed Vastrad.Vastrad, principal of the Government PU College in Gadag and a writer, said his family has always shunned orthodox rituals. ""While constructing our house, we didn't consider vaastu, but are leading a peaceful life for the past 20 years,"" he stated. Shruti recalled how her family initially had reservations about this kind of wedding. ""They agreed to it only after several rounds of discussions. I have never been interested in the conventional marriage either, where we shell out lakhs of rupees ."""

On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

Rather, he believes in superstitious rituals, said Mr.Namassivayam while appealing voters to cast their votes to Congress.Campaigning at Thondamanatham village, Mr. Namassivayam assured the voters of jobs to each family in all constituencies if Congress party came to power.Accusing Mr. Rangasamy of deceiving people with false promises, the Congress leader said that during last Assembly polls Mr. Rangasamy promised to give washing machines and government job to each family and after failing to fulfil those promises, he repeated in the election manifesto of this year.Mr. Rangasamy wants to retain the power by deceiving the people. He does not care about the welfare of people, he said.Free rice promisedHe added that if Congress would be voted, 30 kg free rice would be distributed to the beneficiaries and Rs.5,000 pension would be given to aged persons.

Though 70% of Indians above 15 years of age are still non-vegetarians, the numbers are expected to decline, a nationwide survey conducted in 2014 and released recently by the Registrar General of India (RGI) showed.In 2004, the prevalence of non-vegetarianism was pegged at about 75%.Experts said increasing health awareness, coupled with rising burden of lifestyle diseases like heart disorders, diabetes and cancer, may be influencing the Indian palate.Several international researches and studies have found vegetarians leading a healthier life compared to meat-eaters. Incidence of diseases such as pancreatic cancer and respiratory problems are also less common among vegetarians than in those who consume meat regularly.Besides, religiosity and changing lifestyles could also be contributing to the changing trend, experts said.""It is possible that the purchase wallet for non-vegetarian foods is now being diverted towards ready to eat, processed or packaged foods because there is an increasing trend of cooking less at home,"" said Dr Shikha Sharma, a leading nutritionist and founder and managing director of Nutri-HealthSystems.However, food consumption data from NSSO as well as OECD-FAO (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, UN Food and Agriculture Organisation) Agricultural Outlook 2014, showed that growth in per capita consumption of chicken and fish outpaced the growth in consumption of wheat, rice and sugar. Chicken consumption grew the most with India becoming the fourth-fastest growing market for the product in the world. According to the OECD-FAO 2014 data, chicken consumption in India grew at an annual growth rate of 5.9% between 1992 and 2013.The latest RGI data also highlighted a contrast with rising purchasing power which should otherwise allow more consumption of non-vegetarian meals. The latest NSSO data showed that at higher ends of the income table, consumption of milk, eggs, meat and processed foods rose. In urban India, the richest 5% consume the fewest cereals and the most derivatives of cereals like bread and noodles. However, in rural India, the richest 5% still consume the most cereals.Recently, health minister J P Nadda had made a pitch in Parliament recommending vegetarian food."

Why cant Government procure millets and pulses and use them to feed children in Anganwadi centres and students in social welfare hostels?, he asked, expressing concern that agriculture was on the wane in the past few decades but not much attention was given to correct the situation.Mr. Malla Reddy pointed out that according to the Constitution of India, agriculture was a State subject. This way, the State should fix a remunerative price for crop at the time of sowing itself. There was a law too that procurement should be in tune with the States needs, he said, regretting that Civil Supplies and Marketing departments were only becoming white elephants."

It also explains why so many Indians lose their lives to snakebite every year.The Spectacled cobra, Russell's viper and Common krait are found in the Tricity and its hinterland. These comprise three of the 'Big Four' medically important species of India, which account for the bulk of the estimated 46,000 human deaths annually (Snakebite Mortality in India: A Nationally Representative Mortality Survey, 2011). In a fascinating exposition of the menu card preferred by these three species and its organic link to human life, legendary herpetologist Rom Whitaker writes in his blogs ('IndianSnakes.org') : ""We provide them (cobras) with an abundance of food. The cobra's main prey, rats, love us and our farmlands, garbage dumps and dirty habits!""""Venomous snakes are present in high densities in agricultural areas - this seems to be true though no one has even done even a basic snake population or breeding biology study in India (or compared field populations of snakes to forest numbers). Certainly the Irula snake hunters who provided millions of cobra, rat snake and viper skins to the skin trade concentrated their hunting in agricultural areas, not in forests"" writes Whitaker.Whitaker has been in touch with Tricity and Punjab-based snake-rescue experts to further a national research project on regional variations in snake venoms and visited Chandigarh and Nawanshahr (Punjab) in August 2014 to milk and take away samples of the venoms of vipers, cobras and kraits.Snakes are opportunistic feeders and even eat each other (cannibalism) and other snake species. But in this exposition Whitaker lists the staple diet of venomous snakes. ""We know that cobras are common in rice fields (since we provide rice, water and bunds for Lesser bandicoots to tunnel and live in, cobras naturally move in) and that they do cause quite a high percentage of bites in some areas. Rice (and other grain crops) certainly seems to be a major reason for high rodent and, therefore, snake densities,"" says Whitaker.The krait is India's most venomous land species. ""It is also a rodent eater (besides the snakes and skinks it regularly feeds on), but specialises (so the Irulas tell us) in field mice (Mus booduga), just the right size for a thin snake like the krait. And sure enough, kraits like to live in field mice burrows, a nice tight fit. Kraits are not so fond of the paddy field bunds where cobras live, they prefer larger embankments and especially the old piles of well tailings that dot our countryside. These piles of rocks, soil and debris are quickly colonised by bushes and trees and are ideal habitats for mice and snakes,"" writes Whitaker.On the other hand, Russell's vipers like cactus, agave, pandanus and other thick, thorny, nasty cover. ""They are not regular burrow dwellers, though they will get into old termite mounds and larger rodent tunnels at the hottest time of year (I found one in a fox burrow). Interestingly, these rodent and bird eaters apparently have a special favourite (according to the Irulas and a small snake scat study we did some years ago), the Indian gerbil (Tatera indica). Gerbils live in association with rice fields and other crops, usually not in the bunds but they make their distinctive entrance/exit burrows on higher ground bordering the fields such as the banks of earthern dams. Three of the 'Big Four' thus appear to have strong associations with three different rodents and thus, rice and other crop fields,""said Whitaker.Providing a logical explanation for the high number of deaths, Whitaker concludes: ""The long and the short of it is, we create ideal snake habitats, provide them with abundant prey and produce millions more baby humans each year who will grow up to tromp around these snake habitats with no shoes, knowledge of avoidance and no lights at night. No wonder we have so many snakebites!"""

Booming exports of basmati also resulted in higher returns for the farmers of both states as rates of Pusa Basmati 1121 variety had touched Rs 4,500 per quintal.Manpreet stated that entire basmati industry in the northern states have large exporting units who had expressed their shock over the reported move to include certain area beyond the Indo-Gangetic plains which traditionally never cultivated the aromatic crop. ""Such a step will be detrimental to the aromatic traditional basmati which is the heritage of this region cultivated with the irrigation of five rivers. Basmati of our area will lose its premium tag over other regions,"" he said. In February this year, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) allowed the GI tag on the basmati grown in certain states. Farmers and exporters and Madhya Pradesh wanted to be included in the list of states approved by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), the statutory body responsible for export promotion and development of certain scheduled products.IPAB chairman Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal had stated that basmati rice cultivated in the Indo-Gangetic Plains on the foothills of the Himalayas covering areas of the rice grown in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, western Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu and Kathua, would be issued the GI tag.According to APEDA, India exported 37 lakh tonnes of basmati rice overseas in 2014-15 valued at Rs 27,597.87 crore. The agency stated India was the world's leading exporter of the rice."

Harpal SinghWhile experts acknowledge that economic reforms in the last two or three decades have converted settled communities into nomads, there are hardly any studies on how the poverty-ridden neo-nomads go about eking out their livelihood. A majority of them can be found selling items ranging from ersatz art pieces to clothing to cutlery by the roadside in any given town across the country.The Scheduled Caste Raja Koyas or Rajanollu bards of Khammam and Adilabad districts are among those hit by the economic reforms and have found a somewhat strange calling in trading stainless steel utensils for discarded human hair. A few of these two-wheeler-mounted families can be found criss-crossing the district visiting even the most far flung of villages with their wares every day, the harsh summer notwithstanding.We started about six months ago from our mandal headquarter village Enkoor in Khamma district, said Jakkula Ramulu, found relaxing under a tree with five other families at Mankapur in Gudihatnoor mandal. We keep moving on our two-wheelers and even enter Maharashtra visiting villages at random and exchanging the utensils, he added.The motorcycle in question carries the family comprising of the couple and often an infant, besides 50 to 70 kg of stainless steel utensils and a few kg of rice and dal or lentils.The twosome does not seem to be bothered about the fact that the seat is completely crammed with their wares.We are not familiar with villages here. Its just that we keep driving towards one direction for a few days and enter all the villages on our way, explained Merugu Sammaiah, Ramulus brother-in-law from Mandamarri town in Adilabad.Often travelling up to 50 km a day, the Rajanolla families spend the night at the last village of their visit every day. We sleep in the local schools and start on the uncharted course early next morning, observed Ramulu.The nomads purchase the utensils in Vijayawada and trade it by weight.They offer a small item like a glass or some other water container for about 40 gm of hair.Traders come to our village to purchase the hair we collect and pay us about Rs. 1,000 per kg. What they do of the hair we do not know, said Nerusula Ramulu, the Rajanolla elder.It is assumed that the discarded hair is used to make hair care products and wigs. The hair is also exported to China and other countries where it is used in coat linings."

It also announced to return the amount recovered from them for availing ration so far.At a news conference, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma said the government has extended the deadline to September 30 for ineligible beneficiaries to return their cards. ""If the ineligible beneficiaries return ration cards within the deadline, no criminal cases would be initiated against them. The authorities would not also recover money from them,"" said Das Burma.By July-end, more than 5,000 cases were lodged against people availing ration cards without having the required eligibility and 250 people (mostly women) were arrested, official sources said. Also, the government has recovered more than Rs 6 crore from ineligible beneficiaries, who were asked to pay back the cost of rice at Rs 30 a kg, wheat at Rs 22 a kg and kerosene at Rs 50 a litre.Even though the state government has so far cancelled around 6.60 lakh ration cards, a number of ineligible cards still exist.The state government's move is seen as a damage control exercise to placate voters ahead of the panchayat polls. According to facts collected from villages, it came to know that arrest of people especially women for availing ration cards could have spoiled the ruling party's prospects in the panchayat polls.Even the Centre has issued eight criteria to select beneficiaries under NFSA, the state government added one more which defines that people having three-room concrete structure would not be entitled to the ration card facility.The minister announced to exempt beneficiaries of Indira Awas Yojana (IAY), Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana (BPGY) from the criteria.Recently, Rourkela BJP MLA Dilip Ray in a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik urged to withdraw the criteria as it deprives a number of eligible beneficiaries in urban areas, particularly Rourkela.The BJP and Congress units of Rourkela, who called for a bandh on August 11, withdrew their call after the state government's announcement. As a number of eligible beneficiaries are yet to be covered under the NFSA, Das Burma said all eligible people would receive ration cards within a month."

Faral takes on a quirky avatar this Diwali,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/Quirky-Diwali-Faral-in-Pune/articleshow/55309946.cms,2016-10-29,"Don't we just love the traditional Diwali faral? Crunchy chakli, assorted barfis, freshly mixed chiwda and favourites including anarse and shankarpale; all these find place on the table during the festival. But looks like it's time to go beyond these traditional delights now. Don't get us wrong; we still love our faral, but variety is the spice of life, isn't it? This Diwali, city chefs, chocolatiers and homemakers are giving the traditional faral a quirky and healthy twist...Think of karanji, shankarpale, shev and chakli, made of nothing but pure fudgy goodness. Tempting, yes? Then Vikram Murthy 's chocolate faral is your best bet. ""When I came up with the idea, the biggest challenge was to create the same look, feel and texture as the actual sweets,"" says Vikram. The chocolate karanji is thoughtfully stuffed with dry coconut to ensure a longer shelf life, while the rest have intricate detailing to resemble the actual texture.These little bites are packed with enough energy to make you feel like a pathaka. Camp-based home baker Ritika Mahatani says, ""Festivities need not always mean indulging in the wrong food. People are often averse to anything with a 'healthy' tag, but these handmade laddoos aim to remove this mental block."" Loaded with the goodness of chia, flax, nut butter and cranberries, these laddoos comprise organic honey, not sugar. They make for tasty yet healthy seasonal indulgence.Avanti Deshpande constantly experiments for healthier alternatives to the usual sweets that are high in fat and sugar. The brown rice firni with soy milk is one of them. ""Brown rice has low glycemic content and the dish doesn't contain added sugar; it relies solely on the natural sweetness of dates,"" says Avanti, a consulting nutritionist. Using a combination of soy milk and cow's milk, Avanti melds the pre-cooked ground rice with a blend of dates. ""Moist dates give better texture, while a little rice flour can be added for binding,"" adds Avanti. The preparation can be best enjoyed in an earthen kullad.Remember the 2003 number, Mohabbat hai mirchi? If you have a mohabbat for sweets, this might just be your season's song. Enter the motichoor laddoos with a chili filling. Suvendu Roy , head chef of a hotel in Kalyani Nagar, who came up with the idea, says, ""Diwali comes with an overdose of sweet; so my pastry chef, halwai chef and I decided to give the laddoo a twist."" Choosing bird's eye chili, one of the spiciest, Suvendu has incorporated it with the motichoor mixture, dunking the laddoos in white chocolate. ""White chocolate is a conscious choice. Unlike dark chocolate, it complements and gives the spice its due,"" says Suvendu.Integral to the Maharashtrian culture, Diwali sees families building miniature forts, replete with miniature mavlas and cavalry, telling stories of ShivajiMaharaj's bravery. But Vikram seems to have rewritten scenes from the warrior king's life, building him an abode of chocolate this year. He says, ""At Kumbhar Wada, I once heard a child pleading with his mother to buy him a PoP killa, but she was worried about how to store it after Diwali. What if one could enjoy the killa and then distribute it among friends after the festival? That gave me the idea of making a chocolate killa."" Six inches tall, the miniature fort is crafted with a mix of fudge and chocolate, sturdy enough to hold the killa toys. The chocolate fort brings out minute details, including moss-like texture, village huts and an old Ganesh temple."

They also committed to a cooperative approach in beefing up policies to stimulate and sustain growth of their sluggish economies.""Weak demand and unaddressed structural problems are the key factors weighing on actual and potential growth,"" they said in a declaration. ""We have strengthened the resilience of our economies in order to avoid falling into another crisis and to this end commit to reinforce our efforts to address the current economic by taking all appropriate policy responses in a timely manner.""""We remain committed to ensuring that growth is inclusive and job-rich, benefiting all segments of our societies,"" it said.The wording of the leaders' declaration glosses over differences on the issue of fiscal stimulus by saying each will take into account ""country-specific circumstances"" in committing to stronger policies to support their economies. Germany, in particular, has balked at committing to expansionary fiscal policy.In a nod to such concerns, the declaration includes a reference to the need to ensure debt is ""on a sustainable path.""While Japan is moving toward more public spending, and the likely postponement of a sales tax increase next year, to revive faltering growth, its own gross public debt is more than twice the size of its economy.The G7 host, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe appealed to his fellow leaders to act to avert another global crisis, comparing the current global economic situation to conditions just before the 2008 financial crisis.Vigilance is crucial for averting a relapse, he said: ""We learned a lesson that we failed to respond properly because we did not have a firm recognition of the risks.""President Barack Obama backed Abe's call, saying it was crucial not just to put people back to work but also raise wages and maintain the momentum of the recovery.""We've all got a lot of work to do and we agreed to continue to focus on making sure that each country, based on its particular needs and capacities, is taking steps to accelerate growth,"" Obama said.G7 countries denounced protectionism and trade barriers. They also noted the negative impact from overcapacity in some industries and government subsidies and other incentives that tend to make such problems worse.During talks on the sideline of the summit, the US, EU and Japan reiterated their determination to reach agreement on various trade agreements meant to expand mutual market access.In their declaration, the summit leaders cited a possible departure of Britain from the European Union, depending on the outcome of a June 23 vote, as one of many potential shocks for the global economy The leaders also expressed concern over territorial tensions in the East and South China seas. The declaration does not mention China and its expansion into disputed areas specifically, but calls for respecting freedom of navigation and of overflight and for resolving conflicts peacefully through law.The summit declaration also highlighted joint efforts on corruption, cybercrimes, terrorism, global health and migration  which has become a huge headache especially for European nations  as other top priorities.It said a global response was needed to cope with the surge in refugees, migrants and other displaced people to its highest level since World War II and committed to increasing assistance to meet their immediate and long-term needs.But there were no specific, concrete offers of extra help.Earlier, Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said the EU was creation of resettlement schemes and expansion of other forms of legal migration around the world.Expanding their discussions to issues of ""inclusive"" growth, the group met Friday with leaders of seven developing countries. The ""outreach"" session invited leaders from some of Asia's poorest countries, such as Laos and Papua New Guinea, and also some of its biggest, most dynamic emerging economies, like Vietnam and Indonesia. The president of Chad, Idriss Deby, was representing the African union, and top international leaders such as Christine Lagarde of the IMF also attended.The annual summit brings together the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States. It is taking place amid extraordinarily tight security around the remote summit venue, with uniformed police standing guard at close intervals on both sides of roads and randomly in forests, rice fields, soccer fields and other locations.After the summit ends on Friday afternoon, Obama plans to visit the peace park in Hiroshima, becoming the first sitting US president to visit the city on which the US dropped an atomic bomb in 1945 in the closing days of World War II."
58f55ebc7be9e01a17c9868b,Talk of restarting GM crop trials faces stiff opposition,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/Talk-of-restarting-GM-crop-trials-faces-stiff-opposition/articleshow/52662706.cms,2016-06-09,"Nagpur: The statement by CD Mayee, a member of state government's technical committee on genetically modified (GM) crops, in a seminar in the city on Monday that the field trials be restarted has evoked sharp reaction from those against genetic engineering. The anti-GM group says the crops are not suitable for conditions in Maharashtra. Mayee is also the former director of city-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR).Last year, the state government had put on hold the restricted field trials of seven GM crops, including rice, maize, chickpea and cotton, after organizations like RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections.On Mayee's statement, Ajay Patki of the manch's core team said any attempt to introduce GM crops will be opposed tooth and nail. This can also be in the form of protests involving farmers and other means, he warned.""It is already proven that GM crops like Bt cotton need abundant availability of water, and large areas in Maharasthra are under dryland farming. Rather than GM, the country's indigenous varieties can also be promoted,"" said Patki.He said GM crops, especially Bt cotton, have increased the cost of production. Though not initially, in last 10 years or so the requirement of fertilizers has increased in the GM seeds, which has led to a major hike in the cost of cultivation. This has disbursed the economics of agriculture and often driving farmers into financial crisis leading to suicides, he said.Patki said his organization has already succeeded in stalling GM brinjals in 2009, when Jairam Ramesh was the minister for forest and environment under the UPA regime. A public hearing for GM brinjals was held at that time and the manch despite its minority was able to bring moratorium.""There is no need to introduce any manipulative technology for a commonly grown vegetable like brinjal. At that time, there was a major glut in brinjal supply in Vidarbha with rates crashing to 3 a kg."" said Patki.During the seminar, Mayee had insisted that trials should be allowed for at least drought-resistant varieties. One of the crops which was due for trial is drought-resistant rice.On this, Kishore Tiwari, who heads state government's Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM), said normally rice is grown in assured rainfall regions so there is a little requirement of a drought-resistant seed for this crop. On the trials, Tiwari said he is not against research but that should come from the universities rather than corporates which eventually create a monopoly on the product.On an experimental basis, Tiwari's organization and the agriculture department in Yavatmal are distributing indigenous seeds in the 50 villages of this farmer suicide prone district. ""The traditional seeds which have evolved over a long period of time are itself drought resistant. The HMT developed by a local farmer in Bhandara can also work in low water conditions,"" said Tiwari.Vijay Jawandiya, a veteran farm activist, said the ready round (RR) up ready variety of Bt is suited for countries like the US where agriculture is mechanized. In India, weeding operation provides a major employment to rural labour. Bt cotton will stand its true test if it is successfully grown without fertilizers.He also questioned those backing Bt cotton. ""Why are straight line varieties, which are cheaper, available in the US than,"" he asked. In India, hybrid Bt which costs more is only available in the market.Mayee, on other hand, said adopting the technology comes later but at least trials should be allowed to test the pros and cons. These are limited field trials conducted in university farms. Distances from other fields are maintained as per the norms so that GM seeds do not contaminate other crops. However, if the test itself is barred, it will be a major setback to research and development. At least, drought-resistant and nitrogen-efficient crops in the batch of seven, which where genetic engineering of non-biotic nature, should be allowed for trials, he said.Maha yet to decide on field trialsOver eight months after the state's technical committee on GM crops gave its report setting aside objections raised against field trials of seven crops, the government has not reverted with an answer, CD Mayee told TOI.The committee is headed by former chairman of atomic energy commission Anil Kakodkar. The last meeting was held eight months ago and now the file is learnt to be put up before the Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. Tests have been held in states like Gujarat, Andhra and Punjab, but Maharashtra remains. This can be a major setback to research activities, he said.Last year, the tests were stopped after organizations like Swadeshi Jagran Manch raised objections which the committee was supposed to address. ""The government should now take a clear stand instead of delaying decision. When the union minister for environment and forests Prakash Javadekar was approached he said there is no policy against GM trials. Even the respective state government has to give its approval. The Maharashtra government is however, sitting on the file, said Mayee."

He said that no one can point fingers on the intention, credibility and leadership of the Congress party.Deepender Hooda has strongly attacked the NDA government in the Centre by stating that during last two years, the PM Narendra Modi led government has failed on every front.He said that before 2014 parliamentary elections BJP had promised 'acche din' to the people but in the last couple of years, not even a single poll promise has been fulfilled. He claimed that neither the black money was brought back in 100 days nor Rs 15 lakh was deposited in the bank accounts of individuals. He added that Modi government has also failed to implement the Swaminathan committee report.Hooda asserted that in last two years, growth rate had remained low compared to UPA regime. He said despite falling prices of crude oil in international market, people of India were deprived of its benefits. He also said that Modi has failed to control the rising prices.Claiming that import is constantly decreasing, he insisted that NDA government has failed to provide a package to drought hit farmers, and has also made very less increases in the support price of wheat and rice compared to UPA regime.He also accused the BJP government of implementing its saffron agenda in the educational institutes of country.In response to a question, he said that during Lok Sabha elections, Congress failed to put its side before public, and post parliament election, barring Assam, BJP has lost in rest of areas. He said Congress is focusing on the coming elections in Uttar Pradsh, Punjab and Himachal Pradesh.""In terms of development Congress government of Himachal Pradesh is a role model for rest of country, and in 2017 assembly elections, Congress would return to power once again.""

The forecast has a 4 per cent margin of error.India Meteorological Department, the country's official monsoon forecaster, has predicted 106 per cent rains. The department is expected to issue an updated forecast in the first week of June. ""The last prediction was based on data from March. In our updated forecast, we have looked at data till the beginning of May and it's showing more favourable conditions, particularly the increased possibility of La Nina forming later this year,"" said G P Sharma, VP meteorology, Skymet.Average rainfall of 887mm across the country from June to September is considered normal. If this is taken as 100 per cent, the normal monsoon range is 96%-104 per cent. Rains in the 104-110 per cent range is termed 'above normal', while those above 110 per cent is excess.According to the forecast, the monsoon may have a relatively poor start.

The Chief Minister of Telangana was repeatedly saying that he would pump water from the Godavari for 365 days in a year, he added. The crop period of kharif was four months, out of which there was a flood only for two months. There would be no water for the Godavari delta if the proposed shake-hand barrages were constructed.The Telangana government planned to lift water from one shake-hand barrage to another. It planned to pump water upstream right from Perur to Sri Ram Sagar Project from one barrage to another up to a distance of 600 km and even store water in Singur and Nizam Sagar projects on the Manjira with a total head to the order of 800 metres. It was proposing to build more barrages at Tupakulagudam and Dummugudam in addition to the existing ones at SRSP down and Yellampalli, Mr. Haranath said.There will be no water for Godavari delta on completion of shake-hand barrages"

He is expected to allot nearly 25% of the plan expenditure in the budget to educationNew Delhi: The Delhi government's budget for 2016-17, to be tabled in the Delhi assembly on Monday, is likely to steer the capital towards becoming the state with the lowest value added tax regime in the country.The budget provides the Aam Aadmi Party government the opportunity to initiate the process of rationalising the VAT rates that could enhance tax compliance to offset any revenue loss arising from low VAT rates. The rejigging of items in the current six-layered VAT structure will also make for streamlined tax collecting operations.The Delhi government is likely to move some items of common use currently attracting 12.5% VAT to the 5% category. Such items at present include meals in restaurants, marble tiles and bathroom fittings for homes. Also, the government plans to standardise to a single rate the varying rates that are currently levied on some items such as garments and shoes.However, an item or two under the ""exempted"" category may be now be pushed into the 5% tax slab.But, sources say, the government is in no mood to burden the common man and is unlikely to enhance the taxes on most items of daily use.The existing VAT regime in Delhi is a six-layered structure. Schedule 1 includes exempted items such as CNG, PNG, rice and wheat. Bullion and other items in the second schedule attract VAT of 1%m, while items used on an everyday basis, including shoes and garments costing below Rs 5,000 and cell phones priced at under Rs 10,000, are taxed at 5% under Schedule 3. The fourth schedule levies VAT at the rate of 20% on luxury items such as branded watches and premium alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. The fifth schedule items, taxed at 12.5%, include food in a restaurant and hardware. There is a separate schedule for petroleum and diesel products and aviation turbine fuel with VAT ranging from 18% to 30%.As part of the VAT rationalisation, the government plans to track and bring unregistered dealers and commercial tax evaders into the tax net. It proposes to use digital data from the official Geospatial Delhi Limited and other government departments to identify dealers and locate their official addresses on maps of markets and commercial areas. The mapping will also be used to reach out to traders who are not registered with the VAT department by comparing digital data with ground records with the relevant departments.In its election manifesto, AAP had incorporated three-point plan for streamlining the tax system in Delhi. It had promised that by simplifying the system and taking the entire taxation and licensing procedures online, it would ensure that the capital would have the lowest VAT rates in India.Meanwhile, Delhi's VAT collections in the current fiscal have crossed Rs 20,000 crore, just short of the revised target of Rs 21,000 crore and much higher than last year's collection of Rs 18,500 crore."

Certain things, however, are quite plain about the performance of the Congress government headed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in Karnataka as it completes three years in office on Friday.Comparatively, the Congress governments record in the first three years seems tad better than its predecessor BJP governments. The BJP rule was full of absurdity, sound and fury. A series of scams and scandals saw several Ministers quit ignominiously. Unending dissident activities and corruption charges saw the exit of its first Chief Minister by the end of the third year and he was jailed subsequently. In comparison, the Congress rule has been free of such political drama so far. Despite minor rumblings, there is stability. The third year of its term saw some corruption charges raise their ugly head but they are nothing in comparison with what was seen under the previous regime.Short of expectationsThe Congress rule, however, has hardly impressed and inspired people. There is something lacklustre about this governments performance. In the first two years, popular accounts of the government veered around one major criticism  that the Chief Minister and his team were lethargic. One former bureaucrat compared it to a flight on the runway waiting forever to take off. None seems to have the confidence to say that it has taken off. Recent corruption charges apart, the dominant narrative is still that of performance falling short of expectation, of inefficiency and indecision. At the time of assuming office as Chief Minister, Mr. Siddaramaiah enjoyed the reputation of being an efficient, bold, decisive and incorruptible leader. The first three years saw the complete demolition of this image. This is despite the absence of any major challenge to his leadership.Obviously, many things seem to be going wrong.The Chief Minister seems to have been caught up in a strange trap of his own beliefs. He wants history to remember him as a champion of the downtrodden. Nothing wrong in it. Such commitment to social justice is indeed welcome. The problem, however, seems to be that he has a very conventional idea of social justice which is not in sync with time. It does not appeal to anyone, including those who are benefiting from it. But for a substantial increase in the allocation for SC/ST welfare and a law which addresses the loopholes in utilising these allocations, he has taken the much trodden path of populism to achieve social justice. This is a worn-out model in which a stale mix of doles, reservations and patronage pass off as provision for social emancipation. The weaker sections harbour high aspirations these days and what would really uplift them are good education, adequate healthcare and ample economic opportunities. The governments social justice model is silent on this. Its lopsidedness makes both the Chief Minister and the government appear biased towards certain sections, eclipsing even some of the good decisions taken by the government for balanced industrial growth, strengthening rural local self-governance, and providing urban infrastructure.Communication gapBeyond this idea of social justice, the Chief Minister has never come out with a bold agenda for progress, which is so crucial to impress upon the burgeoning middle-class voters who are also opinion makers. His politics seems to have no place for communication. Major policy changes are being announced without ever gauging pubic sentiments and testing the possible political repercussions. The rationale for some crucial policy decisions  be it the proposed anti-superstition Bill or the much-acclaimed free rice scheme  is never explained boldly to the governments critics. Setting up of the Anti-Corruption Bureau in the place of Lokayukta police made the governments motives look suspicious but no one cared to clear it. Often decisions are revoked, making the government look amateurish. Even the recent announcement of a vision group of corporate bigwigs to advise the government on Bengalurus governance appears to be a volte-face, given the Chief Ministers previous socialist distance from the private sector. It might do well, but as the people are yet to hear the larger vision that the government has for the State, isolated measures, however good they might be, hardly inspire confidence.(Narayana A. is faculty at the Azim Premji University)"

A majority of students prefer to drop out after completing initial schooling due to lack of schools and necessary facilities. Girls completing education till Std X are rare, as parents don't want them to take up education due to fear of Maoists, who may kidnap them and force them to join their ranks. However, some like Sushila Munshitiramma, stand out as a shining light from the hinterland.A resident of a hamlet called Gongwada in Bhamragadh town, which lacks even basic facilities like roads, power, and water, Sushila is lucky to be selected among 50 girls for pursuing education in Pune. After appearing in her Std X examination from Lokseva English Medium School in Pune, she now aims to join science stream and become a doctor.The 16-year-old was hand-picked by the then home minister RR Patil, who started this noble initiative when he chose to become guardian minister of Gadchiroli district. Every year, 50 bright girls are selected from such remote villages and sent to Pune to pursue secondary education. Their expenses, including books and stationery, are borne by the Maharashtra government.Sushila, who belongs to the Madia tribe, wishes to serve villagers from Nelgunda and other villages, which badly lack medical facilities. Even the primary health centres (PHCs) hardly function here as doctors and staffers apprehend fear to their life, in absence of security. A majority of these villages, on periphery of Chhattisgarh border, are directly or indirectly controlled by the outlaws.""Like others, we're also deeply pained by the fate of our villages due to the menace of Maoists, but mainly due to utter neglect by the government. When I compare Pune and my villages, it seems we're living in the dark age with no power, roads, buses or mobile phones. Like normal children, we also want to see development in our villages,"" she said.She had come, along with her brother Dinesh, to Nelgunda to attend an event organized by Bhumkal Sanghatan, where TOI met her. She says she can understand English, but can't speak fluently. Her parents are poor farmers living on rice farming in their native villages. Inspired by her, Dinesh is also pursuing education in Hemalkasa where he stays in a hostel. ""After clearing Std X, I will join arts stream,"" he said.Both siblings also went to their native place to enjoy their vacations with their parents, but unlike children in cities, they had to work hard in farms. They have to rushed back to their respective schools even before classes begin next month, as their village would be completely cut off from the mainland for about four months, due to monsoon. In absence of bridges on nullahs, it gets extremely difficult to cross the rivers during rainy season.Bhumkal members say girls pursuing schooling till Std X are extremely rare, as parents don't want to send them to nearby places like Laheri or Bhamragadh which are 10-15 km away from their villages. ""Like other parents, they also don't want to compromise with the safety of their wards. They prefer to engage girls into their farming business and marry them, as they enter their teenage years. Early marriages are also prevalent in this part of backward district,"" they said."

For a sector reeling under severe labour shortage, the arrival of the Bangladeshi migrants from Raichur has come as a blessing. Willing to rough it out in the slushy fields, they are the main workforce in the fields in Udupi district. There were fears that paddy cultivation has dipped in Dakshina Kannada district. With migrants giving the much-needed helping hand, things are looking up for paddy farmers.For the migrants, agriculture is their main occupation. They are willing to work for less pay and are fast. They use thread to align the placement of saplings and on an average finish planting 5 acres on a day. For an acre, they demand wages of Rs 3,500, which is less compared to what local labourers would demand.Malathesh, owner of Ganesh Harvesters from Shivamogga, is the contractor for these groups. ""I was associated with the Brahmavar Sugar Factory. In 2004, when the factory closed, I had no option but to get back to farming for survival. Earlier, I used to depend on local workers. However, it was difficult to manage them. This forced me to bring migrant labourers from North Karnataka. I figured out later that they had no experience of paddy cultivation and the wages were comparatively more and not feasible. They had knowledge of jowar and ragi cultivation. So this year, I brought 28 labourers from Raichur. The Bangladeshi migrants are familiar with rice cultivation,"" says Malathesh.Madhav Mandol of Sindhnur Camp in Raichur came to Karnataka after the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. ""We were thrown out of our country. The then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted us land in Raichur. We have documents like ration card, Aadhaar, and voter ID. We were born here and we know Kannada. However, we still follow our culture and language at home,"" he added.Jyotsna Mandol says that it is the drought that forced them to migrate in search of jobs. ""We have eight men and 20 women here. We have been in Udupi from the past one month. We work in the paddy fields in Raichur. But there was no rain and we had no field work,"" she rues.Sankari Mandol, another migrant, says they have boarding facility at Belkunja, Karkala.

In this a ruling party is at a distinct disadvantage: it is judged not by promises but by its performance in government. Ahead of the May 16 Assembly election, the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu is intent on overcoming the trust deficit by offering voters everything from free power and subsidised scooters to unlimited wi-fi and interest-free loans. The party delayed releasing its election manifesto until just 10 days before polling day not so much because it needed time to gauge what people wanted, but because it needed to better the offers made in all other manifestos, particularly that of its principal rival, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Word for word, scheme for scheme, freebie for freebie, the AIADMK manifesto is an improvement on that of the DMK, which itself is in good measure copied from the programmes of the Pattali Makkal Katchi. Ever since the DMK made a promise in its 2006 manifesto to hand out colour television sets to all, and proceeded to deliver on it after being voted to power, freebies have been an integral part of the manifestos of all parties in serious contention for power in the State. In 2011, the AIADMK promised fans, mixers and grinders, and promptly gave them away over the next five years.Subsidies and freebies are not necessarily bad; they can play an important role in social welfare if aligned to government policy. Tamil Nadu, under the AIADMKs first Chief Minister, M.G. Ramachandran, was the pioneer in introducing the noon-meal scheme in schools, which increased enrolment and reduced dropout rates. Ms. Jayalalithaa, during her earlier term between 2001 and 2006, gave away free bicycles to schoolgirls, which again slowed down the alarming dropout rate among girls in schools in rural areas. The free laptop scheme in her current term allowed students greater access to higher education and opened up avenues to enhance their employment skills in the competitive knowledge economy. Free rice under the Public Distribution System was another major initiative that eased the lives of people living below the poverty line. But many of the freebies are not targeted to reach only the poorer sections. TVs and fans were giveaways meant as little more than post-election gifts-for-votes at state expense, and they diverted resources from essential services and development programmes. Competitive populism has the result of hindering important social welfare measures, and investment in infrastructure development over the long term. Ms. Jayalalithaa must be hoping her manifesto will have the effect of helping her party in the home stretch before the election. As both she and her main rival, M. Karunanidhi, know, keeping promises is the easy part. Doing so without affecting investment in critical areas such as health, education and infrastructure, is what is truly difficult."

His body was found in an isolated area and we do not believe there any witnesses to the killing.""But the pattern of the killing is similar to ones carried out by local Islamist militants in recent time,"" Kanjilal added.Bangladesh is reeling from a wave of murders of secular and liberal activists and religious minorities that have left more than 40 people dead in the last three years.Most of the recent attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State organisation or the local offspring of al-Qaida.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has however blamed homegrown Islamists for the attacks, rejecting claims of responsibility from the IS and a South Asian branch of al-Qaida.Experts say a government crackdown on opponents, including a ban on Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami following a protracted political crisis, has pushed many towards extremism.Jamaat-e-Islami is a traditional ally of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party whose leader, two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia, is facing a raft of charges in connection with deadly firebombings.Victims of the attacks by suspected Islamists have included secular bloggers, gay rights activists and followers of minority religions.Although it is officially secular, around 90 per cent of Bangladesh's 160 million-strong population is Muslim.Ganguly's murder comes only two days after a Christian was hacked to death after Sunday prayers near a church in northwest Bangladesh in an attack claimed by IS.A Hindu shop owner was also hacked to death outside his store in the northern Gaibandha district late last month. IS said it was behind that killing as well."

Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems. Through adaptation and mitigation measures, we can overcome this Hobbesian crisis.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency forthe BJP."

On Thursday, after opening higher on the back of strong global cues, markets traded steady with the sensex closing 259 points, or 1%, higher at 27,000. On June 23, a day before the results for the UK referendum on EU was announced, the sensex had closed at 27,002. On the NSE, nifty rallied 84 points to close at 8,288.On Thursday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that during the week ended June 29, monsoon rains were 1% above the long-term average. In comparison, so far in the June, monsoon was 12% below the long-period average. Investors were enthused by IMD's announcement that rains had covered almost the whole of India, which could give a fillip to sowing of rice and pulses. In the two previous years, sowing had suffered due to below-average monsoon.In Thursday's session, some stocks also got a boost from the government's decision to implement seventh pay commission recommendations. Stocks of auto companies were in the limelight with Tata Motors, Bajaj Auto, Maruti and Hero MotoCorp among the gainers. Market players feel the extra money that government employees will get after pay commission proposals are implemented could enhance demand for two-wheelers and passenger cars.According to Sahaj Agrawal, deputy VP, derivatives research, Kotak Securities, Indian indices outperformed their global peers as downsides to the Indian market remained limited and there was broad-based participation as buying emerged at lower levels of the index. ""We continue to remain positive on the broader markets and expect (nifty levels of) 8375/8550 in the near term. At present we do not see any significant downside risk in the index,"" Agrawal said.In other markets, the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts have been showing resilience from day one and have been trading at levels higher that last Friday's close at 7.50%. In contrast, the rupee is still below the 67.50 per dollar mark, which closed its Thursday session at 67.69 and is still some way from its pre-Brexit close at 67.25."

For a sector reeling under severe labour shortage, the arrival of the Bangladeshi migrants from Raichur has come as a blessing. Willing to rough it out in the slushy fields, they are the main work force in the fields in Udupi district.There were fears that paddy cultivation has dipped in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts. With migrants giving the much needed helping hand, things are looking up for paddy farmers.The migrants are willing to work for less pay and are quick. They use thread to align the placement of the saplings and on an average finish planting five acres on a day. For an acre they demand wages of Rs 3,500, which is less compared to what local labourers would have demanded for the same work.Malathesh, owner of Ganesh Harvesters from Shivamogga, is the contractor for these groups. ""I was associated with the Brahmavar Sugar Factory. In 2004 when the factory closed, I had no option but to get back to farming to survive. Earlier I used to depend on local workers. However, it was difficult to manage them. This forced me to bring migrant labourers from North Karnataka. I figured out later that they had no experience of paddy cultivation and the wages were comparatively more and not feasible. They had knowledge of jowar and ragi cultivation. So this year I brought 28 labourers from Raichur. The Bangladeshi migrants are familiar with rice cultivation,"" says Malathesh.Madhav Mandol of Sindhnur Camp in Raichur came to Karnataka after the Bangladesh Liberation war of 1971. ""We were thrown out of our country. The then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted us land in Raichur. We have documents like ration card, Aadhaar, and voter ID. We were born here and we know Kannada. However, we still follow our culture and language at home,"" he added.Jyotsna Mandol says that it is the drought that forced them to migrate in search of jobs. ""We have eight men and 20 women here. We have been in Udupi from the past one month. We work in the paddy fields in Raichur. But there was no rain and we had no field work,"" she rues.Sankari Mandol, another migrant, says they have housing facility at Belkunja, Karkala to stay.""We are here from the past one month. We have enough contracts from Hejmadi, Palimaru, Bolanjigutte and surrounding places to be here fro some more time."""

Our country, and in fact the world, is facing an enormous health crisis. Childhood obesity and juvenile diabetes are on the rise like never before. According to experts, the next generation may be the first generation that has a shorter life expectancy than their parents. And may also be the least food literate generation ever. Too many Indians of our generation simply dont cook. Historically, a majority of the male population never really learned. In recent years, even girls, are increasingly kept out of the kitchen because they have better things to do, study, work, learn and earn.Our children  whether boys or girls  are not learning food skills at school, at home, or anywhere. Food is the most exciting sector of growth in India in every way today. Its everywhere: on television, online, even on our phones. And yet our children are growing up without even the simplest knowledge of food or basic cooking.As a mother, I have been researching the connection between children and cooking for a couple of years now. As parents, we worry about our kids safety constantly. We plan, save and invest for their education, their futures, but do we take into account that medical treatment for lifestyle diseases will be prohibitive? Are we saving for that? Lifestyle diseases are preventable by eating mindfully. We just need to ensure we pass on our food culture, the core society values of Indian homes. Go shopping together, cook together and eat together.A cooking date with the family doesnt have to be all or nothing. Start with one day a week, perhaps weekends, when we usually have a little more time to spend on food. Get your kids involved in shopping. Make a trip to your favourite market, interact with you favourite vegetable vendors, identify quality produce, pick the right cut of meat from your favourite butcher, share jobs in the kitchen. Its a great introduction not just to cooking, but also family traditions and recipes.A handful of must-know dishes will set your kids up for life. There is no need for special cookbooks. Its important children learn to make essential basics and it is important they learn to cook Indian food because our home cooked cuisine is one of the healthiest foods. Too often, we want to make things special but then we are telling our kids that everyday dal rice is boring, and cooking only means fancy dishes.Theres no need for special equipment. Not only will they will grow out of kid-sized utensils really quickly, but its better for them to get acquainted with real stuff under your supervision. A dull knife is actually more dangerous than a sharp paring knife, contrary to what people think. Let children get used to them and solid cutting boards, secured with a damp cloths or paper towels underneath. Inculcating the rules of safety and hygiene, the wisdom of separating rubbish, and keeping their workspace clean are valuable practices for life.Involving your kids in cooking, even if its a meal they eventually dislike, is a great way to encourage interest in food, and acquisition of new tastes.Make sure there is at least one component of the meal that they will absolutely eat. Convince them to try just one bite of the something new. You might be surprised to see fussy eaters eating more than you expect. Kids are more inclined to taste what they make themselves, out of curiosity if nothing else.And even if they dont end up loving what you make together, be happy in the knowledge that you are still teaching them valuable kitchen skills, and that they will get there eventually.The lessons are big, though. Children who cook understand what goes into food preparation. They understand that food doesnt just happen. It needs effort. Children must know whats good for them, how to buy and cook nutritious food, and make a few dishes that they enjoy and dont cost too much.Food can be medicine, and if our children learn how to prepare the right dish, they can give their body just what it needs, nutrition. So, get into the kitchen with your kids. It doesnt have to be complicated. From experience with my own kids, I guarantee you will make memories for a lifetime for them and yourselves. Because, food has an unshakeable position in our lives, one that connects us elementally to the place where we belong, home.The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and the author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That"

The officials recovered 372 quintals of fair price shop rice from the rice mill. During interrogation, the workers were said to have confessed that they were purchasing Re.1a-kilo rice from card holders at Rs. 9 per kg, and after recycling in the mill by removing the broken rice were again selling back the same to the State government at Rs. 23 per kg. Sometimes, the same rice is polished in the mill and sold in the open market at Rs. 30 per kg. There were also instances of this rice being smuggled to Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh to sell at higher rates.5,000 tonnes divertedKarimnagar district has a record number of 10,98,393 ration card holders, including food security card, AAY and Annapurna card holders. The government releases 20,400 tonnes of rice per month for the distribution of the same to the card holders, out of which more than 5,000 tonnes of rice is being diverted to the open market by traders and rice millers to make a fast buck.Incidentally, majority of card holders were also not consuming the Re 1-a-kilo rice and selling them to traders in the open market at Rs. 9 to 11 per kg depending on the demand. A few small-time vendors move through residential areas in the town collecting the rice from card holders and sell the same to rice millers and traders.Officials of the Civil Supplies Department said that they were conducting raids on all the rice mills and seizing the rice supplied to fair price shops, but the racket is still continuing in collusion with card holders and the traders. They attributed the same to the distribution of more number of white ration cards to non-eligible persons. They favoured streamlining of ration cards to ensure that only the real beneficiaries get the rice welfare scheme."

It was the day on which Indira Gandhi devalued the rupee by 36.5%, increasing the dollar's value against it by 57.4%. The move sparked bitter, nationwide criticism.In both politics and economics, 1966 was India's annus horribilis. On January 11, Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri - a popular, respected figure - died of a heart attack at Tashkent, and was replaced by Indira. Apparently, the Congress party old guard had conspired to install an inexperienced person, so they could call the shots.Indira's inheritance in 1966 was onerous. Drought had ravaged foodgrain crops, forcing India to import rice and wheat for the first time. This was easier said than done, for India's foreign exchange reserves were sparse. In 1965, with imports of Rs 2,194 crore and exports of only Rs 1,264 crore, India's trade deficit of Rs 930 crore was the highest during the sixties.With no money to import food, India sought aid from the US' ('friendly foreign government' - is this really necessary), whose 'Food for Peace' programme - authorized by Public Law 480 (PL-480) - allowed poor nations like India to pay the US in their own currency. President Lyndon B Johnson obliged by shipping 16 million tonnes of wheat, and 1 million tonnes of rice to India, and disbursing approximately $1 billion to alleviate her financial strain. Indira Gandhi's decision to accept this ""ship-to-mouth"" aid was unpopular.Union finance minister Sachindra Chaudhuri - an eminent lawyer who had been inducted by Shastri to replace T T Krishnamachari - said on February 28, 1966 in his Budget speech: ""With the best will in the world and the utmost effort we are capable of, we still cannot dispense with foreign aid in the near future.""However, when aid was cut off and India told to liberalize its economy, Indira Gandhi reacted with swift bravado. In one fell swoop, on June 6, 1966 (the decision was taken late on June 5) she devalued the rupee, making the dollar worth from Rs 7.50, a 57.4% increase from Rs 4.76. The change was widely criticized, and was described as the ""ultimate sell-out to America and the World Bank,"" but carping ceased when Gandhian Morarji Desai replaced Chaudhuri.But devaluation worked. India averted both famine and bankruptcy. By fiercely implementing import substitution as state policy, Indira brought the deficit down to Rs 100 crore in 1970. The following year, India liberated Bangladesh, and was conferred the Bharat Ratna. By now, thanks to the 'Green Revolution' masterminded by Norman Borlaug in the mid-sixties, India was already self-sufficient in rice, wheat and maize, and searching for export opportunities. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970. Indians were euphoric with their self-esteem redeemed.The verdict of history will forever be that the exercise of grit and guts 50 years ago brought India a manifold legacy of short and long-term benefits. Today, few are aware of, or are bothered by the fact that on August 15, 1947, the rupee-dollar exchange rate was a dollar to a rupee. Parity stands devalued in 2016 by 6,600%. So where do we go from here?"

Odisha was one of them  the BJP won just one out of 21 seats and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), which had ruled the state since 2000, won the rest. The BJP was no greenhorn in Odisha, as it was in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, two other states that bucked the Modi wave. The BJP was part of the ruling coalition in the state between 2000 and 2009.What it pointed to was the BJD's, or more accurately, its leader Naveen Patnaik 's grip on the state. It did not matter that the BJD was not part of a national coalition, nor were the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in Tamil Nadu. Voters in these states backed the regional parties as if it were an assembly election, except that Odisha also had its state polls concurrently, which benefited the BJD in the general election.In its best ever performance, the BJD swept the assembly election too, bagging 117 out of 147 seats (the BJP won 10 and the Congress 16), giving Patnaik his fourth straight term as chief minister. Only two of his present counterparts have won four consecutive elections or more: Sikkim's Pawan Chamling and Tripura's Manik Sarkar. Patnaik's father Biju Patnaik was chief minister of Odisha twice.The BJD and the BJP first joined hands in 1998 and fought every parliamentary and state election together till 2009, when the BJD decided to part ways because the BJP did not agree to give the BJD more seats than in the old seat-sharing agreement. Some cite the Kandhamal riots of 2008, in which the killing of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader led to clashes between Hindus and Christians, as another reason for the BJD severing ties with the BJP; some 38 perished in those clashes that led to the conviction of a BJP MLA.Modi is aware of how far the BJP has to go to even dream of having a shot at power on its own in the state in 2019 and that is why he chose Odisha for one of the five rallies to mark his government's second anniversary.The rally in Balasore, 200 km north of the state capital Bhubaneswar, on June 2, was Modi's second in the state since February. It was also his fourth visit to Odisha since becoming prime minister in May 2014. At the rally he told an estimated 50,000 people that while Odisha is a mineral-rich state, its people continue to be poor, calling Patnaik's government ""soi hui sarkar"" (government in slumber). Modi said neither the Congress at the Centre earlier nor the BJD in the state has given an account of its performance like his government has. Patnaik responded by saying his government believes in work, not propaganda. He accused the Modi government of stopping some schemes for the state and reducing its contribution in others.Sudhir Patnaik, editor of Samadrusti, an Odia fortnightly, says Modi refrains from attacking Naveen, creating confusion in the minds of voters and the BJP cadre. ""People see the BJP and BJD together and that doesn't help the BJP. These days, Modi's rallies are not attracting the kind of crowds they used to."" He adds that the 69-year-old chief minister also rarely hits out at opposition leaders. ""Naveen Patnaik is an astute politician who uses silence to his advantage.""Can the BJP look to its rise in Assam for some lessons in Odisha? After all, the party was not a force to reckon with in Assam after the 2011 assembly polls, in which it won only five out of 126 seats. But it managed to regroup in the years leading up to the 2016 election, which it won through a coalition, helped in no small measure by anti-incumbency against former Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who had won three consecutive terms. The BJP is facing a similar scenario in Odisha, with three years to go for the next poll, so can it capitalise on it?Tathagata Satpathy, a BJD MP, does not think so. ""The BJP had (Sarbananda) Sonowal in Assam. Here they don't have a leader like him."" Sudhir Patnaik concurs: ""Neither the BJP nor the Congress has a leader who can stand up to Naveen Patnaik."" The Congress is the chief opposition party in the state, though the number of its MLAs and its vote share have been falling since 2004. The BJP's vote share, on the other hand, rose between 2009 and 2014.The BJP's Samir Mohanty says its leadership vacuum in the state has ended with Dharmendra Pradhan, Union minister of state (independent charge) for petroleum and natural gas, being accepted by the people to lead the party. ""He is ahead (of the other leaders)."" But Pradhan, observers believe, does not have a pan-state appeal. The other prominent leader, Jual Oram, who is the sole BJP MP from Odisha and is the Union tribal affairs minister, is not in a better position either, though tribals account for nearly a fourth of the state's population. Neither Pradhan nor Oram was available for comment.Differences within the party are also becoming more evident. Recently, Rourkela MLA Dilip Ray stayed away from a party event in the city, protesting against the delay in the upgrade of a local hospital, despite promises by the prime minister. This forced two Union ministers who had been scheduled to attend the event to cancel their plans. Arun Singh, a BJP general secretary who is in charge of Odisha, makes light of it, and says the issue concerned Ray's constituency, not the party.Making things worse for the BJP were the recent bypolls to three local body seats, including one in Cuttack: the party came third in all of them. The BJD, which had held them, lost two to the Congress. Satpathy says while the issues on which these were fought were local, the results are a signal to the party not to be overconfident. Prasad Harichandan, president of the Congress in Odisha, sees the results as a harbinger of better days, but this might be wishful thinking, as these are not Lok Sabha or assembly by-polls.Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD MP from Cuttack, alleges an understanding between the Congress and BJP in the bypoll in the city, which led to the former's victory. ""The consolidation of anti-BJD votes is happening sporadically."" He said the BJD wants both the Congress and the BJP in the state. ""We want a triangular fight.""What the opposition will be banking on is anti-incumbency as Patnaik will have been chief minister for 19 years when the state goes to the polls in 2019. But Satpathy says there is no anti-incumbency in Odisha, thanks to welfare schemes, like 25 kg rice per month at Rs 1 per kg for the poor, and free bicycles to schoolchildren. These welfare schemes have, to an extent, blunted the impact of a Rs 4,600 crore chit fund scam, in which an MP and an MLA of the BJD were arrested. Also, the Trinamool's comprehensive victory in West Bengal, despite its members being linked to the Saradha scam, makes some wonder whether the chit fund scam will have any impact in the 2019 polls, which will coincide with the general election.A Rs 59,000 crore illegal iron and manganese ore scam, which was probed by a commission before the 2014 polls, did not affect the BJD at the hustings. ""We can't say which issues will become important at the time of the election,"" says BJP's Odisha president Basanta Panda. He rules out the possibility of the BJP going back to join forces with the BJD, at least not before the 2019 election. Singh says the BJP is organising programmes against the government frequently at the mandal and district levels. ""It takes time to fight the party you ran the government with. But we are confident of winning the 2019 election.""""Anti-incumbency will work only if there is an alternative. In 2014, the Congress was not an alternative to the BJD,"" says Harichandan. The Congress is hopeful about the 2019 polls. ""If the BJP could form the government (at the Centre) with a 31% vote share (in 2014), why should we lose hope?"" asks Congress leader and leader of the opposition in the Odisha assembly, Narasingha Mishra. The Congress had a vote share of 26% in the 2014 assembly election.If Modi's rallies are any indication, there is no doubt that capturing Odisha is a top priority for the BJP and with three years to go for the election, it has enough time to work toward its goal. But time is not the only factor; the BJP cannot afford to be rudderless in the state. Modi's frequent visits to the state notwithstanding, the party has to identify and rally behind a leader who can take on the might of Naveen Patnaik."

""Such habitations need more attention and care to carry out the assigned mandates under various schemes and programmes,"" the commission noted.The NFSA provides food and nutritional security for all by ensuring access to adequate quantity of quality food at an affordable price. It guarantees 5 kg of rice or wheat per head per month at a subsidized price. The first phase was rolled out in October 2015 and the second phase in December. According to the government, 3.21 crore people have so far been brought under the Act.But with more than 5,000 habitations still not connected by roads, the food panel feels a lot of beneficiaries may not have been covered and has asked the state government to make special efforts to ensure the inclusion of those inhabitants under the Act. When asked about the commission's observations, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma said the government has not closed the enrolment process.""We have facilitated a mechanism at blocks and urban local bodies to include eligible beneficiaries under the food Act. An eligible beneficiary can apply for ration card at any time,"" Das Burma said. The commission expressed displeasure over the manner in which block-level government functionaries rejected applications of beneficiaries. ""No system is being followed to inform the applicants, whose applications were rejected.

But a close look at the pandals put up by the Bengali community reveals the way rituals are performed by them in a somewhat different way.The Tarun Sangh pandal at Basant Vihar Colony has been a popular destination for the 'Bengali Bhadralok' since 1979. Here, every ritual is performed according to Bengali tradition. ""We call the priests from Purbi Medinipur because he knows our tradition and, unlike the local puja style, we open the face of the Goddess on the sixth day of the Navaratra,"" said Saibal Choudhury of the organizing committee.The goddess idol is also different from those at other local pandals. ""The idol of Goddess Durga, Laxmi, Kartik and Saraswati are made on a single unit (Ek Chala) unlike the idols at most other Puja pandals where they are separate from each other,"" Saibal explained.Dhaakis have a major role to play at the time of aarti. Mohan Lal Maan, who has been associated with the Tarun Sangh for over three decades, said, ""We are a team of four artists and get remuneration of around Rs18,000 for a week.""Nilanjana Roy Nandi, a young devotee, shared her experience, ""I have been associated with Tarun Sangh since my childhood days. The sound of the dhak being played at the pandal is a pure bliss. Another attraction is the 'bhog' which is a speciality at any Bengali puja. It is prepared with utmost care and is a mix of khichdi and kheer.""Rahul Ganguli, a member of the puja committee at Boring Road, said 'bhog' is distributed among more than 3000 devotees every day. ""We have a team of 10 persons who prepare the bhog of a special khichdi, labra (vegetable curry recipe) and chatani on Asthami and Navami. On Asthami, we also serve pulao, chana dal, aloo gobhi vegetables and kheer to the devotees.""Dhunachi competition is another attraction at the Bengali puja pandals where artists and young boys perform the dance with big earthen lamps in their hands.At Adalatganj, Bengali puja is being organized since 1922. Partho Mukherjee, a member of the committee said, ""We serve bhog to over 5,000 devotees during Saptami, Asthami and Navami.""The Chajjubagh Sarbajanin Committee has also been organizing the puja since 1922 at PWD Engineers Club. ""The aarti, pushpanjali and sindoor khela are very important parts of Bengali puja. Sandhi Puja is celebrated in the intervening period of Ashtami and Navami. It requires 108 lotus flowers, a single fruit, dry rice for 'noibiddo', 108 earthen lamps, clothes, jewellery, hibiscus garlands and wood apple (bel) leaves. Sandhya Puja is considered one of the most important rituals for Bengalis during Durga Puja,"" said Sudipa Bose.She further said, ""On Dashmi, married women play with sindoor which is a typical Bengali style of puja. The married Bengali women wear white saris with deep red border and gold ornaments on this occasion,"" she said."

Ananda Kumar, Principal Scientist, Biotechnology Unit, Indian Institute of Rice Research, Dr. B. Seikeran, former director of National Institute of Nutrition, Dr. Ajay Panchbhai, Biotechnology Affairs Manager-India, DuPont Pinoeer and Dr. Shivendra Bajaj, Executive Director, ABLE-AG, recommended use of biotechnology in agriculture. Farmers should be introduced to drought resistant variants of rice, a crop which is highly water reliant. Scientists from India and abroad have developed genetically modified variants which will be suitable for soil in Telangana, Dr. Kumar said. Apart from rice varieties, scientists in New Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Hyderabad among other cities, have come up with biotechnologically experimented and better varieties of vegetables and food grains, the scientists explained.For a drought-hit state like Telangana, it is essential to curtail farmer distress and introduce different GM as well as non-GM crop varieties. Drought-resistant variants of crops that can withstand high temperatures and reduced irrigation should be considered along with herbicide tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency, especially in the case of rice, Telanganas primary food-grain, Dr. Sesikeran said at the meet. He also highlighted that GM crops were sae and nutritious.Drought had reduced rice production in Telangana from 4.5 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes in 2015. This is because for each kilogram of rice grown in Telangana, the farmer uses approximately 3,145 litres of water. Speaking of GM research, Dr. Bajaj asked the government to speed up support in the field. There has to be a concerted effort to drive agricultural growth through technology interventions. Telangana has several GM crops where field trials are pending including rice, cotton, wheat among other grains, he said. Putting to rest doubts about safety of GM trials, Dr. Panchbhai said that regulatory framework in the country was as stringent as any other developed nation and proper measures were taken before any crop was approved for field trials or environmental release.Introduction of GM crops would also help in improvement of groundwater levels, the scientists said."

Also, during the year 2015, the board had filed 46 cases against the violators in the special environment courts at Kurukshetra and Faridabad , out of which 24 cases have already been decided against the violators.The board has already engaged the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) to monitor the seasonal rice stubble burning in areas where the crop is grown. It has now decided get the incidences of burning of wheat stubble monitored through HARSAC for the year 2017 in 10 major wheat growing districts of the state.It has sought the daily report from HARSAC in the form of satellite imageries and other remote evidences on the activities captured in the state for effective monitoring and enforcement purposes. Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imaginary reports/data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis for effective monitoring, comparison with other states and implementation of enforcement measures.In a recent meeting headed by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on this issue, it was decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project. A spokesman of the board said that the government or panchayat land would be explored for setting up of the project and storage of biomass. It was also decided that agriculture department would formulate a scheme for reaper, raiker and bailer on the best terms like in Punjab , to provide financial assistance to entrepreneurs for purchase of the same or to be purchased by its own agencies."

The state requires around 12 lakh tonnes of pulses annually while it produced only 9.42 lakh tonnes in 2015-16, creating a deficit of 21.8%Many states, including Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan, Maharashtra , Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, are ahead of Odisha in terms of pulse production. Organizing a workshop here on Friday, the state agriculture department said it has set a target to enhance the pulses production up to 13 lakh metric tonne by 2018-19 by taking up pulses cultivation in rice fallow areas and following methods like crop diversification, inter-cropping and mixed cropping. ""Biotic and abiotic constrains, crop loss due to pest attack, physiological limitations, lack of quality seeds, bio-fertilizers and irrigation facilities are some of the key constraints in pulses production in Odisha. We are trying to enhance production by addressing the difficulties in a phased manner,"" said agriculture secretary Manoj Ahuja.Union agriculture secretary Shobhana Pattanayak emphasized increase in pulses production in the country. ""India is the largest producer, largest consumer and the largest importer of pulses in the world. Many countries like Canada, Mozambique and Australia are looking forward to supply pulses to India but we have to be self-sufficient in production and reduce dependence on others,"" Pattanayak said."

Average yield potential of Co-51 is 2650 kg an acre.This variety was released by Directorate of Plant Breeding and Genetics of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, during 2013, sources in the Agriculture Department said.CO-51, being a fine grain variety, offers the advantage of being a non-lodging variety, a characteristic which is very much required for kuruvai. It has the preferred plant characters such as broad dark green leaves which leads to higher photosynthesis, medium height (90-100 cm), broader leafs (2 cm width) and lengthy panicle. Each panicle bears on an average 250-300 grains, with a panicle length of 23 to 28 cm.The variety has better resistance to green leaf hopper, brown plant hopper and paddy blast disease.Co.51 variety with white medium slender rice is good for cooking and has high a milling percentage of 69 per cent and head rice recovery of 63 per cent.The Department of Agriculture has stocked about 34 tonnes of CO.51 certified seeds in the agricultural extension centres in the Kuruvai growing blocks of the district including Lalgudi, Andhanallur, Manikandam, Musiri and Mannachanallur, the sources said.Meanwhile, P.Viswanathan, president of the Tamizhaga Eri Mattrum Attru Pasana Vivasayigal Sangam, has urged the new government to initiate talks with the Karnataka and Central governments to get Tamil Nadus share of water in the Cauvery so that farmers could take up kuruvai cultivation this year. Over the past five years, Tamil Nadu was not able to get adequate water for kuruvai in the Cauvery affecting kuruvai cultivation in about 16 lakhs acres in the state, he said."

The association wants the government to ensure that the rice milled from procured paddy is not diverted to other markets by private millers for monetary advantage.There have been several instances of fraud by millers, says Babychen Mukkadan, general secretary of the association. Three millers in Kottayam were blacklisted for fraudulent practices six months ago, he said.Under the arrangement of Supplyco for paddy procurement, paddy is lifted from fields by millers at an agreed rate. Supply checks the quality of the paddy prior to its transport to the mills. But the rice from the mills is lifted by ration wholesalers. Because of the absence of a government mechanism to evaluate the quality of rice at this point, several millers indulge in fraud, he says.Mr. Babychen says that some millers get cheaper quality rice from neighbouring States and dispatch it to the PDS. Uma and other good varieties of paddy are cultivated in Kuttanad and Palakkad. Though Supplyco officials are expected to monitor the post-procurement process, there have been instances of corruption, resulting in rice of lower quality reaching PDS outlets, he said. The association has approached the Vigilance Department for an inquiry.Millers refute chargeThe allegation is absurd, says M.P. Antony, Managing Director, Kalady Rice Mills Consortium. The quality of rice at the retail outlets could be examined by anyone, he says.Milling is done under the supervision of Supplyco officials, said another representative of the rice mills, on condition of anonymity. Paddy is stocked in separate godowns and strict quality control is maintained. But often, the rice lots are not removed on time, resulting in rice piling up at mills even as the commodity remains in short supply at the retail outlets. Such a situation could have led to allegations of fraud, he says.Say millers get inferior quality rice from neighbouring States and send it to the PDS."

He addressed the media after review meeting with the civil supplies officials from all the districts.A committee will be constituted to review the laws pertaining to civil supplies, so that repeat offenders cannot go scot-free.Mr.Rajender also informed that the varieties of fine rice being given through public distribution system has been narrowed down to three from six, namely, BPT, Sona Masuri, and Samba Masuri. Arrangements are being made to apply the mid-day meals scheme to college students also. The staffing pattern in districts too was reviewed in the meeting, in view of the creation of new districts, he said.Also reviewed was the procurement of paddy in this Kharif season. The minister said it is now state governments responsibility to procure paddy, as the Centre has stopped the levy rice. Measures are being taken to streamline the online transfer of amounts, without much waiting for the farmers, he said.It has been decided to procure 30 lakh tonnes of paddy this Kharif, as against the 15 lakh tonnes procured last Kharif. A new system is being introduced by which the diversion of vehicles transporting PDS rice to fair price shops will be intimated through SMS to the local body members, a statement from the department said.Warehouses which are unfit for storing of paddy will be discarded, and new godowns will be deployed in their place.Deepam schemeAdmitting that the distribution of cooking gas under the Deepam scheme could not take off as expected, he said efforts would be made to award gas connections in saturation mode. Out of the targeted 20 lakh connections  10 lakhs of which were granted by the Centre  only about eight lakh connections were issued.

A farmer displays the order in his field near Ambur. Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe delay in settling dues for sugarcane crushed last season has left hundreds of farmers in dismay. Financially hit, the sugarcane farmers say they are in no position to take up cutting this season.Like the Vellore Cooperative Sugar Mill at Ammundi, the Ambur mill too has not settled the dues for sugarcane supplied last crushing season. With the price per tonne last year being Rs. 2,550, farmers registered with the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said the mill is yet to pay Rs. 300 per tonne till date.The Ambur mill has issued cutting order for the forthcoming crushing season. But farmers said they do not have the money to pay for labourers, and cannot borrow as they were already facing mounting debts.Ramamoorthy, a farmer in Kammavanpettai said, I supplied 150 to 160 tonnes of sugarcane to the Ambur mill last season. I am yet to receive the pending amount of Rs. 300 per tonne. This year, I have raised sugarcane on more than 1.5 acres of land but how can I bear the cutting cost for labourers without the dues being settled?Farmers said that they will have to pay Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 per tonne for labourers as cutting cost. Apart from this, they will have to give one kilo rice and Rs. 25-30 for cooking for each labourer.While the government bears the transportation cost, the farmers said they end up paying the lorry driver. Our family has been supplying sugarcane for the mill for close to 30 years but this is the first time that dues have not been settled for nearly a year. In the previous season, the pending amount was settled in six months, he added.D. Kumaran, another sugarcane farmer, had supplied 110 tonnes of sugarcane last season.The mill officers told us that the bills will be settled before Pongal but nothing has happened till now, he said.It is a different problem for another farmer, K. Anbazhagan of Saduperipalayam in Tiruvannamalai district, who had supplied 60 tonnes of cane last season. The mill had diverted the cane to another mill and I am yet to receive the full payment, he said.There are farmers who had borrowed up to Rs. 1 lakh to meet the cutting cost, and had also taken the governments interest-free loan for planting. As the dues have not been settled, the farmers could not repay the loans on time. The interest rate has shot up to 14 per cent now, he said.An official of the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said at a Minister level meeting, it was said that the dues will be settled before Pongal."

Yes, I am referring to the burning of 32 buses in Bengaluru after simmering protests over an inter-state Cauvery water sharing dispute spiralled into mob attacks with fringe groups taking over control. Industry body Assocham estimated that in a matter of just two days, the riots and strikes resulted in economic losses of Rs 25,000 crore. The Bengaluru riots are manifestations of a river dispute taking sinister emotive turns following our failure to spare a thought to initiate logical corrective measures to prevent the water crisis from snowballing into uncontrollable proportions. Otherwise, despite the promotion of Digital Transformation as a panacea for our economic woes, the very edifice of our social harmony will be shaken to the core by wars over waters. Solutions for the latter need much more intense, focussed and determined groundwork. Mere powerpoint presentations downloaded through the click of a mouse or grandiloquent grandstanding from an elevated pulpit will not suffice!Nearer home in Andhra Pradesh we, too, should be on our guard and read the writing on our very own wall! Our rivers are now shared with Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Odisha and Telangana - the last being an erstwhile brother transformed into a rival thanks to political machinations. Being the last state before the rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal, we are prospective victims of 'upper river chauvinism'. Thanks to our geographical positioning, we have no option but to be at the 'receiving end'. Therefore, even if truncated AP does gets dotted with Bengaluru /Silicon Valley clones, let us not forget, in our moments of euphoria, that we would still be sitting on tinder boxes if the following two trends are not addressed to immediately:i) The increasingly strident notes of demagoguery on issues like special category status, new rail zone at Vizag, bauxite mining, Kovvada nuclear plant, Amaravati etc.ii) The future water wars, both inter-state and intra state that are bound to upset the socio-economic equilibrium of our state.The recent calls for all possible disruptions to economic activities remind me of the observations of David Selbourne , the British political philosopher and social commentator, in his book ""An Eye to India"". In 1977, he anointed India as the ""largest demagoguery"" in the world. Today, that very rabble rousing on the above two issues is bound to derail a nascent Andhra Pradesh even before it takes off. It is time we sink our party differences, for which we have paid (and are still paying) a heavy price through the bifurcation of our state in 2014!The shape of things to come could well be indicated by the observations of a former superintending engineer of the Polavaram Project, K Haranath. He has cautioned that Andhra Pradesh, the rice bowl of the country, will turn into a salt creek with salinity seeping into both the Krishna and Godavari deltas once the five barrages proposed by Telangana are completed. Telangana, which has reservoirs with capacity to store 206.5 tmc ft, was planning to construct reservoirs to hold 250 tmcft more in the Godavari basin. Once these proposed barrages are constructed, there would be no water for the Godavari delta.Near the Odisha border, the AP government has not been able to construct a barrage at Neradi over Vamsadhara river although its foundation was laid five decades ago. The construction of the barrage is the real solution as AP can then use 16 tmcft of water instead of the existing 8 tmc ft of water. In the absence of clearance from Odisha, AP has been forced to construct through the side weir. In the case of Vamsadhara and Jhanjawati projects (near Vizianagaram), though AP experts feel that inundation will be restricted to only 106 acres, Odisha is apprehensive that huge land will be inundated after construction.The above examples are only a few of the umpteen manifestations of the deep rooted mistrust between neighbouring states when they should be partners in progress instead. Let us Telugus not get carried away by demagogues raking up issues listed above in (i) for their own political mileage. Let us be magnanimous in according due credit to the present Government of AP, for taking the first crucial bold step of interlinking of Godavari and Krishna rivers through the Pattiseema Lift Irrigation Project (PLIP). This should mark the beginning of a journey of a thousand miles, literally, for inter-basin transfer of water between as many as 30 rivers all over the country. At the risk of sounding parochial, may I remind readers that this proposal was first mooted in 1972 by Dr KL Rao, the Union irrigation minister who was also a decorated civil engineer?We cannot shelve off everything till the 'promised big take off' through the Rs 16,000 crore Polavaram project. Whatever be the initial ground failures of PLIP, we cannot afford to lose any more time in the welter of intellectual debates raging for over four decades. There have been breaches in the Pattiseema. But is it the time for the public to press the panic button and join the chorus of fence sitting demagogues eagerly waiting for every such failure to give them ammunition to unseat the government? Each failure is a learning experience in any bold new and pioneering effort towards self reliance, at least on the agricultural front that has always been the forte of Andhra Pradesh.In a democracy marked by demagoguery, the mistakes always get highlighted and the good work either ignored or underplayed. Briefly, the benefits of the PLIP are:i) Four major rivers in AP have got interconnected - Godavari-Krishna, Krishna-Pennar, Pennar -Tungabhadra.ii) With Godavari-Krishna linkage, about 17 lakh acres including 13 lakhs in Krishna delta (Krishna, Guntur and Prakasam districts) will get assured irrigation water for two agricultural crops round the year . Farmers need not depend on the monsoons and wait till September to sow seeds. They can start cultivation by July or August. This would enable them to do harvesting before November which is the month of choice for cyclones to hit AP coastiii) AP government proposes to divert 80 tmc ft of water it saves from the Krishna river reservoirs (Nagarjunasagar and Srisailam) to the dry Rayalaseema region.Even if there are apprehensions from environmentalists, the above should be good reasons to go ahead in making the Polavaram project a success.

This is our airport!"" at White House staffers as they tried to help American reporters position themselves to film Obama's arrival.The outburst was caught on camera, in an awkward prelude to face-to-face talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his American guest.Both leaders are eager to smooth over their differences and find areas of common cause as they seek to bolster their leadership credentials both abroad and at home.The incident was not a first for China, Obama said during a press briefing with""We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing. That they have the ability to answer questions,"" he said, adding ""we don't leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips.""The differences are also on display in discussions with his Chinese counterpart, he said.""When I bring up issues like human rights, there are some tensions there that perhaps don't take place when President Xi meets with other leaders.""Kerfuffles over press access are common in China, where the ruling Communist Party sees the media more as a tool for forwarding its political agenda than an independent check on governance.The country tightly controls its journalism, regularly censoring reporting on issues it deems sensitive or unflattering.Its approach is particularly apparent in, where a suffocating security presence is designed to avoid any disruption and protect China's large political and financial investment in the summit.Nevertheless, Obama took the tarmac incident in good humour, noting that the travelling White House juggernaut can be intimidating for any nation.""Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries,"" he said.""We've got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars, a lot of guys. You know, if you're a host country, sometimes it may feel a little bit much."""

Photos: S.S. KumarThe festival of harvest is round the corner but the festivities are yet to catch up in Puducherry.The incessant rains that lashed in November end and December 2015 have dampened the festival spirit this year.Sale of sugarcane, earthenware and even clothes has come down drastically when compared to last year.Farmers coming to Puducherry to sell sugarcane are in for a ssurprise. There are not many buyers and it has affected their business badly. Farmers from Sirkazhi in Chidambaram are hoping that the sale would increase by Thursday or Friday.We reached Puducherry on Monday night. We have not been able to sell sugarcane since morning. If people do not buy, we will suffer huge loss. We have to stay in Puducherry till Saturday and our meals are dependent on the sale of sugarcane. If we do not sell any, we will go hungry, said Vishwanathan, a farmer from Sirkazhi.However, political parties are doling out freebies before the pongal celebrations in their constituencies. Each household in Muthialpet received two sugarcane free of cost. Congress State secretary P.M. Saravanan is distributing sugarcane to every household in Muthialpet at his own cost. We have purchased 25,000 sugarcane to distribute to every household, he said.On the other hand, mud pots which were once essential elements in Pongal festival celebration are slowly losing shine. On the day of Pongal, mud pots are used to boil rice with milk outside the house thanking the Sun God. A turmeric plant is usually tied around the pot and sugarcanes are offered.But, these traditional practices are slowly fading away. People no more use mud pots to boil rice and milk. The changing lifestyle and less interest in following traditional practices have led to huge loss for potters.The pots which were made for Pongal were destroyed during the rains. The government has not compensated them for the losses.Earthenware are bought from neighbouring villages of Cuddalore, Marakkanam and Villupuram and sold in Puducherry. There are four to five varieties of pots available at the market. Due to rains, the price of the pots has doubled. The pots which cost Rs. 15 are now sold at Rs. 40. We will not be able to sell the pots if they are so expensive, says Lakshmi, who sells earthenware at Kosakadai Street.Seventy-six-year-old Saraswathi, who has been selling pots for the past 45 years, complained that the sales have come down drastically over the past 10 years. I dont see any improvement this year, she says.Five to six generations of her family have been selling pots at Kosakadai Street.The Goubert Market always bustling with activity does not reflect the festive mood. The cloth merchants are disappointed.Every year, the sale for the festival starts from January 1. This year it is very disappointing. We hope that it would get better by Thursday, said Ramanathan, a cloth merchant in Goubert Market."

Though celebrated over five days, it gains a sombre and serious tone on Laxmi Pujan day. The right mahurat, complete ensemble of fruits, sweets, diyas, clay idols of Laxmi and Ganesh , flowers and crackers become the focus of every household. As it is the goddess of wealth who is worshipped, the right time becomes paramount.Though the entire day has an auspicious feel to it, astrologer Anil Vaidya says that puja should be performed in the evening. ""Laxmi, Ganesh, Vishnu and Kuber are to be worshipped on this day,"" says Vaidya and adds, ""Rushabh sthir lagan between 6.41pm and 8.40pm is the best time. Many people traditionally perform puja during 'pradosh kaal' which is between 5.46pm and 8.20pm. Those who find it difficult to offer puja during this time can also worship between 6.30pm to 9pm as there is an auspicious presence of Guru and Chandrama,"" he says.Businessmen and traders prefer the late night mahurat which is called 'uttar ratri lagan'. ""For those who perform puja after midnight, 2am to 3.30am is the Labh mahurat,"" Vaidya adds. He advises sun worship and chanting of Gayatri Mantra and wearing pink and yellow colours on Diwali day. Rahu kaal is between 4.30pm and 6pm and this is not an appropriate time for worship, he says.Though amavasaya is considered as an inauspicious thithi, Diwali which falls on a no moon night is an excellent day for puja. ""However, it is not an auspicious day for opening of new stores or starting a new project. For that padwa, which falls one day after Diwali, is ideal,"" Vaidya says.Even the prasad offered to the goddess of wealth is specific. ""As per the scriptures, naivedhya to be offered should comprise of items which get a 'jaali' like anarsa, ghewar or Mysore paak,"" says women priest Swati Paranjape. Keeping puffed rice (laiyaa) and batasha in puja and sprinkling puffed rice in every corner of the house bring prosperity, Paranjape says.Sound and light are an integral part of Diwali. ""Tej and naad (light and sound) are the two forces that unite this universe and together we see them in the form of Mahalaxmi,"" says astrologer Prabodh Vekhende. ""This is a festival of light and we burst crackers to drive away Alaxmi or daridrata as we term it. That is why a loud cracker or a Laxmi bomb should be burst after the puja,"" he says."

The rice which the tribals get under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) is not enough to feed the family for the entire month. We demand the state governemnt to consider the seriousness of the matter and take every possible steps to ensure tribals dont consume mango kernel in future, said Majhi.The former Nabarangpur MP alleged that during their inquiry at Sipijodi it was found that the villagers don't get any job under the MGNREGA and those who have worked under the central job scheme have not received wages for the past six months.Not a single villager at Sipijodi have been provided land under the Forest Rights Act (FRA). Of the 58 families only 18 have been provided houses under the Indira Awas Yojana (IAY), he said. The tribal leader alleged that the healthcare system has completely collapsed in Kashipur block as there is only one doctor for over 1.5 lakh population. ""If our demands are not fulfilled then over two lakh tribals will stage dharna at Bhubaneswar,"" Majhi said.Among others, senior Cogress leader Bhakta Charan Das, Koraput MLA Krushna Sagaria and Laxmipur MLA Kailash Chandra Kulesika attended the rally.However, senior BJD leader from Rayagada and Rajya Sabha member Bhaskar Rao brushed aside the Congress allegations describing it as a political gimmick by the national party having an eye on the coming rural polls.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has always worked for the welfare of the tribals and for his good works people have voted him for the fourth time as the chief minister of the state.

We had then used VAM [a fungus thats applied as biofertiliser]. The latent benefit of this is evident right now. Besides, the Uma rice grain that we used this time is an upland variety, suitable for our soil conditions, said agricultural officer Lissymol J.Vadakkoott, who extended all technical support to the Samithi.Sreenivasan  president of the paddy collective and patron of the Udayamperoor Jaiva Karshaka Samithi, which has brought nearly 10 hectares of land in the area under organic vegetable cultivation and opened a shop, Udayasree, to sell the produces directly procured from farmers  said it was not enough to practice organic farming. Thanks to severe atmospheric pollution, the showers bring along toxic metals like led that contaminate the soil. There are other heavy metals, too. New methods have to be evolved to ward off their adverse impact. We are now seeking remedies for this, he said.Panchayat president John Jacob said efforts would be made to bring unused plots in the panchayat under organic farming. E.S. Jayakumar, development standing committee chairman, said if the panchayat once boasted some 800 acres of pokkali fields, there was no pokkali farming now. The authorities also said that they would spare no effort to make available land for construction of a permanent office for Krishi Bhavan."

It was unclear if the official, whose name was not immediately clear, knew that Rice was a senior official and not a reporter.The same official shouted at a White House press aide who was instructing foreign reporters on where to stand as they recorded Obama disembarking from the plane.""This is our country. This is our airport,"" the official said in English, pointing and speaking angrily with the aide.The U.S. aide insisted that the journalists be allowed to stand behind a rope line, and they were able to record the interaction and Obama's arrival uninterrupted, typical practice for U.S. press travelling with the president.A White House spokesman and China's Foreign Ministry both did not respond immediately to requests for comment.The altercation occurred out of sight of Obama, who greeted ambassadors and other officials before the presidential motorcade pulled away with Rice.The incident is an illustration of the image-conscious ruling Communist Party's efforts to control the media as its seeks to orchestrate what it hopes will be a flawless event.China has taken extensive security measures in preparation for the G20 summit opening on Sunday.On Saturday, many roads and shops in Hangzhou were deserted and shuttered in the usually bustling city with a population of 9 million.The Chinese government has broad control over domestic media and prevents many foreign media outlets from publishing in the country, including by blocking their websites.Obama has raised issues of freedom of the press on previous visits to China, which insists that media must follow the party line and promote ""positive propaganda"".Foreign reporters are often physically prevented from covering sensitive stories, but altercations involving foreign government officials are rare.Rice met Chinese dissidents before her last trip to China in late July, when she held talks with President Xi Jinping and other senior officials."

On the other hand, millet, which are not labour intensive crop, did not disappoint me. Most of us in our village now have millets for entire year, said Mr. Majhi.Ranjitha Digal, a woman farmer of Biringia village in Kandhamal district, has similar experience to share. Although this years volume of millet production did not match our expectations, it was not a disaster like paddy during this drought year, she said.Farmers from Kandhamal, Deogarh, Mayurbhanj and Rayagada shared their traditional knowledge and practice of growing millets in their backyard here at a State-level workshop on Millets for food and nutrition security and food festival organised by NIRMAN, a voluntary organisation, and Millet Network of India on Thursday.Millets grown in uplands are very low water consuming crops. According to a study, 4,000 litres of water is required to grow one kg of rice while millets grow without irrigation.There has been a decrease in the amount of operating millet farms over time. This decline of millet production is one of the key factors behind the dismal hunger and malnutrition status in backward regions. According to government statistics, millets and other traditional crops used to be grown on 5.49 lakh ha of land in 1978-79, but the area of these crops has come down to 2.01 lakh by 2012-13, said Prasant Mohanty, Director of NIRMAN, which has been working to revive millet crop for years now.Mr. Mohanty said: Women, who have diverse assignments in a family, undertake the stressful labour intensive process of de-husking millets. Owing to the absence of suitable primary processing technology for de-husking, farmers do not get proper value of millets.The government needs to promote millets, which have huge nutritional value, in mid-day meal and other integrated child development programme, he demanded, adding that efforts are needed to create market link for the crop."

58f57fada3d24b0b70c21f0c,Feeding 1.5 million children every day,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/feeding-15-million-children-every-day/article8052893.ece,2016-01-01,"ost talk about entrepreneurship and food in the current Indian context revolves around food tech: an array of mobile applications that customise both eating and delivery experience.That conversation, however, tends to exclude the potentially enormous market that exists in food manufacturing where quality control and economies of scale are equally important.The third role model featured in the Jagriti Yatra is Akshaya Patra, a trust based in Visakhapatnam that has managed to tackle one of the worlds largest feeding programmes  the mid-day meal scheme  and become a major partner to governments in nine states.Akshaya Patra started by feeding 1,500 children in 2000. The idea evolved from a principle it sought to fulfil from the Hare Krishna movement: that nobody around a 10-mile radius of a temple should ever go hungry.Supreme Court rulingIn 2005, a Supreme Court ruling mandated that every child who went to school should get a hot nutritious meal. It gave rise to what we now know as the national mid-day meal scheme. Since they already had experience in conducting similar programmes, Akshaya Patra entered into a public-private partnership model with the Andhra Pradesh government where the government provides raw grain, rice in this case, and monetary help.Though the Andhra government initially figured it only had funds to provide two items  like sambar and rice  Akshaya Patra decided to scale up the model to provide an additional third item like curd or a sweet dish.Technologically, this soon proved to be a challenge. From 1,500 meals a day, Akshaya Patra was asked to scale up to one lakh meals.We had to change the process which till then only involved manual cooking and the only solution was to turn to technology, explained Sriman Satya Gaura Chandra Dasa, president of Akshaya Patra Foundation, Hyderabad. We explored all existing technology and found that there was nothing that could scale up to producing one lakh meals a day. So we had to think about our own solutions to improve the existing technology.It wasnt long before Akshaya Patra was asked to provide mid-day meals in some locations in Rajasthan and that proved to be a different challenge.Rajasthan has a mostly wheat-based diet and that means that for one lakh children at least three lakh chapattis need to be produced, said Mr Dasa. Again we explored the technology market and found that the fastest machine could produce 1,000 chapattis an hour. So we had to sit with the manufacturer and improve the machine till it can now shoot out about 50,000 chapattis in one hour.For cleaning rice, Akshaya Patra collaborated with Swiss company Tetra Pak to import a machine that cleans rice faster.Akshaya Patra now feeds 1.5 million children in 10 states across 24 locations. Though it is a trust and may not necessarily work for profit, it plans to expand its business by speaking to various state governments.For improving quality control, it has set up four labs across the country to test cooked food products to check for their nutritional value and safety.Recently, we received Rs 50 crore from the Tatas exclusively for innovation, said Niskinchana Bhakta Das, head of the Visakhapatnam production unit.Aside from testing food, the funds that Akshaya Patra received also go into a gamut of technological innovations. Chief among these are thermo-insulated delivery vehicles that keep food hot until they reach schools and a gravitational kitchen model that drastically speeds up the process. Most of these innovations are funded through grants but some of the trusts income is also reinvested into innovation.Akshaya Patra follows a centralised model where food is prepared in one location and transported to schools in various locations through its custom-built vans. Mr Das says this is the major reason it has chosen to focus on urban or semi-urban areas. Only two of its 24 locations across India are rural and it requires a decentralised model.The problem with outsourcing to different centres is that it becomes very difficult to control quality, he said.Decentralised modelThis reflects the problems faced by various state governments who follow a decentralised model, where preparation of food is handled at individual centres. The results are often disastrous. Two years ago, over 70 children died in Rajasthan as a result of poor quality mid-day meals.Immediately after that incident we had a lot of requests from state governments, like in Goa and UP, to come there and provide meals, said Mr Das. There is also an opportunity in Tamil Nadu now since Akshaya Patra did stellar work in feeding people during the floods despite not having a kitchen there.But rather than wait for requests, Akshaya Patra actively seeks avenues to expand. We see a lot of opportunities in Gujarat where we already have four centres, said Mr Das. There, along with a grant, the state government also provides land and links us with a donor. The other major opportunity for expansion is UP.Though Akshaya Patra has a history of serving meals to large groups, its worth asking why similar models have not been replicated. One problem, says Rajesh Haldipur, a senior executive from PwC in Mumbai who is part of the yatra, is that such solutions will have to overcome vested interests.Akshaya Patra produces meals at Rs 8 per child. There may be others who inflate that amount to a lot more. After the Supreme Court ruling, every school has a mid-day meal scheme and a lot of those contracts may be given to vested interests who dont want private players to come in, he said.Akshaya Patra nearly signed a deal with the Maharashtra government during the Ashok Chavan regime but after he was removed following the Adarsh scam, that deal went cold.Till the Central government introduces stringent world-class quality control as a prerequisite to operate a mid-day meal scheme, private parties may often find their route blocked, said another yatri. Will it take another tragedy such as in Rajasthan for things to give way some more?Akshaya Patra follows a centralised model where food is prepared in one location and transported to schools through custom-built vans"

The division bench consisting of justice KK Sasidharan and justice B Gokuldas was hearing the habeas corpus petition filed by one M Pandiyammal seeking the court's intervention to produce 13 people belonging to kurava community by saying that they were illegally detained by the Kanyakumari police.Pandiyammal said that the group of kuravas, including women, was in the illegal custody of Mandaikkadu police in Kanyakumari for 63 days from April 29. ""During the detention, police acted high handedly. They sexually abused the women by touching their private parts. They gave them just a plate of rice gruel. They tonsured the heads of children. Due to the illegal detention, they were unable to exercise their franchise in the election,"" the petitioner claimed.Police filed a counter saying the contention of the petitioner was false and no person was under illegal detention.Besides, the Kanyakumari government medical college hospital dean filed a medical report saying that as per the court's directions, people including Gopal, Selvaraj and Velu were examined. The examination revealed that some of them were experiencing physical pain. They have been advised to continue their treatment, the dean's report said.Following it, the bench directed the individual to file replies to the police counter."
58f580117be9e01a17c9b2ac,"Food for thought, and some for history",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Food-for-thought-and-some-for-history/articleshow/53379860.cms,2016-07-26,"If it's a south Indian household, it's got to have MS chanting Suprabhatam in the background as the family sips filter kaapi from steel tumblers, right? And we all, as a clannish compulsion, eat thayir sadam every single day, right? But what if that was not always so? What if we tell you our forefathers had a different breakfast/lunch/dinner menu and that they didn't really gorge on idli and dosai like we do now? Well, much of what we eat in Chennai, today, is a give and take of influences from as far as Greece, tracing a pattern of the ups and downs of the spice route, of the early British settlers, and the later requirements of affluent Chettiars... Some of the dishes that we order without a second thought today, have traversed a fascinating history down the food route.""Till the Brits started the plantations, we didn't know what tea and coffee was, and dutifully drank pasumpaal (cow's milk). But the Brits made drinking tea and coffee fashionable. Again, it was a very gradually acquired taste, frowned upon by good 'desi' types who only drank milk back then. And so, our famous kaapi drinking habit is an imported one."" Geeta DoctorThere was absolutely no culture of eating out. Lunch was served between 9.30am and 10am. And that is how the tiffin culture started in Chennai  way back during the times of the early settlers  as a stop-gap arrangement between lunch and dinner. So those working in the factories and offices would need something snacky to eat. ""That is how, idli, dosai and vadai became the staples down south,"" says Geeta Doctor, freelance journalist and food writer, adding, ""I am not saying we did not eat them before that. We did, but not as an everyday dish. The credit for popularising these dishes goes to the Udipi Hotels. Of course, there were others later, like Dasaprakash, and Woodlands Drive-In where tiffin time was about meeting up, without the family objecting to eating out  a place where young people would not be seen as being 'wild' for eating out. The Udipi hotels were the first to 'serve' idlis/dosais/vadais in portions outside of the home and this serving of two idlis with a variety of chutneys and sambar became a staple. The cooks were Brahmins from the Udipi Mutt, and that sort of made it food fit for the gods back then, it sanctified these three-four items associated with that hotel.""'Where does the dish Chicken 65 come from?' was what Amitabh Bachchan asked in the first season of KBC. Tamilians were perhaps the only ones who screamed the right answer in unison. There are more theories about how we 'own' this dish. One says AM Buhari of the Buhari chain of hotels, 'invented' the dish in 1965. One aunty suggested the name of the dish came about because it took 65 days to prepare the marinade... or maybe, it was the 65th dish on a longish Army menu card... or did the name come about because it was made of chickens which were exactly 65 days old? Yet another story is that the chicken was marinated with 65 red spicy chillies, and hence the name. And well, are you man enough to down something that fiery (aambala singam da) and all went with it? Well, whatever the story is, we still have it on the menu everywhere down south. We. Own. It!... brought to us the railway mutton curry, essentially a Bengali dish of a curried gravy with mutton and vegetables. Today, when you order it in your favourite Nungambakkam restaurant, note that this dish is a variation of what originated when the British Raj colonial-era upper crust (that travelled first class in trains) desired to eat. It was a non-fussy preparation, that involved bunging everything into a pot and letting it simmer for hours as the train traversed the length of the country, and hence, ideal as a train preparation.We, Tamilians, didn't enter Earth slurping on thayir sadam. The dish came much later... it was almost in the early 40s that we discovered the art of mixing it all, and packing it together with a dollop of pickle for that tickle on the palate. So much so, that today, every five-star hotel discreetly places a bowl of the dish bang in the middle of even a Continental food festival. ""Much of our food habits today were also defined by our forefathers' travelling habits. When the railways came in, and people began to travel, they realized that they had to eat food at the stations (""Shiva, Shiva! Enna sollarel?""), or take something packed from home. And that made thayir sadam quite the hero of 'eating out', even as you ate homemade,"" says Geeta, and adds, ""Till then, thayir sadam wasn't perhaps a standalone dish; it was the last course of a meal, but on the train, it was an easy thing to eat, and quite flavourful, too. Soon, variety rice also came about  as people discovered rice could be mixed with veggies and spices and packed into a lunch box to be carried wherever they went.""There was never anything called the curry and rice in our forefathers' menu, ever. There was, however, a man called P Venkatachalam, who decided to mix all the masala we use, bottle it, and export it, as he discovered how much the Brits loved this masala. ""If you look at our cooking, we never have one set of masalas for all, but he sort of mixed it all up back then and created the curry powder, which went to Britain, and spread all over. Today, even here, we serve a dish, which was never part of our milieu to begin with  the curry rice,"" says Geeta.If it weren't for us taking appalams and papadams on train journeys to add crunch to our variety rice, the others would never have figured out what it was, loved it, taken it to their respective countries, and made the simple papadam a Conde Nast traveller's itinerary must-try.It is considered a 'Madras preparation' the world over, and is still a proud dish on all upper-crust menus in town. But ever considered how it came about as you relish a hot bowl? Here's how: Famous clubs back then served a mix of food cooked for the British upper class by the Indians. The mulligatawny soup came that way  prepared quite the way a south Indian would make rasam, but with milder spices, and more suited to the British palate. The clubs served a soup, a main course, and a dessert  which was often a rice pudding, or a thicker version of paal payasam, if you'd have it, laughs Geeta. The soups also came the railway route. The catering was done by the Anglo-Indians, but the makers of those dishes were very much we people.So, that snacky tidbit you order was never our invention either. Neither is the bread-butter-omelette that all bachelors gulp down with tea at the ubiquitous stalls all around town for breakfast or lunch. These dishes also came up the railway route, via the Anglo-Indians who catered on trains. They had the Indian cooks mix Indian spices and veggies as they do for their own mince pie versions. The bread, with the omelette packed into it, was also a creation from back then.We adapted a Greek rice dish, and made it ours! ""The biryani, which we've sort of stamped as our own, is essentially a Unani dish, and is more in culture with north India. But we've adapted it to our palate, with what is available here. Today, there are so many variations of the biryani available all over the state, that we never question its origin,"" says Bangera, and adds, ""Today, at our hotel, I make buttermilk panacotta  I'm taking an Italian dish, and adapting it to our current trends. What is south Indian cooking, but a clever mix and match of rice, lentils, vegetables and spices? You can create anything you want with those, and the creativity of a cook now, if liked by many, can become 'our' dish in the future. So, the food scenario is evolving all the time, and I am sure our ancestors did the same  they just made the best use of what was available to them, with what knowledge of cooking they came across.""The Marathas who ruled Tanjore for about 12 odd years are the ones who gave us those twists on sambhar we all love to call 'Chettinad' style of cooking  the pitla, the rasavangi... dishes that had just that extra punch of the tangy kokum and chilli, but made pretty much the same way we make sambar. They also left us with the 'poli' that sweet roti... But research reveals an interesting theory. Dr Suresh, an archaeologist, says the sambhar was really a Maratha preparation which we slurped up, and not the other way round. It was named after Sambaji, the son of the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji. Apparently, the royal scion was so hungry one day that he couldn't wait for the royal cooks to cook him anything. So, went to the kitchen himself and prepared dal in the Maharashtrian way he knew. And lo... Sambaji had made sambhar for the first time!""At our hotel, we serve something called the Chennai Chowder. It is created for Chennai, using local spices and herbs. It's popular, and is going to stay on the Chennai culinary map forever. I look at everything from the perspective of Chennai, and Tamil Nadu. The chowder is a very American dish, but at the end of the day, it is just a way of cooking, and we produce the same using indigenous ingredients. That's how food evolves everywhere; there are no barriers, and nobody to say this is mine. In Nepal now, they consider the coconut pudding as their creation. So, cuisine has boundaries now, and it must have been the same 500 years ago, too,"" opines Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola."

A thali can contain as many as 21 ingredients for Laxmipujan and can cost anything between Rs 50 to Rs 100.Vijaya Patil , a homemaker, said the essential components of the puja thali for the Laxmipujan are unbroken rice grain, kumkum powder, incense sticks, camphor, coconut, betel leaves, gold and silver coins with images of holy Hindu symbols (Om, Swastika or Shree symbols) and some prasad in the form of fruits or sweets. It must also have a hand bell, an aarti-diya.She said that she always prefers home-made thalis, however, these days; one can find beautifully decorated readymade aarti thali ingredients available in the market in a variety of different designs.There are readymade ingredients for the puja thali, saving a bunch of time for the family. Otherwise one had to keep track of the all the ingredients and it would be frustrating if an item or two gets missing. These thalis are perfect if you find yourself running out of time to make one yourself, she said.While a vendor of the puja thali ingredient on Mahadwar road said that, it can cost up to Rs 50 or Rs 100 depending on the size of the thali. If you buy the expensive one, it will have the higher quantity of the ingredients, while the cheap one has little, but necessary ingredients."

To that end, it is offering several incentives including discounts on seeds of the new varieties purchased from the government and subsidies on every tonne of crop produced.The government has announced a subsidy of Rs 8,000 per tonne of paddy produced with seed varieties that are less than 10-years-old. While this is a subsidy for grain production, farmers have also been offered better discounts and incentives for buying newer variety seeds from the agriculture department. While seeds of certified high-yielding paddy varieties will be sold at a discount of Rs 10 per kg, pulse seeds of varieties less than 15-years-old will be offered a discount of Rs 25 per kg.""Farmers need to have bought seeds of the variety ADT 49 (released in Ambasamudram) from the agriculture department and produced the grains of that variety,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal. ""The discounts on the seeds are also attractive because paddy seeds usually sold at Rs 24 per kg will cost only Rs 14 per kg and pulse seeds which cost Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg will come down by a sizeable Rs 25 per kg, giving farmers an Rs 500 subsidy for a hectare,"" he said.Besides ADT 49, the agriculture department is promoting six new varieties of pulses - which include CO7 and CO8 (released in Coimbatore) for green gram, CO(RG)7 for red gram, CO6 and VDN 5 for black gram and CO(CP)7 for cow pea.Five of the six varieties, released in Coimbatore in the last decade, are believed to be suitable for the district's soil and climatic conditions and have additional benefits too. ""For example, CO7 gives a yield of Rs 900 kg per hectare and is a bunch variety which all matures uniformly, making it labour-friendly,"" said an agriculture officer. ""VDN 5 is also resistant to yellow mosaic virus,"" she said.Experts say such initiatives are critical to promote newer varieties. ""Farmers hesitate to try out the new seeds because they are too attached to age-old varieties. Often traders also reduce the farm gate price for grains of new rice varieties,"" he said. ""So in situations like this, a subsidy is advantageous.""""The newer variety have guaranteed germination, easily achieve optimum population per square metre, have a good yield and are resistant to yellow mosaic virus, all of which the varieties which are over two decades old don't enjoy,"" said head of TNAU's pulses department, Kannan Babu.The farmers, however, are divided on this issue. While Oothukuttai-based farmer, D Deivasigamani, says newer varieties tried regularly by him are more pest resistant and give him as much as 300 kg more per acre, other farmers doubt the new varieties. For example, Maharashtra-based farmer Subhash Palekar, the father of zero budget farming, says promotion of new varieties is a conspiracy to make farmers dependent on seed and fertilizer selling corporations. ""The new varieties which call themselves hybrid and high yielding do not produce seeds for the next season of cultivation and require only store-bought fertilizers, making the farmer dependent on store-bought items. When our soil and weather do not change every year, why should the seeds we plant change?"" he said during an earlier interaction with TOI."

This year also, a selection of exotic praline and cranberry sweetmeats is seen in shopfront displays.Mithai shops commonly use mawa, cashewnut paste, dried fruit and nuts, or chocolate as a base and then add different flavours or fillings to each. These are then shaped into moulds. The original favourite 'ukdiche modak' made of rice flour is not readily available off the shelf except the odd restaurant.In the bustling lanes of Thakurdwar, connoisseurs seek out small shops which work a perfect balance with the sugar content. Tuesday evening, the cooks at Swastik Dry Fruits kept bringing out large thaals of anjeer, kesar, orange, rose, strawberry and Cadbury chocolate modak. Ranging from a modest Rs 440 per kg to Rs 600, these were far more palatable than those at a famous Maharashtrian branded store nearby that curiously uses Glucon C to sweeten its modaks.Morbiwala nearby also lays out a delectable array of kiwi fruit, rose, anjeer and chocolate costing up to Rs 880.Residents of Bandra-Khar flock to Regal Plus at Pali Naka for their annual modak treat.

Regal's sweets in milk, mawa, chocolate and dried fruit cost between Rs 680-1,300 per kg.

Owner Pushkaraj Gaikar says that this season, his wife and mother have been preparing the sweets at his apartment home rather than handing the task to his chefs at the restaurant.

Seniority-based promotions should be given to revenue employees.Though the Revenue Minister had assured them that all these demands would be considered positively, he failed to keep up his promise and hence the protest, the revenue officials said.In neighbouring Tuticorin district, 355 revenue employees went on mass causal leave on Thursday as part of the protest.NagercoilOver 85 per cent members of the Tamil Nadu Revenue Officers Association went on mass casual leave in Kanyakumari district pressing for their 23-point charter of demands, said V.

Their demands included giving up direct appointment of Deputy Tahsildars, filling up of vacancies in the ranks of District Revenue Officer and, Deputy Collector by offering promotions, setting up of a special centre for land survey training in every region and regularising the services of temporary employees in election and special programme implementation sections.Mr. Kannan said the association was pressing for a compensation of Rs. 10 lakh for those affected during raids to check smuggling of ration rice and river sand.He regretted that the government had not issued a GO even on the demands that were accepted by it and announced in the assembly.Out of the total 312 revenue officials from the ranks of Office Assistants to Tahsildhars, 265 went on mass casual leave and 20 officials were on long leave."

Gurushankar, vice-chairman, Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, said that the easiest way to improve ones health was to watch what you eat. Your body is your temple and food is an offering.Prescribing a fibre-rich diet for keeping ones body agile and fit, Mr. Ravi cautioned that a lot of junk food was masquerading as health food in the market. People should decide between a passive and active life, he said, elaborating that being active meant that one should not accept anything at face value. He reminded the audience that man was the fastest animal on land beyond a distance of 30 miles and he was followed by elephant and camel. You are optimised to be a long-distance runner and it is up to you to decide whether you are going to lead a healthy life all through or a long life, spending the last 10 years in a wheel chair with diapers, he said. It would be possible to gain control over life by increasing the level of being active by 10 per cent.While insisting that vegetarian diet provided the necessary strength and energy, Mr. Ravi said, Vegetarians in India do not eat vegetables. According to him, a rich diet should have more of vegetables, pulses and fruits, with rice sprinkled on them. Two things  heart beat and percentage of body fat  mattered for a healthy body and the moment you start working on them you will feel younger.Fit people not only looked younger but were really younger metabolically, he said and wanted the participants to look at the body as a sustainable eco system in which good bacteria thrived. Warning against the use of antibiotics, Mr. Ravi said that one of the worst health issues  obesity  was a result of overdose of antibiotics.Dr. Gurushankar explained how the present medical infrastructure was inadequate to cater to the health care needs of the future, and said that prevention was the best way to avoid going to a hospital.

The AIADMKs traditional vote base comprises mostly women. The party is led by a woman leader in Jayalalithaa. And the party founder MGRs charisma and the two leaves symbol still get votes in rural areas.If the Jayalalithaa government has, as promised, relieved 1.54 crore women of drudgery till now, will it fetch the ruling party votes enabling it to recapture power?Interaction with women voters in a few localities in the city revealed that the women are happy with the freebies. The women admit that the freebies, each worth about Rs. 5,000, have certainly improved their lives. And they have no problem with the working of the mixies and grinders, which they received three years ago.Mallika, a resident of Otteri, is a house help and the head of a large family, says: The mixie and grinder are of immense help,Ask her and her neighbours if they will vote for the ruling party in return, you only get chuckles. My husband is a great fan of Kalaignar [Karunanidhi], she says.Meena, a house help from Chindadripet, said she found the freebies to be of much help and is all praise for the present government. She also has in her house a colour TV and a gas stove given during the DMK regime.But many others lost their household items, including the freebies, in the recent floods. Their essential concern lies in rehabilitation and beneficial schemes that will help them in the long run. We cant say if freebies will influence our voting choice. As long as they are all useful products, we are happy, says her neighbour.Saraswathi of Doomingkuppam in Santhome said that since her ration card was not listed she was unable to get the freebies, though most of her neighbours did get them. She also wont say if she will vote for or against the government.Till last year, 1.54 crore families with rice ration card were covered for the free mixie, grinder and fan scheme. We were unable to finish it on schedule due to the rains in the flood-hit districts. We hope to do this by Pongal, said a senior civil supplies official.Like the present government, the previous DMK regime had distributed 1.60 crore colour television sets by spending Rs. 4,000 crore. To top it, the then deputy chief minister M.K. Stalin was banking heavily on Self Help Groups (SHGs) as officials made him believe that the SHGs were a trusted vote bank. Mr. Stalin gave enormous thrust to the SHG movement. None of it worked. The DMK lost even the Opposition leader post in the Assembly.Game changerFreebies really have not won elections. It was MGR who last won successive elections. The previous DMKs Re-1 rice scheme was launched [in 2006] and it was a game changer. It changed the political economy of food and agrarian relation by taking away the control over food. Still, the DMK lost the [2011] elections, points out J. Jeyranjan, a developmental economist.The Dravidian parties ruling the State alternatively, however, continue to expand the populist schemes. The voters, though, like to keep them guessing. Recent political history shows they vote for the ruling party in by-elections, but vote it out in the Assembly elections, he says.(Additional reporting by Anjana Shekar and Abrar Sultana)Beneficiaries of the free mixie, grinder and fan scheme admit it to be of help"

The cultivation of paddy had declined considerably in the kharif season and now there is no cultivation of paddy in this rabi season.During the 2014 kharif season, the paddy was cultivated in 1.5 lakh hectares against normal area of 2.13 lakh hectares. Incidentally, the paddy yield had also declined to 8.2 lakh metric tonnes due to the drought. In 2015 kharif, the paddy was cultivated only in 88,000 hectares against 1.1 lakh hectares. Out of the cultivated land, only 35,000 hectares was fine variety paddy. But, the production was very less due to bad weather.Now during this rabi season, the paddy is hardly sown in any part of the district due to depleting water table. Only few farmers have sown paddy for their own food requirements in some hectares.The steep increase of fine rice (old variety) ranging from Rs 4,000 per quintal to Rs 5,000 per quintal became a cause of concern for consumers. Similarly, the fine rice (new) was costing Rs 3,200 per quintal to Rs 3,400 per quintal. Last year, the price of new variety rice was costing only Rs. 2,600 per quintal to Rs 2,800 per quintal and old variety at Rs 3,500 per quintal to Rs 4,000 per quintal.The traders said that the rice prices increased with the decline in the paddy production following the drought. They said that the rice price may even reach Rs. 5,500 per quintal in April and May.However, the sources in the Civil Supplies Department said that the government was planning to procure fine rice from UP, MP, Maharashtra, Chhasttisgarh and Bihar to stabilise the prices here."

Customers are ready to dig in their plate of aromaticand hotAt Tunday Kebabi, on the opposite side of the single lane, the scene is no different. Embers are burning and from within the ashes rise soft, succulent kebabs. A few steps ahead, crossing Akbari Gate, at Mubeen's, food lovers are outpouring on the street past the exquisite varieties of Mughlai cuisine and chicken dangling off skewers.A little further at Pata Nala, the aroma of Idris's 'pulao' wafts through the night air beckoning its many connoisseurs. As food keeps coming up, the night has only begun.Decades old and with centuries of secrets unravelling in every bite of their exquisite dishes, these food outlets in the Old City have been dishing out Lakhnavi delicacies year after year and night after night each Ramzan. Thousands of people across religions and age pour in to the old and narrow lanes of Chowk that turn into night-long food havens especially during Ramzan.Even over a century, the sumptuous taste and the quality of the food has left an indelible mark on its patrons. The secret, the owners unanimously say, is the personal touch they give to the food and service.The oldest outlet here, established by Haji Abdul Raheem in 1890 and now manned by his five great grandsons, 'Raheem's Kulche Nahari' is a scene of epic gluttony every night. More so when rozedaars come here after iftaar. The cacophony of noises is subdued in the 'oohs and umms' when steaming nahari is brought to the dining tables.""We five brothers have each a designated duty, be it manning the counter, picking up grocery and spices or supervising the kitchen, all of which we personally look into. That has kept the quality alive since the time of our ancestors,"" comes the humble response from one of the owners, Mohammad Osama.As Ramzan comes in, cauldrons of mouth-watering nahari, biryani, girda, qorma and the likes begin to be brewed since early morning, a cooking ritual to be completed by mid-afternoon.""The nahari spices are cooked in their own aroma for several hours a day in advance, after which the gravy is induced and cooked over slow fire for hours,"" explains Osama, who says that the recipe is not hidden but the taste has not been dittoed by anyone.Maintaining the distinct quality of their soft and juicy kebabs since 1898-99, Tunday Kebabi uses charcoal to cook the meat which gives a kick to its loyalists. A recipe that has been a secret within the family, it is what owner Mohammad Rizwan says was launched by his handicapped grandfather, popularly called Tunda (Urdu for being without an arm), for the Nawabs.""The formula is a secret that brings in all the charm. Others can go ahead to make better kebabs but cannot produce ones with the same taste,"" says Rizwan.There is a beeline of food lovers from evening and all through the night at 'Idris ki biryani', founded by Mohd Idris who came up with the small outlet at Pata Nala in 1968. Cooked in milk with Arwa variety of rice and malai, owner Abu Bakr, Idris's son, shares how the addition of mutton bones uplifts not just the exquisite taste but also the calcium content of the dish.""It is pulao we make here in Lucknow but people have started calling it biryani. Ever since my father started cooking the pulao in the traditional way, we have maintained the method and the taste,"" he said.In Ramzan, the quantity of milk is doubled and the 'zaiqa' (flavour) increased. ""It takes three to four hours to get the pulao ready so we begin early from 6am. We cook small quantities of a kg or more at a time to maintain the taste and heat and it takes not more than 20 minutes for it to finish,"" said Abu Bakr, adding that it is the heavy use of garlic that adds to the flavour and removes the raw smell of meat.At Mubeen's, that started in 1973, every item, from spices to rice to the meat and fresh produce are all personally checked by family members every day.""During Ramzan, the first cook comes in at 5am and stays till 3pm, after which he is replaced by the second cook. This one works till after iftar and is then followed by a third cook who stays and serves till sehri is over,"" explains Shoeb Rizwan. From nahari kulche to pasanday kebab, chicken and mutton handi and stew, the outlet has continued to give its customers more than their demand, tripling its output during the nights of Ramzan."

A decision was taken to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell to state fair price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) from the procurement chain.This has been done by adopting the Centres scheme of Decentralised Procurement (DCP) of foodgrain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and Public Distribution System (PDS). But not all States had switched to it.A finance department report forwarded to the State Food and Civil Supplies Department last month had pointed out major lapses in Maharashtras paddy and rice procurement and warned that a rice scam like the one that occurred in Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh was in the making if the millers and the FCI were kept part of the chain any longer. All three States have still kept FCI as part of the procurement chain.Senior officials of the State finance department told The Hindu that a report has been pending approval. The report points out procedural lapses in the existing process, in which paddy procured by the State is sent to a rice mill and the rice is stored in the FCI godowns and later supplied to the PDS shops.The miller was dependent on FCI for verification while he himself was supplying poor quality to pass the verification scrutiny. We had strongly recommended the procedural lapses be corrected earliest, said an official.The State cabinet approved the DPS on Tuesday allowing the State to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers to meet the need of PDS and fair price shops. The scheme will be implemented from March 1, and the responsibility of rolling out the scheme has been left to the State Adivasi Vikas Mahamandal and the State Marketing Federation, and monitoring will be done by district authorities.Under the DCP scheme, the States undertake the responsibility to procure foodgrain, store it scientifically and distribute it through Targeted Public Distribution System.Currently, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala are procuring rice under the decentralised procurement scheme.

In a report tabled in the assembly on Friday, it said mismanagement in purchase of items for the canteens cost the state exchequer Rs 5.69 crore.Prior to purchasing automatic machines to make four lakh chappatis a day in 15 zones, the Chennai Corporation did not study the performance of the machines. Its own technical analysis committee found the output and required quality were not as per the specification of the agreement in November/December 2013. By then, the corporation had paid the contractor Rs 1.33 crore. After a showcause notice three months later, the contractor promised to refund the amount if he cound not to rectified the defects. He neither corrected the defects nor refunded the sum.""No legal action was initiated against the firm except issue of a showcause notice till date (May 2015),"" the CAG said. The corporation did not even include a warranty clause in the agreement thatb put it at a disadvantage. The non-functioning machines meant the corporation had to spend an additional Rs 22.2 lakh to procure ball cutter, chappati-pressing machines and compressors when it realized it was not possible to cater to the demand by manual operation with the help of self-help groups.While the canteens provided hygienic food cheap and enjoyed huge patronage, the audit in Chennai, Coimbatore, Trichy and Tirunelveli corporations and nine municipalities revealed they were opened without proper surveys. ""Corporations failed to assess the required manpower,"" the report said. Purchase of wheat flour from TUCS without following the prescribed procedure resulted in excess expenditure of 30.85 lakh. Purchase of other raw material at open market rates cost Rs 2.78 crore.While little budgetary support was provided, barring supply of rice at 1/kg, the local bodies had to bear the differential from their own funds. The excess expenditure incurred for the canteens impacted the total deficit of Chennai and Tirunelveli corporations by 5.78% and 18.6% in 2013-14, the CAG report said.In its reply, the government said the sum spent should not be termed deficit in respect of Coimbatore, Trichy and Tirunelveli corporations as it was ""a social welfare scheme for maintaining community public health and not a commercial venture."""

It also has properties to repair damaged root tissues of various agriculture crops, thereby increasing productivity.This application of Trichoderma has been discovered by National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI) after five years of research. The institute has also got patent for this application in US, Europe, Germany and Britain. After successful field trials of rice in Shillong , Banthara and some parts of UP, the institute has submitted the report to the Union ministry of science and technology for implementation. ""An NBRI team led by scientist Aradhana Mishra has found the new application of Trichoderma, which is first of its kind in the world,"" said NBRI former director CS Nautiyal.""Agricultural practices, especially in paddy cultivation and usage of chemical fertilizers, is a big source of methane emission resulting in global warming.

For many the festival evokes fond memories and of grand rangolis with gobbemmalu, bhogi mantallu (bonfire), bhogi pallu (a manner of blessing children), making and feasting on pongal, listening to the devotional songs sung by Haridasulu and offering them rice or similar donations, revering the Gangireddu (decorated and worshipped ox), sweets, new clothes, gifts, feasting, family, friends; generally indulging in a grand holiday.The 'big festival' or more aptly known as the peda panduga in Andhra, Sankranti is a harvest festival that has people from all over the state and country heading back home for the festivities.Traditionally the festivities stretch over three or four days, each day marking the traditional festivals of Bhogi, Makar Sankranti (Pedda Panduga), Kanuma and Mukkanuma respectively.Three days of festive fervour take over the entire city. This festival, also called Makar Sankranti celebrates the entry of the Sun into Makar Rasi (Capricorn). From this day onward, the sun begins its ascent and enters the Northern Hemisphere.This movement of the sun denotes the end of winter, and more significantly - the beginning of Uttarayana, and the commencement of an auspicious phase in the Hindu almanac. The day itself is considered very fortuitous.In the month preceding Sankranti, the Hindu month of Dhanurmasam, women draw beautiful rangolis and put the 'gobbemmalu' between them. Gobbemmalu are the balls made of cow dung which are decorated with turmeric powder (pasupu), red vermion powder (Kumkuma), flowers and with different types of grains. Women sing traditional songs and dance around these rangolis. These gobbemmalu are then dried and used as fuel. Bhogi, the last day of Dakshinayana is celebrated with the traditional Bhogi Mantallu, or bonfire, lit early in the morning. Along with wood, dried cow dung cakes are consigned to flames. It signifies the end a phase and the beginning or fresh start to a new chapter.In the evenings, young children are showered with a mixture of flower petals, Jujube berries (Bhogi pandulu) and coins to ensure their wellbeing, ward off an evil eye and invoke blessings from elders. Sweets in generous quantities are prepared and distributed. On the main day, Sankranti, sweet pongal is made and offered to the Sun.On Kanuma, the third day, the cattle which work in the fields and contribute to a generous harvest are decorated, worshipped and fed pongal.A tradition in Andhra, which is not seen often these days, is 'Bommala koluvu'. It is the showcasing of dolls (generally replicas of gods and goddesses) for three days commencing with Bhogi; similar to the tradition in Tamil Nadu during Navaratri.This tradition dates back to the era of King Janamejaya (a decedent of the Pandavas); when his son, King atnka in order to appease Lord Vishnu and beget a son, had a display of dolls put up during the Sankranti festivities (believed to be Lord Vishnu's favourite festival). Children were invited and gifted with sweets. Continuing the tradition till this day, in many households women and children arrange the dolls in aesthetic, thematic fashion and invite neighbours and friends.The idea of putting up koluvu is symbolically associated with ushering in the Uttarayanam with all the gods and goddesses assembled in the house, in a manner of ensuing their blessings and protection for the whole year - till the next harvest.According to Mrs. C Suneetha, such activities not only keep children happily busy and creatively engaged, it also introduces them to family traditions and teaches them about culture and customs.Uma Chodavarapu"
58f58a797be9e01a17c9c054,Architect gets sweet deal for mango farmers,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Architect-gets-sweet-deal-for-mango-farmers/articleshow/52876513.cms,2016-06-23,"Bengaluru: What could an architect possibly have to do with mango growers? Help them build their dreams. That's exactly what Atul Johri is doing. Short-changed by middlemen who buy their produce for dirt cheap prices, Channapatna mango growers were getting a raw deal all this while. But not any more, thanks to Atul's Tulsi Farm Initiative.Once based out of Bengaluru, Atul, 48, moved to Channapatna around nine years ago to work with local lacquer artists. He bought a farmland in Tagachegere, a village known for its mango groves. As days passed, Atul learnt about the many issues mango growers faced, especially because of unscrupulous middlemen who'd eat into their profits. He heard stories where farmers were pushed to sell their land to make ends meet.According to Atul, natti, the local variety of mangoes cultivated in Channapatna, is not just cheaper but also healthier. This is because these mangoes are plucked along with their stems which helps preserve their freshness; they are ripened using rice hay. ""Naturally grown mangoes can never acquire the uniform yellow colour that we see in artificially ripened fruits,"" says Atul, adding chemicals like carbide and ethylene are used to artificially ripen fruits which can be harmful for those savouring them. Channapatna farmers, though, were unable to get any profit for their pesticide and chemical-free produce.Once Atul took up their cause, better marketing and direct selling made a big difference to the lives of these local farmers. Atul used his contacts in Whitefield to spread the word in apartments about the locally grown natti variety of mangoes. Using the Tulsi logo, farmers can now directly reach out to customers. ""Also, at Rs 150 a kg, they offer a competitive price when compared to the retail outlets in the city,"" says Atul.Lingaraj, a farmer who earned only Rs 60,000 for his six tonnes of produce last year, has been able to see his profits soar to over Rs 2 lakh this season.Krithika Chandrasekar"

Of these, 25 have already been booked.The scam pertains to farmers being deprived of benefit under the government support price scheme despite selling their produce. The probe agency has so far picked 421 glaring loopholes in the scam that is estimated to be to the tune of crores statewide. The case also bares corruption and connivance of government officials with a prominent Bhandara-based miller.Names of Savita Karemore, her husband Raju, Manik Karemore and 14 others besides office bearers of four co-operative societies have surfaced in connection with the case. Sources said that Karemore group, in connivance with government officials and others, are alleged to have pocketed the rightful dues of the farmers.It is learnt that the Karemore group, which owned around 60 hectare land and many rice mills, could produce around 2,000 quintal paddy but documents showed that it sold more than 1.54 lakh quintal to the government. The marketing federation too was aware of this glaring production-supply mismatch. The Karemores are known to be politically connected and occupy top posts in the local marketing federations.As per the government scheme, each farmer was entitled to get 1,327 and bonus of 200 for every quintal of rice which they sold to the marketing federation. The farmers are learnt to have got barely 1,000 or even less from the Karemores who purchased the paddy from them in advance and later re-sold the same under the government scheme at higher prices.The cheques issued to the Karemores bore names of fictitious persons as farmers along with fake extracts of 7/12 document as proof of their land holding. It was through this modus operandi that the scamsters tried to mislead the government where records showed different farmers benefited from various parts of the district.Additional DG, State CID, Sanjay Kumar said the accused private individuals could not have done manipulations without the involvement of government officials involved in implementation of the scheme.""Farmers who have been cheated should come to fore with complaints. This would help us nail the culprits who denied them their legitimate benefit,"" Kumar said. He, who was in Bhandara on Wednesday to supervise the investigation, said that state government has handed over the probe to CID about six months ago.Kumar said the probe so far has brought to fore shocking details of manipulations in the scheme implemented so far. ""The records showed that 100 quintal paddy was transported on a bike. Fake registrations numbers of different vehicles including auto-rickshaws were provided to show that the paddy were ferried in such vehicles by the farmers to the federation,"" said Kumar."
