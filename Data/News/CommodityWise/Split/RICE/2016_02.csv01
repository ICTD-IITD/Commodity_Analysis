More than anything, she was tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist's child.It was the one thing she needn't have worried about.Soon after buying her, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips of pills, one of them colored red.""Every day, I had to swallow one in front of him. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was sold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,"" explained the girl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It is a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an obscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure that the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with her.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was practiced during the Prophet Muhammad's time integral to the group's operations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi religious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the fighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can continue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than three dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed to be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters used to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and sometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion in order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do so.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were driven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone, whose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with apprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser's child; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping them.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing being assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant of it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some of the women's captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees observed: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who have sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern Iraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to Dr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a stunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman is between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times the rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads the Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where the victims are being treated.""We were expecting something much higher,"" he said.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first initial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy ponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to inquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not pregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was not enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the date of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a delay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to start bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room, closed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she was about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on her upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.""To make sure you don't get pregnant,"" she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her back onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Ensuring AvailabilityThousands of women and girls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the jihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In the months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a community now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from their former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were initially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent. All the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside members of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has stated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just about any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a pamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant slave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic State cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can have sex with her only after she has undergone istibra'  ""the process of ensuring that the womb is empty,"" according to the Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on the topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a child's paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued that the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence whenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one menstrual cycle, according to Brill's Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual, the Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also quotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that it was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for other means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A total of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed over three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters insisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others violated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed closely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was that women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given contraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were less versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the Islamic State's governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. ""Each month, he made me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,"" said J., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.""On top of that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, 'We don't want you to get pregnant,'"" she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the Syrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man's mother who escorted her to the hospital.""She told me, 'If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,'"" J. said. ""They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like centrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About 30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn't pregnant.""The fighter's mother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant, validating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter tired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not take her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without ascertaining whether she was carrying another man's child. Several other women reported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control by some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say medical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy were more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk's Ministry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing the treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low pregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war, it has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies  either because the attackers did not use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because they purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68 Croatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more than 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib's center has treated only 35 pregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. ""Even higher than that, if you consider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over many months,"" Dr. Taib said.""I concluded that either they did an abortion before they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions, then there would have been physical signs,"" which would have been noted by the gynecologist treating the returnees, he said. ""There were no signs.""A Fragile ProtectionThe prohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes that the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims, who dreaded carrying their rapists' children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who was kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she had been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used her as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young Yazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150 milligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she escorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and later in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own teenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the conflicted feelings she had at the time. ""ISIS took our girls as slaves, only for sex,"" Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief. ""No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.""Others described how the fighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to abort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time of her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his slave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause her to miscarry.""She hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren't looking, she spit them out,"" said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of his sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries she suffered. ""They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the woman.""A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel nauseated soon after her abduction. ""The smell of rice made me gag,"" she said.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one of the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to location and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by then befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being repeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she, too, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another couple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he knew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with her, and when he did he appeared drugged.""I was telling him: 'I'm pregnant. In your book it says that you can't do this.' He had bloodshot eyes. He acted like he was high,"" she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim of making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the surgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior suggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to abort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove her home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property's wall. ""My knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn't walk,"" she said.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was spirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out that she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her first child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.RELATED STORIES"
58f58b477be9e01a357a2d45,'Water management in rice output key to tackle climate change',http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/Water-management-in-rice-output-key-to-tackle-climate-change/articleshow/52934689.cms,2016-06-27,"New Delhi, June 27 (IANS) At a time when climate change is set to impact rice production in Asia, simple water management by farmers as an adaptation strategy will minimise the damage, an expert said.""Climate change will impact rice production in large parts of Asia, including India. Water management will be a key feature of decisions aimed at adapting to the impacts of climate change,"" Dennis Wichelns, Senior Research Fellow of Thailand-based Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI), said during the Knowledge Forum on Climate Resilient Development in Himalayan and Downstream Regions held in New Delhi recently.The event was organised jointly by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and Delhi-based IEG.According to Wichelns, improvement in water management will help in areas where higher temperatures are likely and where shift in rainfall pattern is expected.In certain areas, crop yields will increase in some seasons, perhaps in response to higher rainfall during the production cycle or with a reduction in summer days in the northern regions. In other areas, yields might be reduced due to higher night temperatures, untimely drought conditions, or submergence caused by massive natural events.According to Wichelns, improvement in water management will also help in reducing methane emissions and arsenic uptake in the rice fields.""Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. It is estimated that up to 20 per cent of the anthropogenic releases of methane to the atmosphere are generated in agriculture, largely by livestock and in rice production,"" he said.""The anaerobic conditions in which paddy rice is produced is largely responsible for the methane generation and release. Methanogenic organisms, which thrive in anaerobic conditions, break down carbonaceous materials and form methane,"" he added.Efforts to reduce methane generation and release in rice production can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission from agriculture, thus contributing to climate change mitigation,"" Wichelns said.He said rice production generates substantial amount of methane annually, thus adding notably to the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere each year.Switching from flooded paddy production to aerobic rice production or to alternative crops that are produced in aerobic conditions can substantially reduce regional methane emissions, Wichelns added.Nitrous oxide emissions can increase when switching from anaerobic to aerobic production, yet the change in production methods will reduce global warming potential.""Adopting some form of aerobic rice production will also reduce the release of arsenic from soils to groundwater, and the subsequent uptake of arsenic by rice plants."" Wichelns said.Arsenic accumulation in rice grain declines sharply when farmers switch from anaerobic to aerobic production methods. Millions of residents of South and Southeast Asia already are exposed to harmful concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. In those areas, and elsewhere, successful efforts to reduce arsenic uptake in rice will be helpful in reducing total exposure, to the benefit of many adults and children who currently consume harmful amounts of arsenic each day, he said.De-watering is the practice of removing water from the rice paddies, at least once during the season. Normally, paddies are kept flooded for the entire season, from planting to about two weeks ahead of harvest. Substantial methane is generated and released during that time.""If farmers remove the water for seven to 10 days mid-season, they can substantially reduce methane generation and release. The paddies are re-watered after the de-watering, but the methanogenic organisms will have been greatly reduced during those seven to 10 days,"" Wichelns stressed.The practice allows oxygen to reach the root zone. The oxygen is unfavourable to the methanogenic organisms, yet favourable to rice roots and thus rice productivity. Therefore, the de-watering also contributes to producing more resilient rice plants with stronger root systems, he added.Much of the rice production in South and Southeast Asia is found in the deltas formed by major rivers, such as the Mekong, Irrawaddy, and Ganges-Brahmaputra. Rice is well-adapted to these deltaic regions, many of which are characterised by monsoonal climates.""Given the important role of rice production in rural economies across much of Asia, adaptation strategies are needed urgently to ensure that smallholder farmers can continue producing rice for domestic and international markets, while generating sufficient income and ensuring that household and national food security goals are achieved."" he said.(Imran Khan can be contacted at imran.k@ians.in)--IANSik/bim"

Sankar, president, Empower, Diabetes Prevention and Education Centre, said here on Friday.In a baseline study undertaken by this centre, these workers aged 30 years and above were screened at 10 work sites in this block in a random method.Among the working classes, transport workers had high rate of diabetes. He told The Hindu that 16 percent of 82 transport workers, who were screened, were diagnosed with diabetes. Fisher folks stood next with 14 percent as 68 fishermen had been living with diabetes. With 68 salt workers screened, 13 percent of them were diabetic. Among 54 hotel workers, 11 percent of them were running the risk of diabetes and ten percent of 58 workers in shipping companies also faced a similar risk. After checking 37 traders, 30 tailors, 30 washermen, 30 workers in manufacturing industries, 27 carpenters and 29 goldsmiths, five to seven percent of each of these working categories were diabetic.The observations were made based on parameters including food intake pattern, physical activity, body mass index, level of glucose and blood pressure. Among the diabetic patients, 74 percent of them had rice all three times a day and only 21 percent of the workers were on regular exercise, he said."
58f58bb67be9e01a357a2de7,Season’s eatings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Seasons-eatings/articleshow/53026389.cms,2016-07-03,"If a time traveller somehow landed in a Goan kitchen, would she be able to tell the season from the vegetables being cooked? In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"
58f58bbc7be9e01a17c9c229,You’ve got to taste it to be‘leave’ it,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Youve-got-to-taste-it-to-beleave-it/articleshow/53026369.cms,2016-07-03,"In the land that abounds with paddy cultivation and coconut trees, the fruits of these two are often combined to make a host of lip-smacking delicacies. Prized among these is the monsoon speciality, patoleo. What makes these a prized monsoon delicacy is the fact that one of the main components of this favourite tea-time snack, is fresh turmeric leaves, which grow in abundance with the onset of the rains.There are two versions of the patoleo that are made in Goa. ""While the Catholic community predominantly uses the brown palm jaggery to make the filling, the version made by the Hindu community is characterized by a filling made using golden cane jaggery,"" says famed foodie and cookbook author Sapna Sardessai. The sweet is also associated with certain feasts and religious rituals celebrated during the monsoon season. These include Sao Joao, Nag Panchami, Shravan, the feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Ganesh Chaturthi. ""It is said that Goddess Parvati, when she was pregnant with Lord Ganesha, would experience cravings for saltless patoleo. Hence, an offering of saltless patoleo is made to the goddess during Chaturthi celebrations,"" Sardessai explains.A slightly time-consuming process, the final product, however, is absolutely worth all the effort put into the making. It starts with the grinding of rice that has been soaked for a few hours. Then one has to make the coconut-jaggery filling, which involves cooking freshly grated coconut with jaggery. ""One can also added pieces of roasted cashew nuts and raisins to the filling,"" Sardessai says. Some people also add a few pinches of flavourings such as cardamom or nutmeg. Then, unblemished turmeric leaves are washed and patted dry, getting them ready for the making process.The making of patoleo is usually a family affair, with one person spreading the rice paste on the turmeric leaf, another layering the filling in the centre and one folding the laden leaf precisely. These are then steamed for 15 to 20 minutes before they are ready to be feasted on, preferably hot.What's the secret to a good patoli? ""A tasty filling,"" says chef Moses Fernandes. He adds that the rice, essentially par boiled rice, must be ground to the right consistency. Another vital aspect is the proportion between the rice paste and the filling. The layer of rice paste must be spread as thin and evenly as possible so that the chalky taste of the rice paste does not overpower that of the delicate filling."

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter.

Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack.""

58f58c827be9e01a17c9c375,Take it with a pinch of KISMOOR,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Take-it-with-a-pinch-of-KISMOOR/articleshow/52594640.cms,2016-06-05,"What is the most favourite food of Goans? Undoubtedly, fish. So much so that to tide the fish-unfavourable monsoon season, Goans of yore came up with a perfect replacement - salted and preserved fish, known as kharem in local parlance.Mixed with a few simple ingredients like onion, green chillies, tamarind and a few more of the ilk, and roughly tossed together, the dried fish makes one of the yummiest dishes you would have ever tasted. Called 'kismoor', it is all at once salty, spicy, tangy and crunchy. A perfect accompaniment for the Goan fish curry-rice staple.Now and ThenWhere once the kismoor would have probably been prepared only during monsoon, today it has become a permanent fixture on the plate, says publisher of several cookbooks and food blogger Sapna Sardessai. ""It is most favoured with fish curry and rice and is projected all over as a Goan staple,"" she says.Salad most favouredOf the several varieties of salted fish available, mackerel, prawns and galmo (baby shrimp) are used to prepare the dish.It would be pertinent to note here that while Goans call it 'kismoor', the anglicized word for it would be salad. For, after all, it is a cold dish of various mixtures, mostly raw, with the main ingredient being dried fish.But chef Surat Naik of Nostalgia prefers to maintain the indigenous identity of the kismoor. ""I prepare salad from dried mackerel, but kismoor is prepared using dried prawns,"" he says.Sardessai does not aver by this. Whether dried prawn, galmo, or dried mackerel, the dish remains kismoor. In fact, she has gone a step further and created a modern version.""I also prepare kismoor from karela, yam and raw banana, as an option for the vegetarians,"" says Sardessai, adding that the style of preparation remains unchanged with only fish being replaced by a vegetable.Divided we taste, united we relishPreparing the dish is really very simple. All you would need is the dried variety of fish of your choice, (if prawns then ensure that the heads are removed), one onion, grated coconut, a little tamarind paste, green chillies. Roast the prawns/fish, crumble and mix with finely grated coconut and green chillies, season with a little tamarind paste, and voila!There is a small debate that crops up over the seasoning used. While Catholics say they would rather use vinegar in preparing mackerel kismoor, Hindus will use nothing but tamarind paste. On this point, Naik and Sardessai are united. No vinegar. But those of us who prepare it at home with vinegar know otherwise.In fact, keeping the basics the same it is possible to experiment with preparations to get various versions of kismoor, all with slightly varying degrees of tang and crunchiness. Hint: You may roast the mackerel on the frying pan or you may roast it directly over fire after dabbing the fish with a few drops of coconut oil.A personal favourite version prepared at my home involves grinding half an onion with green chillies and a pinch of jeera and tamarind paste. This mixture is then tossed together with the crumbled bits of dried fish, half an onion chopped and finely grated coconut. Simple heaven in all its piquant flavours."
58f58c8b7be9e01a17c9c386,How malnutrition is killing kids of a mineral-rich Odisha tribal village,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhubaneswar/How-malnutrition-is-killing-kids-of-a-mineral-rich-Odisha-tribal-village/articleshow/53125313.cms,2016-07-09,"Bamnipal/Sukinda: Between March and June this year, at least 12 children died in Nagada village, located in the forests of Odisha's Jajpur district. The underlying reason for their deaths was malnutrition, local medical authorities and community workers said.The village population is solely of the Juang scheduled tribe, one of India's ancient tribes, declared 'particularly vulnerable' by the government. For the past two months, a chicken pox epidemic has been raging in the village, with at least 35 kids displaying the typical blister-like rashes. G Naresh, an activist of Aspire, an NGO that works with school dropouts and never enrolled children in the region, told TOI that after they informed them, the local authorities made a few trips to distribute medicine. On the latest trip, doctors found several children suffering from bronchial pneumonia, which often occurs among malnourished children.A survey of children aged between 5 and 12 years by Aspire in Nagada recently showed that out of 83 kids, about a third were suffering from malnutrition, as shown by their body mass index (BMI). Another 17% were just marginally 'normal'.But why does Nagada have rampant malnutrition and why do diseases go untreated? This question acquires significance because the village is located smack in the middle of one of the richest iron, chromium and manganese deposits in the world, stretching across Jajpur, Keonjhar and Sundergarh districts in Odisha, spilling over into Jharkhand to the west. So, how come time is standing still in Nagada? The village has a population of 275 people. It has no anganwadi centre, no school, no health sub-centre, and no fair-price shop. In fact, it is not even accessible by a motorable road. Technically, the government has the village covered under the anganwadi system by making it part of the Chingdipal anganwadi  but Chingdipal is five forested kilometres away. The anganwadi and ASHA (health) workers based there are supposed to look after Nagada villagers.Adults and older children work as daily labourers in nearby mines under contractors,earning about Rs 3,000-4,000 per month on an average. The Juang grow some paddy and vegetables in small plots. They collect wild edible plants or hunt small fowls from the forest. In the absence of an anganwadi or school, children are deprived of the basic lifeline available to most poor children in the region  nutritious meals. And, in the absence of a fair-price shop, they are mostly deprived of another lifeline  the Re 1/kg rice provided by the state government.What if there is a disease outbreak, like this year? The nearest government hospital is at Kuika, some 27km away. There is also a Tata Steelmanaged hospital 18km away in the Sukinda mines area. This is where nine of the seriously afflicted kids were taken by the district medical authorities after news of the chicken pox outbreak and child deaths broke out in June.There are an estimated 10,000 members of the Juang tribe left, mostly living in the forested hills of Jajpur and adjoining Keonjhar. They have no rights over their beloved forest and they can hardly claim any right over the minerals. Should they be left to slowly perish of hunger and disease even as the country becomes a superpower?"

Retailers commonly charge up to Rs 40-50 more per kg.The announcement comes hours after the opposition questioned the government over how a large retail chain like 'Big Bazaar' was selling imported tuvar dal for Rs 99 per kg whereas the government itself proposed to sell the commodity for Rs 120.Currently, the retail price of tuvar dal in Apna Bazar is Rs 174 and in Andheri Lokhandwala is Rs 160.The Federation of Associations of APMC issued a release on Thursday to say that wholesale and retail businessmen would work together to ensure fair price.Federation chief Mohan Gurnani said the state government had convened a meeting of dal millers, wholesalers and retailers to discuss the spiralling price of tuvar dal. The wholesalers were represented by the Grain Rice and Oilseeds Merchants Association and shopkeepers by the Retail Grain Dealers Federation.""The state proposed to provide tuvar dal to organized retailers like Reliance, D'Mart, Apna Bazar and Hypercity for Rs 120 per kg which they would then sell for a margin of merely 70 paise to consumers. Similarly, wholesalers will sell to retailers for a reasonable price so they can also benefit consumers,"" Gurnani said.However, it will take more than persuasion and goodwill to convince local shopkeepers. An Andheri grocer said, ""Our price depends on quality. Imported tuvar dal is cheaper because it is inferior to indigenous varieties. Moreover once we start selling for just Rs 10 more than the wholesale rate, consumers will expect us to do the same for other dals and all commodities. Should we compromise our overhead costs and margins in this way?"""

The parents immediately brought the matter to the notice of the Kavaradi Gram Panchayat, which too, expressed its dismay.PurchaseAn official of the Child Development Project based in Kundapur said that the department purchased 99 metric tonnes of rice every four months from the Food Corporation of India to be supplied to 387 anganwadi centres in Kundapur taluk.Every month, 32 metric tones of rice were being supplied to these anganwadi centres.The officials conduct random checking of rice. But it was not possible to check every bag of rice. While 90 per cent of bags contained good quality rice, it is possible that the remaining bags might have rice with worms or substandard rice because sometimes some bags get wet, the officer said.Sadananda, Child Development Project Officer, told The Hindu that anganwadi teachers and assistants in Kundapur taluk had been directed to return any bag with substandard quality of rice or worms in it immediately and they would be replaced with bags containing good rice. He would visit the Moodu Vaalthur anganwadi and take action, he said.Other dutiesSources in the Department said that the anganwadi teachers were being put on National Population Register duty. Due to this, they had to go to enrol people.They then had to leave the anganwadi centres in charge of anganwadi helpers, which was a distraction from their main duty of running anganwadis, leading to such problems, the sources added.Official to visit the anganwadi at Moodu Vaalthur; promises action against the guilty"

But the Bihar and UP governments have no interest in providing food grains to the poor families free of cost despite the fact that it will not add any major burden on state exchequer. The governments in many states including Tamilnadu are already distributing it without charging any money. If people in UP bring NDA to power in state it will ensure free distribution of wheat and rice among poor families.""The minister said that UP government has also implemented Food Security Act since March 1 and distribution of food grains among beneficiaries will start in April. But, he said, during the meeting with FCI officials it has come to light that many initial preparations like computerized monitoring of transportation of food grains from one depot to other has not been completed in the state. Due to the same reasons, he said, there is a need to examine the process of implementation of this Act in the state to avoid misuse and possibility of black-marketeering. He said that with the implementation of Food Security Act in Up the quota of foodgrains for the state has been increased up to 85 lakh ton. He also mentioned that against the sanctioned 85 lakh ton food grain the storage capacity in FCI depots of UP is for 50% food grains.Claiming that government is enhancing capacity for food grain storage Paswan assured that no crisis of pulses will be faced in future as the government is working on long term and short term strategies on this front. He also highlighted the works of on-line feeding of ration cards, on-line allocation and complaint facilities introduced by the ministry and said that 32 states have implemented Food Security Act so far and remaining four states including Kerala and Tamilnadu, where assembly poll process is in progress, would also implement it very soon.Reacting over NDA's defeat in Bihar and political scene in UP he held it unfortunate that caste based politics still supersedes the issue of development in UP and Bihar. He announced that Chirag Paswan has been made Lok Janshakti Party's UP in-charge to mobilise dalits and youths in view of 2017 assembly polls."

However, lack of time and expertise in preparing traditional sweets has been luring Odias to throng special outlets that have cropped up during the festival. These outlets, making a thriving business by serving an array of traditional cakes and sweets, show the demand has increased several times as compared to previous years.According to the official sources, the outlets of the Odisha Tourism Development Corporation (OTDC) had on Monday sold pithas worth Rs 70,000 while the sales crossed Rs 2.19 lakh on Tuesday. ""This year the demand of pithas has gone up several times than the last year. We were forced to close the outlets for some time so that our chefs get time to prepare. We are selling three to four quintals of pithas every day. Apart from counter sales, we got a large quantity order for pithas of all varieties,"" said OTDC marketing executive, Alok Mishra.At least 20 varieties of traditional pithas are available in the shops, including the popular podapitha - a special Odia delicacy made during the festival - and arisa, kakara, manda, chhena puli, sara puli, chhena poda, karanji, patali pitha, saru chakuli, haladipatra pitha, chhunchi patra pitha and so on. Poda pitha comes with a price tag of Rs 200 to Rs 400 per kg..""The preparation of poda pitha takes a lot of time, effort and expertise. First, rice has to be soaked for a few hours then powdered. Then, dough is prepared by adding the rice powder with coconut, dry foods, cheese, sugar or jaggery and finally it is baked in an oven or a pressure cooker. In rural households it is still baked in earthen chulhas (charcoal stoves) covered in banana leaves. With most women working these days and many of them not aware of the proper process of making the pitha, people prefer to buy it,"" said Bimbadhar Behera, owner of Nimapada Sweets, a popular traditional sweet-shop in the city.Many big hotels and restaurants have also been cashing in on the Raja craze and organized special food festivals to serve traditional Odia food."

58f58f6b7be9e01a17c9c776,Hits and misses,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Hits-and-misses/articleshow/52545730.cms,2016-06-02,"The TRS had bet the future of Telangana on the slogan 'Neellu (water), Nidhulu (funds), Niyamakalu (jobs). While it paid off handsomely in the 2014 elections, two years on, tempering any euphoria over some successes are the ground realities where the government needs to get its act togetherJOBS: Vacancies pile upNot much was expected in 2014-15 on this front. The beginning of the state's second year saw the creation of the Telangana State Public Service Commission, instilling hope among the unemployed. However, to the 1 lakh vacancies that the TRS always talked about, some 30,000 more were added, with those many government employees superannuating since June 2014. Barely 3,500 posts have been filled so far, with the bulk of recruitments in the engineering wings of different departments. A notification was issued to recruit 8,000 police constables and 1,000 police sub-inspectors, and another issued to fill 500 Group-2 posts. The government has been quick to justify the slow pace of recruitments citing incomplete division of employees between AP and Telangana. Thus, the Kamalanathan Committee, tasked with the staff division, has become a handy whipping boy for the government.WATER: Full steam aheadThe irrigation sector emerged as a key area of debate this past year. The government redesigned a host of projects, followed by the chief minister, in an unprecedented move, giving a PowerPoint presentation on the government's plans for the sector. This appears to have effectively silenced the opposition parties on the subject. In fact, the government is moving with all possible speed on irrigation projects and, more importantly, on Mission Kakatiya that aims to revive a whopping 45,000 village tanks and lakes. Couple this with Mission Bhagiratha, which aims to provide safe drinking water to every household, and the TRS government seems to have done enough to receive accolades.FUNDS: Waiting game is onTelangana was never poor, it was kept poor: This has been the oft-repeated refrain of the TRS. The chief minister has said he aims to generate high revenues on all fronts. The government claims 15 per cent growth in revenue earnings through tax collection in the two years and says it has funds for all the promises it made. On the ground, however, it could do little in terms of mobilising resources. The state's annual budget of over Rs 1 lakh crore for the second year is an ambitious one, but the reality is that Telangana needs money. Its request for Rs 25,000 crore for Mission Bhagiratha is pending with the Centre. It also wants to raise a whopping Rs 50,000 crore for various projects and schemes.WELFARE: Many welcome movesThis is an area where the KCR government's claim that Telangana stands first among states in implementing welfare schemes holds good. While his government has committed to spend Rs 50,000 crore on BC welfare, schemes such as Kalyana Lakshmi and Shadi Mubarak -- which provide Rs 50,000 to a bride from BC or Muslim communities and economically backward families -- has found good purchase among people. The decision to hike the old age and widow pensions from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000 has been a success. The introduction of fine rice in mid-day meals in schools and welfare hostels has also been widely welcomed. If there is one quibble, it is the delay in fulfilling the promise of providing 12 per cent reservations to minorities. With the issue embroiled in legal tangles, the government is struggling to keep its promise.HOUSING: Delivery awaitedThe promise of a free two-bedroom house for the poor. What more could one ask for? The actual house, of course. This was a promise that helped KCR lead TRS to victory in the 2014 polls. While the government appears committed to the project, its progress leaves a lot to be desired. Except for handing over 396 houses to beneficiaries at IDH Colony in Secunderabad, there is nothing much for the government to brag about. The problem is that the government needs huge funds for the project. It hopes that NABARD and HUDCO will prove to be saviours and contractors demanding high prices will eventually fall in line.EDUCATION: Whither KG to PG edu?One of the CM's pet schemes, which is struggling to take off, is the promise of free education from KG to PG. While there are no signs of the government starting the scheme any time soon, the chief minister has announced 1,000 gurukul schools, and residential schools for under-privileged and minorities.INDUSTRY: Kudos to TS-iPASSA real feather in the cap of the TRS government has been its industrial policy, the TS-iPASS, which provides a right to clearance to investors within 15 days of submitting an application online. With TS-iPASS giving the state an industry-friendly image, Telangana was able to attract some big ticket investments in the IT sector. Led by the articulate and suave K Taraka Rama Rao, this has been one of the better performing areas for the government.AGRICULTURE: Not a rosy pictureThe less said the better about this sector. Successive droughts have broken the backs of many a farmer. The floundering farm loan waiver scheme and an agriculture department far removed from reality have let Telangana farmers down. The soaring rate of suicides by farmers have failed to move the government. The chief minister and agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy can cry hoarse that they too are farmers, but the fact remains that the ryots of Telangana have been left to fend for themselves."

Lucknow division of Northern Railways has floated a tender to outsource the job of shooing away rats from the station. The bids have come from four agencies and the one that quotes the minimum price will bag the one-year contract.It's after three years that a tender for rat control has been floated. ""It will be done as and when need arises,"" said senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), NR, Lucknow, Ajit Kumar Sinha.To keep the contract running, however, the chosen agency would need to have its performance assessed based on number of rats it shows dead in a day or a week. The agency might just present the tail as proof .It is the same as in the case of banks and insurance companies in which an owner has to show the left ear of a buffalo when insurance is sought for the dead bovine. At Varanasi railway station, where the contract was awarded to a public undertaking in November last year, dead rats are counted each time the payment is made.""The number of dead rats was initially high. Now, it has come down, at times to a single digit in a day,"" said sources. The annual contract worth about Rs 7 lakh is being awarded to keep the station free of rats. ""We don't want to spot even a single rat or else the exercise of outsourcing is futile,"" said sources.The agency will use four types of treatments. It will put zinc phosphate mixed with 'aata', 'chana daal', mustard oil, sugar and rice at all such spots where rats are seen, in the pits, parcel office, platform, canteen and offices at the station so that rats could eat the mixture. Besides, they will install glu-pads, burn 'lobaan' (gum resin) and use aluminium phosphide.Dead rats are given mass burial in a pit in the station premises after being counted and number is noted in the official register.The agency will have to go for the treatment twice a month. ""Problem with Charbagh is that once there is pest control by the NR, the rats move to 'chhoti line' (Junction) station. They have dug a trench all the way between two stations,"" said a station officer.The two stations should undergo the rat control exercise simultaneously.The 2012 contract did not yield results because only 18 to 20 rats were found dead everyday, while rest escaped. Railways, however, did not expect anything less than 500 rats found dead every day.The high expectations are not without reason, said an official. An agency which was given contract before 2012 showed 2,000 dead rats in a day. Were they all from Charbagh station? There is no evidence.Rats have for long been a major nuisance at Charbagh station. Apart from frightened passengers and hygiene concerns, what worries the officials is the fact that huge rats have made deep holes under the railway tracks, threatening safety."

The bright sun is blazing on water-starved Hittala Shirur village of Aland taluk in Kalaburagi, some 650 km from Bengaluru. Scores of people carrying pots queue up before a water tanker.Men, women and children jostle for space to fill a pot of water. Many fall down, only to try again. Bheemappa Hulambi, an elderly villager, watches them unperturbed. Though such scenes have been a regular feature him for a decade, Bheemappa says he has not seen such despair earlier. ""There isn't a drop of water in our village and we have only two options: migrate or suffer till some good rain,"" he said.This are the scenes in about 600 villages in 137 of the total 176 taluks of Karnataka, facing a severe drinking water crisis owing to one of the worst droughts since 1972. A majority of these villages are in 12 districts of north Karnataka.According to officials, district administrations have been supplying water through tankers to about 800 and several villages have been left in the lurch. On paper, a tanker visits villages every day, but people claim a tanker visits a village once in 2-3 days. ""This is the only source of drinking water. Else, we need to walk a few kilometres to a pond,"" says an elderly woman. The water scarcity has forced villagers to skip baths and postpone marriages in villages. And the situation of animals is worse. And some major cities and towns are feeling the pinch with the water level in 13 major dams nearing dead storage. ""The condition of cities is more difficult than of villages because of their size and complete dependence on dam water,"" said a senior official of urban development department. The government has issued direction to reserve the available water for drinking purpose. ""Cities, including Bengaluru and Mysuru, can be assured of supply till Juneend. Then it is all up to the rains to fill our dams,"" said water resources minister MB Patil.The primary reason for the crisis, officials say, is that 10,000 borewells in the state have dried even before the summer. This happened largely because of dry spells along with dwindling water tables and uneven distribution of rainfall past two years. In 2015, the state received 44% deficient rainfall, according to the revenue department.However, experts say the crisis is not simply a result of insufficient rainfall but an amalgamation of factors such as rapid urbanization, population growth, agricultural expansion, strong industrial growth and poor water governance.They have contributed to over-exploitation of groundwater and increased water pollution. ""Failure to act now and implement long-term strategies will deteriorate the situation and the prospect of water riots in Karnataka won't be too far,'' they warn.Some also blame the cropping patterns. Cash crops like sugarcane, rice and banana have played a role especially in Belagavi, Bagalkot and Koppal as farmers randomly drilled borewells to supply water to drying crops. ""Sugarcane is the main culprit. Indiscriminate water has been lifted for cultivating sugarcane especially in Belagavi which is facing one of worst water crisis in five decades,"" a minister said. The situation was clear in September-October 2015, but government didn't take precautions.While dedicating over 1,000 safe drinking water plants across the state recently, chief minister Siddaramaiah said, ""When we were young, we drank water from wells, streams and lakes. But now we are not getting water even in borewells.""To provide adequate safe drinking water to the population of over six crore in Karnataka, he said the government needs to spend roughly about Rs45,000 crore. ""We have to divert around 62 tmc ft water from various sources,'' he added.RDPR minister H K Patil said the government already has a plan to set up at least 7,300 drinking water plants. He said the government has set aside Rs 540 crore and asked all 30 zilla panchayats to prepare an action plan and implement it.The government has also approached Isro to map villages and identify availability of water resources.""The satellites will be able to spot water resources like ponds and lakes and collate the data for the government which will help to take steps to conserve and augment water resources. It will help to drill borewells in the areas suggested by Isro,"" the minister added.RDPR minister H K Patil said the government already has a plan to set up at least 7,300 drinking water plants. He said the government has set aside Rs 540 crore and asked all 30 zilla panchayats to prepare an action plan related to drinking water schemes and implement it."

PHOTO: M. GOVARTHANThe higher price of sugarcane is proving to be an outcome of demand-supply dynamics, in the wake of the government's decision to gift each of the family card holders with Pongal Pack consisting of 2 ft of sugarcane along with 1 kg rice and sugar, and Rs. 100.Unlike last year when a stalk was sold for Rs. 25 to Rs. 30, this time, the starting price is Rs. 40, irrespective of the girth and length.Sellers say they would still be making only a thin margin of profit.Seasonal sellers are usually middlemen who provide credit to the sugarcane farmers and procure the produce.This time, the farmers have become assertive, since the Cooperatives Department is believed to be offering them a better procurement price.This time around, farmers who used to supply sugarcanes are prepared to repay the loan along with interest instead. They are keen to dispose off their produce to the Cooperatives Department, said a seasonal seller.As a consequence, there is a drop in the number of retail sellers. For, the State Government has decided to provide 2 ft cane to each of the 1.91 crore family card holders, the sellers say.The Chief Ministers announcement also covers holders of police cards and Sri Lankan Tamil families living in refugee camps across the State. Fortunately for the sellers, 2 ft of sugarcane is hardly sufficient for even one person.Also, every family celebrating the festival in a traditional way needs two entire stalks. Hence, there is still scope for decent business, customers say."

M. Senapati at Bhubaneswar on Saturday urging the latter to initiate immediate steps to elect the new mayor.Anita Behera of the BJD had put in her papers on December 29 last after it was established that she had obtained a ration card in her name to receive five kilos of subsidised rice and wheat every month under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).Ms Behera, who had forwarded her resignation letter to deputy mayor Ajay Barik, had also resigned from the post of corporator of for which she was elected from Ward-21 of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) in February 2014.Her resignation letter will be tabled in the CMC council meeting on January 4 for appropriate action, said Mr. Barik.On the other hand, a shadow war has emerged between three city BJD MLAs  Debashis Samantray of Cuttack-Barabati, Pravat Biswal of Cuttack-Choudwar and Chandrasarathi Behera of Cuttack Sadar -- each apparently trying to get one of their own supporters to occupy the coveted mayoral post.The post is reserved for a scheduled caste (SC) woman and there are now three SC women corporators among the remaining 58-member council. Two of these women corporators come under the Cuttack-Choudwar segment, while the other belongs to Cuttack Sadar. Thus the legislators of these two segments want the mayoral elections to be held immediately. But Cuttack city legislator, under whose segment comes the ward vacated by Anita Behera, wants the mayoral election to he held after the by-election in Ward-21so that the new corporator could stake her claim to the post.Seeing this internal bickering among the ruling party legislators, the Congress  which has just nine seats in the 59-member council -- wants to drive a wedge between them by demanding immediate elections. The mayors post of the city cannot remain vacant for long, lest the civic problems in the city should mount, Mr. Moqim said."

With rising mercury, the cost of food basket is on the rise too. Due to dwindling supplies in the dry season, vegetable prices have gone up. Some items are costing double or close to it as compared to prices just a week ago.A week's vegetable supply for a family of 3 to 4 now comes for Rs300 to 350, which is more than the minimum wages fixed by the state government for an unskilled labourer at around Rs225 a day.Even as summer is making vegetables costlier, it comes at a time when rates of pulses, especially tur dal, have settled but only on the higher side. There are chances of a further increase in tur prices. Despite fresh supplies, not much respite is expected in the rates of wheat too, say sources in this business. The dry spell in the neighbouring Marathwada region is also having a slight impact on vegetable rates in the city, say a section of traders.Traders at markets like Gokulpeth and Fule market say this is the beginning, and another 20 to 25% increase in vegetable prices is expected in the days to come. A bout of unseasonal rains may make it worse, with rates further shooting up due to supplies being disrupted after that.The rates of almost all the vegetables have gone up by Rs10 a kg on an average over the last week, with Rs40/kg being the average price of any variety. However, there are certain vegetables like beans or lady fingers which have doubled. Brinjals of the smaller variety, which were in the range of Rs5 to 10 a kg are now Rs35 per kg, say traders.Sushil Shambarkar, a trader at Gokulpeth, said large part of the supplies come from other centres during summer since local sources dry up. Prices of beans have touched a high because of supply hitches at Chhindwara in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which is the major source. The rates will further go up in the coming weeks, he said.""Nagpur gets its supplies from Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Bhilai, Nashik and even Bangalore, apart from nearby villages. Some vegetables like pumpkin, coriander and cauliflower come from Nanded in Marathwada too. But supplies have entirely dried up this year due to the drought there,"" said Vijay Sonare at Gokulpeth.Nanded and other neighbouring districts contribute 10 to 15% of the total supply in Nagpur, which makes a considerable impact on the local rates, said Adul Sattar, a broker at Fule Market.On the foodgrains side, tur dal rates, which made headlines last year once again spiked by Rs10 a kg. This week tur dal was in the range of Rs132 to Rs115 with the bulk dealers. In neighbourhood stores, it is going at Rs140 to 130 a kg with some branded tur dal priced at Rs250 per kg too. ""The rates have gone up because farm produce markets were closed due to March ending. There is a possibility of some respite in the next week but rates may ultimately firm up, keeping tur dal rates at the same level,"" said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association.The tur production this year is less than last year, when tur dal was priced at Rs200 a kg, which means rates may further go up, say traders.Wheat prices are ranging from Rs2,500 to 4,000 a quintal depending on the variety. Fresh arrivals were low due to unseasonal rains in parts of Madhya Pradesh. As a result, new supply has not made much an impact in lowering the rates, said Motwani. Rice has been stable at Rs2,750 to 4,600 a quintal, he said.OUR TAKEAt present, not a single vegetable is available at affordable price. Usually in this season, price of potato and onion go down. But this year, we have no relief. The vegetables are becoming more and more out of reach of the common man. We fear that a further increase in the prices of petrol and diesel will affect the vegetable price hike moreAsha Mathur, 38, housewifeOver the past few months, we have witnessed at least 30-40% rise in vegetable prices. At a time when middle class families are already struggling with rocketing prices of cereals, the high vegetable prices are hitting the family budget hard. Lower middle class families are forced to compromise when it comes to providing nutritious diet to kids. The government needs to come up with a solution to provide relief from inflated prices of basic commoditiesManjari Joshi, 40, businesswomanWith summer approaching, prices of vegetables are only going to increase more. It is tougher for vegetarian families as green vegetables are the only source of nutrition for them. Veggies like capsicum, spinach and 'methi' which people usually prefer to eat in summer are also very costly. From cereals, potato, tomato, onion and green veggies  if everything is going to be costly, how does one expect a common man to survive?Purnima Singh, 44, teacherThe demand for fruits and vegetables is more in summer as people prefer drinking fresh juices. Such inflated prices are affecting people from all strata. This year particularly, the costs are too much on a higher side. To beat the price hike, I feel the best solution will be to eliminate selling of vegetables through middlemen. Sellers should directly buy vegetables from farmers. This will prove cost-friendly for customers as well as will be profitable for farmersResmi Umesh, 37, HeadmistressHousewives everywhere are struggling to balance their household budget due to the spiralling inflation. Even vegetables like French beans, capsicum, ladiesfinger, coriander are quite high. If vegetable price was low, it would have at least neutralized the out of reach prices of tur dal and other pulses.

The arrow went forth into space and, quivering, pierced the bosom of the ocean - 18 coss from where the brothers stood! ...Samudra retreated 18 coss from the Syadri range of mountains, leaving a long basin, as it were, thousands of cubits deep. The chasms below opened and shut again convulsively, volcanoes innumerable burst out beneath, and all around vomited forth fire, molten lava, ashes, and red hot rocks. It was as if the end of the world had come. A dense black pall of smoke and noxious vapours began to rise from the newly created Konkan, which had but a ghatka before being covered fathoms deep by the briny ocean. ...Several eons rolled by before the Konkan or lowlands won by Pareshram were explored by the ""dhangurs"" of the ghatmala with their buffaloes."" Thus goes the story of creation of Konkan. (Crawford, 1909 : Legends Of The Konkan)The first to arrive were the dhangars (herdsmen) of the ghatmala, Crawford was told by his informant, an old bhat from Chiplun. Every year they came with their buffaloes and penetrated further till they overran the payeen ghauts (foothills). Beyond that was the paradise: mighty rivers, magnificent forests of every kind of valuable timber, trees laden with delicious fruits, a coast line fringed with coconut palms, lush forage on every hillside and wild rice growing in all the valleys. Those that returned to their upland homes gave marvellous accounts of their new discovery. Attracted by these tales, the hardy mhars of the Dekkhan ventured to explore. They built there huts walled with split bamboos and red clay, and roofed them with woven coconut palms. They hired bands of cultivators from above the ghats, sudras by caste, to till the land lying all around. Vaishyas followed them and carried the produce up-ghat on bullock carts driven by brinjaris (gypsies) from the far east Dekkhan. The kshatriyas from across the ghats came thereafter. The old bhat's tale was fascinating history for Crawford.He was reading out from a pothi (old manuscript) that he had brought along and considered very valuable; valuable indeed it was, for it was one of the rare records on the peopling of Konkan. It was a tattered document, most beautifully emblazoned in coloured inks, with marginal pictures of birds, beasts and fishes. The cover made of rice straw board was eaten round the edges. It had originally been bound in crimson tinted and highly glazed kid skin, of which little remained. According to Crawford, the manuscript was as old as the papyrus manuscripts in the British Museum But what happened thereafter? For that we have to turn to Arcamone and his story of peopling of Salcete. Then came the brahmans, writes Arcamone, ""in order to teach faith to the inhabitants of this peninsula"". But they asked for themselves the best part of the Sasattana peninsula in return. The old bhat's story gives a little more insight into the dynamics of this trade-off. The settlers from the ghatmala had 'neither gods, nor temples, nor priests'; they were badly in need of these, and that is what the brahmans gave them, and in return the earlier settlers gave to the brahmans the best of their villages for exclusive abode. Dividing the whole land of the peninsula into sixty six territories, two territories were left to the primitive settlers, fifteen went to the brahmans, forty-four to the kshatryas and five to other servants or adjutants - probably meaning the shudras. We have probably just one source of information on the caste composition of the Salcete villages in the recent times: the gaunkari, from which some identification of the villages may be possible. gaunkari was a system of collective land-ownership prevalent in Goan villages. The gaunkars, the members of the gaunkari, were the early settlers in the village.Based on the gaunkari records, one village that the primitive settlers were left with was Davorlim-Dicarpale, the other could be a village on the fringe of Cortalim , which, however, is not borne out by the available records. brahmans got Benaulim, Curtorim, Cortalim, Dabolim, Dramapur, Guirdolim, Loutulim, Macazana, Margao, Quelossim, Raia, Racaim, Sancoale, Verna and Vaddem - fifteen in all. The rest went to the kshatryas. Two villages (Cavelossim, Telaulim) record sudra gaunkaris, while another two villages (Dramapur, Deusua) have sudra vangods in their gaunkaris. (Gomes Pereira, 1978 : Hindu Temples and Deities) The list and the division may not be very accurate, and stands correction. From the time when gaunkaris were constituted to the time when Gomes Pereira recorded their composition, many millennia had passed. The line of brahman villages on the Salcete map look like ancient settlements along the Saraswati river. For the connection between the two we will have to wait for some time.The opinions expressed in this article are the writer's own.

In this way, the PM had dishonoured the Sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers, even though he addressed a large gathering near the place, said Tiwari.In a press communique, Tiwari said that the PM had mentioned that 18,000 villages were not electrified after freedom and ""we (BJP) will take steps for the electrification of these villages"", but he failed to mention that the electrification of these 18,000 villages was being done under the 'Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme' started by the Congress government.On the PM's claims on fighting corruption, Tiwari said Modi had failed to look at the performances of the chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Shiv Raj Singh Chauhan, and Rajasthan, Vasundhra Raje Scindia, who were also sitting on the dais.Madhya Pradesh, said Tiwari, was facing the biggest corruption scam in the form of the Vyapam case in which about 51 murders had also taken place.

He reviewed the status of National Food Security Act (NFSA) implementation and held talks with Jharkhand minister for food civil supplies and consumer affairs, Saryu Rai.""The price of pulses is affected by the decisions of agriculture department, commercial taxes, import-export department and the department of food and civil supplies which makes regulating the prices tough especially when the production is far below the demand,"" he said.Citing previous year's example, Paswan said that as against the demand of around 226 lakh tonne the domestic production of pulse was 162 lakh tonne and out of the shortfall of 64lakh tonne only 58lakh tonne pulses were imported.""The import is done mostly by private parties and in the absence of direct government control, the scarcity leads to gap in demand supply chain and triggers price hike,"" he said.

Men, women and children jostle for space to fill a pot of water. Many fall down, only to try again. Bheemappa Hulambi, an elderly villager, watches them unperturbed. Though such scenes have been a regular feature him for a decade, Bheemappa says he has not seen such despair earlier. ""There isn't a drop of water in our village and we have only two options: migrate or suffer till some good rain,"" he said.This are the scenes in about 600 villages in 137 of the total 176 taluks of Karnataka, facing a severe drinking water crisis owing to one of the worst droughts since 1972. A majority of these villages are in 12 districts of north Karnataka.According to officials, district administrations have been supplying water through tankers to about 800 and several villages have been left in the lurch. On paper, a tanker visits villages every day, but people claim a tanker visits a village once in 2-3 days. ""This is the only source of drinking water. Else, we need to walk a few kilometres to a pond,"" says an elderly woman. The water scarcity has forced villagers to skip baths and postpone marriages in villages. And the situation of animals is worse.And some major cities and towns are feeling the pinch with the water level in 13 major dams nearing dead storage. ""The condition of cities is more difficult than of villages because of their size and complete dependence on dam water,"" said a senior official of urban development department.The government has issued direction to reserve the available water for drinking purpose. ""Cities, including Bengaluru and Mysuru, can be assured of supply till Juneend. Then it is all up to the rains to fill our dams,"" said water resources minister MB Patil.The primary reason for the crisis, officials say, is that 10,000 borewells in the state have dried even before the summer. This happened largely because of dry spells along with dwindling water tables and uneven distribution of rainfall past two years. In 2015, the state received 44% deficient rainfall, according to the revenue department. However, experts say the crisis is not simply a result of insufficient rainfall but an amalgamation of factors such as rapid urbanization, population growth, agricultural expansion, strong industrial growth and poor water governance. They have contributed to over-exploitation of groundwater and increased water pollution. ""Failure to act now and implement long-term strategies will deteriorate the situation and the prospect of water riots in Karnataka won't be too far,"" they warn.Some also blame the cropping patterns. Cash crops like sugarcane, rice and banana have played a role especially in Belagavi, Bagalkot and Koppal as farmers randomly drilled borewells to supply water to drying crops. ""Sugarcane is the main culprit. Indiscriminate water has been lifted for cultivating sugarcane especially in Belagavi which is facing one of worst water crisis in five decades,"" a minister said.The situation was clear in September-October 2015, but government didn't take precautions.While dedicating over 1,000 safe drinking water plants across the state recently, chief minister Siddaramaiah said, ""When we were young, we drank water from wells, streams and lakes. But now we are not getting water even in borewells.""To provide adequate safe drinking water to the population of over six crore in Karnataka, he said the government needs to spend roughly about Rs 45,000 crore. ""We have to divert around 62 tmc ft water from various sources,"" he added.RDPR minister HK Patil said the government already has a plan to set up at least 7,300 drinking water plants. He said the government has set aside Rs 540 crore and asked all 30 zilla panchayats to prepare an action plan and implement it.The government has also approached Isro to map villages and identify availability of water resources. ""The satellites will be able to spot water resources like ponds and lakes and collate the data for the government which will help to take steps to conserve and augment water resources. It will help to drill borewells in the areas suggested by Isro,"" the minister added.RDPR minister HK Patil said the government already has a plan to set up at least 7,300 drinking water plants.He said the government has set aside Rs 540 crore and asked all 30 zilla panchayats to prepare an action plan related to drinking water schemes and implement it."

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

Krishna Rao said that the present intensive and pest-management-based cultivation had resulted in over-production of superior cereals - rice and wheat- and neglect of the healthy raggi and other millets.He attributed the shortage of red gram during last year to non-maintenance of the critical balance between different crops including pulses and edible oil.Giving finer details of the plan to turn Andhra Pradesh into an organic farming State, Agriculture Special Chief Secretary T. Vijaykumar said noted natural farmer Subhash Palekar would train for eight days 30 farmers each from 130 clusters across the State at Kakinada this month-end on organic farming and sustainable agricultural practices.We planned to train this year about 1.5 lakh farmers, who, in turn, will inspire 50 to 60 lakh farmers to take up organic farming, he explained, adding that 30 to 40 new agricultural practices would be taught to the selected progressive farmers to restore the soil health and ensure sustainable agriculture. The government had constituted a Core Committee headed by Mr. Vijaykumar to show assured market for millet growers.There is a need for increasing the carbon content in the soil to at least 2 per cent as against the present average carbon content of less than 0.5 per cent, he said, adding that the green revolution tools will not work in increasing food production to meet the expected demand in the year 2050.Production ofhealthy milletsFood 360 Foundation President J. A. Chowdary said the next wave of opportunity would be for production of healthy millets.

Under the leadership of a revolutionary group of the Indian Communist Party, a red area of rural revolutionary armed struggle has been established in India...The spark in Darjeeling will start a prairie fire and will certainly set the vast expanses of India ablaze."" The communist mouthpiece couldn't have been wider off the mark. Nearly five decades later, barring a few ageing radical comrades and the busts of Lenin, Stalin, Mao-Tse-Tung (sic), Lin Piao, Soroj Dutt and Charu Mazumdar outside Bengaijot Primary School, Naxalbari's romance with armed revolution has given way to a dalliance with materialism.And it certainly isn't of the dialectical kind. A property broker says land prices have jumped by at least 50%, especially areas hugging NH-31. , now being widened. ""People have begun selling land in kathas rather than bighas because the prices are too high,"" he says. Prosenjit Mandal, an electronics dealer in Naxalbari's main market, claims to sell 50 refrigerators every month in summer. A liquor store stocks Black Label, Teacher's among other whiskey brands. ""But we sell Vat 69 much more. Even Sula wine is popular,"" said Sudeep Prasad.For election purpose, Naxalbari is incomplete without Matigara, another block in Darjeeling district. Following Delimitation Commission orders, the two were combined to create the Matigara-Naxalbari assembly seat reserved for scheduled castes. Parts of Matigara are as swank and urban as anything in these parts of north Bengal. Matigara has a sprawling mall-cum-multiplex, super-specialty hospitals, high-rise offices, multi-storey apartments (Life's got better, says one real estate promo) and showrooms of Toyota, Ford, Renault, Hyundai among others lined along the road leading from Bagdogra to Siliguri.In a sense, this assembly seat is about the welding of two Indias. A section of the populace has prospered in these parts but toiling in the agricultural fields and tea gardens continues to be the lot of many. Yet radical Left parties have been unable to make much electoral headway. In 2011 state assembly polls, CPI(ML) Liberation's Dipu Haldar won 2.06% of the votes. The winner was Congress' Sankar Malakar edging the CPM by 6,000 votes. Supported by Trinamool, the Congress also took Phansidewa seat.A lot has changed since then. Now in bed with bitter ex-rivals the Left Front, Congress hopes to retain these seats. But last year's panchayat polls indicate a possible tight contest between the Trinamool and Left-backed Congress. The BJP is also in the fray. The party's flags and banners, including a rare one with Jan Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee's photo, have marked their presence in many parts. During the Lok Sabha polls, BJP's S S Ahluwalia won more votes than either Trinamool or Left-Congress votes put together in Matigara-Naxalbari. The general view is that BJP will win more than what it got in 20117,351 votes or 4.46% of sharebut the saffron party will not be close to attaining its LS 2014 high. But BJP' Santosh Biswas, Naxalbari Aanchal president is optimistic. ""Don't forget we do have a gram panchayat president at Maniram in Naxalbari block,"" he said.Close to the BJP office are Trinamool and Congress offices. There's confidence, bordering on arrogance and bluster, at the Trinamool office. For the local party leaders, Prithwish Roy and Nirjal Dey, the Saradha scam is no election issue. 'Unnayan' (development) is the key word. ""People are looking at our development work,"" Dey said. Uren Barman and his wife Sumitra, working as a farm hand in the fields opposite Bengaijot Primary School in Naxalbari, say their son got a bicycle from the state. Indeed, girls riding the blue-coloured bicycles are a familiar sight in these parts. Barman also talks about getting rice (Rs 2 per kg) and flour (Rs 3.50 per kg) every fortnight from the ration shop. ""It is a great for us,"" he said. Even Ranjit Rai, a Yadav from Vaishali who runs a sweet shop near the Naxalbari station, is happy his daughter got a bicycle, distributed among Class X, XI and XII students.The Congress, piggybacking on Left, believes it can still win. ""Our alliance is working,"" said Malakar. For Congress and the Left, the outcome of the Matigara-Naxalbari, which goes to polls on April 17, will be a barometer of the tie's success.As for the radical Left, it will be about memories another day, of something barely remembered."

The Farmers Field School conducted under the aegis of Agriculture Technology Management Agency (ATMA) was handy for the department to orient the farmers about best practices. A group of farmers engaged in the fourth of the six training modules on Wednesday was, at the end, able to make out the difference between good and bad pests.They were divided into groups and asked to reproduce their observation in the field on a chart. And they depicted the paddy plant, the sunlight, the good pests and bad pests.The picture of coxynelli beetles and spiders figured among the good pests and leaf folder among the bad ones. They had collected the insects in a plastic cover from the field.Making farmers understand the utility of certain pests in eliminating bad ones so as to avoid usage of pesticides to maximum possible extent is one of the important objectives of the school, said Kulandaivelu, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Modakurichi block. The farmers are provided guidance right from the time of seed selection to post-harvest stage through the school, he said. According M. Sekar, a farmer, cultivation under SRI was economical since seed requirement as well as water usage was much lower.Also, there were many panicles in a hill under SRI cultivation, implying more productivity, he said."

Such was the ambience at Chitnavis Wada , in Mahal on Friday as it opened its doors to welcome the city. The 250 year old vada, built in the time of the Bhosale rule in Nagpur, can now be hired for holding private functions.Giving a glimpse of how an event could be organized at the charming structure, Vilas and Neeta Kale, the trustees of Sir Gangadharrao Chitnavis Trust that manages the property, gave the guests a taste of traditional Maharashtrian hospitality. The carved wooden pillars had marigold flowers wrapped around it and hanging lights from the rafters along the ceiling bathed the insides of the wada in a warm glow. ""The place is ideal for traditional functions. The wada offers a natural setting for those who have a taste for aesthetics and wish to relive the charms of a bygone era,"" said Vilas Kale. The art work on the walls, the ancient artefacts that adorn various sections of the place provide a quaint aura to the place.The food was served in the traditional 'pengat' style where guests are seated on a patala or very low stools and served. Food, served on banana leaves was essentially Maharashtrian. The menu was carefully planned too, as nearly five varieties of salads, dips and relishes occupied the left hand top corner of the leaf. Patal bhaji and kadi were served to go with plain rice and masala bhat. But the star of the meal was gola bhat, a vada made with lentils served with plain rice and seasoned with tempered oil. ""The trick is to mash the vada in the rice completely,"" explained Neeta Kale insisting that the guest enjoyed this Maharashtrian delight.The Trustees hope to attract events of 50 to 100 persons, and will provide the catering and decoration to go with the function. ""We have sufficient parking space, rest rooms and people who would serve and attend to the guest to make it a memorable affair,"" said Neeta."

Until then, I had never thought about where they came from. Ive been in a flaming love affair with them ever since. For me, chillies are the epitome of passion in cuisine. Fresh, dried, ripe, unripe, cooked, raw: however you use them, they make everything better.There is a big difference in the properties of each chilli. Green or red, fresh or dried, fried or boiled, they all have a different effect. For instance, fresh chillies, particularly if unripe, have a biting pungency, whereas the ripe dried ones taste more spicy and balanced. In Central and South American, where chillies originated, each region has its own set of local, traditionally grown fruits that differ not only in hotness but also, and more importantly, in flavour. Each variety is used for specific dishes. Removing the seed-bearing veins reduces pungency and allows the flavour to come forth. In Asia, though, there is no such fuss. If you want less heat, you simply use fewer chillies. The subtleties of flavour are added with a selection of additional spices. Indian, Italian, Mediterranean or South East Asian: whatever the cuisine, chillies blend in perfectly.Thai cuisine is anchored on curry pastes made with chillies. Thai green curry harnesses the cutting spiciness of green chillies, while red curry delivers a slower burn from riper red variants. The Chinese infuse oil with dried chillies; its a staple in their food and has become a mainstay on my kitchen shelf over the years, for when I want subtle heat in soups and stir-fries. Capsaicin, the element in chillies that makes them hot, is an irritant alkaloid found in chillies that has at least five separate chemical components. Their natural defence mechanism comes into play when chillies are pounded or pureed. They also fool the taste buds into thinking they are burnt.Every cuisine in the world has a favourite chilli condiment: the Maharashtrian thencha, the Naga mirch chutney, middle-eastern Harrissa, Thai nam pla. Could you imagine Andhra or Kolhapuri curries without chillies? Without Maharashrian mirchi thencha, Gujarati lasan ni chutney, or Bharva mirch achar? Life would be boring without Jaipurs legendary mirch pakoras and mirchi vadas, Kashmiri rogan josh, Rajasthani laal mass, or Goan fish recheado.Wild chillies were domesticated as early as 6500 BC; Spanish conquistadors carried them to Europe in 1514 and it was only in the 1600s that the Portuguese first planted them around Goa. Indian cuisine embraced chillies with fervour: they had a lot more fire power at a fraction of the volume of pepper, the only source of heat in Indian cuisine until then.So intrinsic are chillies to Indian cuisine that in many parts of India, they are the sole means to enliven simple meals of rice and rotis. For something that came to India so recently, we have so many different kinds of chillies. Beyond the ubiquitous Kashmiri and the legendary Naga, every area has a local variant. They cross pollinate easily, so are hard to classify but some varieties include Mizorams Dhani, Dharwars Byadagi, Khedas Jwala, and Kanthari, a short, ivory white, highly pungent variety from Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu.Most often a little more chilli is all it takes to transform a dish. Crush a handful in a mortar, mix in some extra virgin olive oil or butter and brush onto fresh bread or toss through warm potatoes. You will find that the natural flavours are enhanced by the heat of the chillies. They are clearly intrinsic to my cooking, so much so that I am hard put to not use them, lest people think I cannot cook without them. I wonder myself sometimes...."

Soren who was in Dumka on Thursday, said his party would launch agitation to pressurize the state government for the purpose.""Jharkhand is more affected from the liquor menace with families being victimized as earning members fall prey to it over the years,"" Soren said while talking to the reporters here.The JMM chief said Nitish Kumar did a commendable job by enforcing complete ban on liquor which must be followed by the other state governments for the larger interest of the society.""If the state government does not impose similar ban in Jharkhand, the JMM will launch an agitation for the purpose,"" Soren reiterated. The JMM patriarch has always been opposed to the practice of liquor consumption in the tribal community.As a chief minister, he had even started the process to rehabilitate tribal families which were involved in liquor brewing in villages. The block development officials had been directed to prepare statistics for providing them alternative source for generating income then. The move however turned futile with Hemant Soren not pushing much to accomplish his father's wishes.Soren, however added that hadia or rice beer consumed rampantly during the festivals and even on regular basis, should be freed from such ban. ""Hadia is not harmful as people can work throughout the day after having consumed it even without taking meal,"" Soren said adding liquor brewed from mahua etc must be prohibited.However, the ruling party which has always accused the JMM of encouraging liquor culture particularly during the elections, opposed Soren's demand. ""It is ridiculous for the party to support the ban since it has largely been dependent on providing hadia and daaru (country made liquor) to the electorate to win them over during the elections"" Sunil Soren former Jama MLA of the BJP, who had earlier been associated with the JMM, alleged."

But hunger is something that's easily addressed here. There are a plethora of options - restaurants, cafes and even kiosks  to choose from. As you walk towards the sea, there is a long line of eateries on both sides, forming almost a pathway of food stalls, of sorts. From bajji shops to kiosks that sell everything from soan papadi to sweet corn and even fried fish, you are spoilt for choice. Go on, relish some of the city's local flavours and explore the area's newly opened eateries.Chandra has been running a corn booth for the past five years. She procures close to five to ten kilos of corn, twice a week, from Parrys. ""We sell American sweet corn as our customers usually do not prefer to have the local corn that is grown by the countryside,"" says Chandra who stays in the kuppam nearby. She also procures special coal for the grill. However, the corn business is something that Chandra indulges in only during the weekends or on festival days, not during the week. ""Besides the booth, I also get paid by the Corporation for picking up garbage in the morning and evening. So, I don't have the shop open on all days,"" she smiles. Unfortunately, business is not easy. ""Money is not consistent. But that is not the point; the spark from the grill machine that we use can burn our hands. I wish I could afford one of those high-tech grills,"" she wistfully sighs.Suresh, who walks along the stretch of Beach Road, ringing a small bell on his push cart is hard to miss. He has a large glass jar packed to the brim with snowy white soan papdi. He fills a handful in a packet and secures it with a thread before handing them over to a customer. ""Our soan papdi is made with sugar, dalda and maida. I generally get the sweet from Pallavaram where it is manufactured. I get close to `200 rupees as commission for selling one kilo of soan papdi. Sadly, business isn't as good as it used to be. My sales differ on a day-to-day basis,"" says Suresh who has been in this business for the past 15 years.Masala pori  a tangy mixture of puffed rice and groundnuts with onions, tomatoes, coriander, red chilli powder and salt with a dash of lime  is a favourite snack among beach-goers. Valarmathi, who sells the masala pori out of a pushcart for the past couple of years, says that she generally steams the groundnuts at home. ""I steam the nuts every day at home and come here in the evening, when it begins to get crowded. Weekends are busy, and a lot of elderly people ask me for just the steamed groundnuts instead of the masala pori. There are many people selling masala pori and so the business is quite dull,"" she says as she prepares a serving for the customer.A gang of friends is seated in a circle at Adithya Bajji Stall, waiting for an assorted plate of bajji, which includes gobi, raw banana, chilli, onion and potato fillings. The owner of the store, Indira tempts the group with a humongous Delhi appalam. When one of them asks for fish fry, she points to another row of stores, a few meters away and says, 'non-vegkku anga ponga'. Indira who is quite diligent about maintaining hygiene standards says, ""We have Government officials who do periodic checks on the kind of oil we use. The oil shouldn't be too old, and our veggies, too, have to be fresh...otherwise they take our cylinders away. I make sure I have fresh vegetables and I change the oil every day. There is a lot of politics among the vendors here, so there is a separate row of stalls that serves only non-vegetarian food."" Her stall is open through the week.For those with a sweet tooth, Westfield kiosk, adjacent to Cozee is a good option. They have desserts like Belgium lollipop waffles, poffertjes, a traditional Dutch batter treat, and crepes that are topped with creme, ice cream and fruits. ""All the desserts are baked fresh in front of the customers, and are eggless,"" shares Remi Peter, who owns the kiosk. The maximum crowd comes during the weekends, but the place is an evergreen hit with college students. The lollipop waffle (the waffle is in the form of a lollipop) is a unique dish and is a fast-moving item. ""We shut the kiosk on rainy days. We are also planning to open a new kiosk on Harrington Road,"" says Remi, managing a long line of customers waiting for their dessert.Love sea food? Then head to Pooja fish stall that serves hot and greasy fish fry. There are close to 15 fish stalls at the beach and there are many takers for the fish fry. Kalaivani is busy applying the chilli-turmeric paste to the fish and placing them in a pan of hot oil. One can get different varieties of fish like aiyla, vanjiram, nethili, vaaval, crabs and prawns here. The most popular and fast-moving, however, is sankara fish. ""We generally get the fish from the market. Heading to the sea and catching for a day-to-day business is very difficult. We open the stall in the evening, so we go buy fish from the market before that. In our row, you can find only non-vegetarian shops,"" shares Kalaivani who also adds ginger-garlic paste to the fish before she fries them.Don't expect the beef shawarma that is popular abroad. At this kiosk at Besant Nagar you get chicken shawarma served with cabbage and carrot. ""Non-vegetarians love this. There aren't many stores selling this in this locality. We also have a small cafe where we prepare the shawarma and then bring it to the kiosk,"" shares Manika Sundaram, the kiosk manager. They also have other non-vegetarian dishes like chicken pops, drumsticks, seekh kebabs, masala fries and fish fry.A concept adopted from Thailand, this store sells ice cream as rolls. Prem Chatri, the man who makes this delicacy for you says, ""The shop is a month-old and is yet to pick up. We basically roll the ice cream and give it on a plate. We also add two flavours, and the most popular is strawberry and nutella. The ice cream is made at the kiosk, where they also have a freezer. They have a lot of people coming to the store out of curiosity. ""People want to know what ice cream rolls are, and so they come and taste it. I watched a lot of videos to learn the technique. This ice-cream is very famous abroad and is catching up in India,"" says this man from Nepal.This kiosk is always crowded, thanks to the hot jalebis that are constantly being made. Krishnan, owner of Uttar Bhojan, says, ""Our USP include jalebis and pani puri. The puri is made of wheat and is fried in groundnut oil. We try and keep the shop open even on rainy days. We just cover the shed. People love having chat during the rains,"" he smiles. They also have hot samosas, pav bhaji, sev poori and dahi papdi chat. The centralised kitchen is at Valasaravakkam from where the food is transported to the kiosk at Besant Nagar. They also have another store in Ashok Nagar. Don't miss their friendly chef at the kiosk who is happy to chat with you as he serves you the chaat.The latest rage in Chennai is the spiral potato. It was Charles and Raja who brought the idea of spiral potato to Besant Nagar. These are nothing but fried potatoes wound spirally around a stick. They also have three toppings  cheese, masala and thousand island (which actually is a sauce made from secret ingredients). ""We have been operating this store for the past one-and-a-half-years, and sell close to 50 potatoes on a daily basis. But during the weekends, we sell close to 200 potatoes,"" says Charles. They brought this machine from Vijayawada and the duo is also looking at buying another shop in Besant Nagar itself, all because of how popular this dish has become with college-goers.Perfect for summer, these coloured icy sticks are a delight to both kids as well as grown-ups. Shaktivel, who has been operating his kiosk, Madras Foods, for the last seven years, serves about seven flavours of ice golas. However, he admits that the syrup is not natural and is made out of pulp. ""The festival season is usually the time when sales pick up. The purple coloured kala khatta which is sweet and tangy is a universal favourite. We procure the ice from the Besant Nagar depot. It is made with clean water,"" says Shaktivel."

Its abolition is ""very disappointing"" as it would act as a dampener on investors' confidence.He said the situation has been compounded, because the government has withdrawn capital subsidy on other units too. Earlier, there was provision for 20% capital subsidy with a cap of Rs 75 lakh on investment in plant and machinery, apart from capital subsidy of 20% on investment in new large units with a cap of Rs 5 crore.""These provisions, too, have now been withdrawn. Despite capital subsidy and other incentives, no units were established in any sector other than food processing (between 2011 and 2016). The new scenario is very dampening for investors,"" Modi said, adding the earlier policy had led to the opening of several new rice and pulses mills, as well as cold stores.Modi said that there was no provision for interest subsidy in the last policy. The government has now introduced 10% interest subsidy on term loan, 12% subsidy for micro and small units besides 30% subsidy on sanctioned capital investment in the priority sector, and 15% with a cap of Rs 10 crore in the non-priority sector.Further, earlier, there used to 100% exemption on stamp duty, registration fee and land conversion charge, but as per the new provision the investors would have to now first pay the duty and fees, and the government would reimburse it later, Modi said.In the last policy, the government had provided for 50% subsidy on investment against carbon credit unit with a cap of Rs 15 lakh, but it has been done away with, he added.Besides, provisions with regard to incentive worth 50% of investment, with a cap of Rs 15 lakh on land/shed for small and micro units, as also 25% subsidy with maximum of Rs 30 lakh on investment in land/shed for large, medium and mega units have also been abolished, Modi said, adding one year exemption on payment of EPF of employees in units employing more than 100 workers has also been discontinued."
58f599017be9e01a357a3dd4,A note of thanks to mother nature,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/A-note-of-thanks-to-mother-nature/articleshow/53936081.cms,2016-08-31,"Inherent in every culture is the sense of awe and thanksgiving for creation. In its earliest form, religion was a means for human beings to explain the inexplicable ways of nature and express gratitude for the nourishment it provides.Goa is no different.In the month of August, the entire state prepares itself for festivities with colour and pomp. Floats are prepared, lavish meals cooked, and ceremonious processions taken out. Behind the gaiety and music, the slew of festivals are nothing but an acknowledgement that harvest season is here.The Mundaka Upanishad succinctly states, 'Somat parjanya, Osadhaya prthivyam'  Rain falls. When rain falls, plants grow.The book of Genesis in the Bible also talks about the first offerings made by man to God. The first sons of Adam and Eve were Cain and Abel. While Abel was a keeper of flocks, Cain was a tiller of the ground, and both brought their offerings to the Lord at the opportune time.As the monsoon in Goa takes a break, heralding the arrival of the harvest season, Goa begins to give thanks. The tapering of the monsoon offers a chance for communities, especially farmers, to pray and thank God for a bountiful crop.The dates and the rituals may vary, but the same sentiment runs through like a common thread.""When primitive man first began to form communities, he realized he was dependent on nature. Mother Earth sustains us, and man felt the need to acknowledge Mother Earth's gifts, especially food,"" says former member-secretary of Kala Academy, Pandurang Phaldesai And only once thanks is given does the harvesting season begin.The konsachem fest is one such traditional ritual that marks the start of the harvest season. ""Starting from August 5 every year, the festival kicks off in Raia with the traditional cutting of the first sheaves of the paddy crop,"" says writer Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues in her book, 'Feasts, Festivals, and Observances of Goa'.""The konsachem fest holds vital significance not just for the villagers of Raia, but for all the farmers of Goa as it invokes God's blessings on all the food being grown across the state,"" says comunidade activist and lawyer Andre Pereira Before cutting off some stalks of the paddy crop to herald the beginning of the harvest season, the priest says a few prayers and then proceeds to ceremoniously bless the crop.Everyone gets a couple of blessed stalks to take home, which is religiously placed at the altar at home. The practice of celebrating a good crop is an age-old ritual, one that continued even after the Portuguese conquest in 1510, and is observed with great fervour till today, especially in Taleigao The story goes that in February 1510, Goa was first captured by Afonso de Albuquerque in the absence of Adil Shah. Once Adil Shah learnt about it, he attacked the Portuguese, forcing them to withdraw. With food running out, Albuquerque's soldiers were saved by the gaonkars of Taleigao, who provided them with rice and other food stuff.""At the noble gesture, Afonso de Albuquerque conceded the privilege to the gaonkars of Taleigao to harvest the paddy first,"" Pereira explains.Konsachem Fest closely resembles the navyachi pancham, which is celebrated in Goa a day after Ganesh Chaturthi . ""There is a field that is marked as God's field, and paddy is collected by selected leaders of the community. The sheaves of paddy stalks are worshipped, prayers are said, and then the 'konos' are distributed to all the people,"" Phaldesai says, and goes on to point out that the entire celebration of Chaturthi is an acknowledgement of nature. Ganesh Chaturthi is celebrated in the Hindu month of Bhadrapad, a time when the monsoon starts receding. Every element of Chaturthi is directly related to nature, with local biodiversity well documented in the traditional 'matoli' (canopy).""This acknowledgement of nature begins in July with vat purnima. A few days ago, suttapanno was celebrated, which is now called rakhipurnima  August 17. We celebrate what nature gives us, it is a circle,"" Phaldesai says.During the second day of Chaturthi, the first paddy harvest called 'nave' is offered to Ganesh, which holds great relevance to the local farming community, since Ganesh is a deity related to agriculture and biodiversity.The ancient harvest celebration has, over time, been accepted and absorbed by every community as a commemoration of nature's gift to mankind."

Sambanthan Chettiar carefully mixes the steamed rice with kootu made of spinach and takes a small mouthful along with the other vegetarian accompaniments on his plantain leaf, it is plain to see that he is relishing every morsel as he slowly chews his food.Patience and the desire to savour life to the fullest have helped the former Malaysia-based financier and entrepreneur enter his 100{+t}{+h}year, say those close to Mr. Sambanthan.A resident of Konapet, about 70 kilometres from Tiruchi, for the past 20 years, what makes his longevity more remarkable is his ability to live alone and maintain a large home with little outside assistance.Except for my wife Annapooranis absence by my side, I have few regrets in life, Mr. Sambanthan told The Hindu in an interview at his sprawling home named Annapoorani Illam after his beloved spouse, who passed away 22 years ago.His sons Viswanathan, Sundaresan and Chidambaram and their families have spent the past six months preparing for a grand celebration of Mr. Samabanthans milestone birthday, to be held at the clans ancestral home in Konapet opposite Annapoorani Illam. Besides immediate family, his friends and well-wishers are expected to make up the 2,500-strong guest list for the May 30 pooja and banquet (the date coincides with Mr. Sambanthans birth date as per his astrological chart).Mr. Sambanthan was born on May 15, 1917, the fourth of five sons of the noted businessman and financier Viswanathan Chettiar. He studied up to Class V in the Saraswathi Kalasala in Konapet after which his elder brother took him to Malaysia to train him for the familys lending business.The young Sambanthan travelled to Malaysia by ship from Nagapattinam in 1927 and was soon part of the kittangi  a commercial establishment where moneylenders conducted business in the front, and had residential quarters at the back  in the city of Muar, Johor Province.Mr. Sambanthan, who became a Malaysian citizen in 1948, went on to own, besides other business ventures, a rubber estate and a petrol station in Muar. As president of the Muar Arappani Kazhagam, a charitable organisation run by Indian expatriates, he has overseen the granting of financial aid to many underprivileged people.The charity has a branch office in Pudukottai since 2000. A devout Hindu, Mr. Sambanthan has witnessed the consecration of the Muar Murugan Temple six times.Mr. Sambanthan relinquished his Malay citizenship and decided to return to Konapet for good in the mid-1990s. A fingertip marked with indelible ink shows the extent of his engagement with his present  Mr. Sambanthan braved the rainy weather last fortnight to travel to Chennai and cast his vote in the State elections.It is clearly quite difficult to encapsulate a centurys living in a few hours, but Mr. Sambanthan has a vast stock of anecdotes from the years gone by.Seeing Mahatma Gandhi when he visited Madurai in 1946 is among these. The other, was seeing his father receive a Chevrolet car delivered in 1933 by none other than pioneering automotive industrialist T.V. Sundaram Iyengar of Madurai. Father paid Rs. 3,200 for the car, and we drove up to Mysore in it, he recounted.Mr. Sambanthan loves automobiles, and started driving at the age of 13. As recently as three months ago, he was hopping behind the wheel of his white Maruti 800 to attend family functions far and near. Now my children have asked me to stop driving, because of my age, he smiled a little ruefully.His day starts at 4 a.m. with meditation, yogic breathing exercises, a reading of Thiruvasagam, a cup of coffee and then a brisk walk on the grounds of his residence. His mobile phone helps him to stay in touch with his extended family, which includes eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.

The small, fried balls are crispy on the outside and sweet and mushy on the inside, with some grainy bits of the filling to chew on.Sukrunde  part pakora and part dessert  may be fading from our collective consciousness, but surely not from the memory of those who have tasted this sweet even once in their lifetime. And once is enough.The preparation is a reminder of the enterprising natures of our grannies.""When the chana dal nevreos were prepared during Ganesh Chaturthi , my mother-in-law made sukrunde from the leftover chana dal filling,"" recollects Shantha Dhumatkar of Margao This preparation of the chana dal nevreos itself is something offered only during the auspicious Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations.The dish involves cooking the chana dal till it is soft, but still of a grainy consistency, after the water from it is strained out. Jaggery , coconut milk and opened pods of elaichi (cardamoms) are then added to the mixture and the filling is cooked on low flame till it is completely devoid of the water content.A dough is prepared, similar to the one kneaded for chapattis; it is rolled and sealed into semi-circular pieces with the chana dal filling. Modak , the classic dumplings synonymous with Ganesh Chaturthi, are also made from the same filling and dough - only the shape is different. Both modaks and nevreos, are then deep fried till they are crispy on the outside.""This version of the modaks and nevreos are usually consumed on the same day. But now, with refrigerators being available, they can be stored for a few more days,"" informs Dhumatkar.If the children of the house are lucky, the quantity of the chana dal filling will exceed the quantity of the dough, and this occasion calls for preparing sukrunde.While the filling remains the same, the outer layer of the sukrunde are made of a batter rather than dough.Depending on the preference of the household, the batter is made from either rice flour or a mixture of besan and maida. The batter is of the same consistency as that of the one made for pakoras.The sukrunde are attractively shaped, similar to the size of small lemons. Balls are prepared from the chana dal filling, which are dipped in the batter and deep fried.While sukrunde, is possibly an invention from leftover chana dal filling during Ganesh Chaturthi, it is not a must during the festival and neither is it restricted to the occasion.The wonderful twist to the modern-day pakoras are prepared to delight young and old in the household, whenever they feel like a sukrundo at teatime. But nothing can serve a reminder to the almost forgotten sweet delight as the chana dal nevreos and modaks prepared during the Ganesh Chaturthi festivities."

The lands have become wet all over and the problem of evaporation and wastages has also been considerably reduced. These rains were very much encouraging this time. They came at the right time. Because of this, 1 to 2 tmc of water will be saved in the form of reduction in evaporation losses and wastages, said Ch. Koti Reddy, president of the Nellore District Farmers Association.Water for Chennai likelyAs of now, the storage at the Somasila reservoir stood at around 24.47 tmcft with the water level being 294.2 ft. The dead storage had been reached sometimes in the past. The present storage in the Kandaleru reservoir is stated to be 26.3 tmc of which some water would be released to meet the drinking needs of people in Chennai city.This reservoir was being used more like a stock point also rather than solely meeting the irrigation needs.Following a decision taken at the Irrigation Board meeting, the officials had already started releasing water from the Somasila for meeting the needs of the second crop. The farmers have gone mostly for paddy cultivation.In the past, when there was higher quantity of water storage in the Somasila, the farmers grew the second crop on 2.15 lakh acres also.Paddy cultivation has further picked up in Nellore district in recent months as there is good scope for sale of rice in neighbouring states with the lifting of restrictions on transportation."

Some fifty years ago, these varieties abounded in the country, which is striving currently to ensure food security for all. Now, however, only 7,000odd local varieties remain and not all are grown.A traditional variety of rice is passed from generation to generation and family to family .""It took almost 12,000 years for these diverse varieties to be created,"" said Dr Debal Deb, a rice conservationist and a biologist.""We destroyed or lost them in just 30 years or so. This is the sad state of our heritage.""Deb has preserved 1,200 desi rice varieties, which were showcased in a unique two-day rice exhibition in Ahmedabad, organized by the Ahmedabad Heritage Venture Lab (AHVL). In all, 1,800 varieties were displayed at the exhibition.""Some varieties can grow without a single drop of water. Others can be grown in ponds that are 3 to 4 feet deep. A few grow even under 12 feet of water,"" Deb said. Rice varieties such as Jugal have two rice grains in one kernel, and Sateen has three.According to Deb, some traditional rice varieties have high levels of micronutrients. Despite billions of dollars of investment, companies have not been able to create genetically modified crop which can pack more micronu trients than the in digenous variants.The value of tradi tional varieties be comes even more important in the imate change, which wake of climate change, which results in shifting rainfall patterns and extreme temperatures.The availability of local varieties is crucial as modern agriculture relies only on limited varieties.Deb blames the green revolution and high yielding hybrid seeds for the extinction of traditional seeds. He also rued the fact that not a single government research institute has evinced interest in carrying out research on local rice varieties because they are not linked to gross domestic product or biotechnology .Since 1996, Deb has been engaged in conservation of hundreds of traditional rice varieties with his extensive germplasm-collection expeditions across 11 states of India.Deb has founded India's largest non-governmental rice gene bank called Vrihi (Sanskrit for rice) and has conserved 1,120 varieties in situ. He runs a research farm called Basudha in Odisha.Gujarat had over 250 varieties of milletA lthough Gujarat may not have many traditional rice varieties, over 250 indigenous varieties of millets were found in the state and most of them are lost now.O ut of the 1,200 varieties preserved and conserved by Deb, one traditional variety called `Garib Sal' has silver in it. This variety was found in one district of West Bengal. The rice was found to be have silver in it. This is the first time a plant was discovered where silver was absorbed from the land. However, this variety is not grown presently anywhere in the country. This type of rice may have been used for medicinal purposes. It is assumed that it was given to people gastric infections as silver kills germs. ""We came across this rice grain while looking for varieties having metals such as iron and zinc,"" Deb added."

While the maximum level of PM2.5 was recorded at 101.37 ug/m3 on April 1, it was recorded at 131 ug/m3 on Friday. The level of sulphur oxides has also increased from about 41ug/m3 to 56 ug/m3 in the last 15 days.As per the provisions of Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, Haryana's environment department issue a notification to farmers from time to time in order to prohibit the burning of agricultural waste in the fields.According to experts, the burning of crop waste in Punjab and Haryana adds to air pollution even places like Delhi and other NCR cities.""Burning a ton of rice straw releases about 5 kg of nitrogen in the air, besides releasing other pollutants such as potassium and sulphur. Stubble burning also leads to deteriorating quality of soil,"" said Dr Bhim Singh Gahlot, a city-based agricultural scientist.The offocials of HSPCB, however, refused to buy the argument that stubble burning is a major cause of concern in the city. ""The weather is already hot and wind speed is good so stubble burning shouldn't affect pollution level in the city.,"" said an official of HSPCB, who did not wish to be named."

Police raided a godown in Porur and found the rice in 140 bags, each weighing 50kg.A court later sent Alaana Sundaram, 48, who was employed with ration shop K.D.140 in Chitlapakkam, and his brother Ravichandran, 52, to prison.Sundaram told police he was first employed at a ration shop in Porur before being transferred to the PDS outlet run by the Kancheepuram cooperative stores in Chitlapakkam. Based on a specific tip, police teams nabbed Sundaram and also apprehended Ravichandran.Preliminary inquiries revealed that Sundaram had rented a godown in Porur since the time he was working with the PDS outlet there. He also rented a godown in Chitlapakkam and shifted the rice from the ration shop there.Police said they raided the godown in Chitlapakkam but they didn't find any rice. Later, a team visited the godown in Porur and recovered the rice. During questioning, Sundaram told police that he used his brother to sell the smuggled rice to wholesale traders in Andhra Pradesh. The brothers had been involved in the racket for the past couple of years, police said.After the raids, civil supplies CID officials warned people against smuggling rice from PDS outlets. They said officials in charge of PDS outlets should regularly verify if the allotted quantity of rice was being unloaded at the shops. A senior police officer said, ""We have sent a letter to higher officials to initiate departmental action against the officials behind the scam and others."""

Till his US-based friend introduced him to mock meat. Though made of soya, it looked, felt and tasted like the real thing.""I have now totally cut out meat from my diet and don't miss it at all. And my wife is also happy as she is vegetarian by choice and we can enjoy the same food now,"" says the 32-year-old businessmanWith an increasing number of people turning vegan, there is a greater demand for alternatives that do not contain any animal product. While most of the things available so far in the market have been imported, a few young entrepreneurs in the city are coming up with homely fare to meet dietary requirements.When Marieen Vijay decided to wed her love for animals with her passion for food, the idea of VeggyTABLE was born. She decided to come up with vegan food substitutes so that animals would be off the menu.Today, the vegan convenience food store, which operates out of her premises in Anna Nagar, dishes out yummy VeggyMEAT and VeggyNAISE. ""Prepared mock meat is a fairly new concept in India. We have 14 different styles, including south Indian spicy masala, Chinese not meat mandarin, and Thai not meat satay, which just need to be heated up and served,"" says Marieen, adding that none of it has any additives and preservatives.A few companies in the city have been offering vegan substitutes for a while. Relish, for instance, have been serving nut milk to customers for the last one-and-a-half years. The almond milk comes in six different variations -- unsweetened classic nut milk, as well as almond milk with turmeric, carrot, beetroot, or even with greens such as celery and spinach. A bottle of 320ml costs Rs 130 for a subscriber and can be stored for 48 hours.""There is a significant vegan population out there who are looking out for such products,"" says Sowmya Ganesh, one of the founders of Relish, adding that many people prefer the classic nut milk as they can use it in their coffee, or cereal or just have it as a drink.Marieen's VeggyMEAT can also be used creatively in kati rolls, as samosa fillings, on bruschettas or pizzas. ""They are meant to help non-vegetarians who want to become vegans and are made of just wheat and soy,"" says Marieen. While a 250g packet costs Rs 250, the advantage with these is that they are very high in protein, can be used in different ways, and are zero cholesterol.The VeggyNAISE, or vegan mayonnaise, which comes in several flavours -- original plain, fresh mint, fresh celery, chilli jeera, pepper garlic - are also zero cholesterol and can be used as a dip, topping, spread and filling.Monica Pandian, who has been vegan for the last eight years, sells healthy vegan bakes through her online store, Mystic Gluttony. ""Recently, I have also begun selling organic pure peanut butter. I sell it directly to clients now, but it will soon be sold in supermarkets,"" she says.With not many options available, many vegans make their own substitutes to suit their needs. G P Aishwarrya, who has been a vegan for six years, makes her own almond milk, peanut curd, and cashew cheese. ""I add a little bit of herbs of my choice and lemon juice so it is delicious as a spread,"" says Aishwarrya. ""I have served it as well as vegan curd rice and buttermilk and they couldn't spot the difference,"" she says, adding that she hopes to market it in the future.Encouraged by the market response, some entrepreneurs are planning to come out with more products. ""I am going to bring out vegan curd made of cashew or soy, and vegan ice cream in three different flavours,"" says Marieen. ""I am looking at alternatives as we don't need misery on the plate."""

Supplyco had been procuring paddy for the Food Corporation of India (FCI).The corporation pays Rs 21.50/kg to farmers for paddy procured from them. This includes two components of the central and the state government shares. The central share is Rs 14.10/kg, over which the state gives an additional Rs 7.40/kg as subsidy.The scheme was envisaged to offer farmers more than what is offered by the FCI. However, the subsidy offered by the state for the rice procured is due since January this year, for which the bank loan will be used. The government has been enhancing the credit limit of the Supplyco in the past two years after the financial situation of the state became weak."

They are forced to drink untreated stagnant water, causing a surge in dehydration, gastroenteritis cholera and other waterborne illnesses. The temperature is hovering around 44 degrees celsius in Raichur, Yadgir, Koppal, Kalaburagi, Bidar and Ballari, where nearly 30% of children below five years suffer from malnourishment. In these drought-prone areas, two consecutive years of poor rainfall has led to dried-up wells and surface water evaporation.""Children suffer the most during a drought. While getting basic nourishment is a problem of them, they also have to run around for basic resources,"" said an anganwadi teacher.Between 2010 and 2016, over 3,000 child deaths were recorded in these areas. But child activists claim this is a deflated figure. ""Although drought has been declared here in all taluks, no efforts are being made to ease the situation,'' said Vijay Kumar P, an activist.With inadequate healthcare facilities and not enough food to eat, villagers watch helplessly as children wilt due to malnutrition. About a dozen children were reported to have died in Koppal and Raichur recently but the authorities are yet to establish whether they died because of malnutrition or any other reason. ""I have asked all district health officials of Hyderbad-Karnatak region to prepare reports after assessing the impact on malnourished children, and we will take steps accordingly,'' said health and family welfare minister U T Khader.Dr B Shankar, a child specialist from Hubballi, said malnutrition makes children even more susceptible to various diseases compared to normal children. Many of these children who live in drought-stricken village hardly eat two meals a day because there is little or no food in reserve as their crops have failed and it again takes a toll, he added The Hyderabad-Karnatak region, which got the deemed status under Article 371(J) of the Constitution, suffers from severe poverty, under education, child marriage and consanguineous marriages  all contributing to malnutrition.The Karnataka government has been expanding its nutrition efforts in the region during the last two years by supplying free milk and egg to children in anganwadi centres. It has also launched a cheap rice scheme to tackle hunger and malnutrition among poor children. However, sources said many children have refrained from consuming the milk because the quality of milk powder supplied to them has deteriorated giving a pungent smell. The powder is supplied by state government-run Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).KMF chairman P Nagaraju said they have deployed officials to inspect and check the quality of milk powders and submit a report. ""We will take appropriate action based on the report,"" he added.Malnourished children, already suffering due to lack of a proper diet, need special care, especially during calamities. For, neglecting them is turning a blind eye to our future. In the Hyderabad-Karnatak region, where around onethird of children are malnourished, the authorities should take special measures to also provide them potable water so that they don't become victims of drought. The authorities should not give an excuse that the whole region has been affected. Instead, they should find ways so that these children grow up healthy to face all challenges on their own and to help the region develop"

Recently, the outlet had introduced a variety of options like burgers, stuffed parathas and sandwiches, apart from its regular fare of rice items, south indian snacks, tea and coffee.Sources in the commercial department of Southern Railways said the tender for procuring raw materials like oil had expired and the stock was being purchased on a daily basis for the past few days. ""However, senior officials have not passed orders for the local purchase for the past four days. This is linked to a vigilance case filed against 17 staff working in the outlet,"" a source, requesting anonymity said.Railway staff working at the counter were flummoxed about the reason for the non-operation. ""Our sales in the recent past had gone up to more than 2 lakh per day. Suddenly, why the outlet has been closed is inexplicable,"" a staffer said.Despite having a footfall of 3.5 lakh a day, the station lacked a major food plaza for more than a year, because the Southern Railways stalled the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation's plan of opening a food plaza. Officials said that because of this, the customer base shifted to the Jan Aahar. There are a few other smaller food stalls at the station, but railway-run counters dominate.""When I approached the counter, I was rudely told that food would not be available. I was relying on the cheaper food at this stall,"" said J Rajesh, a 21-year-old student travelling to Bangalore, pointing out that he couldn't afford the food at other stalls.

Earlier, the GI tag was awarded to Kolhapuri chappals, Kolhapuri jaggery, Mahabaleshwar's strawberries, Nashik's grapes, Jalgaon's brinjals and Nagpur's oranges .A geographical indication (GI) is a name or a sign used on products which corresponds to a specific geographical location or origin like a town, a region, or a country. A community's intellectual property is attached to that particular product.""It took 2-3 years to get GIs for these products. The tag for these products means that their uniqueness has been verified by an expert committee of the Government of India,"" Ganesh Hingmire, chairman of Pune-based Great Mission Group Consultancy (GMGC), which has been instrumental in securing these certificates.Scoring a GI for a product helps the community in getting a premium price like the northeast India's Darjeeling tea. The GI creates a distinct identity of the product, assures the buyers of quality, brings reputation to the product and creates an international market for the products.Vengurla's cashew got a GI for its scientifically proven nutritional value and because its vitamin C content is five times more than that of an orange.Ajara's ghansal rice has been proven to be better than Basmati. The elongation ratio of ghansal rice is many times more than Basmati. Sindhudurg-Ratnagiri's kokum is naturally rich in hydroxycitric acid helpful in weight-loss tablets. Lasalgaon's onion has the highest sulphur percentage.India is a heavy consumer of beans (rajma) and 90% of it is imported. The rest mostly comes from Waghya's ghevda. Mangalveda's jowar and Navapur's tur are nature's gifts and tribal products, respectively. Navpur's tur is famous for its fragrance and pleasant taste.Since most of these are agricultural products are from villages, an immediate export market is created and it helps create an international demand for them, experts said.These products have been given GI's for either their nutritional, or scientific importance for which they will now be recognized at the national level.The ultimate beneficiaries of this process are the farmers who will now have to get themselves registered as authorized users to be able to avail of the benefits, Hingmire said.Another seven products were accepted for GI certification and their names were published in the official journal no. 78, 79 and 80 by the Union government.""Certificates to these will be issued in a month's time,"" said Hingmire. These products are Sangli's raisins, Waigaon's turmeric, Jalna's sweet orange, Beed's custard apple, Solapur's pomegranate, Purandar-Saswad's fig and Jalgaon's bharit brinjal."

They were also seen on the graminaceous weeds along roadside. Army worms were seen migrating from one field to another in groups by crossing the roads, thereby invading extensive field areas.Severe infestationFarmers said the fields were completely destroyed overnight. The infestation is so severe that nearly 80 caterpillars were seen in one square metre. They suggested the following measures to manage army worm: In the affected nurseries and newly sown fields, away from homesteads, spray application of Quinolphos 25 EC @ 2 ml per litre of water.In the fields yet to be sown and also around homesteads, spraying/drenching with the quick knock down insecticide, Dichlorvos 76 EC @ 1 ml per litre of water or Lamda Cyhalothrein 5 EC @ 0.6 ml per litre of water will be effective.In the fields where the infestation of army worms has just started, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-based biopesticide @ 2 ml/g per litre of water can also be applied. Erecting bird perches (coconut petioles) in the affected fields @ 20-25 perches per acre will help in predation of the pest by the birds.Spray application should be done either during late evening hours or early morning hours.The management measures should be taken up immediately on noticing the infestation."

McLaren is not as quick. They do a decent job. Having quality all-rounders allows you to find the right balance with the team combination. We havent really got that as of now. Morris is still finding his feet.Saying good all-rounders happen for a team in cycles, he attributed West Indiess World T20 success to it. Good all-rounders come and go in cycles. We were lucky we had Clive Rice and Brian McMillan for young all-rounders to aspire to become. That was good for us. Its nice to see that West Indies has some good all-rounders now and thats why I think they were able to do well in the World T20.Hes been watching the IPL and finds Kieron Pollard impressive among the all-rounders. Ive been watching the IPL. Kieron Pollard has grabbed my attention among the all-rounders.Saying good fielding is something thats non-negotiable these days, he rated Kohli and de Villiers equally good.Its hard to compare. On their day, they are both as good as the other.He said the advent of T20 cricket has bloated batsmens self-belief and doesnt quite allow a bowler to grow in repute and command respect from them; like an Anil Kumble or Shane Warne during his time.To survive as a batsman in T20 cricket, one has to innovate. One cannot think: Ok, Kumbles bowling at one end, lets block him out and take a hit at the bowler bowling from the other end. You need to score continuously and off everyone. The batsmen now are high on belief that they can score as much as they can.On what he thinks is the best ball to bowl at the death in T20 cricket, he said, I still think the yorker is something that never gets out of date. People tend to take the pace off the ball, which is good. But theres nothing like getting a yorker right; for me, its probably the best delivery.The 44-year-old said South Africa needs to improve its level when it comes to high-profile multi-nation events.I think we need to learn how to play competition cricket (multi-nation tournaments) better. When you play a bilateral series, you play five matches against the same team, which allows you to work the opposition up in time;I mean, youve got the time to do that and pull back even if you let it slack at the start of the series. In competition cricket, you have to try and win every game. Thats where I think the players need to be harder on themselves.Im not saying they are not trying to win every game, but talking here about the change in mindset, the mental adjustment that they need to make."

As he puts the phone on hold, he quickly verifies the caller's location and voting rights in the state. The software in his computer then helps him narrow down the exact nature of the complaint: defacement of property, display of firearms, gift distribution, liquor and tobacco distribution, token distribution, et al.If it is about gift distribution, Mathu gives the complainant a few more options  is it distribution of cell phones, clothes and towels, gas cylinders, CFL bulbs, rice bags, or utensils? Once the complaint is registered in the control room located on the seventh floor of Fort St George Building in Chennai, the flying squad stationed nearest to the place of the alleged gift distribution gets an auto-generated text message. Mathu or any of his 39 colleagues in the control room of the state's chief electoral office can check the GPS-enabled map on the wall and verify whether the flying squad concerned is actually moving towards the location or not. ""Thanks to technology, our response time to a complaint has gone down from three hours earlier to three minutes in this election. We have about 700 flying squads in Tamil Nadu, but we have taken a call to increase it further. Also, we are deploying 400 income-tax officials to conduct raids, if necessary,"" says Rajesh Lakhoni, chief electoral officer of Tamil Nadu, adding that a deterrent environment is indispensable to contain the growing menace of cash and liquor used in elections. His office has further coordinated with telecom providers to look at mass mobile recharge among voters, and also held discussions with traders' associations to check token-in-lieu-of-cash, a practice often deployed by candidates to avoid large cash movement during elections.A flying squad, which comprises a team of enforcers from the police and income-tax department, is allowed to seize cash beyond Rs 50,000 carried by one person in a poll-bound state. In Tamil Nadu, where elections will be held only in the last phase, May 16, Rs 24.05 crore in cash was seized by flying squads till April 12, although some seized cash had been returned after it was proven that the money was not carried for poll-related reasons. The other poll-bound states are not lagging behind. For example, in Assam, where elections were over on April 11, Rs 12.33 crore was seized. In West Bengal where elections are on till May 5, Rs 11.96 crore in cash was seized whereas in Kerala, Rs 10.4 crore was seized till April 12.If the seizure during the 2014 parliamentary polls in these four states is considered, liquor and ganja are also a big menace, particularly in West Bengal and Assam. In West Bengal, 8.4 lakh litres of liquor and 1,396 kg of ganja were seized in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, whereas in Assam, the figure stood at 3.1 lakh litres of liquor and 566 kg of ganja, according to the data of the Election Commission of India. The data on liquor and ganja distributed in this round of polls is not readily available. Election commissioner Om Prakash Rawat concedes that those who are using black money in elections are ""creative people"" and one step ahead of the EC machinery chasing them. In a first, this time, the EC has spotted instances of ambulances being used for carrying cash.Rawat does not rule out the use of foreign money in Indian elections. ""Until we catch someone, we can't say money from foreign nations also flows in during elections. But I don't rule out the possibility altogether.... In West Bengal, we have caught a hawala transaction this time. Fake currency notes were also recovered by our flying squads both in Assam and West Bengal,"" he says.As this writer travelled in three of the four election-bound states  Assam, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu  and interacted with political parties, candidates and voters  two things emerged very clearly. First, the use of cash and liquor is a common practice across states going to elections, and the state machinery is nowhere near the culprits. Second, distribution of cash in Tamil Nadu, in particular, is much more organised and open than in other states, something which forced the EC to deploy more forces in that state, including 400 additional I-T officials with a mandate to raid houses. Flying squads are not authorised to undertake raids in houses.The Chennai-based secretariat of Tamil Nadu's chief electoral officer, Lakhoni, has been receiving about 6,000 calls every day, out of which about 200 are pure complaints, the rest being queries and suggestions. If the statistics on cash and gift distribution are factored in, the process of bribing the voters in Tamil Nadu has begun early this time.Between March 4 and April 9, as many as 45 complaints in Tamil Nadu were on distribution of clothes, towels and dhotis, 61 were on liquor, 151 on money distribution, 6 on distribution of ornaments and 61 on ""other gifts"". Remember, on April 9, not all candidates were finalised; nomination process was yet to begin and elections were over a month away.The creativity of the culprits comes to the fore when the complainants tell EC officials about the modus operandi for the distribution of cash. As on April 9, Tamil Nadu saw three cases of cash distribution through milkmen, a practice generally deployed by candidates only in the last few days of the poll. Then, there were six cases where newspaper hawkers were roped in to distribute cash, and in two other cases, cash reached voters along with tobacco products. Former MP and DMK secretary TKS Elangovan says his party does not indulge in cash distribution to woo voters though there were complaints against the party that it recharged the mobile phones of voters in Madurai area during the last assembly polls. ""I deny any charge of the DMK distributing money. This election will be fought on issues, not money power. The voters this time won't favour the AIADMK even if it distributes money"", he says. ET Magazine could not elicit a response from the AIADMK.The voters do acknowledge that political parties resort to distributing cash and gifts to woo them. ""Yes, various methods are used to get votes. Many voters take the decision only at the last minute,"" says E Thangavelu, 53, who worked in a Royal Enfield bike factory in Ranipet in Tamil Nadu before joining his wife's flower shop in the temple town of Kanchipuram. He repeatedly says that he has never taken any ""bribe from political agents"" and will not do so this time either. Saravanan, 42, who sells saris in Kanchipuram, concedes that ""token system"" was prevalent in earlier elections. ""I have heard there are stringent rules this time. Many shopkeepers may not accept tokens this time,"" he says. The voters are usually given tokens for denominations like Rs 500, Rs 1,000 etc, with which they can buy anything from designated shops in the locality. The candidates, through their middlemen, later settle the debt with shopkeepers. For EC's enforcement agencies, the tokens have posed a bigger challenge than the movement of hard cash. After all, they are trained to seize cash, not tackle tokens."

Usually water is released on June 12 when the level is 90 feet. As per the final verdict of the Cauvery water disputes tribunal, Karnataka should have released 10 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu but it did not do so.""Even if Karnataka had given 10 tmcft of water, the level in the Mettur dam would have been 61 feet and still the release of water on June 12 would not have been be possible,"" said Jayalalithaa.Exuding confidence that kuruvai cultivation will be carried out in 3 lakh acres using ground water, Jayalalithaa said 4,000 will be provided as 100% subsidy to those who are involved in mechanised cultivation under the system of rice intensification (SRI) method.To help farmers fetch water from bore wells, they will be given 1,000 HDPE pipes (90 mm width and 6 metres length) at full subsidy for which the government will allot 2 crore.The package also includes micronutrients for 50,000 acres identified as micronutrient deficient areas and zinc sulphate for 1 lakh acres to remove the salinity of the land. While the subsidy for micronutrients is 170 per acre, the subsidy for zinc sulphate will be 400 per acre.Free three-phase power supply for 12 hours a day is also part of the package. However, the farmers are demanding 16 to 20 hours of free power supply a day. .The chief minister said the farmers in the areas of Cauvery's tributaries and Kallanai canals had not been take up kuruvai for many years now. They can make a living by cultivating short term pulses on 15,000 acres by using the southwest monsoon, for which they will get a subsidy of 1,400 per acre at a cost of 2.10 crore to the government."

In its directions lies an opportunity for elected representatives.While Members of Parliament (MPs) discussed drought during the current Parliament session and the Supreme Court intervened, MPs can help address the immediate situation and invest in long term solutions.Given that Members of Parliament represent each and every corner of the country and can fan out to literally every nook and corner through their party workers, the outreach and action potential is tremendous.Man ki Baat had the PM questioning: Can we conserve the rainwater in every village? The answer is yes.With the Parliament session drawing to an end, MPs need to go back to their constituencies to make the most of the monsoons. While some steps are immediate others are towards constituency water security as long term measures.Immediate stepsThe monsoon is almost upon us. Yet it's not too late to:1. Form drought mitigation committees in the villages: These village committees should comprise of panchayat members and representatives of all interest groups in the village. These committees will take care of, and monitor drought requirements and management.2. Elicit commitment to prevent suicide: The distressed villagers should have confidence that they are not alone and collectively take an oath that they will not commit suicide.3. Arrange for tanker water supply where there is drinking water scarcity: Involve villagers to ensure that the water is safe and provided to all in the village. The Ministry of Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation has provisions for emergency situations such as drought and these should be availed of.4. Arrange for water and fodder for livestock in livestock camps: People are forced to sell/ release their livestock since they are not able to provide for them. These camps will provide essential requirements for livestock and prevent distress sale.5. Utilise MGNREGA and MPLAD Funds: All funds allotted for MGNREGA must be directed towards reviving, creating water conservation structures. There is a need to facilitate smooth and swift transfer of funds to the villagers. This is now a Supreme Court direction as well.6. Implementation of the Right to Food (RTF): Assess the functioning of the PDS and other programmes under the RTF and ensure availability of food grains to the affected. This again, is a Supreme Court direction.7. Restore/rehabilitate/ create water conservation structures: Send a message to the villagers that every drop of rain that falls on a field, habitation, village or GP should not go waste. This monsoon must be harvested. There are several things that can be done. For instance,a) Farmers can make medbandhis (boundaries around their field) on their field so that the rainwater can be conserved. A small recharge pit should also be dug to capture the rain. Dugwells should be cleaned and ready for recharge.b) Almost all the villages will have a tank, talab, dug well, or any other structure. The village committee can assess the status of these and undertake repairs, desilting, etc. All nallahs, streams or rivers should be protected and used for recharge.c) New rainwater conservation structures such as ponds, etc should be constructed. After the monsoon arrives, it is important that villagers map the areas where water flows or collects so that these can be used in the future for creating rainwater conservation structures.Long term measures:These will require detailed planning and funds but the task is doable. Every region of India has had traditional water harvesting systems suited to the region, which must be revived at scale.Measures to protect them should be put into place so that these can be used for recharge.1. Constituency plan for rainwater conservation: This plan should be based on the rainfall of the constituency and the total water resources available. Constituency-wise database of ponds, tanks, lakes, nallahs, streams and rivers should be available with the MP to use for recharge and follow up action.2. Moving towards constituency drinking water security: The Ministry for Drinking water and Sanitation has a website that gives habitation wise data of the coverage of drinking water. Sometimes the habitation is classified as covered (expenditure made and infrastructure developed) but still drinking water is not available. Compare this list with the situation in the village for assessment and take appropriate measures if required.3. Use MPLAD and other funds for rainwater conservation: MPs should start spending more of their MPLAD funds for water conservation projects and also make efforts to bring water conservation projects in their constituency.A constituency level water committee for periodic and serious monitoring will keep the progress of the water conservation works on track. This committee should comprise of technical experts, PRI representatives, civil society organisations working there in addition to concerned government officials.4. Create water banks by artificial groundwater recharge: The percentage of recharging of groundwater needs to be at least doubled. This is easily possible by natural and artificially directing rainwater into underground aquifers. River beds offer a great opportunity for recharge. Over time, there will be a balance between the surface and groundwater leading to rivers that will flow throughout the year and recharge groundwater aquifers.5. Water audits for new development projects: New projects in the constituency should be chosen carefully: Only those projects should be allowed which are suitable to the available water resources without affecting the requirements of other sectors.6. Promote agricultural crops which can grow in available water: Crops like sugarcane and rice for example require huge amounts of water. These should be grown only in areas where there is sufficient water. Local varieties should be encouraged and a minimum price/ market and marketing systems developed for these.7. Encourage water efficiency in agriculture: There are several technologies that can be easily used for cutting down irrigation water. Drip irrigation and laser levelling are just two examples. These can be promoted throughout the constituency: If there are challenges to using these technologies then solutions should be found.8. Encourage a water responsible industry: A database of industries in the constituency should be available with each MP. Having regular meetings with the captains of these industries to encourage them to assess their water footprint and make commitments to reduce it through various means will enable co-existence.India is drying and desiccating like a coconut. There is a crying need to reach out to all corners of the country for conservation.If undertaken in rural and urban areas from the smallest unit up to the state (see Figure below, then there is cause for optimism. Are the MPs ready to take on the mantle?The views expressed in the above article are that of Dr. Indira Khurana, Lead - WASH, IPE Global. (ANI)"

Almost an entire village, cutting across political and religious affiliations, assembled to protest against a toddy shop at Vavvamoola near Venganoor here.A licensee based in Chirayinkeezhu had won a court order to operate the shop. In December 2015, local people had busted the move to open the shop, following which the owner had moved the court.The villagers pooled in money to cook porridge, rice and black tea, which they served to political representatives and hundreds of supporters who gathered at the protest venue. Majority of the protesters are labourers, who gave up a day's income to be a part of the agitation.Venganoor panchayat had passed a resolution not to issue license to toddy shops in any of its 20 wards in panchayat. The panchayat authorities stood by the villagers who fiercely objected to the idea of a toddy shop. Panchayat president G S Sreekala said, ""Our aim is to make the panchayat liquor-free. No license shall be issued to any toddy shop.""An action council formed for the cause has forwarded a complaint to the office of excise commissioner stating that the license was granted in violation of the rules. ""The building for the proposed toddy shop is located in the vicinity of a temple, church and an anganwady. The toddy shop will scuttle peace and harmony in the area,"" said the complaint.A colony of dhobis lies adjacent to the building. ""We make a living using the pond right in front of the building. Once the toddy shop starts functioning, it is going to affect our lives,"" said Shakunthala, a protester. Jinu S Simon, ward member said the building was given to a beneficiary under a housing scheme. ""It is unfair to use the building given under the housing scheme for a toddy shop. The residents are unanimous in their demand,"" he said.In 2004, villagers of neighbouring ward Pullanimukku had launched protests that continued for four years to close down a toddy shop."

Since East and West Godavari districts are considered the rice bowl of the State, there is no dearth of produce for the exports. The traders clinched deals with the foreign parties and shipped rice to the destinations.Interestingly, the quantum of rice being exported has been falling year by year owing to the tough competition from other rice producing countries and the global economic recession. In the financial year 2012-13, the Anchorage exported 26.73 lakh metric tonnes to various African countries, which is a record even today. The quantum has come down to 22.67 lakh metric tonnes in 2013-14 and to 22.01 lakh metric tonnes in 2014-15. The recent bulletin of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce indicated that 19.17 lakh metric tonnes of rice was being exported in the fiscal 2015-16.Not just rice, but all the exports have plummeted due to the global economic recession. The scenario remained same in all the ports and is applicable to almost all the commodities, observes Dantu Surya Rao, chairman of the chamber. With regard to rice, he says, the local traders are facing a tough competition from their counterparts from Thailand and Vietnam over the year.Both the quality and price of the Indian rice are high in the International market. Probably, the price factor is forcing the importers to look towards Thailand and Vietnam, he says.The withdrawal of the Duty Entitlement Passbook (DEPB) system by the Customs department seems to be the major disappointment for the traders from the Governments side. Announcement of a few incentives may accelerate the exports in the days to come. Not just traders, but the farmers too are getting benefited from the exports. They can clear the stocks instantly, as the support guaranteed from the competitive market. As a result of the slowdown in exports, farmers are facing the challenge of buffer stocks and all the warehouses are filled with the produce, says Kovvuri Trinadha Reddy, a progressive farmer."

Merely 15 years ago in 2001, the number of gardens was 7,500, covering 24,000 acres only. This means, over the past decade, tea gardens have flourished at over 500%, taking over 1 lakh acres, and rising. ""It is the steady average price of tea leaves that is alluring more farmers to switch to tea gardening. For every kg of tea leaves, a farmer gets Rs 15, earning a higher profit than from any other crop,"" said Bijoy Gopal Chakraborty, president of the Confederation of Indian Small Tea Growers' Associations (CISTA).""For immediate profit, small farmers sell their agrarian land to big tea companies. The practice affects our agricultural production and even culture,"" said MLA Karim Choudhury. He had forced the state to resolve against further procurement of land, but can do little when it came to private land.A tea estate covering an area less than 15 acres is given the ""small garden"". The state had ruled that any such estate coming up after March 31, 2001, would be considered illegal. But giving in to pressure, the deadline was first extended to 2006, then 2009 and now, considering a further date. ""There are at least 24,000 small tea gardens in North Dinajpur, which are yet to get the legal stamp from the Tea Board. Without the no-objection certificate, they can't get subsidy or bank loans. Only 5,800-odd gardens have been listed as legal,"" said Debashis Paul, CISTA secretary. ""Being left out of government benefits, these growers face problems but they do not have to pay tax and they are more than happy about it. They earn a huge amount from the leaves, which they wouldn't have had they followed the law,"" said Sudipta Das, a garden owner.Those who have switched from other agriculture sectir to tea plantation, like to call themselves ""tea farmers"" and not the traditional ""tea growers"". A case in point is Tarun Singha from Islampur, who made a foray into tea industry just a year ago. ""I grew paddy and wheat on my small land. Uncertainty over returns and labour crisis were problems.""As tea estates grow, production of other crops vanish. Rice varieties, such as kalo nania, kalam, aguripak, swarna, arikalam, chunakathi, jashoa and mala, are no more available in local markets. The little that is still cultivated is not enough to meet the demand. The agriculture department record shows even till 2002, rice was cultivated on 40% of land, now it has dwindled to less than 13%, giving in to the demands of the cash crop. ""With tea, farmers are sure of a return, the crop can endure natural calamity and elephants do not eat it. These qualities make them attractive to the farmers,"" a department official said. A case in point is Sudhir Biswas of Kalamati village in Maynaguri. ""I have only one bigha of land where I could grow 20kg paddy. The paddy rate was Rs 250-300 for 40kg. After I shifted to tea, I earn Rs 300 from 20kg,"" said Sudhir Biswas of Kalamati village in Maynaguri. Once known for only bazra and kaon (poor crops), this part now houses thriving small gardens. ""It has changed our economy,"" Kamrul Alam of Barivit said. ""Once people didn't want to give their daughters to our village grooms, in fear of being fed with kaon.""Although the agriculture department is trying to ensure that no more farmer take into tea gardening, the allure of tea trade is unavoidable, especially for those farmers who have small patches of agricultural land.But the Tea Board is worried about the poor quality of tea from small gardens. These estates, which account for 36% of the total production in the country, allegedly do not maintain the minimum quality check, and the leaves are not fit for export. But, as industry insiders said, the tea scene is not exactly rosy. ""Leaf prices have not risen, cost has,"" said Ashok Samaddar. ""Besides the high pesticide price and irregular rains, labour cost has gone up. These unauthorized small estates depend on agents of Bought Leaf Factories. During crisis, the tea price drops to Rs 4-5 per kg."" Changing to tea industry has another pitfall: Switching back is almost impossible owing to the astronomical cost.""Once planted with tea plants, the lands can never be converted to paddy field. It involves huge cost which we can hardly afford"", conceded Harsha Sarkar of Kamlapur.After all how many like lawyer Mansur Ali could afford to uproot tea plants to sow crops again? It is learnt that three in Islampur have uprooted tea plants this year.According to the agriculture department even till 2002 local rice was cultivated in 40 percent of land. Now it has reduced to below 13 percent. Traditional agriculture has changed to commercial agriculture over the past decade"

They left behind their elderly parents and two young children though both have job and Below Poverty Line (BPL) cards.""Usually, we leave before summer sets in but this time we decided to stay hoping for work under MNREGA. But the contractor didn't pay us even after 20 days. How can we survive for 20 days without money? Though the government says it'll pay Rs 224 per day, we got only Rs 150. We decided to leave,'' said Vijayapura based Basappa and Akkamahadevi who are construction labourers in Bengaluru.Munish Moudgil, MNREGA commissioner, admitted to flaws in the system which triggers such migration. ""We're trying to ensure that labourers get wages early (within seven days) but with little success. It's due to technical glitches in the Delhi system which ensures direct payment of wages as well as because of our panchayats''He said there's absolutely no problem with funds since they have about Rs 1,000 crore in the kitty. The challenge is ensure that it reaches those who need it the most. Another senior official added that panchayats, a revolutionary step in the empowerment of rural people, have been misusing MNREGA funds. ""As the government releases funds directly to them, the members battle to grab a share of the pie by creating fake job cards and bank accounts using middlemen,'' he added.He said they've been trying to set up labour groups by involving NGOs and Stree Shakthi units so that genuine workers get their due and fight for their rights collectively.The revamped food distribution scheme, which offers free rice to BPL families is also flawed and hasn't really helped drought victims. A recent survey by the directorate of economics and statistics showed that most beneficiaries find the quantum of monthly foodgrains distributed is just not enough. Under the scheme, every person in each family gets 5kg of foodgrains (4kg rice and 1kg wheat or ragi) free every month, and 1kg sugar, 1kg palm oil, 1kg salt and 5 litres of kerosene at a subsidised rate. Either the foodgrains doesn't reach them or it's simply insufficient for a family of five."

The department of women and child development has expressed its reservations at kindergarten sections being opened in government schools across Dakshina Kannada district. Parents, the department fears, are opting for schools instead of anganwadis.The issue was discussed at a KDP meeting and the district administration ordered that no LKG, UKG sections should operate in schools when there is an anganwadi nearby. ""We are worried that opening KG section in government schools would deprive children from getting nutritional food, which is specially designed to keep malnutrition at bay and helps in healthy growth of children,"" said Sundar Poojary, deputy director, department of women and child welfare.According to a recent survey, DK has identified 128 malnourished children.In DK, there are around 2,102 anganwadis, including 20 which are mini anganwadis that are looked after by one person. The centres operate from 9.30am to 4pm, during which kids from six months to six years are given day care facilities.

Villages like Beraberi in the constituency are Trinamool bastions. Basudeb Ghosh of Beraberi is among those who cannot think beyond Mamata. He runs a sweet shop in the village and with his three brothers owned 12 bighas in the factory site.Along with many of his neighbours, who also share the same surname, Basudeb was among the `unwilling' landowners who refused compensation. Though the Nano site is under litigation and there is no immediate prospect of getting their land back, Ghosh and others like him are diehard Trinamool supporters.Part of the reason is that he and an estimated 3,500 `unwilling' families have been getting a dole of Rs 2,000 and 16 kg of rice every month ever since Mamata came to power.The picture, however, is different among those who accepted compensation. One of those is Udayan Das, a doctor running a nursing home in Singur town and son of a former CPM MLA, who believes that landowners as well as sharecroppers were adequately compensated by the Left Front government. He also thinks that the CPM candidate, Rabin Deb, will defeat the incumbent Trinamool MLA, Rabindranath Bhattacharya, who is referred to as mastermoshai even by his rivals.According to Das' calculation, there are only 30,00035,000 votes in the Singur industrial area of the 2 lakh plus votes in the entire constituency. But a sampling of opinion seems to suggest that Bhattacharya, who first won here during the height of Left rule in 2001, is still considerably popular.For the rest of Hooghly, which is a mix of rural constituencies like Goghat to suburban ones like Serampore dotted with ailing factories, it looks like Trinamool might do reasonably well. In the 2011Assembly elections, Trinamool had won 16 of the 18 seats in Hooghly and in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, of the 18 assembly segments the Trinamool again led in 16 segments. It was only in Champdani and Serampore that the Left-Congress combine led in 2014. In fact, in Champdani the ruling party placed third in the 2014 elections and faces a tough contest this time. TMC's Muzaffar Khan is pitted against Congress veteran Abdul Mannan in Champdani, and even the ruling party workers admit that Mannan has the upper hand.Phul Mohammed, one of several hundred workers at North Brook Jute Mill who are without jobs, voices similar feelings. The crucial element in constituencies like Champdani is where those who backed the BJP, buoyed by a Modi wave, in 2014 choose to cast their vote.Political observers suggest that despite a united opposition TMC might still end up winning 14 of the 18 seats in Hooghly .(The author is with the National University of Singapore) (With inputs from Falguni Banerjee)"

In a separate reply, Das Burma said though the government aims to cover total 3.26 crore people under the NFSA, so far it has included 3.16 lakh people (84, 40,545 families).The government has set nine parameters to select beneficiaries under the Act, he added.The government was in the eye of the storm over alleged irregularities in preparation of the NFSA ration card beneficiary list. The controversy erupted on December 28 when the then Cuttack's mayor Anita Behera's name was found to be on the list. Later, she resigned.In the days after, reports started pouring in from across the state that the NFSA ration card list featured a number of ineligible beneficiaries. Even wife of BJD MLA Rajib Patra (Baliguda assembly segment) got the ration card under the NFSA. As appealed by the state government, total 88,178 ineligible families, who availed ration cards by submitting fake documents, have surrendered their cards."

Preliminary investigation suggests that the animals might have died after consuming poisoned rice grains.On Sunday morning, residents were shocked upon finding carcasses of animals near a ground on Godhani Road, where cattle and goats would frequently go for grazing. ""We also saw some rice grains near the animal carcasses. It seems that very strong poison was used as the nearby grass had turned black,"" said RJ Saini, a resident of Zingabai Takli.Though residents claimed that six goats, four cows and one calf had died, officials from Mankapur police station confirmed death of only goats. ""The post-mortem will be conducted on Monday. We have collected samples of foodgrains which were found about 100 metres from the carcasses,"" said a police official. He added that cause of the death cannot be confirmed without laboratory reports. ""Stomach of the animals seemed a little bloated. It is also possible the animals died after eating stale food that may have been thrown away by residents,"" said the official.Residents however said a calf and some cows were also found dead. ""Some cattle had died on Saturday while a dead calf and two cows were found on Sunday morning. The cattle owners had disposed of their bodies before police came to the spot,"" said a resident. Corporator of the area Arun Daware said that it could also be a case of revenge killing."

Asirvatham, Tamil Nadu State Coordinator of Citizens for Human Rights Movement (CHRM), told The Hindu that he and Ravi, an advocate from his movement, met the arrested people in prison on Monday.The accused we met in prison claimed they had not carried any axes or rice bags with them for sure. They also denied the police version of how and when they were arrested. They claim that they boarded the unreserved compartment of Garudadri Express bound to Tirupathi from Tiruttani station by 5.20 p.m. on August 4. On arriving at Renigunta an hour later, all Tamil-speaking people in the unreserved compartment were forcibly brought down and arrested. But police claimed that they were all arrested the next day, he said.The 22 axes produced by police, as could be seen in the pictures and images that appeared in media, look brand new and uniform in model. It is unlikely that all the alleged wood cutters would carry brand new axes. Those familiar with the modus operandi of the red sanders smuggling suggest that there was absolutely no place for axes in illegal red sanders cutting.Smugglers supply mechanised saw and rice for food in the forest. Hence, it is unlikely that the so-called woodcutters would carry axes and rice bags with them.For example, Haribabu, one of those arrested, said that he was a lungi vendor from Chennai and he did not even know what red sander was, Mr. Asirvatham claimed."

Usually water is released on June 12 when the level is 90 feet. As per the final verdict of the Cauvery water disputes tribunal, Karnataka should have released 10 tmcft of water to Tamil Nadu but it did not do so.""Even if Karnataka had given 10 tmcft of water, the level in the Mettur dam would have been 61 feet and still the release of water on June 12 would not have been be possible,"" said Jayalalithaa.Exuding confidence that kuruvai cultivation will be carried out in 3 lakh acres using ground water, Jayalalithaa said 4,000 will be provided as 100% subsidy to those who are involved in mechanised cultivation under the system of rice intensification (SRI) method.To help farmers fetch water from bore wells, they will be given 1,000 HDPE pipes (90 mm width and 6 metres length) at full subsidy for which the government will allot 2 crore.The package also includes micronutrients for 50,000 acres identified as micronutrient deficient areas and zinc sulphate for 1 lakh acres to remove the salinity of the land. While the subsidy for micronutrients is 170 per acre, the subsidy for zinc sulphate will be 400 per acre.Free three-phase power supply for 12 hours a day is also part of the package. However, the farmers are demanding 16 to 20 hours of free power supply a day. .The chief minister said the farmers in the areas of Cauvery's tributaries and Kallanai canals had not been take up kuruvai for many years now. They can make a living by cultivating short term pulses on 15,000 acres by using the southwest monsoon, for which they will get a subsidy of 1,400 per acre at a cost of 2.10 crore to the government.The farmers in the Cauvery tail-end area, where the high salinity of water prevents kuruvai cultivation, will be encouraged to cultivate green fodder on 30,000 acres to enrich the soil, for which 5.70 crore will be allotted. The farmers can avail themselves of seeds for the green fodder at 100% subsidy."
58f5ab5f7be9e01a17c9e9e6,"Clot factor availability, cost affect haemophilia treatment",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/visakhapatnam/Clot-factor-availability-cost-affect-haemophilia-treatment/articleshow/51872409.cms,2016-04-18,"Visakhapatnam: With the slightest injury, 26-year-old M Eswara Rao from Etikoppaka village suffers from bleeding, which refuses to clot on its own. He has a tough time getting the clotting factor transfused at blood banks as it's often not available and he has to spend thousands of rupees on his treatment per month since the age of 16. Like him, there are many other patients in the district, who lack the clotting factor in blood and are said to be suffering from haemophilia.Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder, which occurs due to the absence or deficiency of clotting factors in the blood. This hereditary disease affects usually men in whom blood doesn't clot in case of any bleeding injury or even without injury. Repeated spontaneous bleeding inside the joints and muscles of the patient may also occur.On World Haemophilia Day (April 17), medical experts point to the challenges in treating this bleeding disorder, mainly due to the high cost involved in transfusion of anti-haemophilia factor to enable blood clotting. Sometimes non-availability of blood clotting factor in blood banks also poses problems as the government has withdrawn it from Essential Drugs List a few months ago. Awareness about the disease is also inadequate. There are different kinds of haemophilia. The commonest being Haemophilia A, in which the Factor 8 in blood is deficient while in Haemophilia B, factor 9 is deficient and in Haemophilia C, factor 11 is deficient. ""Around 80% of patients suffer from Haemophilia A, while approximately 20% patients suffer from Haemophilia B. It can affect men of any age group. There are around 200 patients registered with us from the four districts of north coastal AP,"" said K Sai Baba, secretary of Haemophilia Society of India, Vizag chapter.Depending on the severity, the disease can be categorised as mild if factor level is more than five per cent. Only occasional bleeding usually related to significant trauma or surgery occurs in such cases. Moderate level refers to presence of 3-5 per cent factor. Spontaneous bleeding is uncommon but occurs after minor trauma or surgery. If the factor level is less than one per cent, spontaneous joint and soft tissue bleeding occurs several times a month and denotes severe and serious level of the disease, explained Dr V Chandrasekharam, president of Vizag Haemophilia Society.""Patients are often burdened by the cost of treatment. Each unit of blood costs Rs 10 and an average adult may require 1,000-1,500 unit per dose in case of bleeding and two such doses need to be given. That means, the cost of factor replacement therapy or transfusion of Factor 8 would cost him Rs 20,000-Rs 30,000 for two doses. With irregular supply of stocks in government blood banks, the problem has aggravated,"" stated Dr Chandrasekharam.If prompt treatment is not given, it may lead to permanent disability. The role of physiotherapists is also important in treatment of haemophilia. ""In the initial stage, physiotherapy help reduce chances of joint deformities, improve muscle strength and coordination, reduce pain, inflammation and time period of recovery. They usually employ soft tissue mobilisation technique and RICE (Resting Icing, Compression and Elevation), which can reduce oedema and increase the blood circulation. However, massaging in case of severe cases is contraindicative,"" averred Dr Rajesh Boyila, physiotherapist at Seven Hills Hospital. Speaking about the treatment options, pathologist and managing director of AS Raja Voluntary Blood Bank Dr A Sugandhi said, ""Transfusion of anti-haemophilia factor through injection to enable blood clotting or factor replacement therapy is the most effective mode of treatment. But the state government had withdrawn Factor 8 from Essential Drugs List a few months ago, which has made procuring the factor free of cost quite difficult. The supply is irregular. However, the government plans to reintroduce it.""""Another option, which is not as effective as factor replacement therapy is injecting cryoprecipitate or a concentrate prepared from fresh frozen plasma continuously for 30-40 days and the cost per day may exceed a few thousands. Lyophilisation (separating the clotting factors from the blood and making them into dry powder) is a third option to preserve factor 8,"" she added."

Another farmer Ch Naga Ganesh of Gandipeta, Makkavaripalem mandal, said, ""My family owns two acres of land and we usually depend on rain water and the small irrigation tank nearby. This year we should have two good crops."""

In Gujarat, families with a monthly income of Rs 324 and below in rural areas and Rs 501 and less in urban areas are termed as living below poverty line.""The government will save Rs 116 crore annually by excluding these 1.58 lakh BPL card holders. If they are prohibited from taking sugar and kerosene through PDS, the government will save another Rs 20 crore and Rs 38 crore in subsidy,"" said a senior civil supplies official.""Government employees feeding off grains meant for poor is criminal.In stark contrast, a survey of 36 villages in Panchmahals and Dahod district revealed 1,800 poorest of poor whose names were missing in the BPL and even Antodaya lists,"" said food rights activist and member of Ann Suraksha Adhikar Abhiyan Neeta Hardikar. Manoj Das, principal secretary, civil supplies and consumer affairs department, confirmed exclusion of 1.58 lakh card holders.He, however, declined to comment if government will bar them from taking benefit under PDS or cancel their BPL cards. ""I cannot comment on it as it is the government's policy decision.""In Gujarat, over 41% children are malnourished and have stunted growth. Yet government employees responsible for implementing welfare schemes for people below poverty line are helping themselves to benefits meant for the poor. This is criminal.

However, nobody is cultivating traditional crops like kodra (eleusine corocana), sariara (amaranth) and kathu (buck wheat), and the number of them growing wheat, barley, red rice and corn too are on the decline.This is because, tempted by greater profits, farmers in this region are now growing vegetables. In some cases, even apple-growers have taken to cultivating vegetables like tomato, cauliflower and cabbage. Global warming having an adverse impact on the yield of apple in region is a major reason behind farmers dumping apple for vegetables.Two decades ago, a majority of the 65,000 hectartes of agriculture land in the district was under paddy, wheat, barley, corn, pulses and other traditional crops. As fruits helped improve the returns for farmers, they started converting agriculture land into fruit orchards. Agriculture department deputy director Rajinder Singh Verma said 'kodra' and most traditional crops had vanished in Kullu.""Very few people are now into wheat, barley and corn cultivation. The graph of these crops is decreasing regularly. Farmers are getting no income from these crops and they are choosing to cultivate only cash crops which have encouraged them to go for vegetable production,"" he said, while talking to TOI."

As the PM's helicopter hovered over the sky, the crowd went mad, ranting the air with ""Modi, Modi, Modi.........""Many in the crowd said they have come only to see and hear Modi. From the dais, Modi said a storm is gaining momentum to 'uproot' the ruling Congress as the election dates are drawing closer.The Prime Minister added that his dream is to ensure that every poor family in the country is provided with a house by 2022 when India celebrates 75th year of its independence. ""A poor person never asks for a palace. He/she just needs a descent house to live. My dream is that no poor family is left without a house by 2022. I know it's a very big task as our country is also big. I will accomplish it even if I have to empty my tijori (exchequer),"" said Modi.He added that the electorate have to give absolute majority to BJP for expediting development in the state. ""Today, America, Japan, Germany and other countries are in praise of India. This has not happened because of Modi. It became possible because of the absolute majority the people of India gave to BJP in 2014. Similarly, if BJP is given absolute majority in the assembly polls, there will be jay jay kar (praise) of Assam, too, across India,"" said Modi.Addressing a packed election rally at Kalinagar, a nondescript village in Hailakandi district, Modi said a total of 32,000 industries were closed down in Assam over the last 15 years during Congress rule. They include micro, small, medium and large industries, including Cachar Paper Mill, the largest one in Asia. He hit out at both former PM Manmohan Singh, an MP from Assam, and CM Gogoi for their failure to develop the state. He said thousands have become jobless due to the closure of the industries. ""I understand that Congress in Assam will suffer due to its sins. You give a befitting reply to the party in the upcoming assembly election by voting out Congress and give a chance to BJP to serve you for the next five years"", said Modi.Launching a scathing attack on Gogoi, he said, ""Last year, Gogoi announced a Rs 1000-crore package for the Barak Valley. This time, he has announced another Rs 3000-crore package for this valley. However, not a single penny came here. Otherwise, the condition of this region must have changed.""Modi, during his speech, said his fight is not against chief minister Tarun Gogoi, but against poverty. The Prime Minister added that despite four major rivers flowing through the region, there's problem of drinking water in the area. He said 2,800 villages in Assam have no electricity. The number is 28,000 in India. ""After coming to power, my government has started major electrification drive and it's a big success over the past one and half years"", Modi said. He said Gogoi must not politicize the subsidized rice made available to the poor at Rs 3/kg by the Centre. Enthused by massive participation of people in the rally, Modi said if Sarbananda Sonowal (BJP's chief ministerial candidate) becomes the chief minister, there will be 'anand hi anand' in Assam.Modi said he had promised broad gauge rail link to the Barak Valley before the last parliamentary election and he did it. Now, three trains are running between Silchar and other parts of the country."

From using it to serving puffed rice to making people to junk it, copies of the MoUs were symbolically destroyed.Tourism minister R V Deshpande told TOI from Goa that the protests are based on unfounded apprehensions and that the government is not privatizing VAG, something that the Tasveer Foundation has also reiterated on many occasions.

Karnataka is the last big state in the country where the Congress rules and the party is keen to retain power in the 2018 assembly poll.The Karnataka model, however, is different from the Amma canteen, as only a pre-fixed night meal will be provided at a nominal cost of Rs 5 through mobile vans set up in night shelters, bus stands, hospitals and railway stations. The food will be served - hot and cooked - only for a fixed span of an hour, each night.""There are thousands of homeless and migrants in Bengaluru. We estimate that we will have to feed about 10,000 to 20,000 people a day,"" said Congress state unit working president Dinesh Gundu Rao, who has just stepped down as the state's food and civil supplies minister. ""These are people without ration cards or documents, though we will not be asking for any detail from anyone to feed them. It is a mandate of the food department to ensure hunger-free Karnataka and this is a step towards that.""Rao, who has successfully implemented the Congress' Anna Bhagya scheme to provide rice at Rs 1/kg across the state, felt this project would generate a lot of goodwill for the party and the government.

Hundreds of people eat in the canteens daily, creating an anxiety among them over the fate of these eateries if there was change of government in the state. However, the success of Amma canteens has forced even the major opposition party DMK to include the scheme in its manifesto.But 'Amma' will be rechristened as 'Anna', named after former chief minister Annadurai, if DMK comes to power.The first 10 Amma canteens in the city were started in 2013. Madurai got its 11th canteen in Government Rajaji Hospital in 2014.The 12th canteen was launched at Sundararajapuram on May 24, 2015. Among the 12 canteens run by the Madurai Corporation, those at K Pudur, Santhaipet, Tiruparankundram and Melavasal have received ISO certification.For hundreds of poor workers, Amma canteens are like boons from heaven.

It is high time for the government to neglect the voice of the rural population, hence we have named the campaign as Gram Aawaz,"" said Amit Jogi.As per the seven points proposed by junior Jogi, state government should sanction 35 kg rice for every Below Poverty Line (BPL) household. This has been suggested in view of the drought conditions in the state. Chhattisgarh government is already providing rice at Rs one and Rs two per kg to people of Antyodaya and BPL category respectively. The second point in Jogi's letter includes the exemption of loans of farmers. ""The state government must exempt loans of farmers.

Having delivered on his 2006 promise of free colour TV sets, this time the DMK sought to move from the voter's drawing room to the kitchen with the promise of free mixies or grinders -whichever the woman of the house chose.Also up for grabs were free laptops for SCST students and 35kg of free rice for families below the poverty line.Three days later, AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa beat Karunanidhi at his game: Why choose between a mixie and a grinder, she told voters, take both. As Karunanidhi sweated over a counter strategy, Amma offered each household a fan too.What followed was a tit-for-tat, as the electorate watched with glee. But with Jayalalithaa unbundling her sop bag overflowing with free rice, laptops for all senior students and gold for women, there were no prizes for guessing the winner. And with the AIADMK government delivering the doles, even adding goats to the goodies, the manifesto was redefined as a popular document.So, today, the making of the manifesto is serious business in political war rooms. Parties constitute panels with senior members and external experts, including economists, to brainstorm; the media and voters wait curiously for the highlights. DMK's this time is a two-part manifesto, with glossy pages and multi-colour text under heads of sectors and districts. While the party's proposals on education, health and welfare have mostly been glossed over, the mention of free smartphones has got the eyeballs.IIT economics professor M Suresh Babu sees the newfound importance of manifestos as a sign of sopdriven, competitive politics. ""Parties have realised that promises matter more than vision, especially with on, especially with the middle-class, to bring about an electoral swing. Earlier, party cadres delivered on promises and report cards, now manifestos do it,"" says Babu.In the process, he notes, the relevance of welfare has been hijacked by freebies. ""It's unfortunate that a large part of the public discussions on manifestos are about freebies."" And here is the danger of mistaking freebies for welfare measures, and proposals with long-lasting welfare potential not being debated.Observer and retired Madras HC judge K Chandru doesn't think people take manifestos seriously , but agrees freebies have an impact, sometimes unexpected.""DMK gained from promising TV sets in 2006, but later analysts concluded that it lost the 2011 polls as the same TV sets beamed programmes showing the negatives of the government,"" he says.But do freebies amount to bribing voters? Chandru draws attention to a petition by Subramaniya Balaji, an advocate who sought a ban on freebies in manifestos as they amounted to illegal gratification.The Supreme Court bench headed by then Chief Justice P Sathasivam rejected the petition and held that they are similar to the directive principles of state policy found under Part IV of the Constitution. It extracted the election manifesto of AIADMK (2009).The court held that the Election Commission should take a call. Though the poll panel issued notice to parties, nothing came of it.Implementing the DMK's 2016 manifesto would cost TN an additional Rs 70,000 crore, 70% of the state's revenue. If you think that is impossible, wait for Amma's manifesto."

This is the Yum Brands-owned company's second attempt at readyto-eat packaging after edible coffee cups in UK.""This is an India-first innovation and may be adopted in KFC's global markets,"" said Rahul Shinde, MD of KFC India. Rice Bowlz is one of the best-sellers on KFC's menu here and contributes around 5-6% to its domestic revenues while fried chicken contributes more than 50%.KFC will pilot the project in Bengaluru, keeping in mind the Karnataka govern ment's ban on plastic that was imposed last month.Globally, food scientists have been trying to come up with edible packaging in an effort to curb waste. It is estimated that around $12 billion worth of recyclable, post-consumer packaging is wasted annually .However, edible packaging can be expensive too. ""We will not charge more for our edible bowls,"" said Shinde. ""We will wait for consumer response and depending on the pace of adoption, we may roll the concept out to other items on our menu.""Shinde said the company has invested heavily in its innovation team and the edible bowl was a result of it. Other items from India that have been adopted in KFC's global markets are KFC Chizza and KFC Krushers. While KFC sales declined 1% year-on-year in the quarter ended March with westernstyle foods witnessing a slump, the QSR chain plans to foray into tier III cities in the near future to boost consumption, according to Shinde."

All BPL families or eligible families will be included for benefits under the NFSA.''While launching the scheme, CM Anandiben Patel had claimed, ""The number of beneficiaries receiving wheat at Rs2 per kg and rice at Rs3 per kg was only 1.88 crore during rule of the Congress party, but pro-people policies of Bharatiya Janata Party has increased that number to include 3.82 crore people.""According to the latest policy decision, the facility, which was earlier available only to Below Poverty Level (BPL) families, has now been extended to more people belonging to priority list.

Khobragade, who was once a marginal farmer, is known for invention of his high yielding HMT brand of paddy.Dadaji Khobragade (70) was a marginal farmer having only three acres of land, when in 1983 he began breeding new variety of rice and in span of few years developed a variety that gave much higher yield compared to that of conventional one. By 1989 higher yield with newly developed HMT variety of rice gained high acclamation and its demand skyrocketed in no time. He was even named in the Forbes' list of seven most powerful rural Indian entrepreneurs, whose 'inventions are changing lives' of the people across the country.Back in November 2010, when TOI had highlighted dismal economic condition of Khobragade after his name was included in Forbes' list, government stepped in to extend a helping hand to the aggrieved paddy researcher. The then deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar himself visited Dadaji Khobragde at his home in Nanded village to meet him. The Nationalist Congress Party had given him monetary aid of Rs1 lakh and party had later gifted him five acres of land to continue his research.So far, Khobragade has received 12 awards for his research. It includes Rashtrapati award, state government's Krushi Bhushan award and the award given by National Innovative Foundation for his contribution in the field of agriculture. Various state governments including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana have felicitated Khobragade for his achievements. His HMT variety of paddy is cultivated in more than one lakh hectares of land in five states.Taking cognisance of his great achievement, state board of textbook production and curriculum research has included Dadaji Khobragade's chapter in Marathi textbook of Std VI. The chapter has details of efforts taken by Khobragade for invention of HMT variety of rice."

He was also MLA from Satgachia constituency. A little over 50 kms south of Kolkata, today Satgachia remembers Jyoti Babu well but perhaps not very fondly. ""I used to see him at election time, giving speeches in the maidan. But he hardly ever came here. He used to say, 'I am the chief minister of all of Bengal, why should I favour Satgachia just because its my constituency?'"" remembers 77 year old Premchand Deshmukh, a former jute mill worker.Bustling town markets and idyllic village scenes make up Satgachia's picturesque landscape. Dotted with ponds and fields, shaded with coconut, palm, banana and supari trees, krishnachura flowers in full bloom, Satgachia could be the ideal pastoral water colour.Satgachia was one of the first CPM bastions to fall to the Trinamool in 2001, part of the great momentum in which Red stalwarts fell like ninepins in Mamata's anti Left purge. In 2014, 9-time CPM winner Basudeb Acharia humiliatingly lost Bankura to actor Moon Moon Sen. In Barrackpore the 20 year reign of CPM heavyweight Tarit Baran Topdar was brought down by the TMC's Dinesh Trivedi. Satgachia too is part of that pattern. Today the constituency has been represented 3 times by the TMC's Sonali Guha. ""When we ring her up even late at night, she always comes rushing. We could never think of doing that with Jyoti Babu,"" says medical doctor Sheikh Arab Ali. ""He was like a rainbow. We could look at him but not touch him.""""Can anyone forget the great Jyoti Basu?"" asks former Jute mill worker Shankar Pramanik. ""He created something in Satgachia out of nothing. But its the Trinamool which has given us pakka roads, tubewells, ambulance services and a hospital. Jyoti Basu only started the drinking water plant which was completed by the Trinamool.""Left cadres ruled Satgachia with an iron grip from 1996 to 2001, a control that was so total that Jyoti Basu could win in 1977, 82,87,93, 98 without even spending too much time here. The constituency was managed by his deputy Gokul Bairagi, a widely disliked figure who subsequently contested and lost against the TMC. The only photos or remembrances of Jyoti Basu in Satgachia are in the CPM office. Black and white snaps of the forbidding Red supremo in all his stern unsmiling hauteur hang on the walls although the new generation of party workers say they don't remember him at all.""We don't really remember Jyoti Basu, but we do know that when he started representing Satgachia there was nothing here,"" says 28 year old CPM zonal in charge Bishwanath Panja. ""There was never a corruption syndicate in his time as there is now. Jyoti Basu never pushed himself here because the Left doesn't believe in personality cults the way the TMC does.""Tarun Ray, zila parishad official and TMC member says during Jyoti Basu's time the residents of Satgachia were constantly deprived. ""There was no electricity. When the power went off, we would all say Jyoti Basu chole gelen. We saw electricity as rarely as we saw Jyoti Basu."" That is why, he says, TMC wins today by 25,000 to 30,000 votes.Lack of personal contact with voters, reliance on the party machine to deliver victories, a zealous attachment to de-humanising ideology, the familiar pattern of the Left's joyless pulverizing politics plays out in Satgachia as well. Remembers 74 year old Binarani Naskar, ""Jyoti babu had a lot of stamina, he used to walk very fast. But he never sat with us or drank chai with us. Only CPM workers used to control our lives. Today when Mamata comes here she talks to us.""The consistent complaint from Satgachia residents is the lack of job opportunities. Says resident Ankur Bera, ""people in Satgachia are still living by farming and agriculture. There is only one Birla jute mill nearby and that too we never know when its closed or open. There are two schools. But where will young educated people go for jobs?""Voters here say they are proud that Satgachia was Jyoti Babu's constituency although they never felt they belonged to him. ""The Left did not believe in joga-jog (personal contact) with people. Jyoti Babu would come by helicopter and leave,"" says schoolteacher Aparna Pramanik. ""The footsoldiers of the Left were horrible,"" remembers Sheikh Afzal Durji, ""they can never win again here.""In the 'lal durg' or red fortress of Satgachia, today the Trinamool is triumphant. Says farmer Paresh Manna, 70, ""We get rice for Rs 2 from the TMC. The Left used to talk about big things but never did anything."" Says local journalist Kunal Malik, ""If Leftists are supposed to care about the poor then Didi is the true Leftist."""

The celebrations began on a very traditional note, with the sighting of kani, an assortment of auspicious things seen first in the day, prayers, temple visits and preparation of sadhya at homes. Thursday, which was a public holiday, also saw a few new Tamil releases.Many Tamil families arranged kani, consisting of fruits and some gold jewellary in a large bowl with a mirror behind it, in their puja rooms on Wednesday night itself. The gold was placed in the bowl in a manner that it was right in front of the mirror. ""People wake up with their eyes closed and walk straight to the puja room. It is important to sight the reflection of gold first in the mirror,"" said Veerakesava Iyer, priest at Vinayakar temple in Saibaba Colony.Malayalis, who celebrated Vishu, too arranged the kani on Wednesday night in a metal vessel called ""urali"", with mirror, betel leaves, areca nut, yellow flowers, pumpkin, rice grains and plantains in it in front of an idol of Lord Krishna. The children were given gifts or ""vishukaineettam"", which is usually gold coins or jewellery or money.After the sighting of kani, many families visited temples. All the major temples in Peelamedu, R S Puram, Saibaba Colony and Papanaickenpalayam were packed with crowd. The crowd retreated to the confines of their houses by around 11am to escape the heat and enjoy the holiday indoors. ""We usually play cricket or football in Shastri Maidan on all public holidays, but today it is too hot to do anything else but sit inside an air-conditioned room. We will probably watch some cricket highlights and IPL later in the evening,"" said Vishal Ramkumar, an engineering student."

The duo, later identified as Rakesh Jhodape and Sanjay Pantawane, had decamped with Rs 670 cash and a mobile phone from complainant Nirmal Ekka who was also assaulted with a sharp blade and stones and beaten up.Ekka, who ended up near Pachpaoli railway crossing after having lost his way, had heard one of the robbers addressing his accomplice as 'Baba' while they were robbing him. This clue helped police crack the case. Pachpaoli police station's detection branch comprising constables Roshan Tiwari, Rajesh Deshmukh and others under Senior PI Raju Bahadure and Asst PI Arjun Ghodepatil rounded up Jhodape after learning through their informers that he was known by nickname 'Baba'.Baba spilled the beans about involvement of Pantawane. It is learnt that Baba and Pantwane are addicted to liquor. They got an easy prey in Ekka whom they robbed to pay for liquor. Police said Baba had around eight offences against him, mostly relating to thefts and burglaries. Police are yet to find any record against Pantawane. Jhodape and Pantawane had dragged Ekka behind some shrubs at a desolate place before robbing him. An injured Ekka, native of Umrer tehsil, approached Pachpaoli police station after managing to free himself from the robbers.Senior PI Raju Bahadure of Pachpaoli police station said Jhodape and Pantawane were immediately rounded up but they confessed to the crime after a few hours.

Year after year, it has been doling out false promises. Rate of prevalence of poverty in rural Odisha is really disturbing. Average monthly income of 88 per cent of rural households in the State is less than Rs.5,000.The government had assured to provide minimum 200 days of work to daily wage earners under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act while in reality, the government was unable to make 50 days of work available to needy people, Mr. Harichandan alleged.The government had so far paid Rs.1.5 crore to lawyers in the past 10 years to protect the Naveen Patnaik government which is neck deep in corruption in mining sector. The government has been shielding chit fund scamsters while lakhs of victims have been left in the lurch, Mr. Harichandan said.Similarly, State BJP president Basant Panda charged the BJD government had failed the farmer community of the State.With the government shying away from its responsibility, many farmers, who lost their produce due to drought, had not option, but to end their lives. While tragedy was unfolding before it, the government remained silent spectator, said Mr. Panda.In the past 16 years, the government was consistently trying to modify central schemes and brand them as its own schemes.

Trade sources say that prices of fodder may go tur dal way with bulk dealers wanting to cash in on the shortage by hoarding the stocks. Rates this year began on a higher side due to shortage of cotton, which is used to make seed cakes  a major cattle feed. But eventually it is the demand of cotton seeds which is pulling the rates for cotton.Cotton prices crossed Rs5,000 a quintal recently due to the demand for cotton seeds and not yarn. Even as cotton prices have gone up in India, the international rates have remained stable at 68 cents. It is not the farmer who is benefiting due to high cotton rates as most of the stock has been disposed of. It is the traders' turn to profit.At the local fodder stores, cotton seeds with oil are being priced at Rs2,750 a quintal as against Rs2,200 a quintal three months ago. De-oiled cakes are now priced at Rs2,200 a quintal as against Rs1,900 in January. Other types of fodder made out of tur, wheat and rice bran are also up by Rs300 to 400 a quintal. The spurt in rates of cotton seed based fodder has increased the rates of other types of cattle feed, say sources.Farmers have already begun complaining that the procurement price they get from dairy operators is not enough to cover their expenses. TOI had reported the rising trend in fodder rates on January 15 this year. The rates have further gone up by 25% since then.Traders are strongly seeing a cartel by bulk dealers who have been piling up stocks in the light of the shortage. Hinganghat, the cotton growing area in Wardha, caters to the de-oiled cake demand for the entire state. The rates in places like drought-hit Marathwada are expected to be much higher due to transportation cost, said a source.""Dairies offer an average rate of Rs26 a litre but the expenditure comes to around Rs27 to Rs28 a litre. ""We have no choice because all the dairies quote the same rate,"" said Munbhai Bharwad, a herdsman from Butibori.NP Hirani of Maharashtra State Cotton Growers Federation said this year the final estimates show that cotton production is down by 50 lakh quintals to 320 lakh quintals. However, he said it is the demand for cotton seeds to make fodder which is driving the rates of cotton now. There is hardly any demand for cotton yarn as there is abundant stock with China and exports are down.Roshan Kothari, director of Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Wani, said the seeds are in demand for making fodder. The prices have already reached a peak and this may hit the consumption."

Major foodgrains and certain foods will be available here.To begin with, the outlet will be open from 7 to 9pm. But gradually, its duration will be extended to eight hours. Tanmay Joshi from Beejotsav told TOI that besides grains like wheat, rice, jowar, pulses like tur, gram, lakhodi dal, honey, jaggery, products made from ambadi like sharbat etc, flax chutney will be available in the shop. The pulses and rice will be completely unpolished.""We would also be keeping seeds of the grains and pulses for the benefit of farmers. This is an additional feature of our outlet,"" said Joshi.As expected, the cost of all the products will naturally be higher than the market price. But the price will be fixed by the farmer who would be supplying produce to the shop. Beejotsav Group will be procuring the products from various farmers in the region and hence there could be a difference in price of the same grain at different times. But there will not be any compromise on quality and all products will be completely organic, he said.Oils will also be made available in the shop. Initially, there will be just groundnut oil. It will be totally unprocessed and non-refined and will be produced using expeller technique as compared to the conventional solvent extraction techniques.For Khadi lovers, the outlet will also be keeping various types of khadi fabric. This too is an additional feature which is not available in other organic outlets, Joshi said."

Here is a glimpse of what goes in the green room before a performanceResplendent makeup, vibrant costumes, magnificent headgear and a majestic appearance  these are images the word Kathakali brings to mind. But for the artistes, when they essay gods, legendary kings, asuras and rakshasas, the makeup and costumes become the only way to truly represent these superhuman figures in all their splendour and glory.That's precisely why the makeup and costumes are of prime significance. It's no joke then that the performers spend close to four hours getting into the skin of the character even before essaying it onstage.As Kalamandalam Ravikumar gears up to essay the character of Jarasandha in the play Rajasooyam at Changampuzha Park, Ernakulam, we follow him through the three-stage process:The first step has him applying basic facial paintings using a coconut leaf splinter. As he is essaying a kathi character, he paints a basic jawline in green and his forehead markings in red.Theppu:The first step has him applying basic facial paintings using a coconut leaf splinter. As he is essaying a kathi character, he paints a basic jawline in green and his forehead markings in red.Chutti:The real work is then done by the chuttikaaran or the make-up man. He applies the chutti, a white paper trimming for the face that draws attention to the actor's face. For kathi roles, curved trimmings and white paste of rice flour and lime are attached to either side of the actor's jawline, adding to the grandeur of the character. He then draws the white borders around the red markings and applies green to the rest of the face. Ravikumar adds the final touches himself. He then sticks on the white globes on his nose and forehead. Once he completes the facial makeup, he inserts the harmless seed of chundapoovu on the lower eyelid. This reddens his eyes. The entire second stage takes close to two hours.Uduthukettu:The next stage has him adorning the costume. It starts with him putting on a pyjama and leather bell straps. Later, with the help of three others, a long cloth called kacha is used to tie close to 40 pieces of short cloth around the artiste. This gives the well-pleated skirt or njori a bulbous shape. He then puts on the red overcoat. The costume attendant ornaments Ravikumar with garlands of beads, shoulder accessories, shawls, armlets and jewellery. Finally, he is handed the elaborately embellished headgear. The artiste remembers his gurus before he puts it on. He then wears his silver nails on the right hand before stepping on stage.HUES OF THE ARTThe variety of colours used for the Kathakali make up are all obtained from natural substances and herbs. Mineral stones such as cinnabar or chayilyam and manayola are powdered for red and yellow, respectively. For green, the chuttikaaran adds neelam powder to the manayola in appropriate proportion using coconut oil as the base. Kohl is used for painting black. The chutti paste is made by mixing rice flour and lime while chenchilyam, the gum of the maruthu tree, is used as a natural adhesive and protects the skin from burns."

The Institute of Microbial Technology (Imtech) has sequenced the megagenomic data of microbes coexisting with basmati rice. With this, scientists have opened a big window of opportunity in this tiny white speck. They say that with access to such a data, there can be huge possibilities of new research to increase rice plant output and quality Megagenomics imply large-scale genetic data and sequencing of bacteria. One bacteria has around 5,000 genes and scientists at Imtech have sequenced genomes of 100 such bacteria. Imtech is one of 37 laboratories of Council of Scientific and Industrial Re search (CSIR) in Chandigarh.""The new data can also lead to research in using lesser resources like water and land to grow rice -a staple for almost half the world's population,"" said Prabhu B Patil , lead author of the study.In India, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh , Delhi, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar are major basmati cultivating states. India's export of basmati rice fetches between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 40,000 crore annually.""The data can be a boon for farmers if it can identify those microbes of the grain which makes the crop drought, disease and shattering (during harvesting 1015% of the grains fall off) resistant,"" said Rameshwar Singh, project director, Directorate of Knowledge Management in Agriculture, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Delhi.It is believed that with the chemical and artificial treatment of rice, the original or native bacteria that coexisted with the plant had been suppressed. Exploitation of this genomic data might restore the native bacterial consortium as was in millions of years ago.Plants are host to numerous microbes that co-evolved over millions of years. These natural microbes in turn aid development and protection of plants in diverse climatic conditions. ""Analysis of bioinformatics by an expert can become valuable source for further research. Imtech has shown a new direction to the world. It is a breakthrough when the world is talking about food security,"" said Girish Sahni, director general CSIR.Patil's group at Imtech has published the `The rice microbiome' in Frontiers in Microbiology. It is the first megagenome database of seed microbiome of any plant. ""We have sequenced genome of bacteria found in basmati seeds. These bacteria would be contributing to boost rice's immunity to fight against diseases and other stressful conditions like less water etc,"" said Patil.While genome data of many plants is available, the microbial megagenomic resource of only a plant weed -Arabidopsis thaliana was sequenced earlier. The data generated by Patil's group is the first megagenomic information of microbes associated with an economically important plant.Samriti, who is the first author of the megagenomic study , along with Kanika Bansal, both PhD scholars associated with Patil at Imtech, is carrying forward this work."
