Ahead of the Euro 2016 final between Portugal and France on Sunday, proprietor Eusebio D'Souza - himself named after Portugal's greatest footballer of all time before Cristiano Ronaldo - is now pulling out the posters but will not be able to give his restaurant the look that made it so popular with football enthusiasts.""It will be such an exciting night. Our hearts will always beat for Portugal,"" said Eusebio.Eusebio's father, Moti, started the restaurant in 1964 and named it after his daughter; he also started an inter-village football tournament called Marietta Cup and until his death four years ago, was among Portugal's most ardent supporter in the state, naming dishes after footballers. Portugal's superstar players, and those from Brazil, grabbed attention while fish, curry and rice was named after local favourite, Bruno Coutinho.""Goa is supporting Portugal. Wherever I go, everyone tells me that they are confident that Portugal will win its first major football trophy. Of course we know what happened at Euro 2004 but this night could be different,"" said Coutinho, former India captain and Arjuna awardee.As Bruno pointed out, this tiny coastal state is gripped by football fever and as Portugal take on the might of hosts France in what was predicted an unlikely final, fans are not surprisingly rooting for their former colonial rulers. The Portuguese ruled Goa for over 400 years until the early 1960s.""Goa has a close bond with Portugal. Over the years, Goa has had several tie-ups with Portugal and when it comes to football, they've always offered to help. Goa's support for Portugal, at least for the Euro final, will be total,"" said Savio Messias, president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) and former secretary of the Goa Football Association (GFA), the body that was started by the Portuguese to govern football in the state.""I've always been fascinated with the way Portugal play. It's pleasing to the eye. As a kid I saw Portuguese play football and since then the love affair continues,"" said Goa's first Arjuna awardee Brahmanand Shankhwalkar.His daughter, Vaishnavi, will stay awake on Sunday night to back Portugal despite not being a football fan, and brother Ravindra forever keeps Portugal close to his heart: his mobile's ring tone is A Portuguesa, the Portuguese national anthem.Portugal's passage to the final is good for business too. Atish Angley, who runs a sports goods shop, confirms Portugal's jersey are selling like hot-cakes.""The only problem is I don't have enough. Nobody thought they would reach so far,"" he said.Despite boasting great players down the years, Portugal have never won a World Cup or European crown. That could all possibly change on Sunday, and even if it does not, Goa's love-affair with Portugal will continue."
58f5ba7aa3d24b0b70c2444b,She is a study in self-sufficiency,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/she-is-a-study-in-selfsufficiency/article8665185.ece,2016-05-30,"K. Nagajothi of P. Subbulapuram in Peraiyur taluk of Madurai district is a phenomenon in self-sufficiency. The 55-year-old woman, who has studied up to SSLC, is good at multitasking  she is a farmer, entrepreneur, trainer, leader and, above all, a homemaker.The mother of three practises 100 per cent organic farming in her 8.5-acre farm at Chinna Reddiyapatti, provides value addition to her produce and also makes food products. Whenever she finds time, Ms. Nagajothi joins other villagers in deepening the local tank under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Like any rural household, Ms. Nagajothi and her husband V. Kanagasundaram, her classmate, were struggling to make a living with a meagre farm income. After attending motivational and training programmes, I decided to adopt organic farming in my land in 2001. My husband was for use of chemical inputs and, at one point of time, even threatened to walk out of home if I continued with organic farming. On seeing the results, he is now my partner in progress, says a proud Ms. Nagajothi.Their farm resembles a kind of oasis in a village where use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is the norm. We do not use even one per cent of chemical input. When there was a recent pest attack on maize, I suggested an organic insecticide to fellow farmers. They made fun of me, saying that I was suggesting rasam for a crop. But they could not believe their eyes when their crop withered and ours was ready for harvest.Integrated farmingMs. Nagajothi practises integrated farming while raising tur dal, millets like thinai and kuthiraivaali, green gram and maize. She hires herds of goats and uses her own cows to provide manure to the rain-fed farm. She prepares organic ingredients at home to ward of pests. We do not hire farm hands for deweeding. I and my husband do it ourselves. Like in many places, P. Subbulapuram also faces shortage of farm hands.The cost of harvest has gone up now. However, it is essential to have workers during harvest. We hire vehicles to transport them to the farm, she says. She does not depend on machinery for processing the produce. She has hand grinders at home on which she works and hires people for work on contract.Last month, she, along with a few other women, processed one quintal of tur dal using hand grinders. The organic nature and hand processing add value and taste to pulses and millets, she says. On an average, Ms. Nagajothi processes 25 kg of dal or small millets a day. Mr. Kanagasundaram says that they have planned to buy a machine to dehull small millets.In between, Ms. Nagajothi makes eatables from rice and millets, which have become famous in the region. Mr. Kanagasundaram, who sells the products on his bicycle, says, We do not do it for profit. I give away eatables for free whenever I come across crying children.The couple have married off their two daughters and their only son is waiting to join a postgraduate course. The money they earn is enough to run the family. Immediately after marriage, I pledged all my jewels in a cooperative bank. I could redeem them only when the government announced a loan waiver. Today, there is no need for me to approach lending institutions.Pamayyan, an expert in organic farming, feels that there is immense scope for developing small millet cultivation in the region. During the British period, the area around T. Kallupatti was double taxed for the fertile soil. He points to the couple as a classic example of how farming can be made profitable with value addition and marketing. They have planned their lives without any significant help from outside, he says.Madurai-based Dhan Foundation, in association with the Government of Canada, has launched a project in the country to encourage cultivation of small millets.It is focussing on T. Kallupatti and Peraiyur areas in Madurai district for the formation of farmers producer organisations. N. Karthikeyan, who is involved in the project, says that the objective is to support access to better performing varieties and production technologies; marketing of produce and processing."

Similarly, the plan to provide food for voters also came to nothing at these polling stations.Due to the confusion the token system was withdrawn from polling station number 35 at Government LP school, Vennala, in Thrikkakara constituency.""We give 50 tokens to women voters. In this system, two women get the chance to vote first followed by one male voter. Since voters were not used to this, it resulted in confusion and delay, and within a few minutes the queue of voters had increased. So we decided to drop the token system,"" said an electoral official at the polling station.The polling station has 1,588 voters. ""We had planned to serve food to voters. Voters are urged to exercise their franchise and, later, to have food. We had bought rice flour and other material to cook food. But the cook didn't turn up,"" booth president K M Aboobacker said.A model polling station should have facilities like 'pandals', chairs, resting room, drinking water and give special consideration to senior citizens and expecting mothers. Five polling stations in each constituency were turned into model stations by the district administration. One of them was to be exclusively run by women officials.But the experience turned out to be no different for voters at SRV LP School in Ernakulam constituency as electoral officials withdrew the token system due to heavy rains.The district had a total of 71 model polling stations."

However, the delay in implementing the order by cooperative banks has put farmers in the delta region in distress.Due to this delay, farmers who had taken loans in 2007-2008 are still adjudged defaulters and are not eligible for new loans from the cooperative banks. The farmers are ready to take up kuruvai cultivation for which they rely on crop loans from the same banks.""If the process for loan waiver had commenced soon after the CM's announcement, the problem would not have arisen. Without getting any official communication from higher officials, the heads of cooperative banks are unable to identify beneficiaries of the waiver and make it public,"" said Trichy district secretary of Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai Sivasuriyan.The chief minister had also allotted 40 crore to provide 4,000 as 100 per cent subsidy to those involved in mechanised cultivation process under systematic rice intensification (SRI) method in the special package for kuruvai due to uncertainty over the release of water in the Cauvery on June 12. However, farmers say that the amount will not be enough to meet the needs of all farmers taking up kuruvai this year.""The subsidy of 4,000 per acre is a meagre amount. Loans alone can save them. Besides the defaulters, fresh applicants also cannot avail of the loan now. This will force them to take loans from private banks,"" said state spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Sangam N Veerasekaran in Trichy who recalled a similar situation when the DMK government announced waiver of loans in 2006.Farmers were able to get around 23,000 loan for paddy and around 50,000 for sugarcane from cooperative banks. Now, they expect 30,000 for paddy and 60,000 for sugarcane.Besides the paddy farmers, sugarcane farmers have also been affected by the delay. ""It is a bad time for sugarcane farmers who are in debt after the delay in payment from sugar mills. Now, the cooperative banks have also delayed the loan process citing the waiver. Considering the plight of the farmers, we appeal to the CM to take quick action to solve the issue,"" said Swamimalai Vimalanathan, district secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers' Protection Association."
58f5bb1e7be9e01a17c9fb05,Tigur species under threat from African catfish,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Tigur-species-under-threat-from-African-catfish/articleshow/53052396.cms,2016-07-05,"Panaji : The local aquatic ecosystem is increasingly facing threat due to the uncharted growth of invasive fish species, especially African sharptooth catfish. The situation is further precipitated due to general ignorance about the menace posed by the fish species and its resemblance to Goa's tigur species.Clarias gariepinus, as it is known by its scientific name, is an airbreathing exotic catfish that also belongs to Clariidae family of Goan catfish (tigur). During the monsoon season, it appears in fish catches from rivers, creeks, channels, khazan lands and even from rice fields.A study by fisheries scientists of Indian council of agricultural research-central coastal agricultural research institute (ICAR-CCARI), Old Goa raises a concern about this exotic species posing a threat to the local fish biodiversity and sustainability of the aquatic ecosystems.The hardy fish can breed easily in tough conditions, as it feeds on all types of food. It also appears to be a voracious predator.""It is a major menace as it disturbs the natural trophic status of the ecosystem and deprives other native species of their food and breeding space and it also feeds on these fishes,"" scientist, fisheries science, ICAR-CCARI, Manju Leskhmi N said.The numbers of the invasive fish species grow fast and it proliferates easily in all ecosystems due to its high fecundity and survival rate. ""One individual can release 4 lakh eggs in a single season,"" scientist, fisheries science, ICAR-CCARI, Sreekanth GB said.In comparison, the local tigur species (Clarias batrachus) has a lower fecundity, in the range of 7,000 to 15,000. Goan catfish population may have depleted in recent years due to the presence of the exotic species as also other reasons, but there has been no study to asses these aspects.""African catfish preys on local aquatic species and may greatly deplete in future all native species from the ecosystem,"" director, ICAR-CCARI, N P Singh said.African catfish can grow up to 1.7m and normally matures at 90cm. Breeding in swampy, shallow water bodies with soft muddy substratum, its maximum reported age is 15 years.""Once these species enter the natural ecosystem, it may be very difficult to control their proliferation because they are more resilient and reproduce faster than native species,"" Sreekanth said.Catches have also been reported from Carambolim lake during the last three years. ""During the last week of June, we caught six individuals for our studies from small water channels in the ICAR complex linked to the Carambolim lake,"" Lekshmi said.The invasive species is suspected to have spread in Goan waters after being introduced clandestinely in ponds by aquaculturists for commercial production.""Other persons and fishermen may be propagating this species in their wells and ponds due to its resemblance to tigur, least knowing that it poses a threat to local species,"" Lekshmi said.Conservation biologist, Aaron Lobo, agreed, ""The problem with African catfish is that many people mistake it for tigur. The people need to be educated about its impact on the environment and the health of local ecosystems.""Department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries (DAHD) had banned the rearing of African catfish in 2000 under the Environmental Protection Act, 1986 due to its adverse impact on local fish species and ecology.Director of fisheries Shamila Monteiro said that the invasive fish species impacts local fish population. ""We need to create awareness among people that it is a banned species,"" she said."

""We provide rice at 47 paise per kg, so there is no question of starvation,"" she claimed.Her comment might seem a little contradictory, especially since the tea estates in the Dooars have registered nearly 200 deaths from September last year to January this year, though the government figure pegs it at a much lower 78. Residents of gardens claimed that lack of food, dearth of basic amenities and absence of medical facilities led to the deaths, but the government had all along denied those as reasons. State officials claimed that tea workers' drinking habit led to their ailments and subsequent deaths.In Dooars, seven gardens have been either shut or abandoned, renadering more than 20,000 workers unemplyed and putting the lives of around 80,000 people-workers' families-at stake.This apart, there are 11 more gardens-belonging to the Duncans group-which are neither closed nor open and have in a limbo since February last year.All through her speech, Mamata kept on pointing to the development work done in Bengal over the past five years. ""Only on Sunday that the UN selected Kanyashree as a champion project,"" she claimed.Mamata lashed out at the Congress-LF and BJP-GJM. ""The Congress or CPM hasn't fielded any candidate against the GJM. I will now allow division of Bengal,"" she said."

Seen here, manja at a wholesale kite market in Old Delhi. Photo: Sushil Kumar VermaThe Delhi governments decision to ban Chinese manja has come as welcome news for many in what was once known as the manja city.Bareilly has been the traditional centre for manufacture of the world-famous cotton strings for kite flying. In fact, it is an over 200-year-old traditional business for many here. With the arrival of Chinese manja, which is made of fine nylon, in 2011, the industry began to shrink rapidly. It became difficult for workers engaged in making of cotton manja to make ends meet.However, they now see a ray of hope in Delhi, once a major buyer of cotton manja. This, as the Aam Aadmi Party government told the Delhi High Court that it has decided to ban the nylon string, colloquially called Chinese manja, due to a number of fatal accidents. Chinese manja is not from imported from China, but made by two-three companies in Bengaluru and Noida.Difference in costMohammad Aamir, a Bareilly-based manja manufacturer, said: In just five -six years, Chinese manja dented the cotton manja market. Bareilly ki dor ab utni bikti hi nahi [The Bareilly-made string is no longer sold as much anymore]. There is a difference of at least Rs.700 between the two. While 12 reels of cotton manja cost about Rs.1,100 and above depending on the quality, 12 reels of Chinese manja cost just about Rs.300.He added: Chinese manja is much cheaper and does not break easily as it is made of nylon. It is actually the type of string used in fishing. The string is coated with chemicals to make it tougher and sharper so that it does not break easily. That is why all those freak accidents  including the one of the biker whose throat got slit  are caused by nylon manja. Before its arrival, we had never heard of such accidents. Cotton manja is made from rice flour and a mix of desi masalas and breaks easily.Mr. Aamir explained that cotton manja is laced with powdered glass to make it sharp, but even that breaks more easily compared to Chinese manja.Stressing on the death of a child whose throat got slit by Chinese manja while travelling on a two-wheeler with his father, he said: Those who fear the almighty will not deal in Chinese manja. We are aware of the case initiated by a person for ban on Chinese manja, which is already banned in Bengaluru, Andhra Pradesh, etc.Chinese productsA kite-maker from Bareilly said: The general image is that products from China are cheap, like Chinese toys, bags, etc. When the nylon manja arrived in 2011, it was much cheaper than handmade cotton strings and thus people started calling it Chinese manja.With Independence Day round the corner, Nawab, a kite dealer based in Lal Kuan, Old Delhi, is busy selling Chinese manja and kites these days.I do sell Chinese manja in huge numbers, but there is no doubt that the cotton manja from Bareilly remains unmatched, he added.Meanwhile, an all-India kite flying champion too supported the call for ban on Chinese manja.Banned in kite-flying competitionsSunil Gupta, a member of the citys oldest kite flying club, the Union Kite Club, said the use of Chinese manja is banned in every kite-flying competition across India. All competitors use cotton strings made in Bareilly."

Leaf folder and stem borer, a form of moth and insect larvae, were noticed in rice plantations in Coimbatore, Erode, Dharmapuri, Karur, Thiruvallur, Pudukottai and Tirunelveli districts, said the advisory. ""Farmers are advised to set up light traps to monitor and kill adult months. If further required, farmers can spray neem seed kernel extract or cartap hydrochloride or chlorpyrifos for this problem,"" it said.In all rice growing districts in the state, brown spot incidence was also noticed. ""Hence, farmers are advised to spray Mancozeb two to three times at 10 to 15 day intervals based on the intensity of disease,"" said the advisory.The leafminer incidence was also sporadically recorded in groundnut crops planted in Coimbatore, Erode, Tirunelveli, Ramanthapuram, Pudukottai and Dharmapuri districts. ""Farmers are advised to monitor the insect using light traps. If needed, farmers can spray some neem seed kernel extract,"" said the advisory.The internode borer incidence was also recorded in sugarcane plantations across Coimbatore and Erode. ""Farmers are advised to release the egg parasitoid ""Trichogramma"". Farmers were also advised to set up yellow sticky traps to monitor the pest population and again spray neem seed kernel extract.The university also says there is a strong possibility of sucking pests like papaya mealybug, spiralling whitefly, woolly aphids in pulses, hoppers and mealybugs in cotton attacking agricultural and horticultural crops due to the continuous prevailing drought. ""If any incidence is noted, farmers are requested to release parasitoids for managing this pest,"" said the advisory."

He has more than 2,000 coconut trees in the farm land and resides in a farm house nearby with his wife P Arunlmangai, 55, and his mother Rajalakshmi, 90.Aruchamy, 60, from Aliyar near Pollachi, was the caretaker of farm land, and resides in a small tiled roof house located inside the agricultural land where he had stored two bags of rice bran and PDS rice.On Monday night, a herd of 17 elephants broke open the front door of his tiled roof house and attempted to reach the rice bags kept inside.

Accusing them of inaction, Sonia warned against 'ahankari shaktiyan' (arrogant forces) lurking in Bengal.""We supported Trinamool Congress in 2011after they promised to work for the development of Bengal. However, after coming to power, Mamata dumped all her promises. Now, she is beating her drum on development. What kind of development has taken place in this state? Industries have wound up and unemployment is rampant. Youths are migrating to other states in search of jobs. There is corruption. A flyover came crashing down. People have loan burdens worth thousands of crores on their heads. There is a saying that one fish can foul the entire pond. In West Bengal, the atmosphere has been fouled in such a manner that even the hilsa has fled from its rivers. Now, the state has to import hilsa,"" Sonia said.At Canning in South 24-Parganas, where the majority of the population depends of fishing and agriculture, the Congress chief spoke on how fishermen have suffered under Mamata and Modi.""While Mamata has left the fishermen to their own plight, the BJP at the Centre is snatching their livelihood by allowing foreign trawlers to fish in Indian waters. When the Modi government has been unable to save the country's fish, how can it be expected to protect the borders? The Pathankot incident is an example. Bengal also led the country in rice production. Now, rice mills are closing down and the state has to import rice. Both Mamata and Modi assured jobs but nearly 3 crore people still apply for jobs under MGNREGA every day. This shows that there are no jobs. All that the Modi government has done is cut allocations for our policies for women and backward classes,"" Sonia added.According to her, the Modi government is a threat to democracy, secularism and the multi-cultural ethos of the country. She claimed that it was the Congress that set up institutions that made the country great over 60 years of its rule. These institutions are now at threat from organisations like the RSS, she alleged. ""Before the Trinamool came to power, they begged for votes. Now, they are threatening people to vote for them. Both Mamata and Modi are two faces of the same coin. They will destroy the state. Do not fall into their trap. We are fighting the elections with the Left this time for the development of West Bengal,"" Sonia said."

Farmers of DMK president M Karunanidhi's Tiruvarur district, the rice bowl of the state, say the distress is too acute as farming has failed in successive years.A political solution to the long-standing Cauvery water dispute is their main demand. Most farmers in the district are daily wage earners, who are unable to eke out a living from their own land holdings measuring an acre or two. But their debts range from a few thousand to a couple of lakh rupees.""The promise to waive agricultural bank loans is welcome, but it will largely benefit the rich farmers who own large tracts of land and have debts running to the tune of several lakh rupees,"" said Govindaraj who owns two acres and owes 50,000 to a local bank. Some farmers alleged that in anticipation of DMK's loan waiver promise, some big landlords in the three delta districts - Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam - in connivance with bank officials, had taken hefty agri loans.To improve the lot of farmers, what was needed was availability of water, said farmers. Successive governments in the state have failed to resolve the Cauvery dispute. They are not sure whether the next government can either.While agricultural operations keep them busy for three months, they work under the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) for another 100 days a year. Contractors take a cut even from MGNREGS wages, said farmers. ""To cultivate both kuruvai and samba crops, we need double the quantity of water, compared to what is provided now,"" said Sithiravel, a farmer. Large tracts of agricultural land have been converted into residential layouts across delta districts, he said. With the assembly election just 18 days away, one major farmers' association has pledged allegiance to the DMK while another has to the AIADMK. But the All Farmers' Organisation Committee, a confederation of many farmers' bodies, has decided not to support any front or party, said P R Pandian, its president. The committee has placed a long list of demands before political parties and the central government.Committee coordinator Siva Raajasekaran said, ""The future of farming in the country depends on how fast our farmers shift to organic methods. First, the Centre should come out with an organic farming policy."" Other demands include nominating farmers as Rajya Sabha and legislative council (as and when it is set up) members, declaring the delta region as agriculturally endangered, banning government land acquisition in the delta, and substantial reduction in the rate of interest for farm loans, he said."

The state government has planned to increase the area under horticulture to nine lakh hectare by 2026 from the current 2.5 lakh hectare. In the next 10 years, the government wants to increase the ratio of land under cultivation of horticulture versus agriculture to 25:75 from the current 7:93.Addressing a national seminar on 'Development of states, with special emphasis on northern-western states', organized at Institute for Development and Communication (IDC) on Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the government was setting up centres of excellence for horticulture in every district in this connection. During the workshop, experts discussed issues contributing to the agrarian crisis, such as growth of farm debt and suicides and groundwater depletion. They said the growth of major crops of rice and wheat had experienced a decline in the past decade, and this could be attributed to Punjab reaching its highest attainable productivity under the current high-yielding variety (HYV) technology.IDC chairman and former union minister of planning and power Prof YK Alagh said they cannot have anti-grain policies, but it is equally important for them to diversify to produce jowar, maize, and pulses which can be achieved through incentivization. IDC director Dr Pramod Kumar stressed there was a need to give subsidies to agriculture. ""Subsidies are given as doles, and doles are a feudal response to the crisis of capitalism, while subsidies are a state-led capitalist response to the crisis of capitalism. On the other hand, elimination of 'freebies' is a market fundamentalist response to crisis of capitalism,"" said Kumar. ""It would be worthwhile to examine sectoral needs for subsidies to promote equity and productivity,"" he added. Agriculture scientist Devender Sharma said since the 1970s, the minimum support price has increased only 19 times, whereas the increase in incomes of other sectors has been almost 150 times.Chairperson of IIM-Ahmedabad's Centre of Management in Agriculture Prof Sukhpal Singh, Ludhiana's Punjab Agriculture University vice-chancellor Prof B S Dhillon, Punjab's chief finance and economic adviser Prof B S Ghuman and Centre of Research in Rural and Industrial Development's Prof S S Sangwan also spoke on the occasion."

But at Colmorod-Navelim on Friday, the organizers of the 3rd 'O Re Sao Joao 2016' sought to revive Goa's traditional sport of taabla by staging a mock war between the ladies of Colmorod ward and those hailing from the neighbouring Ratwaddo ward.Ultimately, amidst the loud shouts of 'bicchu', 'tableu' or 'tablam', the Colmorod Ostad's team defeated the Ratwaddo Giants team bagging a traditional prize of 25kg of sugar whereas the runners-up bagged 15kg of sugar.This traditional sport called tableu, tablu, tablam or tablani nd is played amidst a lot of noise and great gusto with the feverish pitch of the player's voices reaching a crescendo no sooner victory is in sight.This game requires not just skill but some luck, too, whilst tossing the four stout six-inch long two-inch in diameter wooden sticks (tablam) that are painted black with some markings on the flattened end across a rope or string tied in the middle of the playing arena. The two teams sit diagonally facing each other as play progresses anti-clockwise with all players taking turns to toss the tablam.The game has to start with tableu which means when the four tablam are tossed, three of them have to fall with the flat-painted black surface facing upwards and the team gets another chance to toss the tablam. So until the tableu is obtained, the team cannot open its account. If all four tablam fall with their flat black-painted surface facing upwards, the score obtained is bara (12). But if all the four tablam fall with their rough side facing upwards, the score obtained is aat (8).If only one of the tablam is with it's flat black-painted surface facing upwards while the rough surface of the other three tablam are facing upwards, then the score is teen (3) and if two of the tablamhave their flat black-painted surface facing upwards, then the score is don (2).The duration of each match is approximately 25-30 minutes, informs veteran player Shivolkar, who adds that traditionally prizes awarded to the winners were either sugar, rice or alcohol and that it is only recently that cash prizes are being awarded for tournaments of this traditional sport."
58f5c7c17be9e01a17ca07ff,US directs cyberweapons at ISIS for the first time,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/US-directs-cyberweapons-at-ISIS-for-the-first-time/articleshow/51974048.cms,2016-04-25,"LONDON: The United States has opened a new line of combat against the Islamic State, directing the military's 6-year-old Cyber Command for the first time to mount computer-network attacks that are now being used alongside more traditional weapons.The effort reflects President Barack Obama's desire to bring many of the secret U.S. cyberweapons that had been aimed elsewhere, notably at Iran, into the fight against the Islamic State  which has proved effective in using modern communications and encryption to recruit and carry out operations.The National Security Agency, which specializes in electronic surveillance, has for years listened intensely to the militants of the Islamic State, and those reports are often part of the president's daily intelligence briefing. But the NSA's military counterpart, Cyber Command, was focused largely on Russia, China, Iran and North Korea  where cyberattacks on the United States most frequently originate  and had run virtually no operations against what has become the most dangerous terrorist organization in the world.A review of what should be done to confront the Islamic State is on Obama's agenda Monday, when he is scheduled to attend a conference in Hanover, Germany, with the leaders of Britain, France, Italy and Germany. Of these efforts, the cybercampaign is the newest. It is also the one discussed in least detail by officials of many countries, and its successes or failures are the most difficult to assess from the outside.The goal of the new campaign is to disrupt the ability of the Islamic State to spread its message, attract new adherents, circulate orders from commanders and carry out day-to-day functions, like paying its fighters. A benefit of the administration's exceedingly rare public discussion of the campaign, officials said, is to rattle the Islamic State's commanders, who have begun to realize that sophisticated hacking efforts are manipulating their data. Potential recruits might also be deterred if they come to worry about the security of their communications with the militant group.Defense Secretary Ash Carter is among those who have publicly discussed the new mission, but only in broad terms, and this month the deputy secretary of defense, Robert O. Work, was more colorful in describing the effort.""We are dropping cyberbombs,"" Work said. ""We have never done that before.""The campaign has been conducted by a small number of ""national mission teams,"" newly created cyberunits loosely modeled on Special Operations forces.While officials declined to discuss the details of their operations, interviews with more than a half-dozen senior and midlevel officials indicate that the effort has begun with a series of ""implants"" in the militants' networks to learn the online habits of commanders. Now, the plan is to imitate them or to alter their messages, with the aim of redirecting militants to areas more vulnerable to attack by U.S. drones or local ground forces.In other cases, officials said, the United States may complement operations to bomb warehouses full of cash by using cyberattacks to interrupt electronic transfers and misdirect payments.The fact that the administration is beginning to talk of its use of the new weapons is a dramatic change. As recently as four years ago, it would not publicly admit to developing offensive cyberweapons or confirm its role in any attacks on computer networks.That is partly because cyberattacks inside another nation raise major questions over invasion of sovereignty. But in the case of the Islamic State, officials say a decision was made that a bit of boasting might degrade the enemy's trust in its communications, jumbling and even deterring some actions.""Our cyberoperations are disrupting their command-and-control and communications,"" Obama said this month, emerging from a meeting at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on countering the Islamic State.In an interview this month in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she talked to Air Force Academy cadets, Obama's national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, said the fight against the Islamic State had to be thought of as a multifront war  and that computers were just another weapon in the arsenal.""It should not be taken out of proportion  it is not the only tool,"" she said when asked about Work's ""cyberbombs"" comment. In fact, some of Work's colleagues acknowledged that they had winced when he used the term, because government lawyers have gone to extraordinary lengths to narrowly limit cyberattacks to highly precise operations with as little collateral damage as possible.But Rice said the Islamic State had ""uniquely utilized cyberspace"" to recruit, to communicate over encrypted apps and to coordinate its operations from Syria to Europe.Rice would not comment on reports from officials in the Pentagon that Obama had asked  quite pointedly  in the fall why the arsenal of cyberweapons that had been developed at a cost of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars was not being utilized in the fight against the terrorist group.Several officials said that Carter had complained that Cyber Command was too focused on traditional adversaries, and that he had set deadlines for a new array of operational cyberplans aimed at the Islamic State. Those were ultimately delivered by Adm. Michael S. Rogers, commander of Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency.But inside Fort Meade in Maryland, home to the NSA and Cyber Command, initial demands from the White House generated some resistance, according to officials involved in the debate.The NSA has spent years penetrating foreign networks  the Chinese military, Russian submarine communications, Internet traffic and other targets  placing thousands of ""implants"" in those networks to allow it to listen in.But those implants can be used to manipulate data or to shut a network down. That frequently leads to a battle between the NSA civilians  who know that to make use of an implant is to blow its cover  and the military operators who want to strike back. NSA officials complained that once the implants were used to attack, the Islamic State militants would stop the use of a communications channel and perhaps start one that was harder to find, penetrate or de-encrypt.""It's a delicate balance,"" Rice said. ""We still have to keep our eye on the Russia-China state-sponsored activity, but this was a new mission, one where we have to balance the collection equities against the disruption equities."""
58f5c8407be9e01a17ca0877,The end of single screen theatres,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/The-end-of-single-screen-theatres/articleshow/51953249.cms,2016-04-23,"Since the advent of multiplexes, several iconic cinemas in the city have shut shop, unable to break even. Gone with them are a host of matinee memories, writes Priyanka DasguptaKolkata: Mini was born two months ago. Days after her birth, her mother was killed in a road accident. Since then, her address is the plastic chair that stands guard in front of the defunct booking counters of Mahua cinema. While Mini curls up on the chair at night, Bishnu Deb Roy and his mother Gayatri Devi sleep on the floor. Mini, the orphaned cat, shares the roof along with the caretaker-cum-gatekeeper of this south Kolkata cinema that downed shutters last year.Welcome to the world of 26 leftover single-screen theatres in Kolkata, which are closing down at a pace that doesn't care for speed-breakers. Welcome to the world that can't match up to the glitz of multiplexes. Welcome to the world of abandoned show reels and empty projection rooms.Last year saw 40 single screen theatres in Bengal closing down. It was at the peak of summer last year  on May 28, to be precise  that Mahua downed its shutters. In the week before its final closure, a cruel joke would do the rounds. The last film to be screened there was 'Belaseshe', the Soumitra Chatterjee-Swatilekha Sengupta starrer. This quirk doesn't escape the 50-year-old Bishnu. ""How ironical that this film should have marked the 'bela sesh' (end of days) for the theatre too. 'Belaseshe' is one name I will never forget. It brought such a sense of closure,"" he smiles wryly, eyes glistening as he walks past the debris, leading the way into what used to once be a favourite entertainment destination for many south Kolkatans.Today, the theatre can almost be mistaken as a set for Mrinal Sen's 'Khandahar'. Just ahead of Gate No. 1 that once led viewers inside is a small earthen oven. The wooden frames that weren't sold off as scrap are now used by Gayatri to light the oven. The fire simmers long enough to let the 75-year-old boil some rice as she stares at the empty auditorium. Her husband used to work here as a mason before the hall opened on February 4, 1977. ""It was an open door for us. There wasn't a single day when I didn't watch a film. In between my household chores, I would catch a few scenes. I never watched a film at one go. But it was fun that way,"" she says.Today, time stands still. The auditorium looks barren. First, the workable machines of the projection room were sold off. Then the AC machine, transformer and generator. Even the plaster of Paris tiles from the ceiling were hammered down. The chairs were sold. What remains as relics are the sponges, torn from the seats. ""A single tile would take 25 days to make. And here, they hammered it down in minutes. When they first starting dismantling, I couldn't even enter the auditorium. Each blow of the hammer seemed to strike my heart,"" Bishnu says.Mother and son wept like inconsolable babies after the final curtains came down after the last show at the theatre. The huge curtain in front has also been removed. Someone told them that a scrap dealer might sell it off to some small-time caterer to make use of as a curtain. But what about that screen? ""Maybe someone somewhere will use it for projections in a village..."" Bishnu's voice trails off.Upstairs in the projection room, nothing much remains, except for some torn bunches of unsold tickets and film reels. Bishnu uncoils one and holds it against the warm April sunlight filtering through the ventilator. At first glance, it's difficult to recognize who the stars are. It's only after a good 15 minutes that he identifies it as a reel from the Amitabh-Rekha starrer 'Silsila'. ""The film had a good run here. Today, all that is just memory,"" he says, rubbing his eyes.The story is no different at most single-screen theatres in the city  Grace, Purno, Ujjawala, Sree have all shut down. Sixty-year-old Chandan Datta had joined as a chief camera operator at Grace on College Street on February 10, 1985. Four years back, when Chandan heard that the hall would close down, he felt like being stranded in the epicentre of an earthquake. ""Before my job, I had to take a verbal, written and medical examination conducted by the government to get my licence. The job of a camera operator was backbreaking, and I had to be on my toes to make sure the two machines were in order. While one reel would run for 17- to 20-odd minutes, I had to keep the other machine ready. The moment one reel got over, I had to start operating the next reel in the other machine. Unless there was a power shutdown, no time loss was allowed in the switchover,"" Chandan says.The job demanded a lot of precision and a sense of responsibility. Once the theatre shut down and digital cinema started taking over, Chandan started adapting himself to another profession. Now, he works at the Bina cinema, where he operates the computers that have movies uploaded on a server. ""This work is less strenuous. One needs a little bit of education to be able to operate the computer and check whether the film is in running condition once the hard disk is uploaded,"" he says. But, once in a while, he still walks along Mahatma Gandhi Road. ""My heart aches when I see the building. People like us don't own the theatres but we put in our blood and sweat to keep it running. Way before I joined, I had heard stories of Dharmendra and Hema Malini coming over to Grace, he says. Today, only a structure plastered with ads remain. Only the address written on the hoarding advertising a computer centre has mention of Grace Cinema as a landmark.Stories about single screen theatres were inspiration for Kaushik Ganguly to pen the script of his soon-to-release 'Cinemawalla'. However, one person he never bumped into while scripting was 43-year-old Pinku Das.Interestingly enough, Das' life story is what movies can be made of. He was an usher at Ujjala in 1986-'87. ""I always wanted to make movies. In order to support my family, I joined as a staff member at Ujjala. Sometimes, I would usher in people. On other days, I would sit at the booking counter. But the owners were very helpful and they allowed me to sit in a room on the third floor and pen scripts,"" Das says. He claims to have penned 11 scripts and one script for a Hindi serial, too. ""I also wrote Satabdi Roy's debut feature film, 'Amar Bandhan', and Prosenjit's directorial debut, 'Purushottam'. When Ujjala was folding up, I had already started directing my first feature film titled 'Eri Naam Jibon' starring Victor Banerjee, Sandhya Roy, Sreelekha and Jisshu. Unfortunately, it got stuck in a legal hassle and hasn't yet seen light of day,"" he says.When Ujjala shut down, Das felt his career as a film director would sail him through. ""But that never happened. I am still struggling. Yes, it feels bad that single-screen theatres are closing down. But what can be done? One has to just adapt to the times. The silver lining is that cinema has survived,"" he says.Even those working for the management feel the pangs of something getting lost forever when the owners are forced to take a decision to shut theatres down. Many insist that once the lights are turned off after the last show, the feeling is like that on the night of Bijoya Dashami... only this is no festival that will return next year. Gobindo Roy, who has worked as executive producer for producer R D Bansal, has long been associated with theatres like Sree, Uttara, Ujjala and Purabi. The last film to be screened at Sree was 'Aashraya'. It was on October 31, 2000. On the same day, Uttara closed down with 'Khauf'. Purabi downed shutters only recently, on April 1. ""I felt like a father whose daughter had just been married off,"" Roy says.It's tough to adjust to the vacuum. Roy recalls that the last show at Ujjala was of 'Tomar Amar Prem' on February 3, 2005. After the show, there is a gnawing feeling of emptiness. One suddenly realizes that one is no longer required to send bills to the amusement tax authority. There isn't anyone to even enquire, 'Ki boi lagchhe? (What movie is running?)'But time has a way of mellowing down the pain. One understands the constraints of owners who run losses of over Rs 1 lakh to simply sustain a theatre each month. ""Some cinemas have litigation problems and lease issues too. Over the years, the attitude of staff has also changed. Earlier, they would feel a sense of attachment towards the theatre. With time, that grew less,"" Roy explains.Arijit Dutta, the owner of Priya, Art Gallery (Jalpaiguri), Netaji Subhas Sadan (Baidyabati), Balaka (Ilambazar), Vidyasagar (Ghuskara) and Vidyasagar (Balurghat), says single screen theatres in Bengal are shutting down like a pack of cards. He is suffering 'disastrously' for all his single screen theatres in the districts. ""For the last three years, Priya is being forced to bear the losses of my five other theatres in the districts. Ten years ago, the Left Front government had given us permission to recover service charge and reduced the taxes. We were given a tax exemption on modernisation/upgrade. We expected the present government to increase the service charge amount and abolition of the government duty on electricity. The government has to realise that single screen is the backbone of regional cinema. Unfortunately, it is only bothered about stars and directors. Cinema halls are too non-glamorous for our government.""Kaushik Sen, the owner of Debasree in Barrackpore, remembers that the hall was established in 1991 with a capacity of 1400. ""There was a time when films like 'Chrodini... Tumi Je Amar' ran for 20 weeks. But after 2010, there was a major dip in sales. The audience just didn't turn up to watch Bengali cinema. I was running a loss of 1 lakh per week. Sometimes, films were pulled down mid-week too. In 2013, the hall was razed to the ground,"" Sen says.For 30-something Shafiqul Islam Shabaz, the last New Year's Eve was the worst day in his life. Shabaz, part-partner of Tasweer Mahal at the Rajabazar crossing, was in mourning while the rest of the city was partying. December 31, 2015, was the day the last film was screened at the theatre. Escalating costs, dip in sales figures and not enough funds to pay staff salaries were some of the reasons Shabaz decided to close it down.Shabaz's friends had proposed to have a party at the theatre after the last screening of a Bhojpuri movie. But he just couldn't bring himself to agree. Mutton biryani can't be gulped down while bidding adieu to a theatre that had been witness to countless happy and sad moments in his life. Shabaz excused himself. His friends had understood, and shifted their party venue elsewhere. ""It was too sentimental for me. There were just 40 people who came for the last show. I recorded video footage of them leaving the auditorium after the movie was over,"" he says.That night, he was unable to control his tears. 2016 began on a sad note. Since that day, he has played the video just once. But reliving the moment of closure is difficult to handle. ""My grandfather was the owner. I used to come to this theatre with my father. When I was in school, it was such a grand affair to be the grandson of a theatre-owner. I'd often get requests from friends who wanted free tickets. It felt good to oblige as well,"" he recalls.After 'Sholay' released, it had run here for 50 weeks at this theatre. 'Coolie' had played for 30 and 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' for 15 weeks in a row. Mithun Chakraborty had dropped by at the theatre when 'Jallaad' was being screened. The day 'Raja Hindustani' played, Shabaz had done his first booking. ""It was the big day of my life and the film ran for houseful for two weeks straight. The film had run for 12 weeks,"" he recalls proudly.But when multiplexes came up around 2005 onwards, the sales dropped drastically. To cut costs, the original staff strength came down from 40 to a meagre six. December 31 was the day when everyone bid the hall a teary farewell.Once in a while, Shabaz now drops by at the theatre. Some accounts-related work need to be taken care of. There are some payments to be made. Well-wishers from his neighbourhood sometimes share his sentiments while rueing the closure. They are as nostalgic as Shabaz, though they know it's difficult to pull along while running in huge losses. Shabaz's nine-year-old daughter too understands that loss. But for her, the glitz of a multiplex can compensate. Shabaz's emotions are still raw.A sweeper comes once in 10 days to dust. Shabaz isn't sure what he will do with the property now. But he has one grand plan left. One day, he will walk inside the theatre and sink into the seat again. For one last time, he will relive the experience of watching a movie there. If possible, he will fetch a print of 'Raja Hindustani' and watch it all by himself in the entire theatre... not alone, but with a myriad emotions to keep him company.ARUNA40/2 Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 9Opening Date: 21.2.1949Opening film: AjitGLOBE7E, Lindsay Street, Kolkata - 16Opening Date: 23.11.1922Opening Film: A Sporting Double (Silent)Previous Name: Opera HouseGRACE91, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 07Opening Date: 11.12.1953Previous Name: Alfred Theatre, Natya Bharati, Deepak and Mitra TheatreLIGHTHOUSE2, HUmayun Place, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 24.10.1938Opening Film: FantasiaLOTUS106A SN Banerjee Road, Kolkata - 14Opening Date: 26.9.58Opening Film: SadhanaPrevious Name: AnjanMETRO5 Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 05.12.1935Opening Film: Bonemian GirlsMINERVA (CHAPLIN)Chowringhee Place, Kolkata - 13Opening Date: 28.02.1969 (re-opened)Opening Film: The Taming of the ShrewPrevious Name: Elphinstone Picture Palace, Madan BioscopePURABI40/1, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Kolkata - 09Opening Date: 14.08.1936PURNA4, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Kolkata - 25Opening Date: 14.10.1921Previous Name: Paris Cinema & Varieties Ltd., Russa TheatreSREE1382, Bidhan Sarani, Kolkata - 04Opening Date: 18.03.36 (renamed)Opening Film: Queen of the JunglePrevious Name: Cornwallis TheatreTIGER19, Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata - 13Previous Name: Picture House, Plaza, Gaiti TheatreUJJALA14, Shyamaprasad Mukherjee Road, Kolkata - 26Opening Date: 12.01.1946Opening Film: The Bathing Beauty"

HUL is selling the business to LT Foods Middle East DMCC, a group company of LT Foods, which is the owner of the popular Basmati rice brand called Daawat  a market leader in India and the US.The deal envisages transfer of the brands and inventory for a consideration of Rs 25 crore, subject to adjustments on closing, which is lower than the annual turnover of the two brands in 2014-15, that is Rs 51 crore  a discount of 49%. The transaction is subject to fulfilment of certain conditions and the parties will work together to complete this over the next few months. Till then, HUL will continue to manage the business.Sanjiv Mehta, CEO & MD, HUL, said, ""Over the years, Gold Seal Indus Valley and Rozana have become household names in the rice category across the overseas markets in which they operate. The brands enjoy strong equity and have been delighting consumers through a range of high quality offerings in Basmati rice. Given the context of our portfolio priorities, we believe that it is in the best interest of the business to sell these brands to a strategic player such as LT Foods, who is capable and well positioned to unlock their full potential.""In September last year, HUL sold its iconic Modern Foods to Nimman Foods. Modern Foods was acquired by HUL in 2000 from the government, which was disinvesting its stake in the loss-making PSU. The FMCG company began exporting premium Basmati rice in 1985 under the brand 'Gold Seal Indus Valley' to various countries in the Middle East and Europe, which was subsequently extended to other brands and geographies. With the business operating across 21 countries, Gold Seal Indus Valley Basmati rice is in the premium segment, while Rozana Basmati rice is in the mid segment.By exiting these businesses, HUL wants to focus on growing the core segments of its packaged foods business, which is of the order of Rs 2,000 crore, including brands like Kissan, Knorr, Kwality Walls and Magnum."
58f5c9747be9e01a357a7536,Alibaug’s secret: A legendary drink with a Jewish connect,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/Alibaugs-secret-A-legendary-drink-with-a-Jewish-connect/articleshow/52274241.cms,2016-05-15,"In India, casual multiculturalism constantly reveals itself in odd and unexpected spaces. D Samsons Cold Drinks house on the Mumbai-Alibaug road is one such non-monument to history, which tells the story of Alibaug's amazing connection with Jews and with Israel. With its Mangalore-tiled roof and Marathi signage, this could be any other vada-pav or cold drink stall, if it weren't for the Star of David and pictures of Moses that hang on the wall. This quaint beverage stop, which serves an array of delicious bespoke aerated drinks like ginger-lemon soda, ice-cream soda and masala soda, was founded 80 years ago by a Bene-Israeli Jew, Daniel Samson Digodkar.Like many of his brethren  at one time there was a population of several thousand Jews in this area and a synagogue still stands tall in Alibaug town  his first name, Daniel, attests to the Jewish heritage, while the surname acknowledges his village, Digodi, near Mandwa. This intermingling of names reflects the manner in which the Raigad Jews have comingled Marathi culture with their very particular rituals, dissolving like sugar into water  in this particular case, carbonated water.D Samson's cold drinks, once a favourite among the British collectors, are by now legendary in the area. ""We continue to use the same secret recipes and the same carbonating machine that my uncle started with all of five rupees,"" says his nephew Sydney David, who lives in Mumbai but returns every Sunday to oversee the family business. Most other members of his family have migrated to Israel.For the longest time, the Bene-Israelis of Alibaug ran rice and oil pressing mills. When the Digodkars' mill shut down, Daniel Samson pursued a personal passion  creating flavourful drinks, first with the marble inside the bottle to contain the bubbles, later with sealed caps. When he died, his sister Mary Moses David took over. Her son Sydney is one of the last in the family - indeed in the community  left here today.According to Jewish author and historian Esther David, there are very few written records about the Bene Israel community of Alibaug. ""It is said we were a seafaring tribe who arrived more than 2,000 years ago, after facing persecution in the Greek or Roman empire. The ship happened to wreck at Navgaon in Alibaug district. Seven couples survived and spawned a community that mostly ended up as coconut oil pressers and supari plantation owners. Because they continued to practice Shabbath and took Saturdays off, they became known as 'Shanvar-telis'.""A little over 100 years ago, the community built the Magen Avot Synagogue (which means Shield of the Fathers) in the Alibaug, with the prayer hall facing the west, with eyes on Jerusalem. ""At one point there must have been 50,000-60,000 Bene-Israelis in western Maharashtra. During the British rule, they started moving to neighbouring cities like Pune and Mumbai, but the highest concentration remained in Alibaug,"" says David.Everyone was raised with the belief that they would eventually make it back to the Promised Land. By the 50s and 60s, most people started leaving for Israel, forming a little India in south Israel, where they continued to wear saris and create spice markets, but lived under the aegis of a new state which prided itself on embracing Jewish refugees not just from the Holocaust but from all over the world.One of the last of the Jews left in Alibaug is the elderly Jacob Dandekar, who has served as a chazan or cantor at the Synagogue and is widely referred to as 'Rabbee Dandekar', the Marathi version of Rabbi. The oldest Bene Israel cemetries continue to lie in Alibaug and the Israeli government has built a monument there in memory of the original seven couples who landed there and kept the community alive, says David.As for D Samsons Cold Drinks, it may not be around very long. The family of the current proprietor's is not interested in the business. His son works in a media company in Mumbai and his daughter has joined Israel Airlines and already been through the military training that is a must for all young people. Many have asked for the formula that makes these drinks the ultimate delicious quenchers, but he guards it fiercely - and it may well remain one of Alibaug's many charming and forgotten secrets."

Sindhu.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has announced Rs. 3 crore in cash along with a Government job as also a plot in the new capital Amaravati. Not to be outdone, Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao came up with his announcement on giving Rs. 5 crore to the ace shuttler along with other sops like a 1,000 sq yd plot.The two Chief Ministers are known for announcing lucrative offers on several counts, including the pay revision commission recommendations. Ms. Sindhus case, however, is a peculiar one as it exposes the unmistakable competition to own up the mana ammayi (our girl) between the two States. The competition between them was there even in bad times when they arranged flights to ferry parents to Himachal Pradesh after children drowned in river Beas during an excursion in 2014.IAS officers go into a huddleIts rare to see IAS officers go into a huddle over unpalatable official postings. At the most an individual officer may proceed on leave when he or she is not happy with the post allocated.But, for the first time, the IAS Officers Association met last week on what it felt an affront to the sanctity of a cadre post when the government appointed a senior IPS officer C.V. Anand as Commissioner of Civil Supplies.Some administrative posts were traditionally given to the IPS officers but this was the first time that one of them got in Civil Supplies. Two decades ago, an IPS officer was appointed as the Commissoner of Vaidya Vidhana Parishad because he was a doctor but the government cancelled the posting in the wake of resentment among IAS officers. So, it can be presumed that Mr. Anand was given the posting to do some policing in matters of civil supplies where the government is spending heavily on supply of fine rice to students.Babus at loggerheadsThere is an air of relief among employees, particularly the top brass, in the Industries Department following division of work between Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar and Secretary Sabyasachi Ghosh, by Chief Secretary Rajiv Sharma on Saturday. According to insiders, the two officers were not in good terms over several administrative issues for the last few months and the subordinate officers were feeling sandwiched between them.The fact was that the decisions taken by one Secretary did not go down well with another all these months and the working equation between the two hit a new low a couple of months back over the posting of a Joint Secretary in the department.It was only after the intervention by the Minister concerned, the issue was settled in favour of the senior officer.Now, the guest lecturersThe Board of Intermediate Education has taken an unusual decision, authorising principals of government junior colleges to appoint guest lecturers, like guest faculty in reputed universities. The principals can appoint retired junior lecturers, paying them Rs.250 a period and not more than Rs.10,000 a month, in vacant posts of lecturers in their institutions. There are about 1,000 posts of lecturers vacant in junior colleges but finding as many guest lecturers is a Herculean task, given the conditions and emoluments.(M. RAJEEV, M.L. MELLY MAITREYI,B.

She is the force behind the state's first college for the hearing impaired, which was established in 2007.Originally from Tirtol in Jagatsinghpur district, the 42-year-old was moved by the sight of a blind beggar at a railway station, which eventually led her to decide to work for the uplift and betterment of the disabled.Third among six sisters and two brothers, Mohapatra completed her diploma in a course to teach the blind after completing her graduation in 1992. She then completed her Master's degree from Utkal University and worked as a teacher in several schools.In the meantime, she kept attending special courses. Her financial condition was restrictive. ""I was passionate about the cause. But I had to leave the school where I taught in 2000 due to my father's illness and treatment. We lost all our savings and he died in 2002. It was one blow after another,"" she said.She came to Bhubaneswar in 2003 and worked as the superintendent of a hostel for the children of jail inmates, managed by Madhur Mayee Adarsh Siksha Niketan, a city-based NGO.""While teaching at Angul, I realized that students who graduated from special schools could not pursue higher education. There were no colleges for them,"" she said.She visited the Saint Louis Institute for Deaf and Blind in Chennai to gain an insight into what establishing a college of this sort entails. ""When I thought of crowdfunding my project, people were surprised. They advised me to drop the plan as it would be very difficult to run the college without any financial support by the government,"" she said.But her cause did find supporters. She formed a welfare trust and founded the Satyabhama Devi College for the Hearing Impaired at Patrapada to impart higher education in the Plus II arts stream to deaf students.The first batch (23 students) passed in 2009 and secured a 100% result. She was felicitated by chief minister Naveen Patnaik and the then-governor. Last year, the college achieved 100% results in the Plus II examination conducted by the CHSE, Odisha. ""This year, 62 students have appeared for the exam,"" she said.""We have been requesting the state government to take over so that the students get more benefits,"" she said. ""After repeated requests, the government has provided subsidized rice for the college hostel and a quarter to run the college,"" she added."

Whether it is a lunchbox made from rice husk or a soup spoon made of millets, environment-friendly alternatives to traditional crockery are becoming popular in homes and at events. These innovative substitutes may also transform the food take-away industry by reducing plastic waste.""Plastic is meant for one time use. If reused, the food gets contaminated with chemicals and people end up consuming toxins and germs,"" says Narayana Peesapaty, founder of Hyderabad-based Bakeys Foods, one of the pioneers in making edible cutlery. Made from jowar, rice, wheat and hot water, the baked spoons are considered healthier. Apart from decomposing easily the spoons can also be eaten after use. ""Since the spoons are made from millets, they have a low glycemic index and are good for diabetics,"" says Dr Vasundhara Kamineni of Kamineni Hospitals. For Chennai-based cater ers like N Sridhar of Arusuvai Arasu Caterers, using edible spoons has reduced the plastic waste generated during wedding buffets. ""People are amused when they are told that the spoons can be eaten, and they all try it and so there is no waste,"" he says.The other forms of biocutlery , which aren't edible, have also helped some restaurants replace flimsy plastic spoons and containers with green alternatives. For instance, Ecolife in Chennai makes cutlery from polylactic acid sourced from plants.""They reduce your carbon footprint by nearly 80% but their lifetime is as long as plastic.When placed in composting conditions, they take about 80 to 120 days to decay,"" says Goutham, founder, Ecolife.Bagasse, a by-product of sugarcane pulping, and bamboo fibres are more versatile when it comes to designing crockery. ""After preparing a kind of pulp from these raw materials, they can be put into moulds of different shapes and sizes. They are more sturdy and aesthetic,"" says Abhishek Agarwal of Pappco Greenware, which makes single use and reusable crockery from bagasse and bamboo fibre.Most of these eco friendly options have also friendly options have also inched their way into households as they are microwaveable and make waste segregation easier.""They are safer alternatives for children too as they don't release chemi cals like bisphenol A,"" says Harika Meka of SaveGlobe, a Bengaluru-based firm that makes edible cutlery and biodegradable crockery.However, companies say that the premium price of these eco-friendly products is a problem. ""A plastic spoon costs 40 to 80 paise whereas an edible spoon is priced at about Rs 2.75. There needs to be more awareness about the environmental and health benefits of these products,"" says Harika."

Photo: Rahulnath S.R.Yes, you can cook using earthenware on your LPG stoves.Initially, it is better to cook on low flame and then increase the heat gradually. And careful handling is a must, say potters.This weekend, over 1,000 visitors to the TRE Farms Organic Farmers Market (OFM) at Chetpet learnt how baked clay utensils could be used for cooking. Arasu Bhaskar, a potter who specialises in such cookware, said once the clay gets used to the heat, they can be utilised like stainless steel ones.Before the first use, the utensils have to be filled daily for four days with either rice wash or starch. The process helps enhance the taste of food and also close the tiny pores on the utensils.After that, you can clean the vessels by filling them with hot water and some crystal salt and keeping them aside for an hour and then scrubbing them with coconut fibre, he explained. The same cleaning process should be used after cooking.Initially, it is safe to cook over a low flame and then once the utensil gets used to the heat, there is no problem. I have been using such cookware for five years now and the flavour of the food is really good. Scientifically speaking, there is proof of 100 per cent nutrition retention in mud, says Ananthoo of OFM, whose branches will stock earthenware. Malarvizhi Mohan spent almost the entire day at the Bringing mud back to life and terracotta workshop-cum-sale, along her son M. Abishek Mayakrishnan.She said he enjoyed the time making clay stuff and terracotta jewellery. We cook in mud utensils. We saw dosa pans only today. There was lunch so we enjoyed that, she said.According to Rekha Ramu, the workshop-cum-sale was organised to encourage potters.Many have left the profession and are taking up jobs as security guards. Since OFM believes in going back to the basics, we thought this pottery sale would encourage people to use them and help the potters, she said.Over 1,000 visitors at a farmers' market learnt how baked clay utensils could be used for cooking"

And, very often, what he brings to the table is not just new, original recipes but long-forgotten traditional ones. So it is not surprising that his new book, `The Secret Recipes of Tamil Nadu', delves into ancient texts and the interior parts of the state to bring old recipes to the modern audience.This time round, the chef, who has already penned 26 books, focuses on ancient dishes that helped boost the health of women. ""In olden times, many dishes were made especially for girls who had just attained puberty and also pregnant women and lactating mothers as they need nutritious food,"" says Damu.But now, with an increasing number of people moving to metros, and living far away from their families, this tradition has been lost. ""I wanted to dig out the old recipes and compile them into a book so that it would be of help to families,"" he says. His book, which is in Tamil, will be published by Karpagam Pathippagam, and has about 30 recipes.He began his research more than a year and a half ago, travelling across the state and reading intensively . ""For instance, in the `Purananooru', a Tamil poetic work, which is one of the eight books in the secular anthology of Sangam literature, and the ` Agananooru', there are references to certain traditional dishes,"" says Damu.In the `Purananooru', there is a refer anooru', there is a refer ence to `gramathu fish curry', which vil l a g e r s m a d e.""While harvesting paddy , the farmers would let out stagnant water. This water would contain small fish, like the vazhai (ribbon fish) and also tortoises, which were then caught and cooked,"" says Damu. Various kinds of fish curry were made with tamarind pulp in mud pots.It was the old-timers he met across the districts who helped him perfect the recipes. ""I spoke to old women, many of them over 80, who told me about these dishes,"" he says.For instance, when girls attained puberty, special food like Uluthuma puttu was given to them for breakfast.""Urad dal was roasted, powdered and then added to steamed red rice, coconut milk, grated coconut, elaichi and karupatti or palm jaggery ,"" says Damu. The mixture was then steamed.Similarly , in the afternoon, they were given whole urad dal, which was boiled with parboiled rice and karupatti (palm jaggery). ""Only pure gingelly oil was used then,"" he says.Young married women were also put on special diets to make them strong enough for childbearing. ""They were given nutritious food to strengthen their uterus and hip bones,"" says Damu.Again, urad dal was used to make a porridge called uluthuma kali. ""Sambar soru was also made, by mixing boiled sambar rice, with dates, almonds, cashews mixed with red banana,"" says Damu, adding that pregnant women were given a syrup made of urad dal, gingelly seeds and white jaggery , which has more iron content.Damu has tried out every recipe before including it in the book. ""Many of the elderly women I spoke to showed me how to make the dishes. Then, I made it myself and had them taste it to ensure it was authentic,"" he says. He hopes that the book will help improve the health of women."

According to Fr Baauche, a French Catholic Priest who worked in Ramanathapuram district, Periya Marudu was the dog-keeper of the second ruler of Sivaganga Vaduganatha Thevar, and Chinna Marudu was the betel-keeper ( adappakaran ).Quite strangely, Colonel James Welsh, a friend-turned-foe of the Marudu brothers, had not recorded anything about the dogs even though his military reminiscences talked about their deadly weapon valari , the fine variety of rice and rough-skinned orange supplied to him by Marudu brothers, and the fish varieties of Papanasam in Tirunelveli.The dog sculptures in these temples, to a large extent, fit the description of Kombai dogs given by English Zoologist Desmond Morris, who authored The Ultimate Dictionary of over 1,000 Dog Breeds. He had said, this muscular, powerful and athletic dogs kept by Zamindars and certain tribes are well-known for their ability to overcome any obstacle on their paths.Desmond Morris had pointed out that there was some confusion about the status of the dogs, and even in 1960, the breed was on the verge of extinction.Much fearedSenior citizens in Ramanathapuram said 50 years ago, there were a lot of Mandai dogs in the district, known for their ferocious nature and were used for guarding farms and houses. The bark of the dog was enough to evoke fear. We must make a clear distinction between the Kombai dogs of Theni district and Ramanathapuram Kombai or Mandai dogs. Ramanathapuram Kombai came in various colours, particularly in ash and white, while Kombai in Theni district is identified by is brownish, black and white and brindle, said K.R.

This is the first such initiative in the state.Handia is a locally made alcoholic drink. Traditionally, handia is made with cooked rice. The rice is then kept open to cool. After some time, bakhar, a tribal jadibuti made of sundried rice and medicinal roots, is added. It is then poured into a specific type of earthen pot with a little water and left to ferment for three days before it is sold.In the first phase, the administration has taken up Suliapada, Bisoi and Bangriposi blocks of the district. While awareness campaigns have already been launched in Suliapada block, strategies are being formulated to cover Bisoi and Bangriposi blocks later on.As a majority of the handia-consuming population is tribal, district authorities have roped in majhi hadams (chiefs of tribal villages), tribal priests and school teachers from tribal communities to make people aware of the health hazards that unmoderated drinking habits can lead to.Before launching the campaigns, the administration had conducted a survey to enumerate the village markets where the drink is served. A total of 3,136 weekly markets were found to be doing so in 26 blocks. Patil said the survey found some traders were adding toxic substances to handia in an attempt to make it more intoxicating, which is an extremely dangerous practice. ""It was also cited as one of the major reasons behind growing domestic violence in the district,"" he added. This apart, the police administration has started cautioning traders about the handia business. SP Gadadhar Pradhani said traders are being warned about the legal implications under various sections of the Excise Act.Collector Rajesh Pravakar Patil said the blocks were selected on the basis of population, depending on the consumption of the traditional rice beer. ""We are organizing such campaigns in almost all tribal villages. We are engaging with the people through street plays and music. The response has been encouraging and we are hopeful of success,"" he said.Big hoardings have been put up in marketplaces to dissuade people from consumption of handia. Separate teams have been formed, taking officers from various departments, to organize the campaigns at regular intervals."

DHAKA: A 70-year-old Hindu priest was found murdered in western Bangladesh n Monday, with his head nearly severed from his body, in the latest in a series of attacks on minorities by suspected Islamists.Farmers discovered the body of Ananda Gopal Ganguly near his home in the village of Noldanga in Jhenidah district after he had gone missing on his way to morning prayers.Although there was no immediate claim of responsibility, investigators said the killing bore the hallmarks of recent attacks by Islamist extremists who have carried out 10 other similar killings in the last 10 weeks.""He left home this morning saying that he was going to a Hindu house to offer prayers,"" the district's deputy police chief Gopinath Kanjilal told AFP.""Later farmers found his near-decapitated body in a rice field.""We do not know the identity of the killers. His body was found in an isolated area and we do not believe there any witnesses to the killing.""But the pattern of the killing is similar to ones carried out by local Islamist militants in recent time,"" Kanjilal added.Bangladesh is reeling from a wave of murders of secular and liberal activists and religious minorities that have left more than 40 people dead in the last three years.Most of the recent attacks have been claimed by the Islamic State organisation or the local offspring of al-Qaida.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government has however blamed homegrown Islamists for the attacks, rejecting claims of responsibility from the IS and a South Asian branch of al-Qaida.Experts say a government crackdown on opponents, including a ban on Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami following a protracted political crisis, has pushed many towards extremism.Jamaat-e-Islami is a traditional ally of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party whose leader, two-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia, is facing a raft of charges in connection with deadly firebombings.Victims of the attacks by suspected Islamists have included secular bloggers, gay rights activists and followers of minority religions.Although it is officially secular, around 90 per cent of Bangladesh's 160 million-strong population is Muslim.Ganguly's murder comes only two days after a Christian was hacked to death after Sunday prayers near a church in northwest Bangladesh in an attack claimed by IS.A Hindu shop owner was also hacked to death outside his store in the northern Gaibandha district late last month.

The incense and the oil lamps might have been still burning in the sanctum sanctorum when three bikers blitz through, hit him with sharp-edged weapons and slit his throat, leaving his head barely hinged on the neck.Ganguly was hacked to death in a small village in southwestern Bangladesh on June 7. Two days later, another Hindu religious worker Nityananda Panday (60) was killed in almost the same manner early morning in front of a mental hospital.is caught in a spiral of violence targeted at religious minorities, following a spate of systemic attacks on atheist bloggers, secular activists and intellectuals that began last year. The priest's beheadings, however, has triggered fresh fear psychosis and whisper talk about the arrival of the Islamic State (ISIS) and migration plans among the already dwindling Hindu minority in Bangladesh.""I don't know whether it is ISIS or some other group decapitating Hindus but it is quite clear that this persecution is not the same as earlier. It is a new phenomenon,"" Kajal Debnath who heads Bangladesh Hindu, Buddhist, Christian Unity Council (HBCUC) told TOI from Dhaka. ""Earlier, they would rape Hindu girls or torch our temples and houses, forcing Hindus to abandon their properties and migrate to India. It was mostly about grabbing Hindu land and property. But now they are slaughtering ordinary landless poor Hindus with no social or economic standing and the message is entirely different,"" he adds. A fresh wave of migration of Hindus out of Bangladesh, he fears, will start quietly.This time, the journey to an Indian passport will be easier following the Modi government's decision to amend laws to grant citizenship to Hindu refugees fleeing persecution.At the time of Indian Partition in 1947, Hindus constituted 31% of the total population of the region. By 2011 Bangladesh census, their numbers came down to mere 8.5%. In 2001, as per the Indian Census, there over 3 million migrants from Bangladesh, out of which over 65% migrated during and soon after the liberation war that led to its creation in 1971. The Census estimated that 50 Bangladeshis migrated to India every day, through the 4096 km long porous border the two countries share. Dhaka based journalist Saleem Samad believes that Hindu population in Bangladesh may have declined sharply in the last five years.""Even though Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina elevated Hindus to prominent positions in her government, most Hindus remain marginalized and persecuted. There has been systemic discrimination and violence against them,"" says Samad. Islamization of the country ""gathered momentum during the military regimes of General Ziaur Rahman (1975-1981) and General H.M. Ershad (1982-1990),""says Samad adding that the general perception in Bangladeshi society as of now is that Hindus are infidels.Bangladeshi Hindus faced massive violence in 1992 after the Babri Masjid demolition in India. About 30,000 homes, offices and places of worship were destroyed. Hindus were attacked again under Khalida Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led coalition government with Islamist hardliners in 2001. The execution of Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) 1971 war criminal Delwar Hossain Sayeedi by the Sheikh Hasina government in provoked attacks oddly against Hindus. During the elections of 2014 that brought Awami League back to power for a third term, BNP and JeI student wing Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS) workers committed large scale violence against them again.Targeted violence against minorities intensified in 2014 after al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), now called Ansar-ul-Islam (AuI), announced its arrival in 2014. Indian intelligence sources say it is behind the killings of most of the atheist bloggers and its recruits are drawn probably from JeI. As if that was not enough, Al Qaeda's opponent, ISIS in Decemeber 2015 threatened to expand its area of operation to South Asia including Bangladesh.Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), sources say, is inching towards the IS because of ""its dynamism and brand appeal."" Some Bangladeshis including Abu Jandal al-Bangali joined the IS in Syria and recently, Singapore arrested eight Bangladeshi IS activists. Since last year, both JMB and IS have intimidated Christians and Hindus. Three priests have escaped murder and three lost their lives.IS mouthpiece, an online magazine Dabiq in its 14th edition released recently, boasted about hacking priest Jogeshwar Roy to death. The magazine interviewed Shaykh Abu Ibrahim al-Hanif, the IS chief in Bangladesh, who claimed that IS has ""widespread support for their attacks on Hindus, Christians, Qadiyanis and other minorities.""Hindus of Bengal, the magazine said were relatively ""deceptive and covert in showing their animosity towards Islam and Muslims"" and many of the atheists were Hindus before. The IS chief also resented that many Hindus held important positions in the government under Awami league leader Sheikha Hasina whom it referred to as pro-India 'kafir'. ""Sharia in Bengal won't be achieved until the local Hindus are targeted in mass numbers and until a state of polarization is created in the region,"" Dabiq quoted the local IS chief.Sheikh Hasina government has however denied the role of AQIS and IS in violent attacks against minorities and persistently blamed the opposition party BNP and JeI. ""The government must take responsibility. The Prime Minister must answer. Why is she is silent? Why has no one from the government bothered to visit the victim families?"" asks Debnath adding that Sheikh Hasina was strengthening the extremist voices by her silence.""I don't support the Indian government's decision to accommodate Hindu refugees because it will open floodgates for our migration. But if these attacks continue at the present rate without any government intervention, Hindus will be reduced to mere 3% in another few years in Bangladesh,"" says Debnath."

American star Williams beat compatriot Christina McHale 7-6 (9/7), 6-1 on Thursday to set up a quarter-final meeting with Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova.A year after retiring following her opening match due to an elbow injury, Williams is looking for her first triumph in Rome since 2014 as she builds form ahead of the defence of her French Open title in Paris later this month. But post-match, it did not take long for talk to turn to her off-court antics. On social media, Williams set tongues wagging when she claimed to have eaten ""a spoonful"" of her pet Yorkshire terrier's tasty-looking salmon and rice dish at her Rome hotel, telling her followers: ""Don't judge me.""In the video, posted on the popular Snapchat platform, she claimed the food tasted ""a little bit like a house-cleaner thing"" and admitted she needed an urgent trip to the bathroom hours later. Coming from one of the most famous and successful women athletes in the world, it raised eyebrows but Williams replied to queries on Thursday by saying: ""I'm not the most serious person off the court. On the court I am, but off the court I don't have a serious bone in my body.""Smiling, she added: ""In fact, I have been told I need to grow up a lot.""Admitting she was feeling no serious ill effects of the incident, she added: ""No, thank God! But I don't know how my dog eats that. I guess he's okay with it."""

Many experts are asking if the government has enough money to fund this revision, though MDM will be saving around Rs 600 crore since cereals will now be available at a subsidised rate - rice at Rs 3/kg and wheat at Rs 2/kg under the National Food Security Act. Cooking cost has also undergone change. It has increased to Rs 5.55 for primary school children from Rs 3.86 and to Rs 8.28 for upper primary children. Committee has said cooking cost should be revised every two years.There has also been increase in oil/fat intake from 5 grams to 10 grams for primary children and from 10 grams to 15 grams for upper primary children. The committee has recommended that oils should be a mix of three combinations: Palmolein/coconut oil/ghee; sunflower or mustard/soybean or linseed.

Police believe the loot would be sold off in drought-hit areas of UP, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and MP.It happened early Monday morning when three or four men intercepted a trailer carrying the rice. Driver Sangram Singh Yadav narrated the incident to the police. ""When he reached the DTC depot near Rajghat around 2am, a red-coloured car took over the trailer and three men got down, waving pistols. They accused Yadav of rash driving and hitting their car.

They then took Yadav's cellphone and all his money and fled,"" police said.Yadav was freed by a passerby who told him that he was in Faridabad. The truck was also empty.

Both the DRI and SIT have referred the case for probe by ED also, they said.Explaining the modus operandi, the sources claimed the rice would be taken to Gujarat's Kandla Port by these exporters.They would then file Shipping Bills--documents filed withcustoms authorities carrying details of goods to be exported, consignor and consignee--for export to Iran, the sources said.Instead of the consignment reaching Iranian shores, it would be diverted mid-sea to Dubai allegedly with connivance of cargo ship operators carrying the goods.Surprisingly, payments were also made from Iran to these exporters in India. Importers and port officials would allegedly acknowledge the receipt of rice and allow payment to be made against it here, they said.What is worrying for intelligence agencies here is that they do not know the end-use of rice off-loaded in Dubai. They suspect use of rice as barter system to fund some illegal activity like terror financing, the sources said.While India lost foreign exchange which it could have got from Dubai in case of genuine trade, Iran was also deprived of customs duty it would have been entitled to if rice was delivered at its shore, they said."

Inspector Rizwan Hassan, whose precinct includes a ""buffer zone"" beside the tribe's reserve, is under clear orders: to interfere as little as possible in the traditional life of the tribe, which India prizes as the last remnant of a Paleolithic-era civilisation.This did not prepare him for the criminal complaint that was registered in November. A 5-month-old baby was dead, and witnesses came forward willingly, leaving the police, for the first time in history, confronting the prospect of arresting a Jarawa on suspicion of murder. The Jarawas, who number about 400 and whom one geneticist described as ""arguably the most enigmatic people on our planet"", are believed to have migrated from Africa around 50,000 years ago. They are very dark-skinned, small in stature and until 1998 lived in complete cultural isolation.After the tribe made peace with its neighbors, India took steps to minimise contact between the Jarawas and the world that surrounds them, hoping to avoid the catastrophes that befell aboriginal people in other countries, like the US and Australia, when settlers passed on germs and alcohol.Nevertheless, contact is occurring. Outreach workers visit the tribe's camps, and Jarawas receive treatment in isolation wards at hospitals. Poachers strike up illicit relationships, trading food for help in harvesting crabs or fish. It is as a result of such an encounter, the police believe, that a baby boy with a lighter skin colour than usual was born to an unmarried Jarawa woman last spring.Among the first to be alerted about the birth of a mixedrace baby was M Janagi Savuriyammal, a tribal welfare officer. It is no secret that the tribe has, in the past, carried out ritual killings of infants born to widows or  much rarer  fathered by outsiders, so as to maintain ""the socalled purity and sanctity of the society."" Savuriyammal and her staff began a campaign of persuasion, presenting arguments against killing the child.Five months later, Savuriyammal received an alarmed call from her field staff and rushed to the camp to find the baby missing and his mother crying silently.Two witnesses told the police that the previous night they had seen a Jarawa man, Tatehane, drinking liquor with an outsider who had entered the reserve illegally. Tatehane then slipped into the mother's hut and took the baby from her side before she awoke. The witnesses later found the baby's body on the sand, drowned.Savuriyammal filed a complaint with the police, but they were in unknown territory: In 200 years of fatal clashes between tribesmen and British and Indian settlers, no member of the tribe had ever been named as a suspect in a crime.The police arrested the two non-tribal men identified in the complaint: a 25-year-old believed to have fathered the child, who was accused of rape, and a man who gave Tatehane liquor and was accused of abetting murder and interfering with aboriginal tribes. But they did not arrest Tatehane, even though he was accused of murder, instead appealing for guidance from the department of tribal welfare, said Atul Kumar Thakur, the police superintendent.Even before the police heard of the baby's killing, the authorities were struggling with the question of whether to allow the Jarawas, who are classified as a ""particularly vulnerable tribal group"", more access to the world outside their reserve.Lieutenant governor A K Singh said that one school of thought holds that ""any contact of the tribe with modern civilisation has been detrimental"", while another questioned how the government could deny the tribe the benefits of modern life.Besides, some ask how could one prosecute a person who is unaware of Indian laws. ""They are in a pre-civilization period. We deal with them on that basis,"" says Nupur Sarkar, a policewoman. Others go further, saying the state has no business interfering in the tribe's tradition of killing children of mixed blood.For now, the case does not seem headed for a swift resolution. The police superintendent said it was straightforward enough from a constitutional perspective: ""Nobody is above the law."" On the other hand, Indian law also accords special rights to vulnerable social groups, like castes and tribes.""They have special status,"" he said. ""We are duty-bound to protect their interests."" The matter, forwarded to the tribal welfare department, seems poised to enter a kind of legal Sargasso Sea."

This session too, it could not be passed though I gave notice,"" Dattatreya said.The amendments to the current law are scheduled to be presented during this session of parliament which ends on May 8, with a recess between March 21 and April 19.Dattatreya's figure, which is from India's 2011 census, shows the number of child workers dropped by 64 percent over 10 years.A February 2015 report by the International Labour Organization puts the number of child workers in India aged between five and 17 at 57 lakh, out of 16.8 crore globally.More than half work in agriculture, toiling in cotton, sugarcane and rice paddy fields where they are often exposed to pesticides and risk injury from sharp tools and heavy equipment.At least a quarter work in manufacturing, often confined to poorly lit, barely ventilated rooms, embroidering clothes, weaving carpets, making matchsticks or rolling beedi cigarettes. Many help their parents in brick kilns or mines.Children also work in the services sector, in shops, restaurants and hotels, washing dishes and chopping vegetables, or in middle-class homes, cleaning and looking after younger children.The government wants to change the current law, which bans children under 14 from working in only 18 hazardous occupations and 65 processes, such as mining, gem cutting and cement manufacturing.If passed by parliament, the changes will outlaw child labour below 14 in all sectors and include a new category for those aged between 15 and 18 years old.The amendments also double jail time for employing children to a maximum of two years and increase the fine up to 50,000 rupees from 20,000 rupees currently.But child rights activists, including Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi, have voiced concern over two exceptions.Children who help their family in family businesses can work outside school hours and holidays, and those in entertainment or sports can work provided it does not affect their education.Also, children aged 15 to 18 will be barred from working in only three industries: mines, inflammable substances and hazardous processes.Satyarthi, whose charity Bachpan Bachao Andolan is credited with rescuing more than 80,000 enslaved children, said the exemptions are ""regressive"" and wants a total ban on all forms of child labour."

State government records show the highest price rise across the state was recorded in Visakhapatnam in superfine and fine rice categories in recent times.According to the essential commodity report (ECR) from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, AP government, superfine category rice was sold in the city at Rs 52 per kilo, the highest price in the state, as on the second week of March. The price was Rs 8.12 higher than the state average price, which stood at Rs 43.88 per kilo in the second week of March. The lowest price of the superfine variety was reported at Tekkali in Srikakulam district where the price was Rs 38 per kilo.Similarly, fine category of rice was sold at Rs 42 per kilo in the city which is Rs 4.8 higher than the state average price of Rs 37.2 per kilo. The lowest price of the fine variety was reported from Gudur in Nellore district where the price was Rs 31 per kilo.G Madhusudhana Naidu, proprietor of Maruthi Minerals Pvt Ltd in Vijayawada, said that the maximum price of superfine rice was reported between Rs 48 and Rs 50 per kilo in Vijayawada during the period.Rice traders attributed the exorbitant rise in prices to several reasons such as unavailability of superfine and fine category of rice that is preferred by Vizagites in the district. Almost all rice traders in the city procure the food grain including the preferred variety Lalitha from other parts of the state like Peddapuram, Mandapeta, Nellore and Guntur.Along with this rise in transportation and labour cost and increasing population in the city also affect prices. Besides, the 'Smart City' tag has led to the increase in rents and other essential items impacting food prices. Labourers charge Rs 200 to Rs 250 per quintal of rice shifted from the trucks to the godowns at the wholesale markets.""Rice preferred by Vizagites are procured from other parts of the state as it is not produced in the district or even neighbouring Srikakulam. However, even though the lowest price of superfine rice was reported from Tekkali, there is a lot of difference in the quality sold in Vizag and Tekkali,"" said S Sudhakar, secretary of Food Grains Dealers' Association for Visakhapatnam city.K Nirmala, civil supplies officer for Vizag city, said that prices are high in the city as consumers are willing to buy the rice at a higher price. ""80% of the rice consumers procure the essential commodity from the public distribution system at Re 1 per kg. The department is also ensuring that more variety of stock at different prices are available in the market to cover all categories of consumers,"" Nirmala told TOI.K Srinivasa Rao, an Andhra University employee, who was spotted at the Rythu Bazaar at Pedawaltair, said the steep rise in prices was impacting the common man as meals were becoming expensive at home and at restaurants.""The state government should focus on such issues on a priority basis. Unfortunately, the state government is not taking any sincere measures to regulate the price of the essential commodities in the state. Instead it is focusing on the capital development at Amaravati,"" Rao opined.An agriculture official said on anonymity that the price can be stabilised if the government took efforts in procuring superfine and fine rice from other states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra where production is high and consumption is low."

Since all the rice is coloured, it neither can be used for human nor bird consumption. If the grains are saved from getting wasted, it could suffice the hunger of around 75 lakh people in the drought-affected places, they said.""The use of akshata is a wasteful activity, which continues even today during some marriage ceremonies. We cannot afford such wastage, especially during extreme drought conditions wherein a larger section of population is unable to arrange even two square meals a day,"" said Anant Motale, the brains behind the hunger-free city mission.""Of the unbroken rice grains which are smeared with kumkum/sindoor (vermillion) to form akshata, only 10% is showered on couples, while the remaining 90% goes waste.

On an average, rice grains worth Rs 1.8 crore gets wasted every year in the state,"" he said.Rajesh Kulkarni, another member of the Save Food Committee, said, ""The use of akshata is rampant during Indian weddings. In a bid to save the rice from getting wastes, we will launch a campaign to pursue and encourage people to utilise it symbolically for the newly weds. The near and dear ones should shower it with good wishes, while other guests at the wedding ceremony standing far away from the stage should raise their hands and bless the couple.""""Since the principal constituent of kumkum is red lead, zinc or other synthetic dyes, this process of converting rice into akshata renders the grains inedible for both human as well as birds or animals,"" he said.""Considering the mount of rice going waste on a large scale, our committee would be first sensitising the parents of would-be couples. We will also put up display boards urging people not to waste rice and donate it to the needy instead. On an average, 5-15kg rice is used for this ritual depending on the number of guests. However, only 5-10% akshat is actually showered on the couple,"" he added.""With over 20 crore population unable to feed themselves properly, the campaign would be launched extensively across the state. We will also urge people to either donate the rice to the poor or donate it to the committee which would ensure that it reaches to the needy,"" he added.Two years ago, a motley group of senior citizens launched a mission for a hunger-free society and formed the Save Food Committee. Its extensive campaign to ensure that no food in the city goes waste and reaches the deprived received overwhelming response from food caterers, city-based NGOs, owners of marriage and function halls and social activists.* Of the total akshat prepared for weddings, only 10% gets showered on the couples* On an average, 5-12 kg rice is used as akshat per marriage depending on the number of invitees* Maharashtra witnesses 1.5 lakh (approximately) weddings every year, which means 6 lakh kg rice gets wasted* The average price of rice is Rs 30 a kg, which means grains worth Rs 1.8 crore is wasted during weddings every year"

Citing example of subsidized rice scheme, the state BJP chief, said the Centre provides Rs 27 a kg while the state government pays Rs 2 a kg and the beneficiaries pays Rs 1. However, the BJD government showcases it as a major Naveen initiative, he added.Contesting the recent claims of the government that the state built 10 lakh pucca houses in the past two years, Panda said the government's recent reply in the assembly reveals 3.20 lakh houses were constructed in the state in 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16 (till December 2015). These include 2.44 lakh houses constructed under central schemes and 58,000 houses under Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana of the state.Panda said the government's neck deep collusion in chit fund and ration cards scams exposed Naveen's double standards on corruption.BJD parliamentary party leader Bhartruhari Mahtab, however, feels the Naveen government's popularity remains intact. Despite financial constraints and change in central plan structures, the BJD government has successfully managed to continue its pro-poor initiatives. ""We have achieved milestones in housing, jobs creation and food security,"" he said.The opposition is crying corruption and scams just for the sake of it. ""All these allegations are baseless. If they have facts and figures, they should come out with it. People have not accepted their false claims to defame the government and have continued to repose their faith on the Naveen government,"" said Mahtab.Panchayat elections are slated next year followed by urban body polls a year later. The Odisha assembly election is due in 2019. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to address a public meeting at Balasore on June 2 marking his two years in office. This would be his third meeting in the state this year. This is being seen as an increased BJP focus on the eastern state."

The 58-year-old, who plans to walk and jog for 3km, is not only celebrating her return to fitness but is happy to do the run with Hema George, her domestic help of three years. Since Pinkathon participants can nominate their mother, daughter or female household help free of cost, she chose to sign Hema up. ""I had not been keeping well and Hema was of great support to me. Now that I am better and walking regularly, I want to ensure that she too stays healthy,"" says Peswani.Whether it's signing up for runs or buying medical insurance, families in Chennai are working to ensure their domestic help remains fit and healthy. Especially since most of these women have little time, money or energy to take care of their medical needs.That's part of the reason why Peswani decided to take Hema along. All Pinkathon participants will get either a free medical check-up or a mammogram, depending on their age. ""I will be accompanying her to the hospital for the mammogram too,"" says Peswani, adding that she is thinking of signing up Hema's daughter for the run, which will be held on June 5 at Island Grounds.Working with the idea of inclusivity, Milind Soman, founder of Pinkathon, says ""We would like participants to support this idea by encouraging them to offer an experience to women who would ordinarily be left out like the household help.""Making medical treatment more accessible for his staff at home, IT professional Chandrasekaran Duraiswamy took medical insurance for his maid Shanthi eight years ago. ""We have just got the family a policy for 5 lakh, which will also cover her husband and two children. That way, they can get treated in private hospitals,"" says Duraiswamy, adding that Shanthi has been working with his family for the past 15 years. Health conscious that he is, sugar has been ruled out in his family. ""Everyone, including the domestic help has kanji (gruel) in the morning,"" he says.

""I also provide them with calcium, and vitamin B supplements, as well as nerve tonics and eye drops,"" says Mecheri. ""Generally their immunity is low and constitution weak as they are not used to taking care of their health."" Mecheri doesn't think she is doing anything out of her way as she considers them as her extended family. ""It is only natural to extend whatever you do for your family. You feel good about them working for you only if they are happy,"" she says.In the Gupta household, they ensure that their maid Monika, who is diabetic, eats healthy and also exercises. ""She doesn't understand the extent of her illness and is fond of sweets and rice so we take care of her diet and also make her go for a walk every evening though she is not too fond of it,"" says 55-year old Sanyukta Gupta. ""We also accompany her to the hospital for her tests.""The domestic help also treasure the bond they have forged with the families they work for.

They have begun researching ways to bio-fortify the two minerals in rice, considered the staple food across South India. At least two varieties are likely to be readied for testing across the country this year.TNAU's paddy breeding station has begun breeding a few new varieties of rice, which are expected to contain four to five times the normal content of iron and double the content of zinc. ""Besides, starch, protein and vitamins, polished rice contains around 2 to 4 ppm (parts per million) of iron and 8 ppm of zinc,"" says professor and project director of Centre for Molecular Breeding, S Robin.""We are targeting raising mineral content of polished rice to 10 to 12 ppm of iron and 24 ppm of zinc,"" he says. If they are successful, polished rice will contain more minerals than even what is found in brown rice currently-8 to 10 ppm of iron and 12 ppm of zinc. Iron and zinc deficiencies in our diet can often cause a host of health complications like anemia, low immunity, hair fall, nail breakage and even mental lethargy. Though meat, especially sea food, is a rich source of zinc and iron, with a sizeable population in the region being vegetarian, mineral deficiencies are rampant say both endocrinologists and dermatologists.""Iron deficiencies are more common than zinc, and is more common in women than men,"" says hematologist at Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, Dr Ramaprabhahari Satheshkumar. ""It causes tiredness, dizziness and even palpitations,""""This is why we came up with the idea of fortifying rice, which is a staple food,"" said Robin. ""And we decided to ensure that even milled rice will have these minerals, because most of the population consumes only milled rice, even though milling (polishing) removes most of its nutrients,"" he added.The bio-fortification research, sponsored by the central government's department of biotechnology and Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) is being done in three steps."

""Our request to the Centre (on supply of rice and wheat) was based on ratio of 85.82 (rice):14.18 (wheat) derived from the options of beneficiaries indicated in their NFSA applications,"" he added.Currently, the Centre has been allocating rice and wheat at the ratio of 78.83:21.17.Asked why is the state government not giving additional rice to the beneficiaries from its own resources, BJD spokesperson Pratap Deb said the state government is ready to provide but why should it be deprived of getting its right according to the food Act.Failure to supply food grain according to the choice of the NFSA beneficiaries is against the spirit of the Act. The Centre's move to provide more wheat to Odisha is due to the lobby of north India states, Deb added.Deb, a former food minister, said around 24% of the state's tribal population prefer rice in their daily diet. Besides, around 85% of rural population prefer rice to wheat."

Asked about the department's response in the light of the high court order, excise commissioner Kunwar Jung Bahadur said: ""We are yet to see the court order. We have no information so far about it. We are yet to receive it."" The excise commissioner reiterated that possession of liquor of any kind was still illegal so far as his department was concerned, and action would be taken as per the Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016. However, excise officials junior in rank to Kunwar said they know that the high court has passed orders to unseal the house of belonging to Nilesh Kumar in Aurangabad town, in which his uncle Sumir Sharma, a former liquor trader, had kept 140 bottles of foreign liquor. The bottles were seized by excise officials on April 21, the house was sealed and proceedings to confiscate it were initiated soon after that. As the case was filed in the high court, Acting Chief Justice Iqbal Ahmed Ansari ruled on May 26: ""A minute reading of the provisions of Section 19(4) (of the Bihar Excise Amendment Act 2016, makes it clear that by way of the said notification, issued in exercise of power under sub-section (4) of Section 19, the state government has not prohibited possession of liquor by anyone and unless such a notification is published, possession of foreign liquor would not become an offence punishable under the Act."" The high court order is expected to impact the purported possessors of liquor in the state, and has wider ramifications in the sense that the state government may mull, including sections to cover such an omission on its part while implementing total prohibition in the new excise act it is preparing to table in the state legislature in the upcoming monsoon session in July. The excise and police officials have so far conducted 34,470 raids since prohibition was imposed. Around 54,770 litres of country liquor, 37,670 litres of foreign liquor, 19,427 litres of spirit, 19,312 litres of liquor made from mahua and rice were seized in the raids.

""They are of this land - of this soil,"" he said. Sarmah said this year under Mohan's guidance they would produce vermicompost in large quantities so that they could sell it. Theirs is the only school in Upper Assam where boro rice variety grew on two bighas of land out of the 10 bighas acquired on lease, he proudly added. ""We also have a rooftop garden on which saplings of capsicum and papaya are grown and then distributed among students so that they can grow it in their kitchen gardens at home,"" Sarma said. Bora has made the lesson modules himself. Some of the practices that he teaches them have been handed down to him by his father and forefathers. Some, he said, had been taken from Internet. There is also the tried and tested mixing of cow dung and cow urine with gram powder ( besan) water and jaggery (gur) in a certain proportion which does wonders for plant growth. To this there is the indigenous knowledge of trapping red ants in a bowl into which pieces of dried fish, sugar, overripe bananas or jaggery are kept and then placed in the middle of a field. The ants which make a beeline for the bowl are then trapped and destroyed. Bora also has a recipe to keep away cattle. Mix together in water tobacco leaves, dhatura flower, a bitter plant, bihlongoni and spray the water on plants to keep away cows and goats . A way to get rid of stench from a drain, he said, is to take water in which rice is washed and preserve it in a container for two days. To this mix milk 10 times the amount of the water and keep it for a few days. The yellow scum will float. Mix this with a little amount water and sprinkle into the drains. Sarmah said they next planto set up handlooms and weave gamosas that would be sold in the market."

58f5e55e7be9e031da8d8473,State food subsidy for tea belt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160201/jsp/siliguri/story_66858.jsp,2016-02-01,"Alipurduar, Jan. 31: All residents of tea gardens will get rice and wheat at the rate of 45 paise a kilo, said state food minister Jyotipriya Mullick, two days after the BJP-led central government decided to acquire seven of 14 ailing tea gardens of the Duncans group. Mullick said the food grains would be given under the central National Food Security Act, although under this scheme, subsidised rice is given at the rate of Rs 2 a kilo and wheat at Rs 3 a kilo to the needy. The minister told The Telegraph over phone from Calcutta: ""Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is always trying to help the people residing in tea estates. At the state cabinet meeting held yesterday, it was decided that workers and non-workers of all the tea gardens will receive rice and wheat at the subsidised rate of 45 paisa a kilo. Under this scheme, each family will get 35 kilos of food grains each month, irrespective of the number of family members."" Left and BJP leaders in the tea belt said the move would indirectly benefit tea garden owners who would buy subsidised grains from the government and sell them to garden residents. A senior administrative official said the subsidised grains would have to be bought by the garden managements as they are bound under the Plantation Labour Act to provide low-cost grains and other services such as free water, power, firewood and health care to tea garden residents. Before the National Food Security Act came into force in 2013, rice and wheat used to be distributed under the Antodaya Annapurna Yojana in closed and ailing gardens. Under this scheme, 35kg of rice for Rs 2 a kg or wheat for Rs 3 a kg used to be given to every family every month. When the food security act was enforced, the Annapurna scheme benefit of 35 kg of grain per family was retained by the Centre for those who were receiving it because the plan served the poorest of the poor. In open and well-functioning gardens, the management used to give 2kg of rice and 1.7kg of wheat at the rate of 40 paisa a kilo every week for each member of the family under the Plantation Labour Act. Now, not just workers of well-functioning tea gardens, but residents of all tea estates in north Bengal will receive food grains at 45 paise a kg. The administrative official said: ""The planters used to buy food grain at the rate of Rs 9 per kilo from the state and distribute it among workers at the rate of 40 paise a kilo for rice and wheat. Under the new plan... the owners will buy food grain at the rate of Rs 2 per kilo and sell these among workers at 45 paisa per kilo."" The tea union leaders said that while the Trinamul-led state government was making a show of concern for tea belt residents, the 45-paise subsidy move was an indirect benefit to garden owners, who instead of buying a kilo of rice for Rs 9 earlier would purchase that now for Rs 2, thereby saving Rs 7 for each kilo. Ziaur Alam, the convener of the umbrella tea union conglomerate Joint Forum, said: ""The scheme has been designed to help tea planters as they would be saving Rs 7 while buying a kilo of food grain. The state should have explored some other option like implementing the food security act directly and sought immediate amendment to the Plantation Labour Act so that garden managements can be asked to pay in cash the amount they used to spend to provide subsidy to each worker on account of rations."" Ganga Prasad Sharma, the Alipurduar district BJP president, said: ""The state is doing politics with tea workers. We repeatedly asked for the Centre's intervention and the central government finally stepped in and decided to acquire seven tea estates of the Duncans group, all of which are in Alipurduar district. The state immediately announced distribution of food grains at a subsidised rate."" Sharma said that ""the Assembly polls are round the corner, Trinamul is desperate to woo tea workers by extending such subsidies."" Representatives of tea planters, when asked about the issue, said the state should call a meeting to clarify the issue. ""Tea garden managers have been functioning as ration dealers since 2007 when the Targeted Public Distribution System was introduced in estates. It is nothing new, only that the ration would be provided under the food security act now. However, there are certain issues which need to be sorted out to make the scheme completely functional in tea estates,"" Prabir Bhattacharjee, the secretary general of the Tea Association of India, said. ""It is evident that if the state goes ahead with distribution of food grains without involving the management and stops providing us food grains at a subsidised cost, we can no longer distribute rations, which means that would be a violation of the Plantation Labour Act."" He added: ""There is no question of depriving the workforce of their legitimate dues. We want the state to convene a meeting to discuss and sort out these issues.""

Members of the ruling party, opposition, even independent and rival groups are competing against each other to dole out freebies in their constituencies.Each party member is spending between Rs. 7 to Rs. 10 lakh in distributing sugarcane, jaggery, sugar and rice. Of the 23 constituencies in Puducherry district, party members in at least 15 constituencies are pushing their chances hard to enter and win the upcoming elections. There is not much activity in the five constituencies of Karaikal, one in Yanam and Mahe.Approximately, a minimum of Rs. 7.5 to 8 crore is spent in view of providing freebies for Pongal celebrations alone in Puducherry.Some of these constituencies include Lawspet, Thattanchavady, Muthialpet, Orleanpet, Nellithope, Ariyankuppam, Kalapet, Villianur and Ozhukarai.In these fifteen constituencies there are at least 90 potential candidates to contest the upcoming elections, who are splurging away money to woo voters. Many of these constituencies fall within the town limit. This includes at least three rival candidates within All India NR Congress (AINRC) in each constituency, one from Congress, AIADMK and DMK.With a population ranging from 23,000 to 30,000 each constituency has at least 15,000 households. Black-stemmed sugarcane costing Rs. 10 each is bought and distributed free of cost. For this, a potential candidate is spending at least Rs. 3 lakh. These sugarcane are bought from Kallakurichi, Tiruvannamalai, Shankarapuram, Salem and Erode.Though the candidates acknowledge they are distributing sugarcane and other freebies, no one wants to reveal how much they are spending.Congress party member John Kumar in Nellithope constituency is advertising in a local television channel that he is distributing free organic sugarcane from his farm to every household, area and ward in this constituency. Congress State secretary P.M. Saravanan said he purchased 25,000 sugarcane from his father-in-laws farm to distribute in Muthialpet.Not just this, people in these constituencies is being flooded with calendars which cost Rs. 65 to Rs. 70. In addition to this, a kilogram of sugar at Rs. 35 is distributed to the households free of cost.Party members are also distributing induction cooker, vessels, rice and toor dal.The questions as to where do they get the money and who is accounting for these freebies still remains unanswered."

He traces his roots to the villageAt a glancePopulation of the village: 10,000 (approx.)Area of village: 4 sq kmDuring a hill cutting exercise for laterite bricks, at a foot of a hill in the ward of Naquelim, a cave was accidentally discoveredSurrounded by three distinct hills, Chicalim or 'Chicle' in Konkani, is a tiny village in the Mormugao taluka; it is nestled in a valley embraced by Alto Chicalim (on the west), Regina Mundi (on the south) and the Naval Armament Depot (to the north), laced by the banks of River Zuari , the epitome of serenity.Chicalim is rich in coconut, mango, cashew and mangrove plantations. Today, very few rice and vegetable fields are seen in the village due to farming taking a back seat. These fields are privately owned by local families who organically or conventionally cultivate agricultural produce.The village is also blessed with wells and natural ponds. Having been bestowed with such natural heritage, residents hold the village very dear. Residents believe that their village is among the oldest civilizations of Goa and this is what gives the village a distinguished character, and them an unmistakable identity.Speak to any Chicalim Villagers Action Committee (CVAC) member about this, and you will be surprised by the never-ending conversation that enlightens you about the village's tremendous potential, tourism being a primary one. It is home not only to Goa's oldest natural rock formed human shelter, pit-dwellings of the megalithic era, ruins of St Bartholomew's church, Chicalim church, Chicalim khazan, Vareg island, St Jacinto island and around 10 Indo-Portuguese influenced heritage houses, but a wide spectrum of colourful birds as well.Of particular interest, is the first known evidence of pre-historic settlements discovered in Goa way back in the 70s. During a hill cutting exercise for laterite bricks, at a foot of a hill in the ward of Naquelim , a cave was accidentally discovered. German Indologist and art historian Gritli Metterwalner, along with members of the Goa, archaeology department visited the site and discovered two more such underground caves and pot shreds in these caves. Scientific study of these pot shreds put the age of the pottery to the megalithic period. The pieces today find a place of pride in the Goa State Museum where they are prominently displayed.The St Bartholomew's church was built in the 1500s during the Portuguese rule. Not many know about this landmark, but, if one wants a sneak peek into history, its remains can still be seen. The Chicalim church, also known as St Francis Xavier church or the St Bartholomew's church, was rebuilt in the 1700s. The Chicalim church was initially dedicated to St Bartholomew and later to St Francis Xavier, and that's why it is referred to by both names. It celebrates the feast of St Francis Xavier and Mary Immaculate in December. One can also find the Palloti Retreat House where the feast of its patron is celebrated in January.The Chicalim khazan and Vareg island are two of the most spectacular sites. Here, it is where traditional extraction of clams, windowpane oysters, shellfish, among other marine products, can be observed.St Jacinto church was originally a chapel founded before 1731, rebuilt in 1789 and extended in 1830. The St Jacinto island, on which it is situated, isn't a very popular tourist spot. But the government recognized its potential a few years ago and undertook a facelift of the connecting bridge to the island, increasing its aesthetic appeal. This island has one of the two lighthouses found in the village. The other is located behind the naval armament depot. These light houses are non-operational and belong to the Mormugao Port Trust.Two of the estimated 10 majestic Indo-Portuguese influenced heritage houses in Chicalim belong to the Costa Araujos and Azaredo families. Some of these houses have crossed the century mark, while some date close to five centuries old. They reflect the true essence of Goa as every element in the house speaks volumes of its history.Look outside the window and amidst the lush green cover you will spot birds like rufous woodpecker, spotted dove, gold-fronted chloropsis, Malabar trogon, Wire-tailed swallow, greater coucol, to name a few. While these have been captured and identified by photographers, some still fly free without a name.The very first school born in the village was Regina Mundi High School run and built since the 1970s by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. This school is instantly recognized by the monument of Mother Mary in the form of Regina Mundi; a statue constructed by the Cloistered Carmel, the only nun convent in Chicalim."

The DM was irked over the slackness of district cooperative officer (DCO) as despite his instruction, the latter was not showing seriousness in lodging an FIR against the defaulter chairpersons. The DM has threatened to take punitive action against the DCO if he delays action against defaulter PACS chairpersons.According to cooperative sources, an FIR has been lodged against the chairpersons of Tole, Bajar Verma, Khaira, Bhopatpur and Jankope for not returning rice to the SFC despite repeated instructions by the officials concerned. It is to be noted that the district has earned bad reputation for not retuning rice to the SFC. Paddy procurement has also been under scanner because of a tussle between PACSs and SFC.Besides defaulter chairmen, five BCEOs have also been found guilty of dereliction of duty. Nodal officer of paddy procurement Ramanugrah Narayan Singh said show-cause notices have been slapped on Kutumba, Madanpur, Nabinagar, Obra and Rafiganj BCEOs. They have been directed to explain their position.Officials engaged in paddy procurement said PACS chairpersons indulged in selling CMR rice on black market.SDPO (sadar) PN Sahu said after lodging of FIR, police would conduct inquiry into the matter and legal action would be taken if allegations are proved."

As per agriculture department, almost 35,000 hectare of area from soyabean has shifted to cotton in addition to the ever increasing area under cotton every in last decade. Total of 18,86,556ha area has been cultivated under kharif this year.While soyabean has taken exactly 50% of the average area under kharif, cotton has taken 155% of the total area under the crop in the season. This year 6,07,276 hectare has been covered under cotton whereas the normal expected area under the crop is expected to be 3,92,100 hectares. In soyabean, of the expected 5,53,500ha area, only 2,79,023ha area has been sowed in the Nagpur division covering Nagpur, Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gondia , Gadchiroli and Wardha districts.Interestingly, despite the rice belt of Bhandara, Gondia, Chandrapur getting almost 40-60% less rainfall in August, the sowing of paddy and transplantation has been completed in 107% area, covering 7,82,912 hectare area.The joint director agriculture (JDA) Vijay Gawhate told TOI that the area under soyabean has been gradually declining in the division for past many years due to decreasing yields. This year the crop is expected to be hit badly due to scanty rains during the peak monsoon period in August when enough rain is required for the pod formation. The pod may not just be small but also may be much lesser in size overall decreasing the area under the crop.Maximum area under cotton has come in Nagpur district where 221% of the total average area under cotton is under the crop this season. In Wardha this figure is 120% and 151% in Chandrapur district. A non-cotton district like Gadchirioli has witnessed 231% of average area under cotton.In Gondia, 1,87,492 hectare is under paddy, Bhandara at 1,66,958 hectare and 1,58,047 hectare in Chandrapur district.

Needless to say, the fourth advance estimates for the foodgrain production during 2015-16 has been pegged at 130.63 lakh tonnes, which has never been achieved before, said R. Doraikannu, Agriculture Minister.In the last five years, the State surpassed 100 lakh tonnes four times. For 2016-17, the State has set a target of 147.80 lakh tonnes. The vision was to double agriculture production and triple the farmers income, he said.In the last five years, 11,880 villages were covered by the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) as a whole village concept and 27.20 lakh acres were brought under this technology, which helped it get a yield of 4,429 kg of paddy per hectare, he said, adding that this year 3,000 more villages were being covered by SRI.In the Budget Speech 2016-2017, it was announced that the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce (Regulation) Act 1987 will be amended for improving the marketing of agricultural produce. In order to implement National Agriculture Market, amendments are required in the existing Tamil Nadu Agricultural Marketing (Regulation) Act 1987 to include e-Trading, single point levy of market fee, unified single licence, private market, direct wholesale market, contract farming and a farmers consumer market.For the promotion of NAM, 100 Regulated Markets are selected on the basis of commodity arrival for availing financial assistance for hardware.

But the State government has made little effort to address the issue of hunger and underdevelopment in habitations of Juanga tribe, said Mr. Naik.Pradip Purohit, another MLA who reached the village by trekking a hill, said, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik must visit the village to see how much development has taken place in his 16 year of rule. The situation in Nagada is as bad as that of in drought zones of Ethiopia.While the primitive tribal community is left to die slow death in forested region, funds allotted for six houses under Indira Awas Yojna scheme has been embezzled by a BJD worker. One cannot find any trace of government programmes in that village, Mr. Purohit said.Congress teamA team of Congress team which visited the region said Nagada was not the only villager where chronic malnutrition was prevailing. Almost all villages, we came across during our visit, depicted similar depressing picture.The development, the Naveen Patnaik government has been bragging to have achieved in the State, is a joke in Nagada, said Sulochana Das, a member of Congress delegation.Ms. Das said, only 15 beneficiaries from the village are getting old age pension while every member of the community requires government support. Even after 70 years of independence, the government has not been able provide basic service like drinking water and education in the village.Pradip Pradhan, convenor of Right To Food, Odisha who had visited the spot said, many families of Nagada have not been provided ration card under National Food Security Act due to irregularities in survey conducted by government As per guideline of Antodaya Anna Yojana, every Juanga family deserves to get each 35 kg rice per month, but most tribal communities have not been covered under the scheme."

Netafim, an Israeli company specialising in drip irrigation technique, had sanctioned Rs. 4 lakh to the tnstitute to take up the research, said P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the Institute.Speaking to The Hindu after inaugurating the programme, Mr. Pandiyarajan said that this was the first time the institute had taken up the research using drip irrigation technique, although similar experiments had been conducted at Aduthurai and other places. About 2 kg of seeds was used for each variety. He said that the experiment would include study on nutrient management, irrigation management and good cultivation practices. The entire 60 cents of the field has been covered with over 77 laterals, each of 50 metre in length. Each lateral contains 130 holes or drip spacing through which water and water-soluble fertiliser will be supplied, he said.T. Ramesh, Assistant Professor of Agronomy, who has been coordinating the programme, said all parameters including the rainfall received during the research period, climatic change will be closely monitored. In addition, a few cultures which are under research had been included for the research. The growth of the plant with fertiliser, without fertiliser, with nitrogen, with less nitrogen would be analysed.The research will be a boon to farmers getting inadequate water for irrigation. It will guide the farmers with abundant availability of water to utilise the resource judiciously. These are the other objectives of the programme, he said ."

The weathers been infuriatingly indecisive lately: moodily soggy one minute and recklessly bright the next. In a cunning attempt to pre-empt an attack of the sniffles, I whip up a cup of creamy hot chocolate, suitably dark, with just enough bitterness to give it an edge. Then, I sneeze.One friend tells me vodka is great for colds, another swears by brandy. However, all I have is a bottle of Jack Daniels. I add a generous glug of it to my cup of hot chocolate. Its absolutely dreadful.Perhaps, its best to take a more traditional route. Apparently, turmeric milk spiked with pepper is the home remedy of choice at times like this. I wouldnt know. My mothers idea of traditional healing is giving me two Vitamin C tablets and a lecture on why partying late into the night is the sole reason Im sick. So, I turn to the recipe mothership, Pinterest, and am rapidly submerged in turmeric latte hysteria. Dont worry. I wont bore you with the benefits. Suffice it to say that Gwyneth Paltrow has added it to her morning routine. She reportedly drinks it with ginger, coconut sugar, coconut oil and a pinch of sea salt. As everyone knows, shes the Kardashian of new-age food trends, so we better get on board fast.Shopping malls used to be my happy place. Now, its gourmet food stores, with their fascinating array of kombuchas, farm-fresh cheese and organic indigenous food.As I browse contentedly, looking for the requisite fresh turmeric, sea salt and coconut milk, Im delighted to stumble upon dramatically inky kavuni rice. Back at home, I grab my blender determinedly, but I just cant go through with it. My vociferous Mallu genes protest at the idea of turning a cup of rich coconut milk into a pretentious yellow oil-slick.So, I turn my attention to the bag of kavuni instead. Although black rice is still fairly rare in urban India, it is steadily gaining popularity for its high nutritional value, unique texture and intriguing nutty flavour. High in fibre and minerals, it is a great source of iron. Packed with antioxidants and phytochemicals, this rice is said to lower bad cholesterol levels, decrease inflammation and fight heart disease. Its also a really cool colour. A brooding black that turns almost purple when cooked.After washing the rice multiple times, I soak it overnight, then pressure-cook it in the morning for ten minutes. According to traditional Chettinad recipes, its perfect for payasam. Indiscriminately blending Thai cooking, Chettinad recipes and Nouvelle cuisine, I stir in coconut milk, jaggery and a healthy pinch of salt. I then add a handful of toasted sesame seeds. The rice grains, much like an overly-muscled schoolyard thug, stand their ground. Even after an additional 15 minutes of stirring, they hold their shape. Chewy, but pleasantly so. Unlike white rice, which tends to get mushy, this retains its personality, yet manages to unite all the ingredients into a sweet, comforting flavour-pastiche.Looking for more information, I track down the remarkable Potshangbam Devakanta. Based in Manipur, he works on preserving indigenous varieties of rice, concentrating on Chakhao Poireiton, a black sticky rice revered for its medicinal properties. Devakanta was awarded the PPVFRA (Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act) conservation award for his work in 2012.Over the phone, he tells me Manipur has 300 varieties of rice, of which about ten are black. Realising its potential  theres an enthusiastic market overseas and a slowly expanding Indian consumer base  farmers in Assam now grow a respectable quantity. Devakanta says hes given seeds to Assamese farmers, and the rice is thriving there. Strains like Chakhao Poireiton taste best when grown on their home soil, he contends. Outside Manipur, the aroma becomes less. Also the stickiness.Explaining why few farmers grow this rice, Devakanta says, The yield is less. One hectare produces about two tonnes of black rice, as opposed to white rice which can yield up to 4.5 tonnes with modern farming methods. He adds, Also, it is better organic. If you use chemical fertilizers with Chakhao Poireiton, the yield decreases. Since the rice is indigenous, its quite hardy and does not require as much water as commercial white rice. All of which makes it an ideal desi superfood: clean, convenient and cheap. I paid Rs. 55 for 250 grams. Devakanta sells a kilo for Rs. 150.Now, I see on the Internet, it has got high medicinal value also, he says. For us, its traditional. Our ancestors have always cultivated and eaten this rice. We make kheer. We make it into herbal tea. Just dry it in the sun, grind and mix one spoon with hot water. As porridge, it gives energy. He adds, My favourite method is to make it like suji halwa. Its very tasty. And after one small cup, I can go to the fields and work for six hours!"

Sometimes, he said, there was no breakfast.My employer told my parents over the phone that I was very happy and that I was studying a lot. I was never allowed to talk to them, the child said.Once when the police raided the factory, Imtiyazs employer asked him to pretend to be studying with his son. Once the police left, the boy was sent back to work.Things took a turn for the better after another police raid. Imtiyaz and the other children at the factory were finally rescued.I am in Class VI now. My favourite subject is Math and I want to become an engineer, Imtiyaz said.Little changeIt has been 14 years since June 12 was declared World Day Against Child Labour. But in India, as many as 65 per cent children suffer from poor health; while 40 per cent are child labourers.Add to this the fact that each child labourer has experienced abuse and exploitation at least once, and that girl children endure far more deprivation than boys.Further, it has been six years since the Right To Education Act was passed. Yet, majority of these children are school drop-outs, while there are others who never enrolled.One visit to the fringes of the Capital is enough to witness how this unorganised sector operates, how the laws protecting children are blatantly violated. Here, a large number of migrant families  including women and children  are recruited by labour agents and employed in brick kilns, construction sites, stone crushing and laying of roads and pipelines.According to the Young Lives at Work Sites study conducted by NGO Aide et Action and the Bernard Van Leer Foundation (BvLF), brick-making units absorb the maximum number of child labourers in the country.Out of every five bricks, two are made by children accompanying their parents who migrate in search of livelihood. The debt or the advance migrant labourers borrow from the middlemen is paid back not by working, but by involving their children in work sites, says Umi Daniel, Regional Head (Migration), Aide et Action, South Asia.In fact, work at a brick kiln is designed in a way that needs all members of the family to participate.Children at these sites are made to walk on the newly-made bricks, which are laid out to dry, in order to check their consistency.The study on the status and condition of young migrants living at worksites in Delhi, Chennai, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Patna, Hyderabad and Guwahati portrays a very grim picture of the children engaged here.A mammoth 90 per cent of seasonal migrant children are excluded from accessing the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), while 80 per cent of children in the school-going age do not access education near work sites.Except Hyderabad, almost all the children at work sites do not benefit from anganwadis.Governments in the other seven States are yet to extend the ICDS services to cater to the needs of the intra or inter-State migrants and their families.The study, which was conducted in 2013, says that children between the ages of 6 to 14 years comprise half of the total child labour population.Talking about the level of education of these children, Mr. Daniel says: Most school enrolments happen at the village of origin. The number of children who continue to study at the destination decreases substantially. On the other hand, 39 per cent of the total child labour population in the age group of 6 to 14 years never enrolled in any school, neither at the source nor the destination.Brick-making units absorb the maximum number of migrant and child labourersin the country"
58f5f4b7a3d24b0b70c26798,The man from Porto Empedocle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-man-from-porto-empedocle/article8661508.ece,2016-05-29,"A new book by the 90-year-old Andrea Camilleri, in an English translation, is a great event. Montalbanos First Case and Other Stories is a collection of stories about Sicilys most celebrated police inspector. After millions of copies and an immensely popular television series, a bronze statue of Inspector Montalbano now faces that of the playwright Luigi Pirandello in Camilleris birthplace, the town of Porto Empedocle. Or, as the town is now popularly known, in honour of the fictional setting of the Montalbano novels: Porto Empedocle Vigata.One knows not to expect tidy endings in a Montalbano story. In the old days, detective fiction provided reassurance that in times of disorder, someone capable would come along and fix everything. Thats how it was in the golden age of the detective novel, between the wars: cosy mysteries in country houses, footprints in the flower bed, and denouements in large room with fireplaces. Very posh and Downton Abbey.Change in crime fictionSince then, times have changed, and so has the crime novel. In Salvo Montalbanos Sicily, we find an ancient Mediterranean landscape now beleaguered by corruption, trafficking, immigration issues, drugs, environmental degradation, and the mafia. The first time we see Montalbano summoned as a witness in court, the accused is a mafia scion and the public prosecutors statement sounds like a defence argument. In his first year on the job, we are told, Montalbano dived headlong into these Mafia murder cases, only to come up empty-handed. Nobody had seen anything, nobody had heard anything, nobody suspected anything, nobody imagined anything, nobody knew anyone.Yet against this background, we see Montalbano and his colleagues doggedly climbing up hillsides to talk to shepherds, visiting hospices to listen to dying statements, taking the train when the airlines are on strike, standing in line before court clerks, and generally trying to do their best in an imperfect world.G.K. Chesterton once wrote that the detective novel expresses some sense of the poetry of modern life, and that the policeman, trying to deliver justice to ordinary people, is a poetic figure in the city. In the wasteland of contemporary urban life, Montalbano finds his identity in his work. Im like a photograph, he says to his girlfriend Livia. I exist insofar as theres a negative made up of crimes, murder and acts of violence.A facet of Montalbanos character is that he reads and rereads, often obsessively. His reflective temperament makes him think of stories by Borges and quotes from Roland Barthes. In a Pirandellesque twist in one story, Montalbano finds the details of the crime too oppressive and telephones his author to say so. His name itself is a feat of inter-textuality: Camilleri named his fictional detective after the Spanish writer Manuel Vazquez Montalban, the creator of the witty private eye Pepe Carvalho.Sicilian charactersUnlike the infallible detectives of earlier crime fiction, Montalbano is all too human: beset by bad dreams, self-doubt, mood swings, an irascible temperament, a kind heart and a weakness for good food. He often lies, bends rules, and hates signing papers. At the same time, he has an unshakable sense of duty and responsibility. When he sees an old lady walking home at two in the morning, he insists on dropping her home. When an elderly small-time burglar calls him one night with information, he takes coffee for him in a thermos. In Montalbanos view, everyone deserves a fair chance. Sometimes I ask myself what proof God had to accuse Cain of murdering Abel, he tells a priest in one story. If I could, I swear Id reopen the case.Unforgettable Sicilian characters shine through Camilleris stories. In Montalbanos first case, his boss is described as unfit (for the job) because he wasnt afraid of anybody. In another, a villager wrongly accused of murder is described by the locals as a shepherd king, one who would never cut down a nettle, let alone kill a man.And then there is Montalbanos cook, the incomparable Adelina whom we rarely see except through her heavenly food. Montalbano has one eye on her wastrel sons and the other on her caponata. On New Year eve she writes a note to Montalbano, inviting him home for dinner: Botha my boys are free and I gonna meck arancini rice balls wich they lika so much. Despite his belief that the best meals are eaten alone, Montalbano decides to accept the invitation. Only one question still nagged him before he fell asleep: would both of Adelinas delinquent sons manage to stay out of gaol until tomorrow?Camilleris inventive, ironic prose, in a unique mix of Italian and Sicilian, comes to us through the elegant translations of Stephen Sartarelli, an American poet based in France. His translators notes are a pleasure in themselves. When we read that old issues of Topolino covered the floor, Sartarelli explains that Topolino is Mickey Mouse in Italian, a popular fortnightly that still exists today.Adelina will not cook pasta in Trapanese pesto sauce and Montalbano must therefore organise it for himself. Sartarelli informs us that this recipe substitutes blanched almonds for pine nuts, along with uncooked tomato; and toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on the dish instead of cheese. Like the Montalbano novels, this sounds like a special delight.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the IASand currently based in Bengaluru.Montalbanos reflective temperament makes him think of stories by Borges and quotes from Roland BarthesUnlike the infallible detectives of earlier crime fiction, Montalbano is all too human"

At present, it has hardly 79,201 hectares. Even the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act of 2008 to conserve paddy fields has failed to arrest the trend, said Richard Scaria, an assistant professor with the department.25 ha reclaimed a yearThough rice fields in Palakkad constitute hardly 38.51 per cent of the acreage under paddy cultivation, it still accounts for 62 per cent of rice production in the State, he said.As per surveys conducted by the department, about 25 hectares of rice fields are reclaimed every year to cultivate cash crops and to convert to real estate. If it continues, paddy fields in Palakkad would disappear in another 35 years.Lack of government support, delay in release of procurement price, climate change impact, and change in land-use patterns are preventing farmers from continuing with paddy cultivation.Besides, there is a growing preference among farmers to ginger cultivation.Rice fields are being leased out to farmers from outside the State to cultivate ginger.At present, ginger is cultivated in 20,488 ha, classified earlier as paddy fields. Real estate lobbies buy paddy fields from farmers at cheap rates and convert them to house plots.Make it profitableThe farmers are forced to sell the fields owing to loss in paddy cultivation. The government should make paddy cultivation profitable, says farmers leader Muthalamthode Mani. Labour shortage is another issue.Farmers now depend on workers from Bengal in the absence of local labour force.Into oblivion25 hectares of rice fields are reclaimed every year in district, says surveyGroundwater level goes down in districtIncreasing temperature partially attributed to field reclamation"

We have decided to procure the surplus products and supply it to the states hit by the drought. This policy will help both the stakeholders such as the states having surplus production and those who require foodgrain,"" Paswan told the media after a Lok Jan Shakti Party workers' meeting.He said the Union government has decided to supply 5 lakh tonnes of rice and wheat to Maharashtra to tide over the drought. ""It is expected from the state governments to lift the quota by October this year in phases and supply it to the needy people through the public distribution system (PDS). Recently, Maharashtra has started lifting the quota,"" he said.Paswan said the NDA government, under Modi, ""has effectively implemented the Food Security Act in the last two years"". he said, ""We have progressed on six parameters. We have blocked 1.62 crore forged ration card holders, have increased the number of states implementing the act from 11 to 33, have brought the ration cards online and have installed GPS to track vehicles carrying food grains for PDS. We have effectively linked the system with Aadhar cards and have minimised the corruption in PDS.""Buffer stock of pulses: Paswan said in the wake of the row over rise in prices of pulses, especially 'tur', the union government has decided to create a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes. ""We have so far created a stock of around 1.25 lakh tonnes. It will be doubled in near future. This year, we will have stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes. I have asked the state governments to make sure that the price of tur dal does not exceed Rs 120 a kg. It is not only the Centre's responsibility to keep a tab on 'tur' dal price.

He remembers his son weighed 16.3kg before being taken for surgery. Most of the rice he took to school that day was still in his lunch box.The last thing Purushottam remembers is his son sitting on the hospital chair, fiddling with his mobile phone. ""I remember asking him what happened. But in a hurry, I couldn't get a proper answer. He was sitting next to me, waiting for the doctor. He was playing a game on my mobile. I don't know what happened inside but the fact is my son is suffering now,"" he said.Purushottam was told by the school authorities that Lakshay injured his fingers while playing in the classroom.

However, police turned down the request saying that the I-T department should approach a court regarding the matter.Hyderabad police seized Rs 1.19 crore from godman Shivananda, who duped the realtor in the guise of doubling the amount. Madhusudhan Reddy is the owner of Lifestyle building in Begumpet. They arrested Shivananda and his two accomplices - Damodar and Srinivas Reddy.In a press conference on Friday, Hyderabad police Commissioner Mahender Reddy narrated the sequence of the crime and confirmed that the I-T officials did contact them.Mahendar Reddy said that the it was several months ago at Bangalore Golf Club that Madhusudhan Reddy met Shivananda and he was impressed by the conman's act of doubling money. Though a few family members claimed that the amount was being used for Lakshmi puja, Reddy refuted it saying that they placed the amount there to double it after Shivananda showed a sample act.""I am disclosing the details as per the accused's confession. First the accused made the victims give Rs 1.5 lakh during the puja and using his conning skills, he secretly put another Rs 1.5 lakh there, making the victims believe that the amount had been doubled. Then they decided to put more money and took out Rs 1.3 crore so that the 'godman' could double it. But this time, the conman slipped them drug-laced prasadam, after eating which Madhusudhan and his wife became unconscious.""After cleverly stealing the Rs 1.3 crore, Shivananda called the other accused Damodar and Srinivas Reddy to come to GVK One mall. He had earlier taken Rs 1.5 lakh from them, which was used during the puja to con the victims. As Shivananda had promised them to given them thrice the loan amount, he gave them Rs 12.5 lakh.

They alleged that BJD is trying to divert the attention from chit fund scam by raising the rice issue inside and outside the assembly.Talking to mediapersons, BJP state vice president Samir Mohanty said the BJD government is jittery after food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma's name figured in the CBIs chargesheet and chit fund panel head MM Das' controversial statement on investors at the BJD legal cell function.""The BJD marched towards Raj Bhawan and informed governor on the rice issue only to suppress the chit fund heat. The rice demand is an attempt to cover up Das Burma's episode. We will not allow them to do so and intensify our agitation to unmask the ruling party,"" said Mohanty.The BJP leader said Das Burma purchased a motorcycle by taking loan from a bank a few years ago. ""How can a person make a fortune within such short span of time? The BJD should clarify this issue,"" he said.At least 12 companies were registered in the residential and official address of Das Burma in 13 years, he alleged.Mohanty said they would sensitize people on the issue and make them aware about the regional party's links with chit fund accused.BJD spokesperson Samir Das came down heavily on BJP for mixing both the issues. ""Chit fund issue and rice demand are two different things. We have been demanding more rice from the Centre under NFSA, but in vain. People of Odisha prefer rice over wheat. We took up the issue with the Centre again and it agreed to consider it,"" said Das."

They were apprehended by the police moments after they committed the crime.Police sources said the complainant A. Raja (29) of Sengipatti in Thanjavur district engaged in rice business came to Tiruchi from Karur district in the late hours on his way home.While proceeding towards the central bus stand, Raja came across Govindaraj who reportedly told him that he was proceeding to Thanjavur in the car and that the latter could board the vehicle, the sources said.Raja boarded the car inside which Priya and Sania were seated. As the car reached Mannarpuram, one of the transgenders laid her hand on the gold chain worn by Raja.The businessman, apparently annoyed at this, slapped the transgenders hand. The transgenders allegedly snatched the gold chain from Raja who got down midway.Even before the car sped away, Raja noted down the vehicles registration number and informed the beat constables on duty at TVS Tollgate area.

With changes in economic policies, the Central government has increased funds allocation to the States. Now the States share has gone up from 32 per cent to 48 per cent, he said.The Minister was in Hassan to interact with party workers regarding the Central governments schemes and programmes. The Centre had been liberal in its approach to State governments, no matter which government is in power. But it is unfortunate that some schemes of the Centre have been renamed by the State governments and being projected as their own. He was referring to Hosa Belaku, recently launched by the Karnataka government.Further, Dr. Vardhan said the interaction with party workers was planned by the Prime Minister to get feedback on the governments programmes. The Prime Minister was an icon before and after the elections. He is always full of ideas for the betterment of the country and the welfare of its people, he added.Mysuru Lok Sabha member Pratap Simha, in his keynote address, said the Modi-led Central government had launched many development works in the last 18 months and they have already begun to impact the common mans life. But, the Karnataka government has been taking mileage for the programmes funded by the Centre. The Centre procures rice at Rs. 32 per kg and gives it to the State at Rs. 3. Here, the State government is distributing the rice in the name of Annabhagya. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah puts his picture on the rice bags though his role in the scheme is minimal, Dr. Vardhan said.Regarding Hosa Belaku, a scheme to provide LED bulbs to households, Mr. Simha said Mr. Modi had already launched the scheme Way to Light in January 2015. The Siddaramaiah government renamed it as Hosa Belaku.Responding to allegations that Mr. Modi was spending most of his time in foreign visits, Mr. Simha said the former had visited many countries to secure and strengthen our borders.Party workers, participating in the interaction, raised issues related to scientific price for agricultural crops, subsidy for fertilisers, quality power for farmers, and an IIT for Hassan.It is unfortunate that some schemes of the Centre have been renamed by State governments"

This Russian girl seems to be an exception. Photo: B.V.S. BhaskarFor East and West Godavari districts, touted as the rice bowl of the State, kick-start the three-day harvest festival, Pongal, with Bhogi. The first day is dedicated to Lord Indra, who is the god of rain. He is worshiped for abundance of harvest, which brings prosperity.Lighting a bonfire is the hallmark of Bhogi. However, the tradition is disappearing in most villages.In olden days, youth used to make a bonfire of tree trunks (Bhogi mantalu) in one corner of the street in the early hours of the day, recalls Tirumal Rao, a villager of Arthamuru.Preparation of traditional sweets at houses is also part of the festival. But due to availability of pure home-made sweets in the market round the year, traditional preparations are going out of fashion.Polisetty Mallibabu, owner of Suruchi Foods that dishes out the popular Tapeswaram Kaja, says: Bulk booking of dishes such as ariselu, kajjikayalu, paakundalu, gorumitteelu, muripeelu, jantikalu, chegodilu, challa guttulu, pootharekulu, sunnundalu, and bobbatlu has come down drastically.The present generation has forgotten about jeellu, which has a long history. They were once in huge demand, particularly during village festivals (tirunallu), Mr. Mallibabu says.Connecting onsocial mediaPeddinti Seetharamaih Bhargav, an octogenarian medical practitioner Korukonda, says that his children and grandchildren, who have come from Hyderabad and the U.S. to the village, are busy connecting with their friends on the social media. My granddaughter says that she knows about Sankranti as she has read postings about the festival on the Facebook, Dr. Bhargav says. Says Vedic scholar Mahamahopadhyaya Sri Viswanatha Gopalakrishna: On Bhogi day, people clean their homes, collect unwanted goods, and make a bonfire of them. The day is meant for undertaking such domestic activities. The tradition of placing pumpkin flowers set in cow dung balls among rangoli patterns has disappeared, thanks to cement roads and apartment culture. Freshly harvested rice, turmeric, and sugarcane are not seen anywhere."
58f5fee6a3d24b0b70c26e54,Traditional manja makers upbeat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/traditional-manja-makers-upbeat/article8109957.ece,2016-01-15,"What is the difference between these two types of manjas? asked Rajesh, who was at Mohammed Iqbal and Sons kites store at Dabeerpura. Snap came the sound four seconds later. Without replying to him, Mohd. Rahmat asked his helper to hold a strand of both the pink and brown threads, and ran them against each other, with the latter snapping in an instant.That was shop owner Rahmats way of telling Rajesh that hand-made manja is stronger and better than the Chinese manja, known as Tangus in the market. After a decade of seeing his traditional manja making business wane, the State governments latest order banning the Tangus has given a new lease of life to Rahmat and several others.In fact, we made manja today morning as well. This is the final year for the Tangus, and we will start preparing for next year very soon, said Rahmat. He explained that before the Chinese manja flooded the kite markets about 10 years ago, traditional manja makers used to have work for about eight months a year. About 20 metres from Rahmats store, 55-year old Mohd. Jawed Khan was busy applying a pink and fluorescent mixture of glass, rice and egg on white thread. Mr. Jawed, who learnt the trade from his father, took to driving an auto over the last few years after workers deserted the manja making business once the Tangus became the preferred choice by wholesalers and kite-flyers. A full-time auto driver now, he is ready to return to his trade after learning of the ban.But it will be very hard to get workers back to this field. Shop owners pay us just Rs. 50 per roll, and we can make about 20 rolls a day. The money I make will not be sufficient to pay to my workers, Mr. Jawed said. Busy applying the manja masala on the white thread, he said that the ban on Tangus should have come years earlier, as most of the workers had deserted the profession to take up odd jobs, or had become auto drivers.For shopkeepers, however, it will now be back to giving orders in advance to manja makers at Dabeerpura and Dhoolpet. Unlike Tangus which they can procure over a phone call, they will now have to order the quantities of manja they require well in advance."
