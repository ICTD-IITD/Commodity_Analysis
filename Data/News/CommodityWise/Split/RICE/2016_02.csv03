PHOTO: M. SRINATHThe yield in TRY 3 rice variety raised at the research farms at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University  Anbil Dharmalingam Agricultural College and Research Institute is expected to increase this season, thanks to crop protection methods and timely setting up of the northeast monsoon in the district.About 18 acres of area has been brought under the crop this season and the yield is expected to be 2.5 tonnes an acre, P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the institute, told The Hindu here on Thursday.He attributed the rise in the yield this season to the continued crop protection technique being adopted by the research scholars, scientists, and farm workers of the Institute.While the actual harvest of the fields was expected to be taken up next week, a preliminary study conducted on the eve of Pongal festival revealed that the yield would be at least 20 per cent over the last seasons achievement.Students studyMeanwhile, the research students have taken up a comparative study on the efficiency of various varieties of paddy being raised on the farm on the college campus.Led by S. Priyanka, the students had taken up a study on the maximum advantage of each and every variety.The number of productive tillers, length of panicles, and combining ability and sodicity tolerance are some of the factors which are analysed, say R. Gayathri and Amrutha Unni who co-sponsored the study.Rajasekar Patcha and E. Devi Chandravadhana said the research would be closely monitored till the best variety was evolved."

The State is witnessing water scarcity for the second straight year and the storage in most reservoirs is low. Instead of water-intensive crops, farmers should take up cultivation of pulses and oilseeds, which will bring them more income, the Minister said.He said as paddy is cultivated by flooding the fields, the problem of soil salinity has been reported in many parts. It is necessary to create awareness among farmers on judicious utilisation of water through water users societies. Mr. Thimmappa called upon CADA officials and UAHS scientists to develop demonstration plots on cultivating crops with economic utilisation of water.Working out crop patternAddressing the gathering, C. Vasudevappa, Vice-Chancellor of UAHS, said that a cropping pattern should be worked out for the command areas in a scientific manner after undertaking a survey on water availability, soil quality and climatic conditions. Instead of flooding the paddy fields, it is necessary to popularise System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and other methods under which water is provided for the crops on an on-and-off basis. When there is shortage of water in reservoirs, farmers should be directed to cultivate short- and medium-term paddy varieties and less water-intensive crops such as ragi, pulses and oilseeds. He also stressed the need to adopt drip and sprinkler irrigation methods in command areas, and to undertake regular maintenance of the canals to ensure proper utilisation of water.K.B.

It is offering several incentives including discounts on seeds of the new varieties purchased from the government and subsidies on every tonne of crop produced.The government has announced a subsidy of Rs 8,000 per tonne of paddy produced with seed varieties that are less than 10 years old. While this is a subsidy for grain production, farmers have also been offered better discounts and incentives for buying newer variety seeds from the agriculture department. While seeds of certified high-yielding paddy varieties will be sold at a discount of Rs 10 per kg, pulse seeds of varieties less than 15-years-old will be offered a discount of Rs 25 per kg.""Farmers need to have bought seeds of the variety ADT 49 (released in Ambasamudram) from the agriculture department and produced the grains of that variety,"" said deputy director of agriculture Mohammed Iqbal. ""The discounts on the seeds are also attractive because paddy seeds usually sold at Rs 24 per kg will cost only Rs 14 per kg and pulse seeds which cost Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg will come down by a sizeable Rs 25 per kg, giving farmers a Rs 500 subsidy for a hectare,"" he said.In Madurai, the district agriculture department is providing seeds for newer paddy varieties at a subsidy of Rs 10 per kg. The subsidy is available for three varieties, all of which are less than 10 years old - CO R 49, 50, & 51 and ADT 49. These were cultivated across 35,000 hectares during the samba or cultivation season beginning in August.Among pulses too, the department is promoting green gram varieties CO G 912, Vamban 5 green gram and black gram varieties Vamban 6, CO 6. Their seeds are being distributed at a subsidy of Rs 25 per kg and farmers who cultivate them also get an additional Rs 5,000 per hectare under the National Food Security Mission if the cultivation is carried out under the cluster method which includes 100 hectares pooled together by farmers. These varieties are cultivated in approximately 10,000 hectares last year and the district agriculture department is planning to reach a target of 12,000 hectares this yearExperts say such initiatives are critical to promote newer varieties. ""Farmers hesitate to try out the new seeds because they are too attached to age-old varieties. Often traders also reduce the farm gate price for grains of new rice varieties,"" he said. ""So in situations like this, a subsidy is advantageous.""""The newer variety have guaranteed germination, easily achieve optimum population per square metre, have a good yield and are resistant to yellow mosaic virus, all of which the varieties which are over two decades old don't enjoy,"" said head of TNAU's pulses department, Kannan Babu."

They have begun researching ways to bio-fortify the two minerals in rice, considered the staple food across South India. At least two varieties are likely to be readied for testing across the country this year.TNAU's paddy breeding station has begun breeding a few new varieties of rice, which are expected to contain four to five times the normal content of iron and double the content of zinc. ""Besides, starch, protein and vitamins, polished rice contains around 2 to 4 ppm (parts per million) of iron and 8 ppm of zinc,"" says professor and project director of Centre for Molecular Breeding, S Robin.""We are targeting raising mineral content of polished rice to 10 to 12 ppm of iron and 24 ppm of zinc,"" he says. If they are successful, polished rice will contain more minerals than even what is found in brown rice currently-8 to 10 ppm of iron and 12 ppm of zinc.Iron and zinc deficiencies in our diet can often cause a host of health complications like anemia, low immunity, hair fall, nail breakage and even mental lethargy. Though meat, especially sea food, is a rich source of zinc and iron, with a sizeable population in the region being vegetarian, mineral deficiencies are rampant say both endocrinologists and dermatologists.""Iron deficiencies are more common than zinc, and is more common in women than men,"" says hematologist at Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, Dr Ramaprabhahari Satheshkumar. ""It causes tiredness, dizziness and even palpitations,""""This is why we came up with the idea of fortifying rice, which is a staple food,"" said Robin. ""And we decided to ensure that even milled rice will have these minerals, because most of the population consumes only milled rice, even though milling (polishing) removes most of its nutrients,"" he added.The bio-fortification research, sponsored by the central government's department of biotechnology and Indian Council for Agriculture Research (ICAR) is being done in three steps.First is to screen and identify traditional varieties rich in zinc and iron, study the genes responsible for the mineral content and then breeding them to create a new variety. ""We studied and screened almost 200 varieties of rice last year,"" said Robin. ""A majority of them from Tamil Nadu and a few from Orissa and Raipur,"" he said.Scientists have identified a few genes, bred a few new varieties and have planted them within their premises. They hope to get at least two new varieties and send them for testing across the country. The other institutes part of the research are M S Swaminathan Research Foundation, Indian Institute of Rice Research, Hyderabad and Indira Gandhi Krishi Vishwavidyalaya at Raipur."

""Araka is a high-yielding foodgrain -- cultivation on an acre gives 10 quintals. One doesn't require more than 300-350 mm of rainfall through the year for this crop,'' he added.Meanwhile, the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) and its director Ram Rajasekaran have tried and tested a wonder grain called teff. It's imported from Ethiopia and also part of the millet family. It can be grown in drought-prone areas and can even be substitute for rice and wheat in one's daily diet.""It is one of the highest protein-content foodgrain in the world. While we're not an agricultural research institute, CFTRI research showed that teff can sustain the entire farming community even during drought. It needs a little water during sowing and can ensure a much healthier society,"" Rajasekaran said.According to both, araka and teff are not widely known. University of Agriculture Science's vice-chancellor MN Rajegowda said the primary reason for this is lack of yield. ""Any drought-resistent crop is considered a last resort, and lack of yield makes them rather unpopular. We have designed certain drought-resistant varieties, but they're the last resort for farmers,"" he said."

The State Government is implementing a comprehensive project for revival of millet cultivation by tribal people in North Coastal Andhra and parts of Rayalaseema.The five-year project aims to increase productivity, household consumption, value addition by making ragi biscuits, idli and dosas, marketing support, setting up of processing centres and establishing Mana Vittana Kendras (seed production centres).The project is under implementation through the Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), Wassan as a lead technical agency and NGOs as facilitating agencies. An interactive meet with farmers was organised at Chinthapaka village of Pinakota gram panchayat in Anantagiri mandal on Friday to explain them on the advantages of growing millets.Project Director ATMA Lakshman Das, Joint Director of Agriculture B. Satyanarayana and Narsinga Rao of Wassan interacted with the farmers and explained the benefits of consuming millets. The Agriculture Department promised to arrange distribution of seeds at Devarapalle, which is close to them.The response was overwhelming. Nearly 980 tribals representing 10 gram panchayats attended. We also distributed seeds to the farmers of Kivarla, Pedakota, Pinakota and Jeenabadu panchayats and explained them on consumption particularly among women as part of nutrition security and promotion of Ragi in SRI (system of rice intensification) method, Kovel Foundation CEO V. Krishna Rao told The Hindu on Saturday.Kovel Foundation is implementing the millets programme in Ananthagiri mandal covering 64 habitations in 10 gram panchayats.

After raising the issue in the assembly, the ruling party members, including a number of ministers, marched to the Raj Bhavan to submit a memorandum to the President through governor S C Jamir over the issue.Talking to TOI, senior BJD leader and former minister Surya Narayan Patro said, ""Odisha is a rice-consuming state as most people prefer rice as their staple diet. Our request to the Centre (on supply of rice and wheat) was based on ratio of 85.82 (rice):14.18 (wheat) derived from the options of beneficiaries in their NFSA applications.""However, the Centre has been allocating rice and wheat at the ratio of 78.83:21.17. ""Failure to supply foodgrain according to the choice of the NFSA beneficiaries will be against the spirit of the Act,"" Patro added.As 24% of state's tribal population prefer rice in their daily diet, the BJD memorandum said providing wheat under NFSA was creating problem for them as they could not mill the whole wheat due to lack of adequate number of flour mills in the state.According to official sources, last year the state government has allocated 85,936 metric tonnes (MT) of rice under the NFSA, which was implemented in the state in two phases since November. At the same time, the state has not utilized 66,343 MT of wheat allocated by the government under the food Act, said a senior officer of the food supplies and consumer welfare department.BJD MPs on Tuesday met Paswan in Delhi and demanded to allocate more rice for Odisha.Raising the issue during the zero hour, BJD parliamentary party leader in Rajya Sabha, Dilip Trikey demanded fair allocation of rice to Odisha."

The treasury bench countered it by shouting slogans against dumping of wheat by the Centre in a rice-consuming state under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013.Moments after the House reconvened at 10.30am, BJP and Congress members created pandemonium demanding tainted food supplies and consumer welfare minister Sanjay Das Burma's resignation for his alleged chit fund links. They also demanded removal of Justice M M Das from commission of inquiry probing chit fund scam for his alleged anti-investor statement last week. BJD members stood on their seats shouting anti-Centre slogans for allocating more wheat at the expense of rice under NFSA.Just like Monday, BJP members wore jackets with writing, 'Remove Das Burma from the ministry'. Congress member Tara Prasad Bahinipati climbed atop the reporters' table. Speaker Niranjan Pujari adjourned the House till 3pm.Speaking to the media outside the assembly, leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra said the BJD so far criticised the opposition for stalling the assembly before question hour. ""However, they themselves disrupted the House from the beginning. It exposes their double standard,"" he said.Narasingha said the BJD raised wheat allocation to divert public attention from chit fund scam because it was panicked. BJP MLA Pradip Purohit said their party will continue protest inside the assembly and outside against the chief minister 'sheltering' Das Burma.Post-lunch, Narasingha sought a reply from the CM in the House whether chit fund accused transferred money to BJD accounts. BJD MLA Pratap Jena dismissed the allegations, terming it politically motivated and dared probe by any agency into their party funding."

Hence, Maharashtra government should lift the moratorium on conducting trials of all genetically modified (GM) crops in the state. Such bans or restrictions in conducting research trials will only push the agriculture sector backwards rather than taking it forward.These were the observations by CD Mayee, former chairman of the Agriculture Scientists Recruitment Board (ASRB). Mayee was speaking to reporters at a programme organized by the Association of Biotechnology-led Enterprises  Agriculture Focus Group (Able-AG) in city on Tuesday on the importance of increasing productivity and profitability of oilseed and pulses.""Indian agriculture is at the cross roads and there is strong need to improve the stagnating yields of all crops,"" Mayee said.""India imports pulses costing Rs30,000 crore and oil costing Rs90,000 crore, the highest imported items after gold and petroleum. Vidarbha has a high potential for pulses and oilseed crops. Andhra Pradesh allowed the Bt chickpea trials. But Maharashtra didn't. It is sad that this is despite the Kakodkar committee recommendations,"" he said. Mayee admitted that GM crops alone cannot be an answer to all problems in agriculture. But an adequate mix of all types of technologies, including organic, can minimize the agrarian distress.In India, 16 types of trials are on in different crops including cotton, rice (drought tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency), brinjal, sugar cane (drought tolerance), Bt chickpea and maize. ""Farmer wants technology, be it Swadeshi or foreign. If Swadeshi technology is available, it is always welcome but that doesn't mean that foreign technologies should be restricted,"" said Mayee.The Able-AG executive director Shivendra Bajaj, speaking on the proposed fields trials in Maharashtra and barriers in the way of introduction of agricultural technology in the state, said that GM technology was always a supporting technology and definitely not the only solution for all the problems in the agriculture sector. But he stressed on the need for openness in allowing research and development by the states. ""There is no issue of safety so for in any of the GM crops. GM technology is commercialized only after rigorous trials. Concerns of the general public and scientists can be addressed only through discussion and not banning trials,"" he said.Two progressive farmers from Yavatmal district, Vijay Niwal and Vasant Kale, also voiced the need for newer technologies for improving agriculture as they didn't see any future in conventional methods of farming. ""Every technology has some limitations, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be tried. We want solutions to our problems. Whether they come from home or abroad is immaterial to us. Younger generation would never take up agriculture unless it is technology based,"" said Niwal, who is surviving on Bt cotton since 2003."

Her husband had led several high-profile operations against the JMB in Chittagong and her killing prompted the police to vow to catch her killers.In recent days an elderly Hindu priest was found nearly decapitated in a rice field, while a Christian grocer was hacked to death near a church, with Islamic State group claiming responsibility for the killings. A Hindu monastery worker was found hacked to death on Friday in the northwestern district of Pabna.  AFP"

Alagu Ambalam (90) and his wife Angammal (85) in front of the toilet constructed by them at Achampatti near Madurai on Wednesday. Photo: R. AshokA tweet made the day for 90-year-old C. Alagu Ambalam and his wife A. Angammal (85) of Achampatti village on Wednesday.Abandoned by their two sons, the couple live in their one-room home in the company of four goats. The adjoining toilet, constructed by them under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, is their pride.They have inspired a village to go open-defecation-free by being the first volunteers to take up construction of the toilet. This effort turned the spotlight on them when a tweet with the Prime Ministers picture said: A 90-year-old couple from Achampatti constructed a toilet in their home and inspired the entire village.Open defecation was rampant in the village as people preferred the fields and pond bunds to relieve themselves. According to a survey conducted by District Rural Development Agency, 145 of the 373 villages in the district did not have a toilet.There was lot of diffidence among the residents to have a toilet near their home.I volunteered to construct the first toilet for which I had to dig up two pits to be used as septic tank in September last year. I and my wife assisted the masons and took care of the curing after construction, recalls Mr. Alagu Ambalam.Today, 141 of the 145 identified homes have toilets fitted with solar lamps provided by Madurai-based Devaki Hospital.Members of the four houses, where toilets could not be constructed, use a public toilet, making Achampatti a zero open defecation village, say DRDA officials.The village is the first among eight panchayats in Alanganallur panchayat union to contribute to Swachch Bharat mission by putting an end to open defecation.According to S. Murugan, panchayat president, convincing the villagers to have their own toilets with the money provided by the government was very difficult.Inspired by Mr. Alagu Ambalam and Ms. Angammal, they slowly fell in line. The biggest advantage for the couple is that they need not have to walk a distance to the nearest open field to ease themselves.It was very difficult for us in the night. Now, the toilet has provided a sense of security for us, says Ms. Angammal.Loneliness made our lives gloomy. The notice and recognition we got today have made us proud. This sense of pride will keep us going for some more years, says Mr. Alagu Ambalam.The couple, who do not have any land holding, survive on the old-age pension sanctioned for Ms. Angammal, free rice drawn from the public distribution system and occasional sale of goats."

Biren said that hectic construction work is going on around the Marjing temple.""One larger than life statue of a pony and polo player will be installed in the middle of the park. This was the place where the first polo game was played. It spread throughout the world through the Britishers who learned from Manipur,"" Biren said.""People know this game originated in Manipur and naturally many would like to know where the game was first played in this state,"" he added.He also disclosed that devotees are coming every day to the Marjing temple for praying. Once the modern park is completed there will be more devotees and tourists.Realising the tourist potential, the government has liberally sanctioned funds. Biren said: ""The park is located near the Trans Asian Highway. It means that a considerable number of tourists shall be visiting the temple and park. Since it is now an international game many players and enthusiasts would naturally want to visit the birth place of this game.""The park and other facilities will be completed on schedule, he said.However, polo enthusiasts are disappointed that there is no headway in developing a pony sanctuary near the temple. The government had planned to acquire 70 acres of paddy fields near the temple for developing a pony sanctuary.Industries Minister Govindas Konthoujam told IANS that the Manipur government has sent a project report involving Rs.78 crore to the central government.However, the central government has not cleared the project. The rice farmers whose fields are being acquired are objecting to the government proposal for setting up the pony sanctuary there.Some farmers said that they welcome the government plan for a sanctuary since it will help protect the endangered species.One knowledgeable farmer recalled that as per a census done in 2012 there were just 1,100 ponies in Manipur, its natural habitat. This small but smart animal is not found anywhere in the world. If proper protection is not given this species will soon become extinct.However, farmers said the proposed sanctuary should be developed at a place far away from paddy fields. ""People cannot go on starving for the sake of the sanctuary. What will happen to hundreds of farmers and their families whose only source of livelihood will be staunched?"" asked one farmer.Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who is known to be a tough fighter, is not easily disappointed. Sources close to him say that he feels ""good sense shall eventually prevail"" on the farmers.He wants that the sanctuary should be located near the Marjing temple, the birthplace of the game. In the meantime the farmers at Heingang refuse to budge."

Due to an unhealthy diet, sun exposure and stressful lifestyle, the signs of ageing are becoming pronounced even in those in their 30s and early 40s, making them look years older than their biological age. While the factors associated with internal ageing can't be controlled, external ageing can be delayed by lifestyle modifications and medical methods, say experts.Internal ageing in a person may be faster or slower depending on their genetic composition and protein degeneration factors, while external ageing that shows on the skin as fine forehead lines, wrinkles and sagging are directly related to prolonged exposure to sun (heat and sunlight in the plains and ultraviolet rays in the mountain regions), stress and anxiety, habits such as smoking, drinking, sleeplessness, excessive indulgence in meat, which releases free radicals in the body causing more of protein degeneration.""Besides photo-exposure, faulty diet and stressful life, even prolonged exposure to computers and 24X7 staying in air-conditioned room will dehydrate the skin causing premature ageing. Swimming in highly chlorinated water will also lead to faster growth of wrinkles at an early age. So, signs of ageing has become common in the younger lot, those in their 30s,"" averred aesthetician K Satya Prema from Do Up beauty clinic.However, exposure to sun is not the only factor triggering ageing and photo-exposure can be managed. ""A farmer and an athlete are both exposed to the sun for long hours. Yet the farmer ages much faster. It's because of their difference in lifestyle. Lack of nutritious food, indulgence in smoking and alcohol, sleeplessness, stress due to debts and financial constraints make the rural people look much older than his actual age. The athlete takes care of his diet and follows a strict healthy lifestyle, which naturally gives him a younger look. Therefore, rectification of lifestyle and diet should start from childhood. Children should abstain from preservative-rich packaged and instant food or juices. Instead opt for fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables,"" said Dr G Ajay Kumar, assistant professor at King George Hospital.The ageing takes place not just on the skin but of the muscles, arteries, brain and heart. On the skin, it affects the dermis layer, damaging the fibrous network of collagen. The collagen is responsible for maintaining skin integrity and prevent sagging. ""The signs of ageing is first reflected at the back of the hands, followed by forehead and frown lines, crowfeet under the eyes, drooping angle of the mouth, nasal folds and sagging of cheeks,"" stated Dr SV Satyaprasad, dermatologist at Suraksha Health Park.Speaking about the ways to delay the onset of ageing, the dermatologist said, ""Stress management through deep breathing exercises and meditation is important. In fact, any physical exercise, aerobics or dance enable the organs to stay young. Drinking a lot of water, eating fresh fruits, salads, green leafy vegetables while avoiding excessive meat and high carb diet is a must besides of course quitting bad habits like smoking and drinking. Apart from these, anti-oxidant packs can be applied as home remedies. These mainly consists of aloevera gel and cucumber packs to reduce the sun damage and rejuvenate the skin. Medically prescribed sunscreens, vitamin C creams and collagen-building creams can be used too but it can control up to 30 per cent of ageing. Beyond that cosmetic corrections after clinical evaluation is required. The various cosmetic corrections or skin tightening procedures include Botox, fillers, thread, radio frequency skin tightening and injecting platelet rich plasma.""Another method is using Mesoscience treatment. Explaining it, Satya Prema said, ""The machine has various nodules that works on the dermis layer. Negative current is passed to make the skin porous and then positive current with the anti-ageing product is passed. It's evenly and internally distributed wherever required and finally kryo is used to seal the skin. Post-treatment, certain hyaluronic acid rich products and creams should be used. The overall treatment can help in minimising wrinkles, toning or firming the skin and lightening of pigmentation.""Since the skin types of individuals vary, one should use skin tightening products or collagen creams or undergo any procedure only after consultation with a qualified dermatologist, advised Dr Ajay Kumar.Keep the body hydrated always by increasing the daily intake of waterConsume lots of fresh fruits, salads and green leafy vegetablesInstead of eating meat daily, switch to plant protein and egg whitesAbsolutely avoid high carb, oil-rich food like biryani and fried rice as well as heavy desserts for dinnerAbsolutely abstain from alcohol and smokingDo yoga and deep breathing exercises to eliminate the free radicals from the bodyExercise regularly to tone up the skin and enable the organs to stay youngerApply home remedies like anti-oxidant packs containing cucumber and aloevera gel to rejuvenate the skin and reduce the impact of sun damageUse only dermatologist prescribed sunscreens, vitamin C creams and collagen-building creams for the skin to look youngerAs a last resort, one may undergo cosmetic corrections or skin tightening procedures after clinical evaluation by a dermatologist"

Records available at the centre show that since its opening on March 27, 2014, over 480 children, especially tribals, aged between 0 and 5 years, diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) have returned home with an expected gain of about 15%.""Our duty is to ensure a 15% gain in the child's weight. It is an indication that intervention in the form of providing formula food to children during their 15-day hospitalization to bring their status to near normal is working,"" said collector (Koraput) Jaya Kumar V.The ASHA workers, dieticians, ANMs and cook play a vital role in this success along with the doctor, he added.According to the nutrition counsellor Rashmi Sahu, ""the digestive system of SAM children is so weak that they cannot be given high protein and high calorie diet as is generally expected. Their metabolism becomes too weak due to severe malnutrition and they lose appetite. Hence these children are given a milk-based formula food called as F75 and F100. These contain powdered puffed rice or ragi with milk in a particular ratio.Initially, the children are fed every two hours. Gradually the intervals are incresaed to four hours and eight hours. After the discharge, the children are shifted to home based food.The nutritionist educates the mother on nutritional supplements to be given to malnourished child and the cook demonstrates food preparations. Food rich in nutrition, vegetables, a high calorie diet and other important factors for improving nutrition in children are explained. The anganwadi workers identify the hildren during the village level health nutrition day held on every Tuesday and Friday and brings them to the NRC for treatment such as administering nutritional supplements.The expenses towards the treatment of children are borne by the hospital. During the treatment at NRC, the mothers of children get Rs 100 a day as incentive.According to an estimate, 3,500 children are affected by malnutrition in the district. At present, apart from Rabanaguda, the district has another NRC at Koraput hospital equipped with 20 beds. However, upbeat over its success, the administration has planned to open one NRC each at Laxmipur and Nandapur blocks to make the district malnutrition free.The proposed NRC at Laxmipur and Nandapur blocks will be opened soon and it will be of 20 beds each. The centres expenditure will be taken care by the district mineral foundation, the collector said."

Nonbu Kanji made of broken rice and various ingredients has a special place on the occasion of Ifthar (breaking of roza or fast) and Ifthar parties.The rich and poor break the fast only with this gruel, which is prepared in every mosque and household during the fasting days.In the backyard of the Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque in Suramangalam area, about half a dozen men, led by Sait alias S. Sadaqatullah, make gruel using 150 kg of rice every day. The gruel is used for breaking the fast by about 1,500 to 2,000 Muslims. Though kanji is served only during the sun set, the preparations start from the morning. The preparation starts immediately after the break of dawn, so that the kanji is ready by evening, says Sait of Keeranur near Palani.Explaining the kanji preparation method, Mr. Sait said saut a few cloves, cinnamon, cut onions and tomatoes and ginger garlic paste. Mint and coriander leaves, green chillies, turmeric powder, chilli powder, are added to the mixture. Later, water is added which brings it to a boil. Now broken raw rice (ponni kurunai rice) is added along with cooked green gram. This mixture is cooked till the dish reaches a porridge consistency.Particularly in rural areas, the Hindus come forward to provide rice, ghee, coconuts, other groceries and even the firewood in turn basis during the whole month. The Hindus feel it an honour to feed the fasting Muslims and the Muslims too wholeheartedly accept their gesture.According to G. Khader Shariff, treasurer of the Noorul Islam Jamath, which controls three mosques  Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque, Azad Nagar Mosque and Ammapalayam Mosque  the kanji for all these mosques is prepared in six giant containers at one place.

In Titlagarh, one of the country's hottest places, it's the unrelenting heat that keeps people at home these days.By 11 am, the roads are deserted and there is no sign of life in this western Odisha town, 450km from Bhubaneswar. ""Only a fool will risk facing the burning sun. Even stray animals stay in the shade. Business can be done another day,"" says Jain before heading home. The Titlagarh market opens at 10.30am during other seasons.This town of 60,000 people is even named after the climate: Tatla means 'very hot' in the local Sambalpuri dialect. This April, the temperature hovered around 45 degrees Celsius and touched 48.5 on April 24. The hottest day ever in this town was recorded on June 3, 2003 -50.1 degrees Celsius. Though they're used to the heat, residents say the temperature has stayed over 45 for the longest period this year. ""Previously, we'd have very high temperatures for a few days, which were followed by hailstorms,"" said Sudam Behera, a government employee.The town now functions before 10.30am and after 6pm. ""We impose a curfew on ourselves in summer. We're wiser from past experiences, and don't make plans for weddings or other functions for the summer,"" said Maneesh Majhi, a resident.To survive the open oven, people eat pakhal (semi-fermented stale rice soaked in water).""Eating pakhal and frequently wiping the skin with wet towels helps,"" said Kailash Chandra Sahu, sub-collector of Titlagarh. ""We avoid outdoor tours after 11am. I always keep oral rehydration salts, even in office,"" he added.People also keep their heads covered, usually with a white cloth, and wear white clothing.It's the topography that makes Titlagarh a heat island, say experts. The town is surrounded by several treeless hillocks, which radiate heat and block winds. ""Its hard rock soil and lack of ventila tion makes it warmer than surrounding areas,"" said surrounding areas,"" said Sarat Chandra Sahu, director of India Meteorological Department, Bhubaneswar.Balangir district, of which itlagarh is a part, has 14.7% forest cover, far below the state average of 32%. ""If only Titlagarh is considered, the percentage would be even lower,"" said Ranjan Panda, a water conservation activist.A central team visited the area in 2005 after temperatures started rising, and suggested massive plantation within a 10km radius of the town. The Centre provided Rs 1.8 crore to raise trees on 10 hectares. Saplings were planted in Tulang, Tikrapada and Belpadar and the project kept the mercury below 46 degrees Celsius till 2010. But many trees eventually died or were felled, and now the temperature is spiking again. ""The cooling project seems to have failed because the species selected were not enough to create a green canopy . Trees should have been planted up to 30km from the town,"" Panda said.Divisional forest officer (Balangir) Rashmi Ranjan Naik claimed the trees were unable to survive the heat. ""In some places, only 40% of trees are alive, in others 62%, because the place is so dry,"" Naik said. ""Despite our best efforts of launching yearly plantation drives, the place remains the hottest."""

Didi shook hands with some of them and later handed over packets of sweets to the children.Mamata's residence on Friday turned into a centre of celebration with VIPs, administrators, event managers, journalists and visitors making a beeline to meet her either to chalk out future plans or enquire about the grand swearing-in ceremony to be held on May 27. Banerjee had convened a meeting of the newly-elected MLAs. But before anybody from her team of 210 MLAs could reach her house, Banerjee reportedly held a closed-door meeting with her trusted lieutenants Subrata Bakshi and Mukul Roy. ""The names of probable ministers in the next cabinet were discussed in the meeting,"" said a source.The meeting with the MLAs started with a loud applause for Didi for the historic victory of the party despite threat from alliance. The meeting ended with a note of caution - introspection in the rank and file of the party following failures in some key assembly constituencies, including Jadavpur. The newly-elected MLAs were offered fish fry, fried rice, chicken and sweets.However, Mamata opted for a light lunch - rice and 'kalmi saag' with chilly.

That's why I resign,"" she wrote on Facebook, handing her seat back to the party.She had voted for the bill overall but against the articles calling for the contingency mechanism and the creation of a state privatisation fund.The so-called contingency mechanism, labelled ""the cutter"" by Greek media and designed to cut spending if the country fails to meet fiscal targets in 2018, is of chief interest to Greece's international creditors.""European leaders get the message that Greece is sticking to its promises.

In the targeted mandals the consumption has to be increased to 2,000 households beginning from 500 to 600 initially, he says.To restore the place of pride enjoyed by traditional millet-food, food festivals, cooking competitions and recipe contests will be organised and additional recipes and baked items introduced.Value addition and encouraging entrepreneurship are also a part of the programme. With area expansion, capacity building and value addition, demand is expected to go up. At gram panchayat level de-hullers and pulverizers have to be promoted. For example, though there is a demand for korra and sama the means of turning grain into rice are not available, Dr. Sarma points out.To be coordinated in a forum of NGOs, WASSAN is the Lead Technical Agency for the programme and at the district-level, Project Director of Agricultural Technical Management Agency (ATMA) will anchor it."

The tip off came that rice was stacked in huge sacks there.Delay by a day would have given the racketeers time to move a tonne of rice across the inter-state border, about 35 kms away and it would have made its way to Palakkad in Kerala.It is no wonder the smugglers from Kanyakumari use autorickshaws to take the rice across the border. Luxury cars, which are rarely intercepted at the checkposts are increasingly put to use. Far north, a bus driver and conductor of Andhra Pradesh State Transport Corporation were detained for aiding the smugglers to transport 1.5 tonnes of rice in the bus bound for Mallanur from Tirupattur Town.Polished either in the mills in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the rice which originally comes free under the Tamil Nadu PDS system, is sold for not less than Rs 40/kg.Intensified enforcement has made no difference, as the problem lies with the source itself. Explaining the modus operandi in Coimbatore, an officer said the PDS staff who siphon off the stock sell it to agents of the smugglers for up to 5 per kg. ""It was sold for Rs 2 until two years ago. The price has shot up due to hike in market price,"" he said. The moment the commodity crosses the border at Walayar, the price shoots up to 16 and when it reaches Palakkad and gets polished, it is sold at 25 in grocery shops. Some traders in parts of Kerala polish it further, pack and even brand them for a higher price.In fact, four civil supplies officials were suspended and penalty to the tune of 20 lakh was slapped on various staff for aiding smuggling in Coimbatore last year, besides detection of bogus billing in huge numbers. On an average, ten tonnes of PDS rice is seized every month in the district, but actual quantity of rice smuggled could be at least five times more. ""We had even seized upto 50 tonnes per month a few years ago,"" a source said. In 2015, 41 rice smugglers in the district including a notorious smuggler identified as Edison from Pollachi, were held.Kanyakumari District consumer protection association president S R Sriram said that much of the PDS rice from the affluent coastal villages goes to Kerala, in connivance with the civil supplies staffs, police personnel and agents."

She had to repay him with 'puttu' a dish made of rice flour, which she sold.As mythology has it, Lord Shiva did not complete his quota of work and the Pandya king had canned him for dereliction of duty. Lord Subramania of Thiruparankundram is brought to Madurai during the festival every year, where he plays the role of the Pandya king.As this ritual will be performed on Sunday, the deity left his abode. It is the second time that the presiding deity of the temple comes to Madurai to participate in rituals of the temple. He will leave for his abode on September 15, in his floral palanquin."

Various products of the banana plant are included in such celebrations, with fodi from ripe bananas being a common food item served at such occasions. A now not-so-commonly-used product of the plant, though, is the flower of the banana fruit, or keli bondi.For many families in Goa, a dish made from this banana flower is a must in the plate of food offerings made to Lord Ganesh , and so the keli bondi is a commonly sold item even today at matoli markets.It takes some effort to collect the consumable part of this large, purple-coloured bondi and is possibly the reason the upkari made from it is reserved only for special occasions.On removing the outer purple layer of the flower, tiny, yellow-headed florets can be seen, which have to be collected for the dish. One has to keep peeling these layers to gather the florets, until the inner part of the flower, which is nearly white in colour, is reached. This tender part of the bondi has to be finely chopped for the upkari. The florets, too, have to be similarly finely chopped, but not before they are 'cleaned'.""Each of the little flowers have to be gently opened to pull out the growth inside, which resembles a matchstick. This has to come out along with its stem as this part doesn't cook . Don't forget to apply coconut oil on your palms before cleaning and cutting the banana flower in order to prevent discolouration of the skin. The chopped bondi has to be left in water, with salt added to it, for about half an hour,"" Sushma Lotlikar , a homemaker from Margao , says.After 30 minutes, the chopped bondi must be squeezed dry and the water discarded.""Cook tur dal till flaky. It should not be mushy like when it is cooked for preparing dal. Keep this tur dal aside. Heat oil and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, hing, dry chillies and bay leaves. Once the fonn is ready, add the chopped bondi and let it cook. Once the bondi is cooked, add the cooked tur dal, grated coconut, salt and a hint of jaggery to it. Let it cook for a bit and the banana bondi bhaji is ready,"" says Lotlikar.Tur dal can be replaced with other pulses as well, depending on each individual's choice.This upkari is used as a side-dish in a fully vegetarian meal, which includes varan, rice and other veggies, during festivities.So, if you have the banana plant in your garden, make sure that it is used to the optimum."

The subsidised rice that the tribals are getting under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) is not sufficient for them for which they are forced to eat gruel made from dried mango kernel, alleged Congress whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati, who visited Sipijodi on Sunday to take stock of the situation and led the rally at Rayagada on Monday.Under NFSA each member of a family gets 5 kg of rice at Re 1 a kg every month. According to Bahinipati, most families of Sipijodi have not got any job under MGNREGA for the past several months. There is no safe drinking water facility in the village and the Kashipur hospital doesn't have adequate health personnel, including doctors, Bahinipati alleged.The Congress demanded supply of safe drinking water to the village, jobs under MGNREGA and posting of adequate health staffers. Earlier, the Rayagada administration had refuted that the two deaths were due to eating mango kernel gruel. According to ADMO (public health), Rayagada, B L N Prusty, while the 12 year-old Ranjan Majhi died of fever, the 55 year-old Narsingh Majhi succumbed to diarrhoea.

The department has already introduced bar-coded coupon system for ration cards linked to Aadhaar number in Bengaluru city and few other villages in the state on a pilot basis.Soon, the new IVRS coupon booking system will be launched throughout the state to make the system more foolproof. A ration card holder will have to dial 1614 from the mobile phone number that is linked to the ration card to get coupon number for the month's ration via SMS and voice. Soon after dialling 1614, the ration card holder will receive an SMS with details of quantity of food grains and kerosene allotted. Later, the PDS dealer can get confirmation by sending the coupon number to 1613 and distribute the food grains and kerosene as per allotment, Khader said.Ration card holders need not buy food grains and kerosene from the same PDS dealer, where the ration card is registered. Instead, they may use the coupon to buy ration from any one of the nearest PDS dealers. The move will not only help government detect bogus cards, but also plug pilferage of food grains and kerosene, Khader said, adding that it will also make PDS paperless.The department has hiked the commission considerably to encourage PDS dealers in the state. The profit margin of rice per quintal has been increased from Rs 36 to Rs 90. Meanwhile, the commission for sale of kerosene has been increased from 75 paise per litre to Rs 2 per litre, he added."

He was apparently alluding to many state government-sponsored welfare schemes reaching the people in Tamil Nadu with chief minister J Jayalalithaa's photograph on the cover.It was rice politics - promise to supply 3kg rice for 1 - that ensured a decisive victory for the rainbow alliance led by the DMK in 1967 against the mighty Congress. Later, in 2006, DMK returned to power with the promise of supplying ration rice at 2 per kg. The rate was further slashed to 1 per kg.Tamil Nadu has been following a universal public distribution system, in variance with the Centre's targeted food subsidy plan aimed below the poverty line only. Analysts say voters in the state are developing an aversion towards freebies as expectations, especially among the youth, have moved on to more pressing issues like development, infrastructure and jobs. Time is up for competitive populism as people have started viewing it with scepticism, said M Kasinathan, a political analyst. 1967 onwards, there was a gradual decrease in the announcement of freebies in poll manifestoes, he said, adding that over the decades, the price of ration rice was also increased several times. The trend was finally reversed in 2006, said Kasinathan.""But now the state has reached a saturation point in supply of rice, because it is given free,"" said analyst Gnani Sankaran.Nevertheless, misuse of TN's public distribution system is a matter of concern. Many shops buy ration rice from consumers at 3-5 per kg and sell it in the open market in neighbouring states at a higher price. There are instances of bulk diversion of ration rice to other states."

For the agriculture department, convincing farmers to adopt the new seeds was a tough task since traditionally farmers have been accustomed to only certain varieties of rice.""There is fear in their mind that the new variety may fail, thus they are hesitant to grow them. Only Jaya and Jyoti varieties of rice have been harvested in the state for over two decades, until now,"" said Kakode adding that cultivation of new varieties is usually taken up by progressive farmers.These comprise of 10% of the total number of farmers in the state, which is approximately 2,500 registered farmers.""Progressive farmers are usually always ready to experiment.

Point of Sale (PoS) devices in all FPSs in Delhi were to become operational by this month, but leave installation, the government has not even finished preparing its Request for Proposal (RPF).Showcase cityAs per the plan, Delhi was to be the showcase city for the Centres project of putting in place a biometric system at all fair price shops in the country. But, despite floating three tenders, the State government failed to rope in any company to carry out the project. This is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. The government did not have to spend anything extra in getting the biometrics of ration card holders.Pilot projectThe Capital has 2,534 FPS, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through fingerprint or iris detection of beneficiaries. However, even the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines is now gradually being withdrawn. According to a senior official, at present, only 37 FPS have functioning PoS devices.Confirming the report, Amjad Tak, Secretary-cum-Commissioner, Food and Supplies Department, told The Hindu that the office was working on a fresh RFP. Installing PoS devices in FPSs is the most important project for us; a lot of time has already lapsed. The original proposal had some major flaws, because of which bidders were not forthcoming. We are now working on a new RFP which will be out by next month, he said.Owing to repeated delays, the Dialogue and Development Commission of Delhi (DDC) came in to re-visit the project, and is now co-drafting the proposal. The new RFP is going to be a robust one with a detailed note on the process of system integration as the company awarded with the project will have to install, operate and even maintain all the devices. A tender (the fourth one) will be floated soon after, he added.Criticism from CAGEven the Comptroller Auditor General (CAG) of India has criticised the failure to implement the project. In its latest audit report of the Delhi government (for the fiscal 2014-15), it observed that PoS machines for verification of the eligible beneficiaries and disbursement of food grains were installed in only 42 out of 2,300 FPSs.It also highlighted problems in the pilot project. FSO (Circle 15, North district) intimated that even the PoS machines installed in the FPSs were not working efficiently as these were not user-friendly, had poor battery life and problems of mismatching of fingerprints, and poor network.Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding"

Dr Girish told TOI, ""Type II diabetes is a major chronic disease and its prevalence is increasing, while various studies indicate that choice of carbohydrates, particularly those with low Glycaemic Index (GI) is able to assist in management or prevention of type II diabetes. Hence, objective of this study was to determine the variability in GI of popular improved and traditional varieties of rice and to find the genetic basis of GI.""He said state's 200 varieties of rice were screened of which local variety called ""Chaptigurmatiya"" was discovered, which was re-named as Chhattisgarh Madhuraj paddy-55.

It is consumed by natives of Chhattisgarh, who claim that it is the best stomach-filler and one's appetite remains in control many hours of eating it. ""In its options, diabetic patients are advised to consume brown rice or unpolished rice, which is low in GI but its taste is still unpopular among rice-eaters hence this CGMP-55 is a blend of taste and healthy values for diabetics,"" Chandel said.It may take another year before the rice hits market."

But unlike the legendary Ali who had been afflicted with Parkinson since he was 42, Aich was fighting fit and hitting the gym even at 104!Aich, who earned the moniker Pocket Hercules for rippling muscles packed into an astonishingly tiny 4-feet, 11-inch frame, had served in the Royal Air Force and began his weight training in 1942, coincidentally the year when Ali was born. A decade later in 1952, Aich fought off tremendous odds including bodybuilders who literally towered over him to lift the Mr Universe crown under the amateur category. Five years later, an unknown Austrian called Arnold Schwarzenegger would win the same title.It was Reub Martin, a British officer in RAF who introduced Aich to weight training when he was 30. Pumping iron with determination and without the supplements and steroids that bodybuilders rampantly use today, Aich soon sported a physique that others in the RAF were envious of. But it was in jail where he had been incarcerated for protesting against British oppression of Indians, that he seriously began weight training.""The stint in prison helped me prepare for the world championship. There were no equipment but I practised free hand 12 hours a day,"" he recounted during a visit to the TOI office a couple of years ago.The Universe Championships organized by the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (NABBA) was first held in 1948. It is little-known how Aich found himself participating in the contest within a few years of its inception. But he took everyone, including perhaps himself, by surprise when he won the amateur prize in 1952.BACK THEN: Manohar Aich in his heydayFor Aich, the results were spectacular but the philosophy was simple: It was always mind over body. A simple diet complemented an uncomplicated life. Despite his struggles to make ends meet as a bodybuilder, Aich would say it was his ability to take hurdles in the stride that helped him to remain tension free.""Since my young days, I had to struggle to earn money but whatever the situation, I remained happy,"" Aich had said during his interaction with TOI.As for his mindboggling longevity, Aich would once again point to his simple diet. He would recite a few lines very frequently that underlined his philosophy: 'Uno bhate duno bal/ bahu bhate rasatal' (A small amount of rice doubles up power/ while a full portion of rice may bring doom). It spoke of restraint winning over normal practice.Aich's diet of milk, fruits and vegetables along with rice, lentils and fish kept him healthy. ""Jethu (uncle) never smoked, nor did he touch alcohol,"" said Tushar Sil, Trinamool MLA and bodybuilder who was close to Aich, ""I would call him jethu because of our age difference, but we were actually friends,"" added Sil.Aich leaves behind his two sons, grandchildren, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren. Getting introduced to a new addition in the family was his greatest pleasure, said family members. Perhaps that was the driving force.Although Aich was bed-ridden for a year, his faculties remained razor-sharp. Even after suffering a stroke in 2011, he continued to visit the gym he had built in his house and would keep a watchful eye on young bodybuilders training there.Born on March 17, 1912, in Dhamti, a remote village in Comilla district of undivided Bengal (now in Bangladesh), Aich was always interested in strength-related sports like wrestling and weightlifting from a very young age. However, he had a near fatal kala-azar (Leishmaniasis) attack when he was barely 12 and suffered severe ill health.He gradually regained his strength by exercising regularly, doing push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises and traditional sit-ups. Later, in the run-up to competitions, he would do only bodyweight/calisthenics exercises with up to 100 reps per set.When he won the Mr Universe title, his chest measured 54 inches with waist 23 inches. His last body building show was in 2003."

Later, he inspected the paddy milling and production of rice units in the Puducherry Central Cooperative Processing, Supply and Marketing Society premises.Addressing the media, he said: Earlier, the Congress Government was providing quality rice free of cost to the people. The cost was higher since it was bought from other states. In order to reduce the cost of buying, we have planned to build the modern rice mill here, he said.He added that 20 kg free rice to ration card holders would be provided in Puducherry soon. This modern rice mill will be used for the production of rice. Many private rice mills have also closed down. In order to supply quality rice to people, the government will rent these rice mills, he said.The Minister cautioned the employees to refrain from politics during work. The Cooperative employees requested the Minister to increase the fund allocation. One of the first announcements of the newly-formed V. Narayanasamy Government was to enhance the monthly free rice supply to ration card holders from 10 kg to 20 kg per month to be implemented from this August. This provision will be in addition to the cash compensation being provided by the Union Government under the National Food Security Act.The monthly rice quota would be gradually raised to 30 kg as promised in the Congress election manifesto, Chief Minister V.

Why not gear up and go trekking? With plateaus, forts and hill-tops surrounding the city, heres looking at some of the most popular trekking spots around Mumbai.Ah, the monsoons are finally here! While there's familiar comfort in curling up with a novel and hot cuppa on a monsoon weekend, you're still far from having some real seasonal fun. Move over monsoon drives and getaways and find solace in immersive experiences this time. There's enough happening this month to give you an adrenaline rush, so get going, solo or with your buddies.The Prabal Plateau between Matheran and Panvel, houses the 500 m high Kalavantin pinnacle, a diamond in the rough, waiting to give adventure junkies some adrenaline overdose. Join a group of trekking enthusiasts attempting to scale the Kalavantin Durg. This one's surely not for the faint-hearted! The experience comes with its share of perks. The trek from Thakurwadi base village leads to Prabalmachi. Interact with village folks over kadak chai. Then, it's the final push for Kalavantin summit. The rock-cut staircase snaking up the mountain leads to the top, offering a pristine view of the region. Head back down to a warm village meal before you end the sojourn at a seasonal waterfall. ""The gushing winds and rain tend to add to the trek difficulty, but if one is seasoned, this experience proves more exciting than 'precarious'. A guide and his team, adept with the place, will help trekkers along the way,"" says Regan Rodricks, who's conducting this experience. This stairway to heaven will surely make Led Zeppelin's the second best!Monsoon cycling brings its own share of renewed fun and freshness. ""Cycling in the monsoons to Khandas Village  the starting point for treks to Bhimashanker  provides one with spellbinding visuals of thesurrounding forest cover and lush field stretches. The terrain gets slippery at times, but the special mountain bikes provided and the back-up vehicle following the trail will help prevent accidents,"" shares trip organiser Prasad Joshi, noting that over 15 people have registered so far, most amateurs. He stresses on the fact that this isn't a race. The whole idea is to ride leisurely and soak in the sights and sounds of the place.With the monsoons comes the time when farmers start planting and replanting rice, a satisfying experience by itself. If you like getting your hands dirty then join a group that's heading to Kurunji village especially for 'bhat lavni' or rice plantation. ""We've done such personal trips before; the experience is wonderful. But this is the first public trip for which we're expecting over 30 participants,"" says organiser Jayesh Paranjape, adding, ""While this is a usual chore for Kurunji's farmers, it's a newfound experience for city people, teaching us about the hardwork it requires."" The session will be preceded by a briefing about the process and crop pattern. ""Ideally, this is done standing barefoot in fields with almost knee-deep water, but gumboots could be brought along,"" replies Jayesh. Once done, soak in the simplicity of village life as you enjoy a tractor and bullock cart ride, play traditional games and weave cane artefacts.If scaling mountains isn't your cup of tea, this treasure trove of activities could be your best bet. Unlike the usual weekend crowd that hikes up to Matheran, why not begin from there and walk downhill to the Garbett Plateau? ""The idea of a downhill trek makes for an easier, enjoyable outing, especially for first timers. The first part of the trek will entail getting to Matheran by cab from where one can see the entire Garbett Plateau. The second phase will involve descending to the plateau along a rocky trail, and the last leg will be the walk along the scenic Bhivpuri Lake. Be sure to wear a pair of shoes with good grip,"" shares Husain Tinwala, leading the trip with his team of guides. You'll also get to encounter simple and rustic village life on the way, take pictures in lush meadows with their renewed monsoon makeover and relax then at the natural monsoon pool with a waterfall before you proceed to Bhivpuri Lake and thereon, for your final walk to Bhivpuri station, to head home for a wonderful snooze!There are some experiences as humbling as they are sublime to indulge in, fishing being one of them. If that's something you've wanted to do on a lazy weekend, a basic fishing adventure to Bhima River would be a good chance. ""We do around six river or lake fishing trips between July and December. This trip to Pargaon (55-60 kms from Pune) will be a basic one,"" says organiser Rohan Ratnapal. Participants would be introduced to the basics of angling a day prior. ""All trips emphasise on 'catch and release', especially of the native species. Fishes like catfish and tilapia that are caught, that are a menace to the local ecosystem, are handed over to villagers for their protein fix,"" Rohan adds. Besides the novelty and fun, these trips hence also come with a big conservation message. ""The activity also teaches one patience and persistence,"" says Rohan, who along with his team of experienced people, will assist participants on the trip."

Yet, it is an insurmountable distance for the tribal children of Periya Mallahalli tribal colony in Mallahalli village of Kotayyur Panchayat.Look at our children, what if they say something that invites trouble, asks 22-year-old Mangamma, flashing her toothy smile stained by dental fluorosis, as a little army of unkempt children huddle up from across the habitation. We didnt send our children and nobody from the anganwadi has ever visited our colony to persuade us to send the children, she says of the centre, folded into one room in a Lingayat household.Subtle rules of social engagement directed by caste equations have denied this tribe its access to the angawadi centre in the predominantly upper caste Lingayat village in Thally block here.As of date, not a single tribal child of Periya Mallahalli has tasted the food of the ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services) centre in Mallahalli village.Incidentally, the teacher of the anganwadi centre had written to the higher-ups to replace eggs with bananas. Lingayat children dont eat eggs, says Pachayammal, the anganwadi teacher.The tribal children dont come to the centre and they are never there, she says. Pachayammal holds the additional charge of a centre in Thagatty Panchayat.The anganwadi of Mallahalli Panchayat is the main centre. The centres cook Dudamma claims to cook 1.5 kg of rice per day for over 30 children.But, ask her about the portion for each child, and she fumbles. The original anganwadi was built out of DRDP (Department of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj) funds only five years ago, but was abandoned soon after a section of the tin roof was blown away by the wind. Today, two emaciated buffaloes wander about the spacious partially tiled interior of the centre, reportedly built at a cost of Rs.78,000.The missing roofFor the residents of the tribal colony, ICDS nutrition for children is of little concern. There are graver issues, they say. The 30 houses constructed as part of Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) are in varying stages of dilapidation. Roofs of seven houses have crumbled, forcing the households to occupy the nearby Anjetty forests. Most roofs of the remaining houses are held up by bamboo poles stuck in the middle of the house.We dont know when this roof will fall over us, says Maadevan, pointing to the exposed and rusted iron rods in the ceiling. The habitation neither has Hogenakkal water pipeline nor the panchayat water pipeline. Many households do not have ration cards.Sivarudrappa, the Lingayat village headman, says there is no discrimination. But, when asked whether they would let their children eat out of the same plates as the children of the tribal colony, there was an uncomfortable silence.

With lack of many workable options and not enough clarity, restaurateurs are working out sustainable solutions to comply with the new regulations.""Karnataka, with its young population has a high eating out and pub culture. Specialised tea cafe Chai Point's chief executive Amuleek Bijral said: ""The government should give a fixed timeline to all the restaurants to comply with the new guidelines. There are times when we have noticed that alternative packaging such as bagasse packaging isn't working.""Chai Point has done away with plastic coated plates and introduced 100% plant material and bio-degradable bagasse-based plates and bamboo stick stirrers, while cold beverages it delivers will be done in glasses instead of plastic cups.""All such measures are more expensive and we are exploring ways to meet the extra costs.Either we will add the cost for deliveries or price our premium products factoring the packaging costs. Soon we will roll out all these measures across cities we are present in,"" Bijral said.On average, bio-degradable packaging such as bagasse plates are 18-20% more expensive than plastic coated ones, while glass bottles are 30% costlier and rice and corn starch based spoons and forks are 15% more expensive.The country's largest coffee chain Cafe Coffee Day's group president, marketing, Bidisha Nagaraj said the brand is working on alternative solutions to certain plastic products that it has been using at its outlets such as cold beverage cups (typically used for takeaway orders), stirrers, straws and spoons.Likewise KFC and McDonald's. A spokesperson for KFC said the firm is ""supportive of this environment-friendly initiative to reduce plastic usage and is working with authorities to get complete clarity on the law, and find a cost-effective and sustainable solution"".McDonald's India (west & south) managing director Smita Jatia said: ""We are working towards customising our packaging to meet a holistic approach.""According to a report published by Freedonia Group, the packaging food service disposable market in India is pegged at $575 million by 2020.Delhi-based biodegradable tableware maker Ecoware cofounder Rhea Singhal, which supplies to leading hotels and QSR chains said the new law is expected to accelerate demand for such products.But the challenge, say restaurateurs, is lack of options. Rashmi Daga, founder of online food ordering startup Freshmenu said: ""There are hardly any end-to-end options for biodegradable products."""

But unlike the legendary Ali who had been afflicted with Parkinson since he was 42, Aich was fighting fit and hitting the gym even at 104! Aich, who earned the moniker Pocket Hercules for rippling muscles packed into an astonishingly tiny 4-feet, 11-inch frame, had served in the Royal Air Force and began his weight training in 1942, coincidentally the year when Ali was born.A decade later in 1952, Aich fought off tremendous odds including bodybuilders who literally towered over him to lift the Mr. Universe crown under the amateur category. Five years later, an unknown Austrian called Arnold Schwarzenegger would win the same title.It was Reub Martin, a British officer in RAF who introduced Aich to weight training when he was 30. Pumping iron with determination and without the supplements and steroids that bodybuilders rampantly use today, Aich soon sported a physique that others in the RAF were envious of. But it was in jail where he had been incarcerated for protesting against British oppression of Indians, that he seriously began weight training.""The stint in prison helped me prepare for the world championship. There were no equipment but I practised free hand 12 hours a day,"" he recounted during a visit to the TOI office a couple of years ago.The Universe Championships organized by the National Amateur Bodybuilders Association (NABBA) was first held in 1948. It is little-known how Aich found himself participating in the contest within a few years of its inception. But he took everyone, including perhaps himself, by surprise when he won the amateur prize in 1952.For Aich, the results were spectacular but the philosophy was simple: It was al but the philosophy was simple: It was always mind over body. A simple diet complemented an uncomplicated life. Despite his struggles to make ends meet as a bodybuilder, Aich would say it was his ability to take hurdles in the stride that helped him to remain tension free. ""Since my young days, I had to struggle to earn money but whatever the situation, I remained happy,"" Aich had said during his interaction with TOI.As for his mindboggling longevity, Aich would once again point to his simple diet.He would recite a few lines very frequently that underlined his philosophy: 'Uno bhate duno bal bahu bhate rasatal' (A small amount of rice doubles up power while a full portion of rice may bring doom). It spoke of restraint winning over normal practice.Aich's diet of milk, fruits and vegetables along with rice, lentils and fish kept him healthy. ""Jethu (uncle) never smoked, nor did he touch alcohol,"" said Tushar Sil, Trinamool MLA and bodybuilder who was close to Aich. ""I would call him jethu because of our age difference, but we were actually friends,"" added Sil.Aich leaves behind his two sons, grandchildren, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren. Getting introduced to a new addition in the family was his greatest pleasure, said family members. Perhaps that was the driving force.Although Aich was bed-ridden for a year, his faculties remained razor-sharp. Even after suffering a stroke in 2011, he continued to visit the gym he had built in his house and would keep a watchful eye on young bodybuilders training there.Born on March 17, 1912, in Dhamti, a remote village in Comilla district of undivided Bengal (now in Bangladesh), Aich was always interested in strength-related sports like wrestling and weightlifting from a very young age. However, he had a near fatal kala-azar (Leishmaniasis) attack when he was barely 12 and suffered severe ill health.He gradually regained his strength by exercising regularly, doing push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises and traditional sit-ups. Later, in the run-up to competitions, he would do only bodyweight calisthenics exercises with up to 100 reps per set.When he won the Mr. Universe title, his chest measured 54 inches with waist 23 inches. His last body building show was in 2003."

However, the agriculture department as well as progressive farmers say that proper planning and listening to advisories from the agriculture department can address the situation easily.Joint director of agriculture (JDA) Nagpur division Vijay Gawhate told TOI that the department has been sending messages to five lakh farmers through the M-Kisan advisory system. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has also asked farmers to wait for the monsoon to arrive and not hurry with sowing.""We have been updating them through SMS and telling them not to sow till there is at least 75mm rainfall, whether pre-monsoon or monsoon, especially for soyabean sowing. Though the temperatures have decreased, there is a risk in dry sowing. Farmers need not be scared but should be very careful,"" Gawhate said.However, progressive farmers like Subhash Palekar see zero budget natural farming as a solution to the monsoon problems. ""Delay in monsoon may worry conventional farmers. But with our farming method, we have got very good results even in drought ridden Marathwada in last three years, without any inputs from outside like seeds or fertilizers. With delayed rains, the crops otherwise also get less exposure to sunlight. We have our own seeds and since we grow local desi varieties, there is no fear of loss of expensive seeds. In fact, with delayed monsoon the quantity of fertilizer needed decreases,"" he said.Farmers like Keshav Rahegaonkar from Nanded, who also follows natural farming, stress that if farmers can take relatively higher yields in Marathwada region, farmers in Vidarbha can definitely get better crop even with less rainfall. ""The investment in zero budget farming in even crops like cotton is just Rs2,000 per acre. Also, farmers in Vidarbha should leave mono-cropping system and go for multiple crops to make agriculture more sustainable,"" he said.In fact, progressive farmers using conventional techniques too are not much worried as they seem to follow agriculture advisories from the department. Anand Raut, a progressive farmer of Seloti village in Bhiwapur taluka, says that farmers should see TV bulletins and advisories, and also listen to the radio if they are not connected to the SMS service. But he advises that marginal farmers should avoid short duration varieties. Soyabean farmers should wait till June 20-25, which is also otherwise the right period for sowing.Shivadas Kore from Kilimiti Mandha in Brahmapuri taluka, who takes rice and turmeric, said that since farmers have no control over rains they should follow or adopt technology that suits their area. ""Those who have irrigation to even small extent should give one irrigation before monsoon,"" he said.Cotton farmers, however, need to be more aware and follow the strategies suggested by the Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) as well as the agriculture department."

Kerala and Tamil Nadu are the only two States left where the NFSA has not been implemented yet.

I dont understand why a developed State like Kerala says like this, he said.Stringent actionIf the two States do not implement the Act, we will take stringent action. One option we have is to supply APL foodgrains to them at a higher rate or we completely stop the allocation. Let them buy foodgrains for APL families at the support price, he said.Asking the States to speed up reforms in the public distribution system (PDS) to curb leakage of foodgrains, Mr. Paswan said there could be problems in putting up necessary infrastructure for the effective roll-out of the NFSA but those issues need to be sorted out by both the Centre and States.While the ration cards have been digitised 100 per cent in the country, States are slow in seeding them with the Aadhaar card, which would help in eliminating bogus beneficiaries, he said, PTI"

It was planned as a farming intervention to increase crop productivity, inculcate practical knowledge on seed selection and treatment, and preserve the indigenous variety of paddy.The project was initiated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Lotus Progressive Centre (LPC), a NGO, based at Morowa village in Nalbari district, in July 2011.The project period got over in 2014. The model, however, continued to be practised by the farmers. The farming families in a cluster of seven villages held on to the practice because of the positive results it brought.""The model led the overall crop productivity to jump from 13-18% to 30-40%, while also bringing about an increase in the income of the farmers,"" said Hemanta Baishya, member and coordinator of LPC.The model ensures that the agricultural land does not lie idle. For instance, a farmer might have five bighas of agricultural land and may use three bighas to cultivate the main crop of paddy. The remaining two bighas, considered 'baam' or shallow, are utilized for rabi and other crops.After the main crop is harvested, leguminous crops (peas, lentils and chick peas) and rabi crops are cultivated, improving the natural soil fertility.""The farmers have informed us that they are continuing the practice. It has led to crop intensity. This project has been a success. The followup is continuing,"" said Tapan Baishya, secretary, LPC.Before the introduction of the initiative, farmers had no practical experience in increasing crop productivity, and no knowledge of or systematic approach to seed selection and treatment, seed-bedding preparation, seeding duration. They also had an unsystematic approach to line preparation (the manner in which seeds are sown based on line rows).""The project period is over but it is now that we are witnessing the impact. This has given an immense boost to their financial and motivational levels. We do have a plan to expand it to other places as well,"" added Baishya.With most farmers are cultivating high-yield varieties - Joymoti, Luit, Athaisa, Untrisa and others, local varieties of rice paddy - Joha, Kola Joha, Mainagiri, Phool Pakhori, Tengre, Samraj, Boka Dhan, Tulsi Joha, Konkoni, Biru, Kajali Bah, Bordhan, Kalamdani, and others - are also being cultivated, besides mustard, peas, lentils, chick peas, among others."

Standing up on the bike or leaning out of the car trying to find a way out of the mess. Somebody cuts in front of you, gobbles up the little space that you had for a second. A car aggressively from the side road almost scraping the paint off your breath. Another car decides to do a U-turn in a place where even a crow will have to hop and skip. Cars and buses parked on the one-lane road, indifferent. And we are all waiting, miles behind, waiting, waiting.Cities die. When a red signal light means Go. For those who are impatient or who dont care. Who will also not care what happens to those vehicles and people who have to avoid crashing into them. It is no longer the lawbreakers, the history-sheeters. It is you and it is me, in fancy cars or fancier bikes or women with children in front, in their dainty Scooty.Cities die. When anger begins in traffic jams knowing that all it needs is just a simple solution. It stares at all of us in our faces but we are tired. We know what to do and will mutter inside the car but all that we will do is to nudge an inch here and steal a foot there.When anger builds upCities die. When anger builds up in the market, in shops, in schools. When every moment of doing something is filled with aggression, with sudden uncontrollable rage. When different faces and languages seem like the enemy at the gate. When different customs begin to take on the images of an invading force. When every man is the criminal, the cop and the judge all rolled into one, into one politician. We know these truths well, truths so jaded that they no longer can cause action.Cities die. When we all realise that nothing is what it is, nothing will ever be what it was. When we know that nobody will do anything about any of this. All we can do is leave earlier and come back later, but it is the same later, now slowly eating into the whole day and soon into the whole night.Cities die. Because we just dont care. And when we care, we dont know what to do. And when we know what to do, we are too tired to move. Or we are stuck with breathing problems or mosquito love bites of all kinds. Or we are busy on iPhones and extraterrestrial messages beamed through dangling wires from our ears.We die when our cities die. Children have no grounds, have lungs filled with such residual poison that they may as well enjoy a smoke. When they are so scared of water that doesnt taste of plastic bottles. When going to school makes it seem as dangerous as a hike to the misty mountains.Adults die in ambulances that make noise but do not move. And when they do get to hospitals, the doctor is stuck somewhere else. The BP machines have gone out of sync and the whole city is going into cardiac arrest. And yet we watch, there is nothing we can do.A burning cityCities die when young men on motorbikes with flags they have rarely seen come and ask you, what are you? They asked that then, when they saw people who did not look like them. They asked them, are you from China, and then said, oh, you are from the Northeast. And they beat them up so that trains that left the city were filled with young men and women trying to find a space in which they could squeeze their fear.It was the turn of the Northeast then and now it is (once again) the turn of their favourite neighbours. The boys are back on the bikes again, the flags are out with a little bit of oil stain, but the question remains the same. One group is standing around a traffic junction, trying to burn a tyre. When a city is already burning, what is a tyre or two? They say they want justice. A courageous old man asks them, what justice are you seeking for? And they reply, this is all we will say for 200 rupees.When aliens take overCities die when the poor selling drying vegetables on the streets look around constantly in fear. They too would like to be like us, enjoy a holiday and get aroused watching television news, incessantly fuelling their collective anger. They can speak all languages but they know they will be beaten and their produce thrown on the street. We can see that too, we who watch from our barred windows from across the street. We know too that there is nothing we will do, that all of us are anyway nothing more than numbers that have stopped meaning anything to anybody anywhere.Cities die when all the rage about small little things becomes a rage about all things around us. Every little thing creates anger, depression, asthma, dengue, and gastroenteritis. Like a zombie film, the city seems to have been taken over by aliens, who call dose dosha , who eat rice with a spoon, and think that the city is cute. Friends who used to meet from across the city have gone back to burrow into their houses and flats. Or they go in search of malls near their houses so they dont have to travel. We will meet some other time, in other cities that are not yet dead.Cities die. This city dies and we are all watching, waiting. For those of us who remember this city when it was young, innocent, welcoming, and had real gardens instead of fake ones in IT La-La land, this is all nostalgia. With nostalgia, at least you have a vision of what can be. But now even that future is gone, dying in little bits of anger that builds up at every street corner, at every puddle on the street. When the future dies, the city is already dead.Sundar Sarukkai is a philosopher based in Bengaluru.It was the turn of the Northeast then and now it is (once again) the turn of their favourite neighbours"

Sure, biryani is an integral part of Eid celebrations, but there's more to the festival, too...the Eidi. As part of celebrations, everyone looks forward to receiving gifts from their elders. Here are some of the city peeps' plans for, and favourite memories of Eid...Eid is very special for the reason that it brings the entire family together for the month of Ramadan. My entire family gets together for Eid. They start preparations for the meal the previous night itself and mostly the biryani is ready as early as 3am. Women on the previous night will also spend time putting mehendi for each other. After the Eid prayer at 10am, we will start distributing biryani to our friends, needy people and then sit together for lunch. It is mostly kurtas for men and saris with lot of chamki work for ladies. Since my sister owns a designing unit in my native Salem, all the saris, ghagra designing work is done by her. My favourite memory is when I got my mom a gold bangle with my first salary and a nice linen shirt for my dad. It was way back, but seeing them wear on Eid day was the best.Eid is always a special festival, because it is the one occasion that brings us all together back home, no matter where we are. Of course, I fasted during the Holy Month of Ramadan like every year. This year, too, I will be spending Eid at home with family and close friends. Apart from a grand lunch at home, I will also be sending biryani to a few friends as well as distributing them in a few slums. My most memorable Eidi was two years ago, when a 10-year-old girl, Aparajitha Ramesh, from Dubai, paid me a surprise visit. She apparently was quite impressed with my work, which she learnt about after watching a few of my videos. She, too, wanted to become an activist. She came bearing gifts, too  chocolates  and it really was the best gift. I offered her biryani in return, but she was vegetarian, so, she couldn't eat it. She told me she would rather have a sapling to take back home instead. This incident is something that constantly keeps me inspired.Every year, my mother arranges for biryani to be prepared for all our houses. So, the cook makes it for her place, mine, my sister's and my brother's houses. My sister has got me new clothes, which I intend to wear today. This year, I fasted for all the 30 days of the Holy Month and visited the mosque with my niece, too. For celebrations this year, I've invited a lot of friends home. Most of my friends are non-Muslims and some are even Brahmins, so there will be special vegetarian biryani. We will also be making sweets like kesaris and laddoos, vadais and a chicken shorba. So, the feast is grand. Every year, we get Eidi from my brother Rahman, and it is always special because at no other time does he indulge us with money like this. Every year, my mother buys all of us clothes, and that has become a tradition now.On Eid, I try my level best not to work, but invariably I end up going to the studio. The day starts with my regular prayers. Everybody, for some reason, assumes that this is the day of the biryani, but after fasting for over a month, it is difficult to have a lot of biryani. You are so used to a certain diet. I generally go to my hometown Trichy for Eid and I haven't been able to do that for the last two years. I miss doing that. Eidi for our family is a lot about charity. So, we are generally busy doing that.I will be wearing a beautiful chudidhar kurta in yellow and my dupatta will be grand. I think no Indian festival is complete without good food, so yes, we will have an elaborate lunch. So it is going to be a lot of biryani and chicken. Eidi is a lot about charity, and we do a lot for it as part of my trust. We contribute towards children's education. Eidi is also about good-luck money. I still get my Eidi and also give it to the youngsters in the family. I believe that Ramzan is not just about fasting but it is also about restraint. There is no point of fasting if you are going to be angry and yelling at everyone. It is also about introspection.This Eid is going to be about new clothes, mutton biryani and lots of sweets. My mother generally prepares the meal, but since she is not well, I will take over the kitchen. We have ordered the biryani and I will making semiya and rice payasam. I am the last in the house, so when I was young, I used to get all the Eidi. Right now, my niece's son is the youngest, so he collects all the money."

Apartments and high-rises today have hardly any crevices or niches for sparrows to nest. Electromagnetic radiation from cellphone towers is another big reason that has affected birds. Besides, birds are often electrocuted by wires dangling from electric poles.Growing noise pollution is another factor that does not make birds feel safe. ""Sparrows have always co-existed with humans. You will not find the bird in the wild,"" said ornithologist KK Mishra. Sparrows have lived and bred in recesses in walls of old buildings, above the entrance door which mostly had gaps between the wooden beam and the wall, in ventilators or in open spaces used for storage in houses. Modern dwelling units, high on architectural finesse, hardly have space for 'house-sparrows'.Change in the urban plantation scheme, where ornamental varieties dominate, also does not support sparrow population. 'Desi' varieties like jamun, tamarind, peepal, neem, mango and lemon, which are fruit-bearing, and grow up to become huge trees with dense crown and crevices in their trunk, are not planted any more. Years-old roadside trees, bushes and thickets in the middle of the city, parks and green spaces in residential colonies provide space to birds for roosting. But, tree cover has been lost to concretization.""It was always believed that sparrows are the symbol of prosperity and happiness but urban homes now do not get these visitors. These homes have no food or water for the birds,"" said range officer, Lucknow city, OP Singh. In many houses earlier, it was a routine to keep aside morsels for birds and animals before people sat down for food. The tradition is almost lost now.""Sparrows have been of extreme help to farmers as they prey on harmful insects and pests,"" said Singh. Change in agricultural techniques, however, has not been favourable to birds. Farmers spray insecticides to protect their crops. Birds prey on these insects and die due to poisoning.The agriculture residue is also unfit for the bird to eat. When the bird eats grains and fruits treated with pesticides and fungicides, it dies.n Re ason to rejoice:Sparrow count might be on the rise in Lucknow. A study conducted by the Biodiversity and Wildlife Conservation Lab of Lucknow University found an increase in the number of sparrows over successive years. In 2015, 5,637 birds were counted, which was up from 4,084 in 2014 and only 2,025 in 2013. The forest department, too, launched awareness programmes for sparrow conservation in 2010. ""We never had any numbers available for sparrows, so to say that the population of the bird has increased over the years is difficult. We can definitely say that people have started noticing the bird more. Sensitivity towards the bird has increased,"" said a forest department official."
58f6383a7be9e031f13b08d9,Racing food prices keep govt on toes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Racing-food-prices-keep-govt-on-toes/articleshow/52788549.cms,2016-06-17,"NEW DELHI: Mission pulses is turning out to be a key political task for the Modi government. Inflation in retail dal prices remains stubbornly high, climbing to 32% in May 2016 from 7.94% in September 2014, even as the price rise of items such as oils, eggs and veggies ranges in the 5% to 7% band.Meat and fish rates too are creeping up -inflation moving from 6.94% in September 2015 to around 8% now. This rise along with the surge in price of oils, eggs and vegetables -the last affected by seasonal surges (tomatoes moved from -10.21% in March to 9.50% in May) -is creating inflationary pressures.Though food inflation is well below the levels when NDA assumed office, it's begun eating into household budgets and threatening to give the government a political headache.The need to manage pulse rates has seen the government offer large jumps in minimum support prices, hike imports, create a contingency fund and use mobile delivery vans.Food prices not only affect the poor but also the middle class. And, this can affect the government's ratings when the BJP has reasons to feel satisfied at having completed two years in office and tasted recent electoral successes. High food inflation was seen to have hurt the UPA along with corruption cases -areas of vulnerability the Modi campaign zeroed in on in 2014.Initiatives in irrigation, a national farm market and a shift from MSP-driven policies will take time to show impact. The Centre needs to be wary about public impatience over its inability to smoothen price fluctuations.Expectation of a robust monsoon has wiped off some worries. But the impact of two consecutive patchy rainfall years must be dealt with when both retail inflation and wholesale price inflation data point to build up of pressure points on food items.Aware that spiralling prices may hurt economic recovery, measures to ease pressure on pulses include negotiations being initiated on long-term contracts to improve supplies.Interestingly, the inflation rate of cereals has hardly changed, indicating the effect of massive buffer stocks and the rising demand for pulses, fruits, meat, milk and eggs while per capita consumption of wheat and rice is declining. ""The government should cut import duty , remove stockholding, build buffer stock through imports and resume futures trading in pulses,"" said Ashok Gulati, Infosys chair professor at ICRIER.The RBI has already paused its rate cutting cycle, will watch the government's supply management as well as progress of the monsoon before it moves on interest rates.Economists say they expect prices to remain firm in June and July with added pressure coming from the hike in service tax rate and the increase in fuel prices.But things may reverse as the skies open up.""CPI inflation is expected to print in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% in June-July , with food prices likely to remain firm during those months,"" said Aditi Nayar, senior economist at ratings agency ICRA.""Moreover, the rise in service tax rate and retail prices of petrol and diesel would add some upward pressure to CPI inflation.""August 2016 onward, food inflation is likely to soften, Nair said. ""Moreover, data on the distribution of rainfall and pace of sowing may dampen food inflation, particularly if higher MSPs can boost acreage of high-inflation items such as pulses.Lower temperatures may douse the prices of perishables and non-vegetarian protein items,"" she added."

Their expectations of good prices because of lower yields also went wrong.As the season was drawing to a close, the farmers turned panicky and started selling the produce in the fields itself without waiting to take the produce to the purchase centres to claim MSP. This had turned to the advantage of the dealers and the representatives of the millers, who were offering low prices.Alluru Kishore Reddy, a farmer from Pottepalem, said they had not anticipated the problem this season as the officials said necessary arrangements had been made for better prices at the purchase centres throughout the district.But the problems have cropped up and there are no good prices for the farmers. Millers are not cooperative because of which the dealers are buying our paddy at low prices. We have no option but to settle for this and we cannot wait till we get Rs. 12,350 MSP per putti (850 kg), Mr. Kishore told The Hindu .He had cultivated paddy in over 20 acres at Pottepalem village near Nellore. The yield was 35 bags (each bag 40 kg) per acre due to lack of adequate water supply and unfavourable weather.Mr. Kishore said this had become a recurring problem but this time the farmers had to sell the produce in fields itself at far lower prices. He said they would have waited if there was any hope of getting MSP in the near future.For the farmers, lack of remunerative prices was indeed a major blow what with their financial conditions already turning grim considering the high interest loans they had taken from private persons.The cost of cultivation also rose to anywhere to Rs. 30,000 per acre."

And though many reconcile with tandoori or grilled items there are others who crave to bite into a crunchy salad, slurp on a healthy soup or get a shot of detox through a cold pressed juice.Cashing on these trends are health and food enthusiasts who have set up eating joints that cater to this segment. Nitish Das , for instance, was weighing around 120 kgs till a year back when his friends goaded him to lose weight. ""I began working out and controlled my diet and got phenomenal results,"" says Das who now weighs 84 kgs.Not restricting his experiences to just himself, Das along with a few friends started Diet Studio, a small eatery at Shankar Nagar which caters to around 25 people at a time. ""80% of the weight loss comes with eating right kind of food. I hope to provide that aid to many who are trying to achieve their targets,"" he says.The place serves a plethora of items like cold press juices made with fresh vegetables and fruits mixed with herbs. Vegetarian and non-vegetarian salads, brown rice meals, sandwiches made with whole wheat or multigrain bread and egg white omelettes. A meal for one would come at an approximate cost of Rs120.""The response has been overwhelming so far,"" says Das who has been devising these items on his own.Breaking the myth that takeaway foods are unhealthy and food home deliveries are only about pizzas, burgers or greasy Mughlai dishes are health monsters, a 'home delivery service' serves fresh salads for a reasonable Rs399 for five servings. Started two months back, the founders are promoting their venture through social media.""We knew this would work as we ourselves are heavily into health foods and regimes,"" says Sachin Patil who also runs an e-education business. His other partners are Anup Wodatkar , a chef, and Jayesh Bagde , a businessman.""We are at the moment delivering gourmet salads made with exotic Indian and continental ingredients, dressed with different sauces,"" says Patil about his creations which are delivered in insulated bags to retain freshness.Terming his clientele as elite and comprising of doctors and businessman, Patil says that at the moment they are facing timing and ingredient availability issues. ""Our delivery timings are between 12 to 2pm and then 5 to 7pm. People specify different timings which we have to match. Besides though get good quality raw vegetables the supplies can get erratic in the city.""Finding the menus healthy and different at these places, 28-year-old Pranav Ghugre, who runs 'vada pav' outlets in the city, feels that items served at the health food eateries cater to that crucial 4 to 7pm food craving. ""It is important to eat something healthy during that time and these places have excellent filling items,"" he says.For 31-year-old space consultant Deepak Sharma the sheer convenience of these places is appealing. ""Indians are not smart eaters and so far such options were not available in this city. But now I try to grab at least one meal at these places be it a protein loaded shake or a salad."""

IGKV is in the process of commercialising the products, as it will bring fame to the farmers of Chhattisgarh. These rice varieties are soft in quality and highly aromatic while the husk is also very thin. After being cooked, the natural green colour and aroma will appeal to rice eaters.""""These green rice grows to a height of 125 centimetres and takes 135 days to mature while total yield is four tonnes from an acre of land. It is suitable for cultivation in all seasons,"" said Prahlad.The farmer who has been growing this variety since 15 years, said, ""Korma variety should be kept unpolished. Only then will it retain its natural colour. The green colour is removed once rice sheller process is used for removing husk. Hence, it should be promoted for sale when unpolished.""Talking to TOI, IGKV's soil scientist Dr KK Sahu said, ""To provide maximum economic benefit to local farmers of Chhattisgarh, the agricultural university will sign memorandum of understanding with Ahmedabad's National Innovation Foundation. This MoU will document and develop the innovative farming practises adopted by farmers at the grassroots level.""Till now, around 600 unique rice varieties from Chhattisgarh have already been registered for the commercial use.For this, IGKV had been conferred with a national award for filling maximum number of applications for farmer varieties."

He demanded immediate sanction of 7,082 tonnes of rice and 2,849 tonnes of wheat for distribution among BPL category and 15,488 tonnes of rice and 5,049 tonnes wheat for distribution among APL category customers in the state.In his letter, the opposition leader said that the government's decision citing that the state was yet to implement the national food safety act, would push lakhs of citizens in a consumer state like Kerala to starvation and poverty.He said the most efficient public distribution system was functioning in the state, where almost 97% of people were covered by the system and there were PDS shops in every two kilometres. ""There will be all the more demand for the food grains due to the coming Onam festival season in the market. The shortage of rice and wheat in the market will also lead to black marketing and hoarding,"" Chennithala pointed out in his letter."
