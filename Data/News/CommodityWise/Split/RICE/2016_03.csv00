""I have told the Prime Minister how we can make use of paddy straw instead of burning it. You cannot ask farmers to stop burning paddy straw as he has to prepare his field for the next crop. You must find a mechanism to commercialise it,"" Swaminathan told reporters on the sidelines of the first International Agro-biodiversity Congress (IAC) here. Referring to a technology developed in Maharashtra and used in a couple of other states, Swaminathan said, ""You add urea and molasses in paddy straw, you can use it as animal feed. There are different ways in which paddy straw can be utilised.""Swaminathan, who shared the dais with Modi on the inaugural day of the IAC, said, ""The PM was interested and I will soon send a note to him on this topic.""He said India produced 140 million tonnes of paddy and 280 million tonnes of rice straw a year and its effective commercial use would benefit farmers. Addressing the IAC, he said that when we talk about agro-biodiversity, it is not about grains alone but about the whole plant. ""Paddy straw enriched with urea and molasses is a wonderful animal feed,"" he said.The Centre, which discussed the issue of stubble burning in detail in its review meeting on air pollution on Friday, is expected to elaborate on the issue again in the meeting of environment ministers of neighbouring states on Monday."

Ambient lighting, costumed serving staff and floor-level seating (complete with canopies draped in shimmering curtains) aim to make the visitor forget Tiruchi for a brief while.Moroccan cuisine has been shaped by all its interactions with other countries over the centuries, chef Rajprasad Radhakrishnan said. You will find dishes here with a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, Andalusian and Berber cuisine.Theres also an influence of Moroccos colonial heritage, with a small selection of French recipes.The buffet starts off with a salad table that has some staples of Middle Eastern cuisine  steamed couscous (semolina granules made from durum wheat) with finely-chopped fresh vegetables, tabbouleh (cracked wheat mixed with finely chopped ingredients such as tomatoes, onions, and parsley) and Hummous dips made with chickpeas and black beans.Fatayer (mini minced mutton pies) have been given a vegetarian twist with a potato and peas filling, and Manakish, small pita flatbreads topped with zatar spice mix of cumin, oregano and olive oil, and sambouseh add to the variety of the bread counter.Grilled meats feature prominently in the Moroccan palate because of the nomadic lifestyle of its people. We have tried to include the commonly barbecued meats in our festival, with a live station that will serve customers the cuts of their choice. We marinate the lamb for at least one and half days before we grill it, said Mr. Raj. The whole lamb being barbecued at one end of the pool makes a dramatic visual statement at the festival.

Hubballi-based Aissel Technologies Private Limited has set out to change the 56-year-old railway engineer's perspective.Elderly look for a hand of support, places to unwind No place for the elderlyArun.Dev@timesgroup.com Bengaluru: In her list of prospective grooms, matchmaker Shanti Kotresh has an 80-year-old, a 70-year-old and three men in their 60s---all who do not wish to spend their autumn years in solitude.KOLKATA: His devotees were worried because he was having headaches for the first time in his life. Not bad for a 120-year old. So, the monk walked in for the first medical check-up of his life. To put it in perspective, when Swami Sivananda was born, it had only been a year since X-ray was invented, and on Saturday, he didn't bat an eyelid when he was wheeled into an MRI machine.Swami Sivananda walked out with a clean bill of health but for high blood pressure -even then his diastolic was absolutely normal at 80. The secret of baba's health? Mashed green chillies every day . Plus boiled food, daily exercises and the joy of helping.Swami Sivananda's passport and Aadhaar card put his age at 120, but he looks 50 years younger -there's hardly a wrinkle on his cheeks. Doctors and nurses at the private hospi tal were awestruck by the monk's mental and physical agility. They were speechless when he did a sarbangasana at the drop of a hat (or request).Born on August 8, 1896, in Behala, then a village, the swamiji could be the oldest living person. In fact, he is about five years older than Japan's Jiroemon Kimura, who holds the Guinness Record now. Though based in Varanasi, he moves around the country and abroad for spiritual discourses.He seemed quite bemused at his first medical check-up. He has been staying with a devotee in Salt Lake for about a month now. In the last few days, he started complaining of headaches after every discourse with devotees. Prodded by his followers, he agreed to a check-up. All these years, we've nev er heard Swamiji com plain of health problems. When he said he was having headaches, we persuaded him to get a check-up,"" said Dr S C Garai, a disciple.All they found was systolic hypertension (18080). ""Even people in their forties can have such high blood pressure if they lead stressful lives.Swami Sivananda has the heart of a young man,"" said Dr P C Mondal, interventional cardiologist at the hospital.""Clinically, his heart seems to be in good condition.The ECG and echocardiogram reports are awaited. He agreed to take medication for his high blood pressure but asked us if he could postpone it by five days so that he can work on reducing it on his own,"" Mondal said.Born Sivananda Goswami, his parents died on the same day when he was only four years old. His elder sister, who used to beg for food with him, died two years later. Some relatives handed over the child to a guruji who brought the boy to Nadadwip. He moved around before settling down in Varanasi in 1979.What's the secret of his longevity and health? ""I believe in eating simple, living humble and in being compassionate. I feel good when I have tried my best to help those in distress,"" the guru told TOI in perfect English, despite never having got formal education.He had boiled rice, boiled pulses and boiled vegetables with a couple of green chillies from the hospital's canteen for lunch. Chef Suman Bhattacharjee got a pat for the doubled boiled rice as swamiji has lost all his teeth, perhaps the only sign of his age.""As a child who had to sleep on an empty stomach many nights, even boiled food is a fancy . I stuck to boiled food as a habit and not because I was conscious of my health. Fruits and milk are a fancy for the hungry so I avoid them,"" said Swami Sivananda. While many `Godmen' or gurus live in palatial houses, Swami Sivananda lives in a 600 sq ft flat in Varanasi donated by his disciples. Anyone who wants to approach the swamiji with their problems can walk in any time of the day . He sleeps on a mat with a wooden block for a pillow. He performs yoga, pranayama and freehand exercises for two hours daily. The rest of the day he reads, chants and speaks with devotees from any religion.The good days are when he gets to help someone.Every Saturday, he and his devotees distribute food among the poor. He also spends time working with lepers and plans to travel to Puri in December to help lepers and beggars."
58f63e19a3d24b0b70c29686,The crossover comedian,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/The-crossover-comedian/article14984584.ece,2016-09-17,"Decorators working in the ballroom of a five-star hotel in suburban Mumbai, are clearly looking bewildered at having to transport a giant plastic duck across the room. On a makeshift stage, the same crew see large colourful balls and a shark mask. All of which only adds to their confusion. These are just some of the props Irish comedian Jason Byrne uses during his stand-up act, theyre told. But the most crucial prop Byrne is known to use generously, is yet to arrive  his audience.When a sleepy Byrne arrived in the hotel from the airport at the crack of dawn, he received a traditional Indian welcome. The hotel staff performed an aarti with a plate of flowers and rice grains, which he thought was food and tossed some in his mouth. Byrne finds himself in the midst of such cultural gaffes often, something he weaves into his jokes as he travels the world.Desi premiereThe 44-year-old stand-up artist makes his foray into India with performances in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru over the weekend. When I told my friends I am going to perform in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangladesh, they laughed and said, I dont think youre performing in Bangladesh. Thats another country. Thats how new I am to India, says Byrne, who squeezed in his Indian visit before he begins his Britain tour from October 1.The comedian alters his material depending on the culture hes parachuted into. Byrne shows us his red diary in which he has scribbled three names: Amitabh Bach- chan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan. You will have to help me pronounce these names. My Sri Lankan friend told me no act can be complete without Bollywood in this city, says Byrne.Thinking visuallyByrne, who also hosts a wildlife-themed game show called Wild Things on U.K. television, says he has an animated imagination. I think in images, not words. Hence I started using props, reveals Byrne, who titled his memoir Adventures of a Wonky-Eyed Boy .The comedians constant interaction with the audience is the perfect crucible for creation of comedy. When Byrnes not interrogating someone in the front row about his missing wife, he is making another wear a shark mask and quack like a duck. Comedians are strange people. If the whole room is laughing and one person isnt, thats the one Im looking at, says Byrne, who thinks he is at his smartest when on stage. His humour covers all bases, from observational to physical humour and improv.Transcending bordersByrnes versatility and flexibility helps him universalise cultural interpretations of humour. For instance, he believes audiences in Britain are good listeners so he has to keep his humour sharp. While in Australia, where he performs the most outside Europe, the audience is always grinning because of the perpetually good weather. The Finnish have been the kindest. In Finland, other comedians stand in a line and clap for you and then shake your hand thanking you for the show as you leave, grins Byrne. But for the Dublin-born comedian, the French audience has been the toughest nut to crack. They welcome you with a frown and you have to work that into a grin.Despite the diversity, the comedian has observed over the past 20 years, that women are the same all over: better than men. Byrne relies on women in his life and the audience to provide him the meatiest of fodder for jokes.No politicsThe comedian promises to steer clear of making political references in his comedy, but does just that on stage. He recalls performing in Dubai, where he made several jokes about Sheikh Mohammed, Vice President of the United Arab Emirates. They said you cant talk about him, so I did. I did 20 minutes on him. After the show, someone came up to me and said, I enjoyed the show very much but you could soon be gone. I replied, gone where?. He said, thats what we dont know, he recalls.He says the only time he offended someone in the audience was during a performance in Ireland. I said, there were two guys in the sauna sitting in the nip [Irish slang for being naked]. Later I realised nip is a horrible slang for Chinese people, and there were two of them in the first row, he grimaces.As Byrne hits the stage the same evening, he storms into the ballroom wearing a black T-shirt and white blazer. Five minutes in, the jacket is off his back and the audience is at his fingertips. From taking digs at latecomers to the Shiv Sena for changing Bombay to Mumbai, he improvises from the word go. Byrne had revealed to us that he has performed for as long as two hours without any material. But irrespective of whether he had any material on him, there was not a moment when the room wasnt pulsating with laughter.Jason Byrne is Propped Up will take place at Tata Theatre, NCPA, at 7 p.m. today.

Prayers are offered to the four gods of the tribe, Tamu, Harniang, Metii, and Danyi, for a pest-free and bountiful harvest. Community feasts comprising delicious rice and millet beer are accompanied by traditional dance and songs glorifying the greatness of the Apatani tribe. The women visit their relatives and present them with home-made beer and wine as a gesture of love and affection."

Works on the single line project, covering a distance of 125 km, commenced in the 1980s and were completed in March this year. The cost of the project has swelled to Rs 1,900 crore.Chintalaneni Srinivas, an employee in a private hospital in the city, hailing from Pottipadu village in Rajupalem mandal in Kadapa district, said: ""Now, it becomes easy and affordable to go my native place."" Srinivas, who came to the city three decades ago, used to cough up at least Rs 2,000 towards bus fare to visit his place. ""With Rs 600 in pocket, I can travel from Proddatur to Nandyala and from Nandyal to Vijayawada via Guntur thanks to the new line,"" he explained.The capital city region draws a huge number of students from Rayalaseema areas running into around 50,000. Around 15 private buses operate from Vijayawada to these areas every day in addition to several RTC bus services, indicating heavy dependence of people on road transport. Gajula Ramachandra Reddy, a native of Yerraguntla who retired as a Telugu lecturer from SRR and CRR College in the city, termed the new train a road to progress and a medium to bridge the regional disparities between coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema regions.The rail route is set to improve market linkages for the Rayalaseema areas rich with limestone, minerals and iron ore. Kurnool and Kadapa districts earned a name for themselves in onion and rice across the country and the rail link will give a big boost to market these products."

Amandeep Chugh, however, doesn't reach for packets of Maggi or soft parathas that remind him of his childhood in Chandigarh. The whole of last week, he battled a viral infection with time away from work and some hot jowar oothappams, brown rice and vegetables.""I never heard about millets before I came to Bengaluru as we never had it at home,"" says the 28-year-old software engineer. He dropped into a neighbourhood millet cafe in JP Nagar and was hooked to the hearty fare. ""I feel lighter and fresher after a meal,"" says Chugh, who came to the city a little over a year ago.Well-packaged millets have been in city stores for years but the hardy grain seem to be finding more health-conscious patrons, and the proof of the pongal seems to be in the eating. Sustainability activists and farmers' collectives have realized that more people will consume millets if they are turned into tasty pulavs, rotis and payasas, and are showing people how to cook daily fare using the grain.A few activists have turned into intrepid entrepreneurs to set up cafes and catering units. ""I started a cafe after realizing that no amount of talking would convince people,"" says Jyothi Madinur, founder of Vaathsalya Millet Cafe, one of the first such outlets in the city. It is the same reason that prompted Arun Kaulige of Kaulige Foods to branch into millet-based catering apart from distribution. After catering for individuals and corporates and organizing regular Sunday cookouts to show how the grains can be turned into mixed rices and dosas, he is readying to open a cafe.RISE IN DEMANDOver the years, the demand for millets has grown as more people started looking for healthy and desi alternatives to rice and wheat. Sahaja Organics, a company set up by organic farmers' collective Sahaja Samrudha, has 350 stores in south India. The maximum demand is from Bengaluru and Chennai, says CEO Somesh Basavanna.""Last year, we sold one tonne each of the seven millet varieties in a month. This year, it has gone up to two tonnes per variety,"" says Basavanna. He says demand will go up further due to rising health concerns.Kaulige says people prefer kodo and proso millets that are rich in fibre and vitamins. Apart from local entrepreneurs, several big brands are also in the fray. However, the figure is paltry when compared to rice and wheat sales. ""Millets are not even 0.5% of the amount of rice being sold every month,"" says Basavanna.RACE TO THE TOPIt isn't easy to change dietary habits even in a city like Bengaluru, called the 'organic capital' of India due to the sheer number of organic outlets. A 2006 study about consumer perception shows that people would start with organic vegetables and fruits, followed by milk and rice, says Manoj Kumar Menon, executive director, International Competence Centre for Organic Agriculture.What is really making the difference is the price. In the aftermath of the Green Revolution of the 1960s, high-yielding varieties of wheat, rice and maize covered swathes of the country in a bid to ensure food security. Incentives and cheaper prices meant that both cultivators and consumers shifted to the grains popularised by the government. ""There is a millet belt in Mysuru that was killed by maize,"" says G Krishna Prasad, director of Sahaja Samrudha, which has been trying to revive traditional crops. Ragi is an exception as it is a staple of south Karnataka.LOST HERITAGEWhat got lost was traditional knowledge of sustainable, local crops that could give American oats and Mexican chia a run for its money in the nutrition department. Prasad says two major (bigger grains of bajra and jowar) and seven minor millets (ragi, foxtail and others) have been cultivated in rain-fed conditions for centuries.""They are hardy and need little water, and are found from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh, parts of Odisha and the hills of Tamil Nadu to the Himalayan foothills,"" Prasad says.No climate change is going to stop stout brown topped millets from thriving in the shade of tamarind trees or kodo to grow in rocky land in Karnataka. ""These practices are environmentally sustainable too,"" says Prasad.However, with neglect by government and academics, cultivation dwindled. Fifteen years ago, a group of organic farmers came together to address this knowledge gap. As the movement grew, they hit the same wall: how to get people to start eating millets again? The first millet mela was held in 2011 by the group in association with Dharwad Agricultural University in Bengaluru.MOVE TO MILLETA series of melas followed and other organic groups too organised similar events. Now, millets have come to the mainstream. ""For one, the nutritional value of the grains are prompting the health conscious to switch, especially those with gluten allergies,"" says Menon. Then, there are those who are moving away from refined foods.Bengaluru, with its highly educated and mixed population, has been experimenting with grains. ""Tamilians know barnyard millet as 'kuthiravaali' while it is 'jhangora' to those from Garhwal and other regions,"" says Prasad. Add to this mix a higher incidence of diabetes, and many are ready to replace rice at least once a day. ""People eat dahlia or broken wheat due to lack of choice. Many are happy to use navane and koralu that were eaten by their grandparents,"" he adds.But to beat the price advantage, the government should set up community processing units so growers needn't send grains to Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Also, a push to popularise millets as in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh would help, says Prasad.Meanwhile, Kaulige and others are planning to make cookies and cakes out of millets so that people will find the old grains appetising. A move that makes sense as many of Chugh's friends still find the cafe food costly or not 'spicy' enough.He isn't sure how long the place will be around without adequate marketing push. The backup plan is cooking classes. ""I can't completely switch to millets but if I know how to cook I could have a light dinner,"" says Chugh."

The 94-year-old was one of the founders of the Progressive Artists Group of the early 1950s that comprised the country's influential modern artists including FN Souza, MF Husain, KH Ara and HA Gade. His constant endeavours and globally-appreciated works catapulted Indian art on the world map in a big way.Over the years, in his interviews with Times Of India, we discovered that despite living in Paris for most of his working life, he was a true Indian at heart. His thorough knowledge of Hinduism, Christianity and Islam helped him add a distinctive touch of spirituality to his works. Though his early paintings were mostly poetic landscapes and seascapes, he transformed his style with his concept of the 'Bindu'. The deeply-spiritual artist would talk about it as the 'origin of everything'.He was awarded the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and was also conferred the highest French civilian honour, the Commandeur de la Legion d'honneur.We spoke to artists, gallerists and art collectors to get a glimpse of the man behind the legend...When SH Raza was here with us in Paris, my husband, daughter and I would go to church together every week. We were best friends for 20 years and would talk about art for hours. We were like family to each other. He was also a witness at my wedding. In fact, he was the reason I settled in Paris. He had visited Pune to see my exhibition in the 80s and then urged me to go to Paris. I was lucky that I got to be so close to such a great artist. We'd show each other our works before showing them to anyone else. A huge chapter in my life has now closed.SH Raza lived in France but whenever he was in India, he would visit his college, Sir JJ School of Art in Mumbai and attend the annual exhibitions held by students. He may be the first modernist Indian artist who incorporated texts in art. Some of his works juxtaposed texts with abstract spaces. He understood colour, darkness, light, line, thinness and thickness of layers. He was friends with poets, writers and youngsters and admired by everyone. He led a life of precision.I was fortunate to have been guided by Razaji. On seeing my works, he encouraged me and his first tip was to just paint what came to my mind. Since I had no formal training in painting, I'd always feel I had missed out on something, to which he would say, 'One need not go to an art school to learn art; it has to come from within'. He would ask me to sit with him and watch him paint for hours. He taught me how to mix colours and the importance of placing them on canvas. He was spiritual and influenced by every religion and his depth reflected in his works. I try to follow him, and my bold colours and conceptual works are a direct influence. He was a pure soul and loved the Bihari kadhi and rice cooked by my wife. I will miss him and owe him for being the artist I am today.All abstract artists admire him  his work combined the Orient with the Occident  and they appealed to most people. He encouraged young talent and never felt threatened by anyone. I remember my first meeting with him, which was many years ago in Delhi. I was part of an abstract show. Out of all thepaintings displayed, he asked about one particular painting  it happened to be mine. I was flattered and honoured as he couldn't stop praising my work. Even though we did not meet that often, he still remembered me whenever we met. He had many young artist disciples. He will be remembered for his wonderful works and for being a mentor to many.My memories of him are at the India Art Summit (now India Art Fair) in Delhi. He would look at the works of known as well as unknown artists with equal interest. I remember seeing him pause and contemplate before my Gandhi painting and then do a namaste. He was like a messenger of peace. He did not speak much but was enthusiastic about young artists and would always advise them. He took abstract art to a different level altogether.He was the epitome of abstract art. His existence itself was like a learning for artists like us who have seen him for so many years. His visual communication was powerful and his art was a language in itself. I met him several times and consider him my guru. His paintings were alive with passion.Raza, MF Husain, VS Gaitonde, Tyeb Mehta and FN Souza shared the dream of a free modern India. But soon after independence, most of them left for France, the Mecca of Art, to explore their creativity. My father stayed back in India and remained in touch with Raza. They shared a volatile relationship and would be brutally frank with each other. Of course, it did lead to some fiery moments but my father would eventually make up with him. Over a period of time, I saw their relationship evolve and both of them would catch up over a meal.Raza was a phenomenal human being and definitely my favourite painter. He was an intuitive artist, with a lot of intellect. His deep knowledge of Hindu spirituality would astound me. His works were perfect orchestrations of colour and form. His paintings almost lit up spaces. His strokes had spirituality. He would say that the Bindu is a simple means to attain infinity and he kept using it. He did a painting for me and gifted one to my wife, titled Mala, which was special. He will be sorely missed in the India art scene. An era ends with him.Not many people know that Raza started out as a landscape artist. It was later that he deviated towards abstract. A couple of years ago, he told a dear friend of mine that abstract is the only way to gain mastery in composition. Landscape painting was his true love. 'Those who can balance various elements of a landscape can excel in any form', were his words.India has lost not only one of her greatest artists, but also a great symbol of cultural unity. As an Indian Muslim, Razaji contemplated and explored Hindu cultural symbols and concepts his entire life. Such enlightened thoughts are missed in our turbulent times.He was such a charming man. I only knew him during his old age, when he was in his wheelchair. He was extremely generous  in 2002 at the golden jubilee of our gallery, he donated one of his works and it was auctioned for a lot of money. While most artists ask for a 50-50 share, he just gave the entire amount to us.His demise will leave a deep void in the art world and in our hearts. Razaji was a mentor, guiding us with his vision and wisdom, shaping and deepening our understanding of art, and more importantly, of life. He led his life by example. The result of his journey within, to seek his own truth, found resonance in the concepts of his art. Having been closely associated with him in the last 20 years has enriched our lives profoundly. We spent time in his Paris studio, browsing through his treasure trove of books and enjoyed his hospitality in Gorbio where he spent his summers. Inputs by Vinita.Chaturvedi@timesgroup.com"

The temple administration helps only in the facilitation of the event. The kozhukattai is then taken atop the 272-ft hillock by temple workers for special puja. Later, the Kozhukattai is distributed among the devotees.R Sundararajan, a devotee from Rockfort, said making of 150kg kozhukattai and distributing it to devotees has been a practice in the temple for the past 15 years. It is similar to that of the mega Kozhukattai offered to the deity of Mukkuruni Vinayagar inside the Meenakshi temple in Madurai.Malaikottai Ucchipilliyar is only next to Pillayarpatti temple known for Vinayaka temples in the state. On Vinyaka Chaturthi, traffic around the hillock comes to a standstill due to the huge turnover of devotees to have a glimpse of the deity.Purushothaman, one of the coordinators of the event, said over 15,000 devotees are expected on Monday."

Baburaj of Kadalundi never imagined that this delicate fish would turn his life around.Receiving the Deen Dayal Upadhyay award for inland aqua farmers from Union Minister for Agriculture Radha Mohan Singh here on Sunday, Mr. Baburaj thanked the Kadalundi river and the Karimeen for saving him from the verge of bankruptcy and for earning him the laurels.Baburaj stays at Cheriyathuruthi, a small island almost at the mouth of the Kadalundi river, that houses 14 families. He hatches Karimeen fingerlings in a huge pond at the centre of the island and supplies them to the nurseries across the State. In fact, his is the only Karimeen seed farm in the region.Karimeen is easy to rear, not like Chemmeen (prawns) that needs constant attention and care, Baburaj told The Hindu . In fact, he says the island provides the best possible condition for Karimeen farming with constant flow of water from the river to the pond, saving him the effort of artificially managing the oxygen-level in the pond.The adult fish are fed rice and pellets/cattle feed. The pond is divided into two segments with sand-made bunds and pipelines beneath to facilitate flow of water between the segments. Thus the water level in the pond is maintained at one metre or above depending on the level in the river. The hatching usually takes place during June-July or November-December.Baburaj is in a jubilant mood explaining how he obtained the award. I applied for the award through a breeding centre in Chennai. I provided all the documents needed to give credibility to the claim, he said.He was accompanied by a team of 25 people, including family and friends, to the Indian Institute of Spices Research at Chelavoor in Kozhikode to receive the award."

The remaining 14,791 hectares of land has remained unsown owing to scanty rain.The district has received 1,297 mm rain this year till September 23 as against the average rain of 1,978 mm during this period.The total deficiency of rain is around 34 per cent.Paddy in more than 55,000 hectares of land is under the traditional rain-fed cultivation method in the district that includes drill sown method locally known as koorige and upland cultivation also known as makkigadde .K. Madhusudan, Joint Director, Agriculture Department, told The Hindu that the target set for sowing has been met in command areas of reservoirs in the district. Owing to scarcity rain, those farmers, who undertake cultivation in the rain-fed method in parts of Tirthahalli, Sagar, Hosanagar, Shikaripur and Sorab taluks, have shown reluctance in cultivating paddy.Ravindra, a farmer from Konandur Gram Panchayat limits, used to cultivate paddy in the traditional rain-fed method. He said that though he had raised nursery of paddy seedlings, he decided not to go for transplantation of the saplings owing to shortage of rain this year.The average yield per acre in Malnad region is around eight quintal. Last year, Mr. Ravindra had undertaken paddy cultivation in two acres.Owing to moisture and the stress caused by scarcity of rain, the yield had declined by around 50 per cent. As the rain was scanty this year also, he decided not to cultivate paddy to avoid incurring loss.Like Ravindra, many farmers in Ripponpet, Anandapuram and surrounding areas too did not transplant their saplings owing to poor rains.As the rainwater from the forests in the vicinity gushes with great force in makkigadde , barring paddy, it is practically impossible to cultivate any other crop there.The unsown paddy fields have become grazing ground for cattle in Tirthahalli and Hosanagar taluks. Nandish Churchigundi, a progressive farmer from Shikaripur, said that at present the traditional method of puddling and flooding the fields with water is being practised for paddy cultivation in Malnad.In the wake of decline in the quantum of rain in recent times, the possibility of cultivating paddy under the System of Rice Intensification and other methods that require less water should be explored, he added.District has received 1,297 mm rain this year till September 23 as against the normal 1,978 mm"

Altogether, 1,500 KMC personnel have been picked up from the civic headquarters apart from a section of regular staff at the borough level.The dwindling staff at the one-day mutation counter at KMC headquarters has started refusing fresh applications for mutation of flats. ""We are left with low manpower and cases have piled up. This is why we have been forced to reject fresh applications,"" said a KMC assessment department official.The rapid requisition of civic staff from the assessment department has dented the civic coffers too. ""Revenue collection from property tax and mutation fees has gone down by 25% in the past two months due to withdrawal of staff,"" a civic official said.

58f64262a3d24b0b70c299c5,Water shortage triggers paradigm shift in cultivation in delta region,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/Water-shortage-triggers-paradigm-shift-in-cultivation-in-delta-region/article15003584.ece,2016-09-28,"From what was once a three-season mono crop paddy cultivation in the Cauvery delta region for over 2,000 years, things have changed rather dramatically for the farmers in the last few years. The vagaries of water availability have now forced the farmers to shift their cultivation pattern to ensure that they reap at least one harvest during the current year. While Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathy reservoirs in Karnataka put paid to the hopes of kuruvai paddy cultivation in delta, samba is under threat from the proposed Mekedatu and Rasimanal reservoirs, say delta farmers who fear complete loss of livelihood resources.Till about four decades ago, farmers in the delta used to go in for kuruvai and thalady paddy crop in certain areas even as others took up the long-term samba cultivation. That was when Mettur dam used to be opened regularly around June or July for kuruvai paddy cultivation in delta and coupled with a reasonably beneficial north east monsoon we could cultivate two crops at least. With the construction of Kabini, Hemavathy and Harangi reservoirs in Karnataka then, kuruvai came under severe threat. This year even samba is in danger resulting in loss of production and jobs for lakhs of farm labourers, points out secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai S. Vimalnathan.The short duration kuruvai paddy crop was cultivated on about four lakh acres in the delta region. The cultivation area came down to less than a quarter of that extent. The slump was precisely due to meagre inflows into the Mettur dam and the subsequent irregular opening of the dam for delta cultivation. In reality, construction of the dams in the upper reaches of Karnataka prevented water flow effectively depriving us of our livelihood, rues the vice-president of the CPI (M)-affiliated Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Thozhilalar Sangam V. Jeevakumar.Water scarcity has forced on the delta farmers a paradigm shift in their cultivation pattern. Farmers had to skip the traditional nursery and transplantation method and resort to direct sowing of paddy, as usually happens in the rain-fed areas. Second, mechanised farming has come to effectively replace manual labour-oriented farm practices. Third, farmers have also moved from conventional paddy cultivation to the System of Rice Intensification method which could be undertaken with less water. Finally, the meagre water availability has pushed the delta farmers this year to raise medium and short duration paddy varieties instead of the usual long term varieties.Present day water availability has pushed us to the wall and we are cultivating medium (135 days crop) varieties such as CO (R) 50, CO 43, ADT 38, ADT 39 and ADT 46 and short term varieties such as ADT 43, ADT 45 and Anna 4 varieties for this samba season. Produce could be there but what about the market and price, wonders a progressive farmer V. Pattabiraman of Thirunageswaram near Kumbakonam.Unfortunately, paddy is the only crop that could withstand rain and come up in the clay soil that largely marks the delta region. That was why generations have remained tethered to paddy crop cultivation in the delta for well over 2,000 years. That was when water was available aplenty, but now that is a sad story. From luxurious cultivation practices to frugal use of water, the delta farmer has come a long way and has truly transformed himself."

58f64294a3d24b0b70c299e8,Still missing in Mullaitivu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Still-missing-in-Mullaitivu/article15419824.ece,2016-10-01,"There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, residentThe last time Mary Sabamalai saw her son Mayuran was in 2008, when he came home for his 21st birthday.This was about a year after she surrendered him to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), during the final stages of their battle against the Sri Lankan armed forces. Mayuran went missing in 2009.Since then, Mary has been to different government offices in Mullaitivu and outside, carrying his photograph. Tall and lean, he is dressed in white formals, sporting a tie. Not a day passes without Mary, 52, wondering about Mayuran, the eldest of her four sons. She has two daughters. Her husband, now in his sixties, is a fisherman who takes up other odd jobs occasionally. Some months ago, Mary petitioned a presidential commission looking into cases of missing persons. I got an acknowledgement saying they have received my letter, but that is all, she says.Mayuran, she firmly believes, is alive somewhere.Kamala (name changed) knows how to keep her four-year-old busy. Look, the hens are running. Catch them, she tells him, just so that he would move away from her bicycle that stands slanted. Her trick works. But three minutes later, little Mukesh (name changed) squats behind the rear wheel and looks at her through its spokes. He giggles quietly, sensing her fake anger.It is not often that Mukesh gets to play with his mother. On most days, Kamala sees him for barely two hours after she returns from work. I usually leave at six in the morning and get back by 7 at night, says the 25-year-old. It was past lunchtime that Saturday and she had not heard from the farm where she is employed. The days labour fetches her Rs.600 (roughly INR270), if she picks a sack-full of groundnuts and shells as much. On some weeks she gets called for work all seven days. Like Kamala, many in Mullaitivu work in kachchaan or groundnut farms, as farm hands. The district accounts for the second highest share of groundnuts produced in the country. But that is not what Mullaitivu is best known for.The dogs of warHome to nearly 1.3 lakh people, mostly Tamils, the town located on Sri Lankas north-eastern coast paid heavily during the three-decade-long civil war that ravaged the Tamil-dominated Northern Province. Its residents, displaced multiple times, are slowly stitching their lives together. They cannot let go of the past, and the present holds them in its vice-like grip.A UN panel of experts report published in 2011 estimates some 40,000 civilian deaths in the final phase of the war. The report attributed most civilian casualties to government shelling, a charge that Colombo has flatly denied. The impact was most intensely felt in Mullivaikkal village here, where thousands of displaced people took refuge. That is where Kamala lost her mother and her young husband.It is more than seven years since the Sri Lankan armed forces defeated the rebel Tigers, ending the brutal war. In October last year, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution moved by the United States, and co-sponsored, among others, by Sri Lanka, that seeks to probe allegations of human rights violations during the war. Even as different actors argue for and against international judges participating in the process, survivors in the countrys war-ravaged Northern Province continue battling its lingering aftermath every day of their lives.Gruelling schedulesAfter my first husband died, soldiers would just walk into my house and speak very inappropriately. They would harass me day after day. The local men were even worse. They would just hound any woman living alone. I knew I could not survive by myself, that too with a child. I got married again, says Kamala.Her days now begin at four in the morning. She takes an hour to cook and pack rice meals. She makes four packets, two each for her husband and herself to take to work. We have rice for breakfast and lunch, there is no time to make anything else. When she returns home in the evening, it is time to prepare dinner. After her father died in 1996, it was Kamalas mother who toiled as a labourer to support her and her siblings. I didnt realise her role when she was alive, but today I miss her the most. Had she been around, she would have taken care of my children while I am away at work, she says, fixing her glance at Mukesh, who is still playing with the cycle pedal.Kamala does not seem to mind her gruelling schedule. At least it takes her mind off the past. Right from her school days, distress followed her like a shadow. The LTTE demanded one child from every home to join their cause. They took me. I could not stand their horrible practices and somehow managed to escape, risking my life. She dropped out of school in Class VIII.Even as she despises the LTTE for taking her by force, she thinks the organisation helped maintain some order in the town. The rampant alcoholism we see today would have been impossible had the Tigers been around. Things were not so costly. Life was better in a sense.With her husband too engaged in daily wage labour, the couple gets by with some support from an elderly neighbour who takes care of Mukesh during the day. Her elder son, who is seven, lives with an aunt in Kilinochchi, about 50 km away. Kamala has not spoken to her aunt in weeks. If I do my son cries a lot, asking me when I will bring him here.She plans to, in January. But by then she would have to think of ways of sending him to school. Whether it is transport or tuitions, everything costs money. A tiny home built with financial aid, an uncertain job and a meagre income from it is all she has.Catch-22 on the coastOn the other side of Mullaitivu, closer to the coast, are families whose lives are tied to the sea. Fishing is a key driver of the districts economy, along with agriculture.A small group of women gather at the front verandah of one of the homes. They are attired in gowns that flow below the knee, some in bold colours sporting floral prints. It is past noon and very warm, the sporadic sea breeze alone bringing some relief. They used to call this place a prawn bank, says Edel Queen, who formerly headed a womens organisation here. The catch has fallen in the last few years, largely due to Indian trawlers fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. More recently, Mullaitivu fisherfolk are being forced to compete with fishermen from the southern districts of the island who have begun fishing in the northern seas. The drop in fish production has left many men and women jobless. Edel recalls a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making small sums of money on a regular basis. Now that has become impossible, she says.Many of them burnt their fingers borrowing money to set up small businesses. Leasing companies have mushroomed in the north, says Edel. Trying to replay old loans, many find themselves trapped deeper in debt. According to government data in 2012-13, Mullaitivu has the highest percentage of poor households in the country at 24.7 per cent. The mean household income here, as per census data for 2012-13, is Rs.23,687 (approximately INR10,700), the lowest among Tamil-majority districts, and in the country.With few options, most of the women now take up odd jobs for a small daily wage. They make and sell fruit juices in the village or package grocery items in small quantities.A few others, mostly younger women, have joined a garment factory in Puthukkudiyiruppu, travelling 20 km one way. This is one of the three factories that were set up in the north following the war.Employing many thousands of women, mostly in their twenties, the factories draw cheap labour. The women stand all day and work, making branded garments that fetch them a few hundred rupees every day. With no crche or child care facility, the factory automatically excludes young mothers.Broken familiesAccording to the District Secretariat records, Mullaitivu has nearly 6,000 women who are the sole breadwinners in their families. At least 5,000 women are widows, with many of them losing their husbands during the war.In addition to the many thousand lives that the indiscriminate shelling claimed during the conflicts last days, over 750 people in the district are reportedly missing. Some since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the district. And others during the war, due to enforced disappearances.My neighbours saw the army personnel arrest and take away my husband. I dont know where he is, I am still searching for him, says Nirmala (name changed), a woman in her early thirties. She has checked in rehabilitation camps, prisons and hospitals in vain. Some say he might have died, I dont know. What if he is alive? He must be alive, somewhere far away.Between appearing before commissions that hold public hearings and running to government offices with petitions, she takes up any daily wage job that comes her way to support her two young children.Amid growing pressure from families of missing persons, the government in Colombo recently decided to set up an Office of Missing Persons by an Act of parliament. It is a welcome move, but it should be set up in Vanni, says Nirmala, referring to the mainland area of the Northern Province. We cannot keep running to Colombo every time, right? How will young mothers go all the way, forgoing a days income and spending on the journey? Who will take care of their children?A missing person, in many families, also translates into having one less earning member. Aged parents and young spouses run from pillar to post, seeking answers or, possibly, some closure.Almost every family has lost a relative to the war, or is looking for a missing member. Many homes have a photograph of a relative hanging in the living room, with an oil lamp lit beside. Grief over the past coexists with anxiety about the future.Men are engaged in daily wage jobs, if not in farming or fisheries. However, given the number of single women running homes, there is a desperate need for sustainable jobs and child care facilities, the women emphasise.We need industries. That too industries linked to our natural resources  the sea, agriculture or forests, says Edel. They teach us to sew or make sugar candies or pappadam [a lentil-based flatbread]. How long can we do that? Where is the market? How do we compete? she asks, having tried it all  from skills training workshops held by government and non-governmental organisations to entrepreneurship.Vanni parliamentarian Shanthi Sriskantharajah agrees. The reason that women have not got into palmyra products is because there is no market. We need industries focussing on natural resources of the region. And we need to find a way of marketing the products.This is something that neither the central government in Colombo nor the Northern Provincial Council elected by the Tamils seems to act upon. They keep organising some programme or the other for women. They buy them milo packets and make presentations. Thats about all. Nothing changes, Shanthi notes.Accessing natural resources comes with a set of challenges. If fisherfolk are faced with a diminished catch, many farmers are fighting for their land that is still under military occupation.After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in January 2015, defeating former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, he began releasing private land that the armed forces had occupied during the war. In Mullaitivu, the government has released almost 1,000 of the 2,000 acres taken over by the army, according to the District Secretariat.Reclaiming land after 30 years of displacement involves major adjustments for the displaced families. Those who were children back then would have grown up now and have families of their own, explains Sundarampillai Sivamani, a 60-year-old farmer. Sivam akka, as she is known in her village, grows paddy and groundnuts on a small farm her family has taken on lease. The five acres she owns have been occupied by the forest guard for years.That is what happens when you get displaced for so long, she tells me, sitting at a bus shelter. Families lost members. They lost birth certificates, national ID cards, land deeds. The missing documents haunt them as they try to trace and reclaim their own land. But I realise how lucky I was, I did not lose any of my children. Especially since she witnessed her 14-year-old nephew succumb to a bomb that landed near their bunker. He had a bath, and had oiled and combed his hair so neatly. He looked like a prince that day.She remembers his last words, Athai (aunt), I am feeling very scared today, he told her. Dont worry, we are in a bunker and will be safe here, she assured him. The army had said they were all safe there. He probably believed her. He smiled. Within minutes, however, she heard his mother scream. A shell had pierced through his head and he dropped dead. His smile was intact, says Sivamani, her bold voice suddenly shivering. No one had time even to bury the bodies there or grieve, they had to run for their lives.Battling everyday challengesIn Mullivaikkal or Nandikadal, the lagoon where LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is said to have been killed by the army, the residents are under watch, though many observe that surveillance has lessened since President Sirisena came to power.Is it okay to be named, they ask each other as they give interviews. It should be fine, we arent saying anything that is untrue, one of them reassures. We cant take a chance, you never know with the military, warns another. They negotiate this everyday fear, systematically evoked by the government and the armed forces in the islands post-war years.They try out different ways. Some Tamil women have joined hands with Muslim women who have recently returned to Mullaitivu, years after the LTTE forcefully evicted them. We have to reflect on the past together. Or we cannot move forward, says a prominent member of the group, requesting anonymity. Our Tamil leaders do not look beyond Jaffna. They do not know how we live in Mullaitivu, she says with anger. This feeling of being left out in the margins is not uncommon in the district. Leaders in Colombo will not let us come up in life. Their actions keep reminding us that we are Tamils, that we are second-grade citizens. They feel abandoned. There are some changes, we must acknowledge, intervenes another member of the womens group. They do not agree with each other. But they dont mind listening.However, most of them have little time to dwell on anger or resentment. The stark reality of negotiating each day presents a challenge. A kilo of rice costs 68 rupees (roughly INR31) in Mullaitivu. Sugar costs Rs.100. Coconut, 30 to 40 rupees. And sea fish, Rs.500 per kg. This is our situation today, says S. Mary, also employed in a groundnut farm like Kamala.Her family, like several others in Mullaitivu, migrated from the islands hill country, where Tamils of recent Indian origin live and make a living at the countrys famed tea estates. We left during the 1983 riots in the south. Only to face an even worse war in the north. I want to go back to the hills now, she says.Kamala hopes she gets called for work the next morning.There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, resident"

KarunakaranA kolam with its myriad designs, patterns and colours, is an emotion and an expression, and it is still drawn in front of homes to welcome guests. This emotion need not necessarily be religious and may even sometimes convey social concerns. It is the emotion however which breathes life into what otherwise would be empty form with no meaning, says author Shakuntala Ramani, whose book Kolam and other Ritual Arts of India was released on Saturday at a simple function at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan by former judge of the Supreme Court S. Mohan.She said her fascination with the intricate patterns and designs that are kolams began early. These days, with people living in high-rise buildings, there is no space for kolams or else, there is an ugly looking sticker in its place. Over the centuries, drawing kolams developed into a very sophisticated art but in recent years, it has begun to disappear, which was one reason I began to study the art form, said Ms. Ramani, who has also penned a book titled Sari and the art of natural dyes, among others.She recalled how she has watched hens pecking at and squirrels licking off kolams drawn using rice flour, which used to be a tradition. People now use stone dust, which keeps away the tiny insects that used to feed on kolams, she said, adding that kolams had also become a part of religious practices at homes.The book is published by Oxygen Books.Archaeologist R. Nagasamy said the kolam was the common mans art and was glad that Ms. Ramani had concentrated on such a ritual art.He suggested that the book be prescribed to students in colleges to introduce the traditions of India."

The tribunal has completed its hearing and the final award is expected in a year.Karnataka's counsel Mohan Katharaki told reporters in New Delhi: ""The tribunal observed that other states are also presenting their case seeking water. In such circumstances, it is not possible to admit Karnataka's plea. However, the final judgment is yet to come. I am sure the state will get justice.""Chief minister Siddaramaiah said: ""We are waiting for a copy of the tribunal order that will shed light on reasons for the rejection of our petition. We'll convene an all-party meeting to elicit opinions to resolve the inter-state water dispute with Goa.

Rajendran said that the 35-40 per cent rainfall deficit was likely to open up a plethora of issues for plant health management and crop production.The programme was organised by the Directorate of Extension, KAU.Minimising water use for crops, decreasing crop duration and ensuring crop rotation are some strategies we can adopt. Development and identification of crop varieties with shorter duration and tolerance to drought, pests, and diseases would be helpful. Focus should be given to location-specific varieties, the VC said.Metal toxicity (iron, aluminium and manganese), soil acidity, nutrient deficiencies, severe infestation of weedy rice and rice bug, water hyacinth, bacterial leaf blight, blue beetle and rice case worm were the major issues likely to affect paddy farming.The experts noted that machinery for mount preparation and dismantling of mounts and harvesting in Pokkali fields was a dire need. Problems of weeds in upland paddy cultivation were also discussed.The meet noted that 90 per cent yield in coconut was reduced owing to the infestation of red palm weevil and Richnocerous beetle, which was particularly severe in dwarf palms. Soil- related problems, deficiency of nutrients, and white fly attack would also affect coconut trees, experts said.The problems affecting vegetables were identified as infestation of sucking pests  mites and white fly. Rampant incidence of soil-borne fungi causing wilt and root rot in vegetables such as cowpea, solanaceous crops, ladies finger, and bitter gourd; fruit fly and downy mildew in cucurbits and mealy bug were other threats, they said.irector of Extension S. Estelitta said that the second phase of the interface would be held on October 7, when pragmatic solutions to the issues raised would be presented."

Since June 1, Kolhapur has received 4,561.11mm rainfall. Gaganbawda taluka has received the highest rainfall with the daily average being 25mm, while Hatkanangale has recorded the lowest showers (daily average 1mm). While most of the parts of the district witnessed rainfall on Wednesday with low intensity, it was invisible in most of the district on Thursday.The citizens woke up to dark clouds on Thursday morning, which covered the city throughout the day till evening. But, rainfall was nowhere in sight.After heavy rainfall in the first few days of this month, the water level at Rajaram barrage increased to 26ft. But the level declined to 23ft on Wednesday. Similarly, the water level of the Panchganga also dipped further to 20ft on Thursday.The reduced rainfall intensity has worried officials of the water resources department (WRD), who faced stiffed opposition from the farmer community for imposing restrictions on using the river water for irrigation.A WRD official said on the condition of anonymity, ""It the water level continues to decline, we will have to impose restrictions on water use. At present, the water level in dams has increased but not up to the desired level. The dams need to be filled completely so that adequate water is made available for irrigation.""Farmers have started sowing after rainfall for the first few days. Crops such as rice and sugarcane are water intense and need continuous supply for growth. If the rainfall continues to be low, the farmers may have to carry out sowing once again, which is a costly affair.We are monitoring the rainfall situation in the catchment areas of the dams. If the rainfall continues to be low in next few days and the river water level declines, we will be left with no other option but to impose restrictions to some extent,"" the official said.By Thursday morning, about seven barrages located along the Panchganga and five along Bhogawati river were still under water."

Apart from picking on people from the front row and roasting them, which is what the award-winning comedian is famous for, Jason also talked about his time in Delhi and got many laughs for the Indian-Irish comparisons. ""Irish moms are very similar to Indian moms. They'll be running around the house chasing you down with a slipper in their hand and eventually beating the hell out of you. Well, I grew up like that,"" he laughed.He also narrated how he got what was for him an unusual yet funny welcome at the hotel on his arrival. ""Let me tell you, I had a very different welcome at the hotel. A woman was standing with a plate that carried flower petals, some red powder and rice. What was that? I didn't know what to do with it, so I picked up some rice and literally started eating them. I thought it was food,"" said Byrne, who at the time was jetlagged and hungry, he said. However, he had something to say about Delhi's weather and traffic conditions as well. ""You people have some guts! The road would be brimming with traffic, and you would still have the courage to cross the road and stop right in the middle to let some cars pass, and then carry on with it. There are lanes, people. How do you guys do this?""Considering that this was his first visit to India, Byrne seemed to know a great deal about the country. When asked about his knowledge of Delhi and Indian culture, he said that he grasped everything within a week's time. ""It was all very impromptu. I noticed little things about the city while travelling in the car here, and incorporated them into my gig. That's the secret, you know. I picked up things about the culture of this city and talked about it in my show, which established a connection between me and the audience. I am glad it turned out well,"" he said.In his interactive act, Byrne roasted almost everyone sitting in the front row - especially one gentleman whom he asked what he did for a living, and his wife, seated next to him, shouted, ""He keeps me happy."" Byrne continued to make the audience laugh with his take on modern-day relationships, and mother-son and husband-wife relationships. He also talked about Coldplay singer Chris Martin's relationship with his ex-wife Gwyneth Paltrow by doing a before-after divorce act, with Coldplay songs like 'Fix You' playing before the 'divorce' and 'Adventure Of A Lifetime' after it.Byrne during his Coldplay act (BCCL)When asked about his views on the Delhi audience, Byrne expressed his amusement at the 'constant yet fun' argument between Delhiites and Mumbaikars on who's the best. ""I've heard this has been going on for a long time. They (Mumbaikars) say they're better and you say you're the best. I was told after my performance in Mumbai that the Delhi audience can be a bit hard. But nothing of that sort happened. The audience was responsive and seemed to have a good time. Everyone I called on the stage was a sport. I had so much fun the whole time,"" said the 44-year-old comedian. The show ended with his trademark segment, in which he called people from the audience to the stage and used them as 'props' by making them wear animal masks, follow his lead and make funny noises.Jason Byrne with one of the audience members during his last segment (BCCL)After two of his shows got a thumbs-up from the Delhi and Mumbai audiences, Byrne said it would be amazing to plan more shows in the country next time. ""I am looking forward to planning more such gigs in Delhi and other cities too. This time was focussed on planting a seed in the cities I performed in so that people tell their friends and relatives about it. The response was very good and I hope it will be even better next time,"" he added.After spending a week in India, Byrne was off for his next gig in Dublin. When he was asked about his plans of staying in Delhi for a while, since it's almost the festive season, he exclaimed, ""What? The festivals are approaching? On my way here, I saw a place brimming with people. Some of them were boating while others were in a huge park, eating and having a fun time. Wasn't that some kind of a festival today?"" Turns out, the Irishman was at India Gate on a Sunday. We suppose India's even funnier than he thinks!"

Every year, from late in July to the first Tuesday of August, Antiguans come together for the carnival which celebrates the emancipation of slavery in the country. Coinciding with the carnival, some villages in the Saint Phillip area of the island organise a reunion every four years. The event brings back expats who mingle with locals. A good number of Antiguans have shifted overseas in search of greener pastures. The largest number of the expats is in United States while many have found their calling in Europe and even South American countries.The reunion is held over a week with activities every day. A popular part of the reunion is the 'food festival' which attracts a goodly crowd. This year, the food fest has been organised at the local football ground of the Seatons village. Food stalls dot one part of the ground while a group of young boys play football under lights.The atmosphere is easy and joyful. There is no hustle and bustle of an Indian carnival because of the small population. On a routine day, you hardly see anyone on the roads after sunset. It's a sparsely populated island and only sounds one hears once the evening sets in is that of birds, pet dogs and the wind coming from the bays. For someone from India, it seems almost eerie.Back at the food fest, Devon seems happy with the sales his wife's stall is racking up. He owns two buses and, interestingly, drives them too. Do you know a bus owner would never drive it in India? Devon, a simple looking man, smiles and says, ""I don't mind driving my bus. People look at me and think I'm just a bus driver but it's fine with me.""For a place like Antigua, a congregation of 300 people is quite a sizeable one -the entire population of the country is barely 85,000. It's thus a festive atmosphere at the Seatons football ground. The blaring music adds to the mood which is typically Afro. On offer at the stalls are king-sized crabs and lobsters, pork ribs and chicken with seasoned rice and veggies. Saltfish, which is a slated, dried cod, is much in demand by the revellers. Then, there are traditional Antiguan staples like fungie which is made of corn paste and water, and ducana which is a sweet, dense dumpling made of grated sweet potato which is mixed with coconut, pumpkin and cinnamon. Then there are simple, homemade cakes almost all of which contain coconut."

School authorities claimed that they had not received any supply of raw rice from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godown due to which the MDM scheme had stopped.Nilesh Waghmare, district in-charge of MDM scheme, said, ""It is shocking that the school did not inform our office about the issue. I think it is a very simple concept, which a big school such as this one should understand, that if there is a problem in the supply chain, the competent authority has to be informed. They apparently had been calling the truck drivers who deliver rice sacks, but that is not the protocol to be followed. But as a first step, we have ensured that rice sacks reach the school today itself so that MDM preparation can resume.""The problem came to light after social activist Shahid Sharif visited the school following complaint from some parents. Sharif said, ""It was extremely difficult for me to imagine that a school in the middle of the city can go an almost entire month without serving MDM to students. Kids in this school have been denied their basic right and yet the management is taking things very lightly.""School authorities say they had been in touch with MDM officials right from the start. Speaking on behalf of principal Sr Sophia D'souza, a senior teacher said, ""We were continuously informing the staff at the MDM office about the non-supply of rice. They kept assuring us that supply will resume shortly. The only oversight was that it wasn't done in writing. We have been following all rules and have always ensured to maintain standards.""Waghmare said he was unhappy with the storage room's condition. ""Other cooking ingredients were being kept on the floor, and in such a condition that they could get contaminated easily. I pointed out these things to the school and will wait for their official reply in writing before deciding further course of action,"" said Waghmare."

On the occassion, Malayalees cutting across religious lines, get together to welcome the benevolent King Mahabali , who according to mythology is believed to visit every year to inquire the well-being of his people.Being a harvest festival and a family affair, on Thiruonam it's mostly a family affair with families confined to their homes and attending to guests serving traditional Onam Sadhhya- a feast involving traditional delicacies cooked with vegetables and spices from Kerala and payasam- sweet dish.Malayalee associations will be holding various programmes through the week to commemorate Onam with community feast and cultural programmes.General Secretary of South Bhopal Kerala Samajam Raghuvaran Pillai shared believes and reason behind celebrating Onam. He said according to myths Thriuvonam is the most important day for Malayalees, who belive the their belowed king Mahabali would come to their house. All the houses are decorated and preparation of food items is done in anticipation of his visit.Wednesday, begins with pooja for Lord Vamana , a descendant of Lord Vishnu, he said.Celebrations begin early in the morning. People clean their house, apply rice flour batter and floral petals on the floor on the main entrance (a traditional welcome sign), take an early bath, wear new clothes and distribute alms to needy. The eldest female member of each family presents clothes to all the members of the family. Special prayers are organized in temples, churches and mosques that highlight the secular nature of festival. The pookkalam (flower-based Rangoli) is prepared to welcome Mahabali.Retired school principal NUK Menon said the increasing number of associations in the city have only divided the people which is just contrary to the spirit of festival as Onam basically means togetherness.There are over 30 Malyalee associations in the city, according to Menon there were just three associations working for 40 years when he shifted to Bhopal for his studies. Although now the festival is celebrated at a large scale the new generation is hardly aware about the tradition and festival."

Symbols of such cherishable moments (replete with pranks and covering up for each other), rakhis and gifts associated with Raksha Bandhan now come in 'edible' avatars as well, defining a trend in itself. With our love for chocolate as sincere as that for our siblings, we went on a spree to take stock of all things chocolate-y for the day.Chocolatier Nikita Malhotra noticed a growing demand for customising edible rakhis this year. Her chocolate shop in Kalyani Nagar is a wonderland for chocoholics, displaying countless rakhis bearing the words 'bro' and 'bhai'. Dainty, they've been a hit so far. ""At first, I anticipated only youngsters to warm up to the trend, but lots of adults have also asked for these,"" quips Nikita. Looking for something extra special? You can go a step further and fashion rakhis with your brother's name on them. ""If names are long; we suggest placing the initials or pet name instead. After all, less is more,"" Nikita adds.For us though, the totally edible puja thali (yes, you heard that right) took the cake. Everything, from the thali to its various components: the diya, katori to bear the rice and roli and of course, the rakhi are nothing but pure chocolate! While Nikita personalises rakhis and chocolate bars with different flavours (think almond, fruit-and-nut and the likes), the thalis are pure dark or milk chocolate; it's easier moulding them when the consistency is focused. On our way out, we couldn't help but notice the Poke Ball rakhis. The game craze seems to have piqued the interest of the chocolatiers' brigade too. ""These have been a real rage, especially among girls looking to give their bros a subtle hint that they've been catching too many Pokemon of late,"" laughs Nikita.For those cat-and-mouse sibling relationships, the soft-centred rakhis available at Farman Ali's chocolate shop on Dhole Patil Road are perfect, symbols of the 'hard on the outside, but soft within' facet of the relationship. ""The centres on demand are cacao coffee, hazelnut and caramel, including ganache grande, passion fruit and orange blossom,"" shares Farman.The cupcake is perhaps the most explored canvas  for fan art and more. And city home bakers, like Baner-based Devika Joshi, have gotten creative, giving youngsters something more to express their sibling-love with. There is something simple yet dainty about Devika's chocolate cupcakes; each one is topped with an intricately moulded rakhi, crafted from fondant . ""With Shravan on, focus has been laid in keeping the chocolate cupcake, the ganache topping and the rakhi, all eggless,"" says Devika.A famous chocolate shop in Somwar Peth has doubled up as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory this Raksha Bandhan, churning out magic in various shapes and sizes. The rose-shaped rakhis bear a wonderful marble-paint effect. But even more eye-catching are the 3D rakhis, each layer a different colour. ""I took inspiration from the traditional rakhis that usually have a lot of elements. Each layer corresponds to a flavour, ranging across mango, kiwi and blueberry, among others,"" says chocolatier Vikram Murthy , who has handcrafted these rakhis for the first time.All reasonably priced, the 'barfi' on offer is particularly deceiving. What looked like a rich slice of mava barfi, is actually white chocolate with a flavoured layer on top, complete with an almond sliver and some dusted edible silver powder to replicate the barfi garnishing.Customised rakhis: Rs 90 eachPoke Ball rakhis: Rs 90 eachChocolate puja thali: Rs 900 onwardsRakhi cupcake: Rs 240 (for six)3D rakhi: Rs 10 each (small), Rs 20 each (big)Barfi: Rs 20 eachPictures by Shashank Sane"

This can take blending of this biofuel into petroleum to 22.5% as against 10% at present.""The move will also create tremendous demand for the farm waste. Perhaps all the rice straw generated from paddy growing district of Bhandara can be used in making ethanol. At present the entire waste is being burned away,"" said the minister.Gadkari was speaking at a seminar on small and medium enterprises' (SMEs) participation in capital markets organized by BSE and Panthomath Limited, a private advisory firm.He also said that the government will be spending Rs10,000 crore on road safety. This funds will be used in having crash guards, electronic markers and cameras installed on the highways.Stressing on the need of promoting research by the SMEs, he said, city-based PSU Western Coalfields Limited (WCL), has come up with a method of separating sand from the dumps created while digging coal. ""This will bring down the cost of sand to half, and I have directed that it should be used by all government agencies,"" he said.Another plan for using mine water in irrigation as well as potable use is being worked by the WCL. ""The irrigation department too found a tremendous potential in water generated during mining process,"" he said.Using waterways can considerably reduce the cost of logistics. There are plans to transport petroleum from Haldia port to the states like UP and Bihar through riparian route on Ganga. ""It can reduce the cost of fuel by Rs2 a litre there,"" said Gadkari.During the seminar, officials from BSE spoke about the avenues available for SMEs to raise funds from stock markets.Nagpur-based M/s DRA Consultancy, the company which provided consultancy for NMC's 24/7 water supply project, has filed a red-herring prospectus for the listing. Dinesh Rathi of DRA consultancy said there are plans to offload 25% promoters' stake, taking the issue size to around Rs265 crore. This will be listed in the SME segment of BSE."

But this is not criticism, but praise, for the Lord has His silent presence in all of us. And on occasions, He has come to the help of His devotees in various garbs, said K. Sambandan in a discourse.There was one instance where He even took a beating when He came to the rescue of one of His devotees.The Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam recounts the story of Vanthi, an old woman who made her living in the town of Madurai by selling a dish made of rice flour.The city was often inundated by water from the river and so the king decided that bunds would have to be built strengthening the banks of the river to protect the city.The King ordered that everyone had to do their bit. But Vanthi was too old and infirm to be able to lift sack loads of sand. So she appealed to the Lord for help.Lord Siva appeared in the guise of an able bodied man and offered to help. He wanted to be paid in kind by Vanthi. What he wanted as payment was the rice flour dish she made.She agreed, but the young man, instead of working, went about distracting others who were at work. Finally, everyone had done their assigned tasks.But the portion of the river to be blocked by Vanthi remained unblocked because her hired help was just not working. Enraged, the kings men struck the young man with a cane.The young man disappeared, but everyone there felt the blow on their backs.Thus the Lord deceived everyone when He came as a labourer to help Vanthi, but His deceptions were always for a good cause and always in order to help His devotees."

Photo: Special ArrangementLast week, motorists were alarmed by a gaping hole on the carriageway of the flyover at the junction of the Sardar Patel Road and Gandhi Manadapam Road. The flyover, which usually witnesses heavy traffic, could not be shut down for a long period for repair. So, the engineers of the Chennai Corporation improvised and finished the repair work in a few hours and the bridge was good to use.The damaged portion was paved with concrete in the quickest way possible by using environment-friendly geocement, which is a mineral compound, which is blended with bye-product materials like fly ash, rice husk ash, slag, activated clay, alumina used in the Geopolymer formation.The civic body usually uses regular cement for executing concrete cement repair work, which needs a long time to set, thus requiring the blocking or rerouting of traffic for several hours. It is one of the reasons the civic body used bitumen topping as a temporary repair material.M. Ezhil, Chief Governance Officer, Kiran Global Chems Ltd., that executed the project, said the repair work carried out using the geocement was done on a experiment basis. The same material has also been used on other flyovers, including the one at Padi, that belongs to the State Highways Department. He said geocement does not require a long time for curing because of its quick bonding and faster setting time.Lasts longerHe added that it is also environment-friendly because it is a carbon-free product and does not require any water for mixing and curing. An activator, a kind of chemical, is used in place of water. On the other hand, the commonly-used Portland cement is made with limestone, which is detrimental to the environment. Geocement has a high resistance to wear and tear, Corporation engineers added."
58f64fd67be9e031f13b23e3,New mosquito that stings malaria,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/New-mosquito-that-stings-malaria/articleshow/53328022.cms,2016-07-22,"The National Institute of Malaria Research (NIMR) based in Panaji has identified yet another type of mosquito as an urban Malaria carrier. Hitherto unsuspected to be a malaria vector in urban areas, a 2-year research projectthe first of its kind in the countryby NIMR, established that not only does the Anopheles subpictus mosquito carry human malarial parasites in urban areas of western India but may facilitate perennial (throughout the year) malaria transmission. This finding is crucial in the control of malaria. Earlier, scientists thought that only the Anopheles stephensi mosquito was a malaria vector in urban areas. Now, this study has established that unlike the Anopheles stephensi, the breeding season of which peaks during the monsoon months, the Anopheles subpictus peaks twice in a year  the monsoon months of May to July as well as from December to April. Hence, it is suspected to facilitate 'perennial' malaria transmission.Earlier, scientists only knew of two mosquito species as malaria transmitters  the Anopheles stephensi in urban areas and the Anopheles fluviatilis in hilly regions. But with the identification of Anopheles subpictus as a third type of malaria carrier in urban areas, scientists have to worry about two types of mosquitos in the highly urbanized coast of Goa and other parts of the western coast of India. ""Now Anopheles subpictus is our bigger target,"" said Dr Ashwani Kumar, senior deputy director of NIMR, Panaji.While Anopheles stephensi breeds mainly in man-made habitats in Goa such as curing waters, masonry tanks, terraces, lintels, overhead tanks and wells, Anopheles subpictus can breed additionally in a variety of natural puddles, pools, ponds, pit wells, rice paddies and backwaters. This wider choice of breeding habitat may give Anopheles subpictus an advantage over its cousin stephensi.Dr Kumar said the study was conducted from May 2013 to May 2015, the findings of which have been published in 'Malaria Journal' by BioMed Central, UK. The research was funded by the national institute of health in USA and the university of Washington, he added.NIMR, an international centre of excellence for malaria research, selected construction sites in the four towns of Panaji, Porvorim, Candolim and Margao  known for the high incidence of malaria. NIMR deployed 1,036 traps, caught 23,782 mosquitos but kept only 16,201 female mosquitos as only female mosquitos transmit malaria. Of these, 334 were Anopheles stephensi and 501 were Anopheles subpictus and others. Not a single Anopheles fluviatilis mosquito was found along the coast.Tests showed that out of 334 Anopheles stephensi, 100 were positive for human blood (29.9 %). Out of 501 of the subpictus species, 135 tested positive with human blood (26.9 %). In contrast with the stephensi, 2.4% subpictus mosquitoes assayed were positive for human blood during the monsoon phase and 24.1% were positive during the dry period, showing signicant seasonality.Dr Kumar said that Anopheles stephensi are controlled mostly through anti-larval measures including spraying of larvicide in stagnant water. But with Anopheles subpictus having a wider range of habitats, larval control may not be cost-effective. Dr Kumar proposed that long-lasting insecticide nets (LLIN) be used to protect high-risk population like labourers living near construction sites.""People need to ensure that there is no stagnation of water on terraces, lintels and drainages. Lids of overhead tanks should be airtight, septic tanks should be sealed, no puddles should be allowed and window screens should be installed in homes,"" said Dr Kumar, who is also the author of ""Vector Surveillance and control at ports, airports and ground crossings,"" published by the World Health Organisation in March 2016.In conclusion, the study highlights that, ""Anopheles subpictus is more prevalent than the recognized primary urban vector, Anopheles stephensi in the coastal region of Goa ... Given that Anopheles subpictus is present throughout India and Asia and can breed year-round in coastal areas, monitoring and further study of Anopheles subpictus should be an integral part of national urban vector control measures in Asia."""

Beside her sat cousins 'sitabhog' and 'mihidana' and rice variants 'tulaipanji' and 'gobindobhog'. They awaited scrutiny for a prized tag that will catapult them as ""novelties"" in the eyes of the world. When they win the tag  the coveted GI  they will get a unique logo, with all producers adhering strictly to a certified process of production.The team of experts from the Geographical Indications (GI) Registry office, Chennai, spent the maximum time over rasogolla, which has recently soured ties between neighbours Bengal and Odisha. Bengal, however, has refused to get into a fight by registering its claim under Banglar rasogolla as opposed to Odisha's 'Pahala rasogolla' or 'kheermohan'.At the end of Monday's examination, sitabhog and mihidana inched closer towards bagging the GI tag, but more technical details were sought on Banglar rasogolla even though the team was more than satisfied with the documentation of its history.The team, led by GI examiner Prashant Kumar and assistant registrar of trademarks Chinnaraja Naidu, expressed their satisfaction over the documentation and technical details of the production of sitabhog and mihidana. ""They will now put these out on public domain on their website for people to comment. After a reasonable period of time, which is a couple of months at the most, if no objection comes, the two sweets will be given the GI tag,"" said Reena Venkataraman, secretary of the state science and technology department.Though the team expressed satisfaction over the documentation done for Banglar rasogolla, the state will still have to submit details on the range of viscosity of the sugar syrup in which the roundels are kept, the range of its texture and sponginess, said officials of the patent office of the science and technology department.Members of the Mistanna Byabasayee Samity were invited to attend the examination process of the sweets and give their views if asked. Among those who attended were Dhiman Das, of the K C Das family, which has been included for the contribution of Nabin Chandra Das towards the invention of rasogolla. Food historian Haripada Bhowmick was also present. ""The experts appreciated how we traced the rasogolla right from Sri Chaitanya's times when it was called chana bora to golak, then golla and finally rosogolla in 1865,"" Bhowmick said.In an effort to prove that Bengal's rasogolla is different from Odisha's pahala rasogolla or kheermohan, the latter two specimens were also reportedly presented to the experts, though they refused to include this variety as part of Monday's investigation. ""The team has done a thorough examination of 'Banglar rasogolla' and will send us an examination report with details of where we need to pad up the information that we have provided. Once we do that, this product will also be put up in the public domain. If no objections come, 'Banglar rasogolla' will also get the GI tag,"" Venkataraman said.The team was satisfied with the tulaipanji and gobindobhog varieties of rice, and these will also be put up in the public domain. The Parliament had recently accepted these varieties as Bengal's original produces, and it will be easy for them to bag the tag."

The Kuzhu was among 32 such farm women groups initiated in the district during November 2014.The feed is sold at a competitive rate of Rs. 15.80 a kg and hence the demand. The consumer network was created with the support of other farm women groups and cooperative milk societies, said Kulandaivelu, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Modakurichi Block.The samples are tested regularly for validating the right ratio of inputs -- rice bran, groundnut cake, minerals mixture, black gram husk, jaggery, bajra, maize, sorgam, palm cake, cotton seed, common salt, red gram husk, and bengal gram husk.The customers have responded positively saying the milk yield has increased by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.Though the formula is uniform for all branded animal feed, the women group is able to offer their product for a few rupees lesser per kg since the overheads is low on account of own labour.In all probability, the Vellivalasu group that has invested Rs. 15 lakh by itself for the venture will qualify for the State Innovative Scheme that would entitle it for substantial subsidy benefit, Mr. Kulandaivelu said.The State Bank of India has evinced interest in extending loan for the group to ramp up its capacity, it is learnt."

The chicken satay with chilli sauce and peanut sauce was also good.It was followed by mahi aanarkali tikka -- fish tikka, pomegranate seeds, chilli, garlic paste and mustard oil -- that fish lovers will relish.For the main course, the obvious choice was the nasi goreng -- fried rice with shallots, chicken, seafood and a fried egg on top. ""It is still argued whether nasi goreng is an Indonesian or a Malaysian dish,"" Teuku said.However, there was no argument about the taste of the nasi goreng that was served. The rice was light and infused with flavours that went well with the stir-fried prawn.""The first thing Teuku did here was to change the nasi goreng's recipe to make it light and flavourful,"" Vamsi Krishna, Head Chef at the Flying Elephant, told IANS, adding that he also changed the recipe for pizza which was a big hit with the guests, as was evident at a neighbouring table.A little girl was busy munching her pizza (pesto, asparagus, spinach, goat's cheese) and her mother savoured saffron parathas with beetroot, green apple galouti and cream cheese stuffing. They also opted for seekh kebab and a pasta (mushroom and ricotto cheese agnolotti, asparagus, truffle cream, poppy seeds).The tasty dishes induced pester power -- the girl kept asking her mother whether they would be back the next day.Be that as it may, it was time for the dessert.

Biswas, in fact, has been crusading to revive folk alpana, with foundations like Daricha and Intach playing a key role.To most of us, the word alpana means patterns drawn with rice paste on auspicious occasions. In today's age, when one has very little time to soak and grind rice to make the paste and then take time out to draw the patterns, stickers make for easy use. The result is that one of the most vibrant folk traditions of Bengal is gradually becoming extinct. However, two of the country's premier art schools have taken it upon themselves to make alpana a part of their teaching-learning process, to help start a revival of sorts.The one-year foundation course at Kala Bhavan - compulsory for all students taking up fine arts at the undergraduate level - has been revised to include alpana, both in the Santiniketan gharana that was perfected by Nandalal Bose's daughters Jamuna Devi and Gauri Bhanja, and also the genre inspired by folk traditions. ""All students of painting, sculpture, graphics, design and art history have to first go through the foundation course, get their grades and then be given a chance to choose their specializations,"" said principal Dilip Mitra. "" Alpana now features in the foundation course because we want every student to be aware of both the Santiniketan and the folk traditions. This will save it from extinction.""The most popular among these are the six different kinds of 'Lakshmi brotos', coupled with specific corresponding alpanas. There are brotos in the monsoon for sowing paddy seeds popular in Birbhum, Burdwan, Bankura and Purulia, where the paddy sheaf is the central alpana motif, brotos for the Nabanna festival, for a custom called Punyipukur, where the pond and the lotus are the central motifs, for Dasputul, where the alpana is inspired by the 'Ramayana', the Senjuti broto that characterizes evenings in the month of Agrahayana, with a 52-motif elaborate alpana, the Jampukur broto where the god of death is appeased through rituals and alpanas, and the Hyachra broto to ward off seasonal diseases like chicken pox.Though unrelated to the Visva-Bharati initiative, similar alpana workshops by Biswas were a routine affair at Rabindra Bharati University at its state academy of dance, drama, music and visual art. ""We are toying with the idea of expanding a portion of the painting syllabus to include folk traditions from Bengal, including alpana of the different districts,"" said head of the painting department at RBU, Nikhil Pal."

It was very tasty, says Elena, founder of Orchid, a dance studio based in Rostov-on-Don.

This, however, is a significant gain compared to 1-2% that was being achieved in early 2014. Almost all of the 120-odd crore litres of ethanol (for blending with petrol) is gotten from molasses, a waste product from the sugar industry.Hitting the 5% target only with molasses is quite possible, said Pramod Chaudhari , executive chairman of Pune-based Praj Industries , which is involved in research and development of various processes that converts various raw materials into ethanol.Chaudhari, however, said due to the vagaries of sugarcane crop the government has to look at other sources of bio-feeds if it has to realise the target of 10%.""To achieve 10% by 2022, availability of raw materials is required... With molasses, the existing production can be increased to up to 160 crore litres. For more, feed stock other than molasses is being looked into,"" Chaudhari, who is also the chairman of the bio-energy committee of industry body CII , said.Given the dispersed nature of agriculture in the country, the collection and distribution of agri-waste is a big challenge. About 80% of Indian farmers are small and marginal farmers holding less than two hectares of land.""Collection, aggregation and distribution is a big challenge,"" said Chaudhari, adding, ""A NREGA like programme can be introduced to enable collection of agri-waste.""Praj, at its R&D facility in Pune, is working on multi-grain waste products like corn cobs, rice and wheat straw, among others to convert them into ethanol. ""The government has realised that producing ethanol from agri-waste will be a little expensive to start with. So they are encouraging the oil and marketing companies to start production in the initial stages,"" Chaudhari added.The target of 10% or even slightly higher ethanol blending with petrol (and later diesel), experts say, nicely dovetails with the government's aim to introduce a stringent Bharat Stage - VI emission norm by April 1, 2020.Praj on its part has also set-up a ""green fund,"" which will provide seed capital, in exchange of stake to entities that are looking to set-up ethanol manufacturing plants based on agri-waste.Asked why Praj itself does not get into producing ethanol, Chaudhari said, ""I am doing my job of optimising processes and doing research.""The company is looking to finalise at least one contract on agri-waste-based blending plant by the end of the current financial year - which if materialises, Chaudhari said, ""It should give us reasonable good benefit so that we can be back (in terms of profitability) to where we were 10 years ago."" In the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the company' y-o-y net profit halved to Rs 4.11 crore on income of Rs 205 crore."

The department found that most of the firms, from which he had showed the purchases, either did not file the returns or filed nil returns implying that they did not issue any bills to him.In an order dated August 5, excise and taxation officer-cum-designated officer, Kapurthala, Baljit Kaur mentioned that in the tax assessment for the financial year 2007-08 then ETO on February 9, 2011, had ordered recovery of over Rs 64 lakh from Aggarwal's firm.""The main contention for raising the additional demand by the designated officer was that this dealer had availed wrong ITC on purchases made from cancelled dealers or dealers who have wither not filed their returns or filed nil returns,"" the recent order said. It also reproduced list of 19 dealers from whom purchase transactions of worth over Rs 3.34 crores were shown.After the 2011 order, Aggarwal filed an appeal before district excise and taxation officer (DETC) and VAT tribunal, who remanded the case for re-assessment back to the ETO.

The ETO in her order also mentioned that verification of transactions with a particular company were verified from a bank and it was found that even as Aggarwal's firm deposited the money in the account of M/s Sandeep Rice and General Mill, Ferozepur and latter withdrew the amount to show genuineness of the transactions but TIN of M/s Sandeep had already been cancelled on April 18, 2006.The ETO also found that perusal of the VAT-20 it was detected that the dealer (Aggarwal's firm) had managed to change the data in the return because the data fed in the computer system differed from the data in the VAT-20. The ETO rejected the VAT-20 and took the data fed in the computer for assessment.

They perform the moves, learnt over months of hard training, from memory.The village of Bengkala has been home to an unusually large number of hearing-impaired people for generations, and nowadays about 40 out of its approximately 3,000 residents have severe hearing loss.But unlike in other parts of Indonesia where they could face mistreatment, local people have taken the hearing-impaired residents to their hearts. In many ways, life in the small hamlet has come to revolve around them.As well as the dance project, a unique sign language called Kata Kolok has been developed in the isolated village, which has been mastered by those with hearing impairment, as well as many of those who can hear, prompting interest from scientists around the world.In addition, hearing-impaired villagers are trained in skills such as making handicrafts that can be sold in the heaving tourist resorts of the island, and they work side by side with other villagers in the rice fields.Why ostracise?Human rights are the same everywhere. So I thought, why should the hearing-impaired be ostracised? said Ketut Kanta, who heads a community group for the villages hearing-impaired residents.The approach is relatively unique in Indonesia, where the differently-abled often suffer harsh discrimination.Bengkala, in northern Bali, has existed for about eight centuries.Residents often scrape a living by tending to the surrounding rice fields and education levels are generally low.In the past, villagers thought the high incidence of deafness was due to a curse but those superstitions  and the prejudices they created  have largely been abandoned after experts concluded it was due to a recessive gene common among the local population.It was not until the 1960s that the village began to make efforts to better integrate its hearing-impaired residents and nowadays everyone is treated equally, according to village head I Made Arpana.

This journey is longer and tougher, the prize has no financial value or global recognition and the participants are not professional cyclists but Buddhist nuns from India, Nepal, Bhutan and Tibet.Five hundred nuns from the Buddhist sect known as the Drukpa Order, http://www.drukpa.org/index.php/en/ on Saturday complete a 4,000-km (2,485 mile) bicycle trek from Nepal's Kathmandu to the northern city of Leh in India to raise awareness about human trafficking in the remote region.""When we were doing relief work in Nepal after the earthquakes last year, we heard how girls from poor families were being sold because their parents could not afford to keep them anymore,"" 22-year-old nun Jigme Konchok Lhamo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.""We wanted to do something to change this attitude that girls are less than boys and that it's okay to sell them,"" she said, adding that the bicycle trek shows ""women have power and strength like men.""South Asia may boast women leaders and be home to cultures that revere motherhood and worship female deities, but many girls and women live with the threat of violence and without many basic rights.From honor killings in Pakistan to foeticide in India and child marriage in Nepal, women face a barrage of threats, although growing awareness, better laws and economic empowerment are bringing a slow change in attitudes. KUNG FU "" NUNSThe bicycle trek, from Nepal into India, is nothing new for the Drukpa nuns.This is the fourth such journey they have made, meeting local people, government officials and religious leaders to spread messages of gender equality, peaceful co-existence and respect for the environment.They also deliver food to the poor, help villagers get medical care and are dubbed the ""Kung Fu nuns"" due to their training in martial arts.Led by the Gyalwang Drukpa, head of the Drukpa Order, the nuns raise eyebrows, especially among Buddhists for their unorthodox activities.""Traditionally Buddhist nuns are treated very differently from monks. They cook and clean and are not allowed to exercise. But his Holiness thought this was nonsense and decided to buck the trend,"" said Carrie Lee, president of Live to Love International, a charity which works with the Drukpa nuns to support marginalised Himalayan communities. http://www.livetolove.org/""Among other things, he gave them leadership roles and even introduced Kung Fu classes for the nuns after they faced harassment and violence from monks who were disturbed by the growing shift of power dynamics,"" she said.Over the last 12 years, the number of Drukpa nuns has grown to 500 from 30, said Lee, largely due to the progressive attitudes of the 53-year-old Gyalwang Drukpa, who was inspired by his mother to become an advocate for gender equality.The Gyalwang Drukpa also participates in the bicycle journeys, riding with the nuns as they pedal through treacherous terrain and hostile weather and camp out in the open.""PRAYING IS NOT ENOUGH""The Drukpa nuns say they believe they are helping to change attitudes.""Most of the people, when they see us on our bikes, think we are boys,"" said 18-year-old nun Jigme Wangchuk Lhamo.""Then they get shocked when we stop and tell them that not only are we girls, but we are also Buddhist nuns,"" she said. ""I think this helps change their attitudes about women and maybe value them as equals.""South Asia, with India at its centre, is also one of the fastest growing regions for human trafficking in the world.Gangs dupe impoverished villagers into bonded labour or rent them to work as slaves in urban homes, restaurants, shops and hotels. Many girls and women are sold into brothels.Experts say post-disaster trafficking has become common in South Asia as an increase in extreme events caused by global warming, as well as earthquakes, leave the poor more vulnerable.The breakdown of social institutions in devastated areas creates difficulties securing food and supplies, leaving women and children at risk of kidnapping, sexual exploitation and trafficking.Twin earthquakes that struck Nepal in April and May 2015, which killed almost 9,000 people, left hundreds of thousands of families homeless and many without any means of income, led to an increase in children and women being trafficked.More than 40,000 children lost their parents, were injured or were placed in precarious situations following the disaster, according to Nepali officials.The Drukpa nuns said the earthquakes were a turning point in their understanding of human trafficking and that they felt a need to do more than travel to disaster-hit mountain villages with rice on their backs.""People think that because we are nuns, we are supposed to stay in the temples and pray all the time. But praying is not enough,"" said Jigme Konchok Lhamo.""His Holiness teaches us that we have go out and act on the words that we pray. After all, actions speak louder than words,"" she said."

Complaints related to delay or inadequate ration supply can be lodged on the toll-free number (18003456598).Das said that the scheme will cover all districts by October 2 in the second phase.While issuing a word of caution to dealers, Das said the concerned department and PDS vendors should ensure that ration is available to beneficiaries by the 7th of every month. Das said failure to adhere to the deadline will invite punitive action.Das symbolically distributed food grains after obtaining biometric authentication of beneficiaries and said women will be encouraged to form self-help groups to obtain the requisite license to distribute items under PDS. ""We expect to implement Daal Bhat Yojana across the state to ensure food security. For this purpose, a mobile van scheme will ensure ooked food is provided at a subsidised rate in rural areas,"" said Das.Describing the day as historic following the introduction of electronic power point of sale, Das said the government's pledge was to enable the poor get their rights and this biometric system would help not only the beneficiaries, but also curb corruption.Food, public distribution and consumer affairs minister Saryu Rai said the government would strengthen the supply chain."

FILE PHOTO: AFPThe U.S. Republican Party is in meltdown as dozens of of senior functionaries disavowed its presidential candidate Donald Trump with more tapes of his vulgar conversations about women  including remarks about his daughter Ivanka Trump  surfaced on Saturday.A recording from 2005 that emerged on Friday, where Mr. Trump speaks of his pursuit of women, and how he forcibly kisses and gropes them, has resulted in widespread condemnation.The batch of conversations run by the CNN on Saturday were clips from radio talk shows aired years ago, and hence already public, technically.But the fact that their presidential nominee could talk the way he did about relationships and women has left many Republicans with no option but to abandon him. Ms. Trump figures in one of the conversations.Mr. Trumps running mate Mike Pence refused to defend him while Senator John McCain, the partys presidential nominee in 2008, retracted his endorsement of the candidate. Enough! Donald Trump should not be President, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said. He should withdraw. As a Republican, I hope to support someone who has the dignity and stature to run for the highest office in the greatest democracy on earth, she added.New candidate?Republican leaders are also discussing the possibility of replacing Mr. Trump but that may not be easy.The candidate has rejected calls by many of them to quit the race.Mr. Trump is set to face off with his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton on Sunday evening in the second presidential debate, 30 days ahead of the election. The town hall-style debate will have the audience asking questions of the candidates."

You name it, and the sweet shop owner will oblige you for sure.Many chose to stick to the basics - steamed rice flour dumplings filled with a mix of grated coconut, jaggery, poppy seeds and cardamom.At scores of catering shops and home-based suppliers across the city, orders were readied through the night, to be delivered fresh on Monday morning.Explaining the painstaking task of packaging the sweet, Sampada Pardeshi, proprietor of Modakalay, said, ""Despite all the new varieties on offer, most devotees still prefer the ukdiche variety. After all, they are Bappa's favourite too. We had a lot of orders this year and the work of collecting raw material began weeks in advance. The final preparation was done after midnight on Sunday by me and my team of six workers. We packed and dispatched orders by 6am as we wanted all our customers to get them in time for the puja.""Making the modak needs skills. The coconut and jaggery needs to be put into the hand fashioned cup of hot ukad and then seal well. After a few hours, it is steamed in a special cooker. One cannot make more than 100-125 modaks at one go.For those looking for a change of taste, plenty of new variants are available. Abhijit Gadve of Kaka Halwai said, ""The sale and response has been very good this year. While bulk orders were fixed much in advance, a lot of small orders are also picked up fresh over-the-counter during the 10-day festival. We made modaks of chocolate, cashew, khoa and dry-fruits. We also had decorative variety modaks with each weighing half or 1 kilo each.""City-based sweet-shops aggregator 'Flavors of My City' is also offering same-day delivery in Pune.The aggregator's co-founder Smitha Nair said, ""Ukdiche modaks don't have a shelf-life beyond a day. So we are trying to spread the taste among people who don't have the time to make them at home, or would like to experience our flavours. We also have a lot of other varieties, including cashew, kesar, anjeer, rose, motichoor, chocolate, strawberry and even fried modaks which can be ordered from any part of the country."""

A few may even want to lend a helping hand. In the case of six-year-old Nihal Raj - 'Kicha' to friends and family - a stint at making an ice popsicle turned into a full-blown passion for cooking. And it won him a spot on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.The young chef from Kochi showed host Ellen how to make 'puttu' -- a traditional Kerala breakfast of steamed cylinders of ground rice layered with coconut. The show aired in the US on Friday.Kicha making a traditional rice breakfast at the show. (Video courtesy/youtube)""Kicha has always loved watching me bake, and would ask me whether he could help. So I would give him small recipes which he could follow,"" says his mother Ruby Rajagopal, a lecturer-turned-home baker. When he was four, Kicha insisted that his father Rajagopal V Krishnan make a video of him making popsicles and post it on Facebook. ""That got great feedback from friends,"" says Ruby.Soon, the Class I student of Choice School had started his own cooking channel - KichaTube HD - where, clad in an apron and oversized chef's hat, he demonstrates how to make everything from tender coconut payasam to bread pizza. Though he seems too small to lift the saucepans and big bowls, he reels out the recipes, and tries to keep the viewers engaged. Launched two years ago, the channel now has more than 4,000 subscribers.""I give him very kid-friendly recipes - no cutting, chopping or cooking over fire. If any is involved, he mentions in the video that I helped him out with the chopping,"" says Ruby, adding that she selects recipes that involve just baking or refrigeration.The little chef shot to fame recently when FB acquired the rights for his Mickey Mouse Mango ice-cream video, paying him $2,000. ""It was a huge surprise for us. He is the youngest to sell a video to FB,"" says Ruby.It got him international attention, and a place on the Ellen DeGeneres show. The family flew to the US on September 19 for the shoot on Thursday. ""I had to make puttu, which I have done before,"" says Kicha, who also taught Ellen to pronounce 'puttu kutti', the vessel in which the dish is steamed."
58f65c44a3d24b0b70c2a9ab,Mumbai shows it cares,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Mumbai-shows-it-cares/article15434146.ece,2016-10-08,"In a quiet corner of Mumbai Metros Western Express Highway station on Friday afternoon, a bunch of children seated in orderly rows fidgeted and talked among themselves as they were introduced to one Indian classical musician after another. Hariprasad Chaurasia. You know who he is? the moderator asked, drawing a blank. The impatience was beginning to show. The moderator pointed to a boy in the front row and said, Pay attention, or Ill call you to the table here. The method was familiar, but this was no school in transit. It was part of a week-long session on music and theatre for underprivileged children being organised by the Mumbai Metro in collaboration with Natural Streets for Performing Arts. It was one among the scores of events across the city that marked Daan Utsav, the week-long festival which celebrates the joy of giving.The festival is incredible in scale and reached out to crores of people across the country. In Mumbai, a core volunteer base of five worked quietly, persuading NGOs and companies to participate. They are not part of any formal organisation, and do not get paid. Some of them started work in December last year, making time from classes or day jobs.As the week progressed, one thing became quite clear: Mumbai is a giving city. In terms of sheer engagement, we achieved what we set out to do, said Vikas Puthran, VP, Corporate Alliances and Operations, GiveIndia. The organisation roped in seven NGOs at four metro stations  Ghatkopar, Chakala, Sakinaka and Andheri  to convey the message of what the NGO does, create visibility and collect donations. The theme was, I am a celebrity. I changed Mumbai. We dont have a historical comparison, as this was the first time we were doing something like this on the Metro, said Puthran. But in each station, we easily had 50 to 100 donors at every NGO counter. To him, the most heartening example came from Chakala, where a donor, on impulse, treated the children of the Salaam Baalak Trust and the volunteers at the counter to ice cream.An official at Mumbai Metro, who did not wish to be named, said the event helped the organisation realise what they could do with a public space. Transport doesnt just mean going from one place to another. The way we see public spaces, is that these are where people spend a considerable amount of time and we want them to be happy places, she said. The overall objective is to enrich peoples lives in the time they commute, besides reaching out to the overall community. By doing so, we want to set an example.The Metro-related events were an unexpected success. We thought we would get more footfalls at Phoenix Mall, said Puthran, but the Metro proved better in terms of visibility. Not only did people stop to ask questions, it also opened up the possibility of them coming back the next day or later in the evening to donate.Volunteers of Robin Hood Army, an organisation committed to seeing that no one goes hungry on the streets of Mumbai, were as amazed at the spontaneous giving. They started a public collection drive for necessities and educational supplies for 2,000 children across the city. We covered all areas of the city up to Virar, Thane and Navi Mumbai. The response was amazing as there was an overflow at our collection centres, said Amit Tanvi, a volunteer for Daan Utsav, who is also part of Robin Hood Army. In some collection centres, people looked up the materials that the organisation required and bought in bulk to donate.Lets Feed With Love, an initiative by three groups  Expresso Talks, Feed Your Neighbour and Youth For Seva  focused on crowdsourcing dry rations to distribute among families in villages beyond Aarey Colony and Mokhada, a village on the route to Lonavla with a very high incidence of childhood malnutrition. We had set up five collection centres in the city and the response was overwhelming, said volunteer Shalini Kocha. Besides materials like rice and pulses we also collected things like peanuts and milk powder. All of these were made into food packs and on Friday, one of our teams went to Mokhada to distribute them. There are 400 adults in that village and about 50 children. Today, the team will be going to villages beyond Aarey Colony, where another 150 packs of food will be distributed. The collection drive was so successful, she says, that the team decided to add on brick-worker families in Kalyan, tying up with an organisation that works with them.Daan Utsav wasnt just about donations. Part of the agenda was getting people to volunteer their time for causes.Bhumi Volunteers, for instance, decided to try and get residents of Juhu to help clean up the beach. We started out with about 90 volunteers but the group rapidly expanded as people saw what we were doing. Even people who were passing by asked us to give them gloves and bags so they could help us, said Satheesh Ravi, one of the coordinators.As Daan Utsav draws to a close (the festival ends today) the organising team is quite pleased with the results. As one of them put it, its about multiple messaging and creating opportunities to give. When you actively give, it changes you. It makes you happy. We also believe theres good in everybody. That needs to be given an opportunity.In each Metro station, we easily had 50 to 100 donors at every NGO counterVikas PuthranVP, GiveIndia"

It caught international attention when Mao Zedong toasted former U.S. President Richard Nixon with Maotai. Nixons 1972 visit was a game-changing event, which permanently split the Cold War communist alliance between China and the former Soviet Union.Long March connectionAmid glitzy advertising, sweet wafts of alcohol, made from Sorghum, are inescapable inside the town, where nearly half the land is owned by the state-run Guizhou Maotai Liquor Company.Seven exhibition halls  a part of the National Liquor Culture City, inside the factory, showcase the traditional art of making the Maotai wine. The seven chambers, each with a unique architectural style, exhibit the liquor culture of the Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties, and beyond.But Maotai town has much more to offer than alcohol. It is an inseparable part of the heroic Long March  a 12,000-km-trek over snowy mountains and fast-flowing rivers  of the Red Army to escape a deadly and existential siege imposed by the forces of the Kuomintang (KMT), led by Chiang Kai-Shek. The success of the Long March 80 years ago was a turning point, leading to Chinas liberation in 1949.In his 1937 classic, Red Star over China , American journalist Edgar Snow distilled the essence of the Long March: Adventure, exploration, discovery, human courage and cowardice, ecstasy and triumph, suffering, sacrifice, and loyalty, and then through it all, like a flame, an undimmed ardour and undying hope and amazing revolutionary optimism of those thousands of youth who would not admit defeat by man or nature or God or death all this and more seemed embodied in the history of an odyssey unequalled in modern times.The Red Armys four crossings of the Chishui River  which bisects Maotai town following the famed Zunyi conference of January 1935, were central in permanently breaking the encirclement by KMT and its warlord allies. The conference at Zunyi city led to the emergence of Mao Zedong as the master strategist of the Long March, and eventually the tallest leader of the Peoples Republica of China (PRC).A suspension footbridge over the Chishui river links the two flanking slopes of Maotai. From the bridge are visible four hill-top orange pillars, a memorial to the four crossings of the river.In todays Maotai, Red tourism coexists with the towns liquor culture. From the hilltop memorial, a stream of cars  some from the not-so-distant city of Chongqing bring tourists in droves. After dusk, indulgence in street food is routine, with Yangrou Fen, a spicy lamb, and rice noodle soup, being a local favourite. Sometimes, the jarring notes of a noisy rock concert in the background, perhaps out of sync with towns cultural rhythm, are an unavoidable hazard.The Maotai Baijiu has been a favourite among the Chinese elite but the place has more to offer"

Other issues that the party is banking on to bolster its presence in the state , which is going to the polls next year along with UP and Punjab, are easy availability of LPG cylinders and cheap rice.State party in-charge, Union minister Prakash Javadekar asserted that these issues, coupled with the anti-incumbency sentiment against the 15-year-old Okram Ibobi Singh government will become game changer. The state will face the same fate like that of Assam where Tarun Gogoi was voted out of power after a continuous stint of 15 years.""Cooking gas cylinders were earlier difficult to get (for the common man). It took days for delivery and had to be acquired from black market. Now it is easily available, within two days. People are also happy with the central government due to availability of rice at Rs 3 a kg as against Rs 5.60 earlier through the public distribution system. It will be a game-changer,"" he said.Cheaper rice is available for tribals, who are in large numbers in the state.""We are sure to win because of BJP's rising credibility as people have benefited from the Modi government's programmes.

The penal action has, however, been long overdue. The government's action though belated is highly welcome. Now that it has acted tough, the government should find out the real reasons for the spurt in the spurious seed market. It should also identify the people and the companies responsible, blacklist them forever, and recover the damages from them. Andhra Pradesh enjoys the distinction of being one of the major producers of various varieties of seeds in India. The government should ensure that the state's reputation is not affected due to increasing cases of crop failure linked to spurious and substandard seeds.Andhra Pradesh is primarily an agricultural state. But, ironically successive state governments failed to effectively focus on the menace of spurious seeds. The emphasis has always been on improving yields, fighting pests, soil nutrition, loan waiver, and farmer education. For reasons best known to our rulers, the core issue of spurious seeds has never been addressed in the manner it deserved. After all, it is the seed quality that decides the fate of farmers, who spend about a quarter of the farm input on seeds. We enacted about three dozen legislations on agriculture in the last six decades and came out with several policy documents. The core issue of seed viability unfortunately has always taken the back seat.Take for instance, the latest 'vision document' of the state government released in July 2015. The fancily named 'Raithu Kosam' document submitted to the NITI Aayog talks of all that afflicts farmers in Andhra Pradesh, and the strategy needed to address the core issues faced by the agricultural (primary) sector including achieving double digit growth. Curiously, it fails to lay emphasis on the need for stringent penal action against companies that sell spurious seeds. The document (Vision 2029) simply makes passing references to seed improvement and better cultivars. It also lays emphasis on the economics of agriculture without realising that bad quality seeds will only financially cripple farmers. We have seen dozens of cases of farmers ending lives after their crops failed due to spurious or substandard seeds.In fact, the AP government's strategy against spurious and substandard seeds should have been better planned and executed. AP meets about 60 per cent of the seed requirement of the country in case of certain varieties including maize and sorghum. Since AP along with Telangana is considered as the seed bowl of India, any dereliction on the part of the government will affect the crop production not only in Telugu states but also in other parts of the country.Unless seed viability and quality is improved AP cannot dream of achieving higher yields. According to the Vision 2029 document, the percentage gap in yield per kg per hectare in case of jowar is 6.6, and as high as 421 per cent in case of castor. Rice production in AP is 3,116 kg per hectare as against 3,918 kg in neighbouring Tamil Nadu. The yield gap in case of rice is 20 per cent. In case of red gram it is 321 per cent with Kerala faring three times better than AP.Andhra Pradesh has lost some of the best farm research units including the state agricultural university post bifurcation. The state needs to replicate all these institutions in its territory. It should also focus on public sector seed production, which at present forms hardly 20 per cent of the total seed output and market. The rest of the market is occupied by private players. This leaves enough room for unscrupulous elements to compromise on seed quality. The focus should be on the seeds of cotton, sorghum, maize, pearl millet, sunflower, paddy, pulses and oilseeds as AP leads in their production. Village level vigilance teams should be formed to ensure that only quality and certified seeds are sold in the market. Spurious seed business cannot thrive without tacit political or official support. It's high time the nexus was broken."

But its target audience is under strain.Even after the fall of the kwanza, six eggs cost the equivalent of $3.50, as does a packet of imported cheese, while a large bag of rice or three salmon steaks cost $30.- Slums and skyscrapers -Away from newly-developed Talatona, many of Luanda's residents still live in slums, with tin shacks spreading to the horizon.A deadly yellow fever outbreak has spread through the city since last year, while rubbish has piled up in the streets and many major roads need repair after municipal spending was slashed.Angola also has the world's second highest mortality rate for children under five years old, according to UNICEF.The rarely-seen President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has been in office since 1979, has vowed to diversify the economy away from oil to spread wealth and protect against fluctuating prices.But little has been done on the ground.Economic growth, which soared to over 20 percent in 2007, has collapsed to less than two percent, and about 40 percent of the population live below the poverty line.The former Portuguese colony is also rated among the most corrupt nations worldwide.""Angola's aim must be diversification, industrialisation and agriculture,"" Jorge Pinto, a professional engineer and representative of the Industrial Association of Angola, told AFP.""We are a country that imports 95 percent of its goods and we have lost the power to bring these goods in due to the decrease in oil value.""Inflation has already surpassed 30 percent -- cooking oil, rice and chicken are all essentials, but many families don't have the ability to buy them.""The demand for real estate is also now so low that construction companies have no choice but to stop their operations.""In the exclusive restaurants and nightclubs along Luanda's beach strip, some wallets still seem to be full after the oil boom.A can of beer costs the equivalent of $12, and the Lookal Mar seafood restaurant, with its views over the Atlantic ocean, offers imported lobster at $200 per kilo.- Reality bites? -Emphasising the country's chronic shortage of foreign currency, Angolans or foreigners who hold dollars are in a powerful position if they brave the illegal street exchange markets.Officially a dollar is worth about 165 kwachas, but on the street it can be exchanged for more than 500 kwachas.Such anomalies suggest further tumult for Angola in the months ahead, and analysts fear the risks are being multiplied by a government that is failing to confront reality.Dos Santos recently surprised many observers when he called off talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a possible loan to ease the current troubles.""The decision puts a big question mark over whether the government realises how deep the need for reform is,"" said Soren Kirk Jensen, a specialist in Angola at the London-based Chatham House think tank.""The government and IMF could identify reforms and ensure their implementation, so it suggests the president has been ill-advised,"" he added, stressing that it would be dangerous to await any recovery in oil prices.""The last decade has been a missed opportunity. There are reports of shops running short on some imported goods. It is a very problematic situation.""bgs/lb/rl"

We have delivered clean and transparent administration, which is why the masses have perceived our rule as their own,"" he said.Listing out some of the major achievements of the BJP government in the two-year rule so far, Danve said farmer-centric schemes, including Rs 4,200-crore aid to mitigate drought, road toll waiver (to a few category vehicles) and empowerment of tribal and Dalits among other backward communities were some of the highlights.""The state government, together with the Centre, had ensured fund flow of Rs 4,200 to fight drought. Organised efforts were taken to ensure sufficient availability of drinking water and fodder, besides offering employment to the needy during water crisis. The newly introduced crop insurance scheme offers benefits more than thrice that of the old one. The flagship water conservation programme, Jal Yukta Shivar, has been endorsed by farmers as well,"" he said.Talking about farmer suicides in Marathwada and other parts of the state, the BJP president said the government has taken necessary steps in the 14 identified districts, including eight from the region, by offering wheat and rice at minimal prices.On the empowerment of backward community, Danve said 25,000 students from tribal communities have been offered quality education by shifting them to good facilities.""Our government also took a range of measures to mark the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. The transfer of Mumbai's Indu Mill land for the world-class memorial named after Ambedkar was our poll promise, which has already been fulfilled. Completing acquisition of Ambedkar's house in London and releasing the commemorative coin dedicated to him are some of the other noteworthy measures,"" he said.About the repeated tension with alliance partner Shiv Sena , the BJP president said there was nothing to read much between the recent developments. ""We are intact as an alliance,"" he said.However, Danve refused to comment over the delay by Shiv Sena in asking its mayoral candidate to step down from the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation and make way for a BJP candidate as per the post-poll arrangement."
58f65de37be9e031f13b35eb,Go beyond buying spree of festivals,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/Go-beyond-buying-spree-of-festivals/articleshow/55003412.cms,2016-10-22,"Trying to grab the newspaper headlines is truly a pain these days. One has to flip over page after page of jacket ads to finally reach the front page. Thanks to the ongoing festive season, corporate majors and advertising consultants are apparently going berserk wooing people with their luring offers. As if these festivals were only about shopping and acquiring every material good on earth that money can buy.Lost in this maze of offers and best deals, is it any wonder even we (leave aside the younger generation) are missing out on the true meaning and symbolism behind our festivals? Most of us appear so consumed by the need to stack up on the latest couture, furnishings, gadgets, automobile or property before Dussehra or Diwali that we lose track of the underlying philosophy behind celebrating these festivals.Given the onslaught of consumerism and the younger generation's disdain for rituals, it was a pleasure to watch a friend's teenage daughter perform an early morning Pushpanjali on Ashtami. Bathed and dressed in her Puja finery, she was among the very few children who were present for the ritual.I think it's a good idea to apprise our children of, and bear in our minds too, the spiritual significance of these festivals. Navaratra and Dussehra signify victory of good over evil, the killing of demon Mahisasur by Goddess Durga. But it's equally important to know these epic legends symbolise the profound analogy that both Goddess Shakti and the demon Mahishasur are actually within us. That is to say, the festival calls for efforts to awaken this Shakti within to purge the inner demons of anger, greed, lust and ego.As children we often used to wonder why we worshipped Goddess Lakshmi on Diwali as we were told it was Lord Ram who returned after 14 years of exile on this day to Ayodhya upon killing demon king Ravan . The festival got its name Deepawali from the rows of earthen lamps that the people of Ayodhya lit to welcome their beloved king.It wasn't until much later I came to know Diwali is also celebrated to mark the incarnation of Goddess Lakshmi, the divine strength of Lord Vishnu whom she married on this darkest night of the year (amavasya).The brilliant lamps placed in rows actually signify our quest to end darkness -- of ignorance and everything negative or evil. Hence the association of Diwali with lights, sharing of sweets and spreading good fortune.Besides educating our youngsters on the profound reasons behind these festivals, we can also convince them to join us in performing some simple rituals. It helps to know most rituals have deep-seated scientific or logical explanations. For instance, offering puffed rice to Goddess Lakshmi signifies prosperity as the Kharif crop is ready for harvest around this time.

He said that as per the latest weekly analysis (August 25-August 31), the region has 42% rainfall deficit.Incessant rainfall followed by a long spell of flood in August had affected the recently sown crops particularly of pulses and rice in low-lying areas, thus causing deficiency of zinc in rice.The excess rainfall caused damage to pulses including pigeon pea, seasame, moong and maize and also irrigated rice crops cultivated in low-lying areas.""We noticed widespread appearance of 'Khaira' disease in rice but the crop damage can still be prevented"", soil scientist and professor at department of soil science and agricultural chemistry department, Institute of Agricultural Sciences, SK Singh told TOI on Wednesday.Sharing the remedy to save the standing crops that have not been completely damaged, Singh said, ""To save the standing crops of rice spray them with a solution of 0.5% zinc sulphate along with 2% urea solution and repeat the procedure after a week. To save other standing crops like pigeon pea not spoiled completely, spray 2% urea solution.""The soil scientists said showers will be beneficial for non-irrigated rice crops. ""Unless there is heavy rainfall, rice crops would not be damaged as maximum areas are still unirrigated and rice has a tendency to sustain water. Moreover, rainfall would benefit the farmers while sowing Rabi crops in October-November as the moisture content in soil would be high which is needed for growth of Rabi crops,"" shared Singh, who is also in-charge of Agriculture Research Farm in BHU."

He added that 886 people had been detained under the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980, on smuggling charges.He said that during the DMK regime, rice and essential commodities were smuggled though ships, trains and in large trucks, and added that the location of the smugglers remained unknown. However, it was only under AIADMK rule that smuggling activities were curbed, he said. ""It is because of the chief minister's firm actions, smuggling has been fully controlled in Tamil Nadu,"" he said. The state's efforts to contain smuggling of essential commodities, especially the setting up of the Civil Supplies Crime Investigation Department (CID) was lauded by the Centre, and other states were asked to implement the same, he said.The opposition raised objections to the minister's remarks. The food minister said that the DMK government had filed cases but against lorry drivers and cleaners, and not the owners, or the real culprits. However, the AIADMK government had taken steps to apprehend the actual culprits, he said.He added that the years when the DMK government was in power, one particular individual was active in the smuggling business, and no case was filed against him. Later, the minister said that the newspaper report was ""baseless"" and asked the DMK leader to submit proof for his allegations.When speaker P Dhanapal gave an opportunity to DMK whip R Sakkarapani to respond, the latter said that the DMK government had taken action against smugglers."

One of them depicts the occasion when the Lord was caned by a Pandya king, for dereliction of duty.Legend has it, that river Vaigai was once flooded and each citizen was asked to perform his civic responsibility by depositing a specified amount of sand on the river bank to prevent the flood waters from entering the land. When Vandhi , an old woman, found it difficult to carry her quota of sand, Lord Shiva appeared before her in the form a loadman. He offered to do her work in return of 'puttu', a dish made of rice flour, that she sold. However, the Lord was caned by the king, who found him resting on the river bank, instead of doing the work.The drama is enacted at Puttuthoppu in Madurai city, on the banks of the river Vaigai every year during the festival when Lord Sundareswarar is brought from the temple to the site of the ritual.The deity is seen carrying a basket made of gold for performing the ritual. Two priests of the temple adorn the role of the Pandya king and Lord Shiva. When the latter goes to sleep on the banks of the river without completing his task, the priest who represents the king canes him with a golden cane.Some of the devotees who gathered at Puttuthoppu to witness the ritual distributed puttu to redeem their vows.The temple remained closed throughout the day, till the deity returned to it on Sunday evening."

Every year, in November and February , burning of agricultural res idue in these states causes severe air pollution in Delhi.According to Climate Foundation India's proposal for the Urban Labs Innovation Challenge, nearly 60 mega tonnes of rice straw is burnt openly annually . Haryana and Punjab comprise 48% of total emissions due to rice straw burning across India. ""During the months rice straw is burned, PM 2.5 (fine, respirable pollution particles) levels commonly exceed 400 parts per million,"" it said.The team at Climate Foundation India proposes to make biochar out of the agricultural residue instead. Inspired by scientist James Lovelock's Gaia theory, which explained how the soil can act as an effective sink for greenhouse gases, Brian's team developed a ""charvester""-an equipment that harvests grain and cuts the straw at the same time.""It can also collect the straw and put it through pyrolysis to make biochar,"" says Herzen, adding that ""the biochar that is rich in carbon can then be buried into the soil where it will remain for thousands of years.This will also improve the soil quality immensely .""His team in Delhi is in talks with the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute (CSSRI) in Karnal for this project. It has also visited villages in Haryana to understand whether farmers will accept the biochar technology . ""CSSRI has already helped address soil salinity in about 2 million acres of land in UP , Haryana and Punjab. An important part of the restoration process was ensuring carbon is put back into the soil. Charvesters are going to do just that.""The organisation had used a similar technology to produce biochar with bi omass waste in Bangalore a few years ago. Says Hitesh Arora, who is based in Delhi, ""We know that biochar can be effectively made from paddy and wheat straw. Our team has already met farmers in Haryana who have expressed interest. Now we will have to demonstrate it and see how the technology can be made affordable for them.""Haryana and Punjab have already prohibited agricultural residue burning under the Air Act. In order to ensure effective enforcement of the law, the Environment Pollution Control Authority has directed state governments to start imposing penalty and prosecution for all incidents of stubble burning through district level special teams, to launch awareness campaigns before the paddy harvesting period, and asked state remote sensing agencies to stay vigilant.Bringing about change, part-IVThe University of Chicago Urban Labs and the Delhi government have announced the finalists of the Urban Labs Innovation Challenge--a competition to find innovative solutions for the Capital's air pollution and energy crisis.

Sources informed that the situation was same in almost 90% of the mills. As a result, industrial effluents were being discharged outside without any treatment. Moreover, collection, storage and disposal management of boiler ash was also found to be handled in unscientific conditions.Massive environmental pollution by rice mills is not new to the district. ""This has been going on since years. Few years ago, when we threatened to issue closure notices to industries, they fell in line but things are now back to square one,"" said a board official who was earlier posted in Gondia.After receiving complaints about polluting rice mills, Gondia district collector Vijay Suryawanshi had directed enquiry into the matter. ""We also had a meeting with board officials to discuss the matter. Mills are causing air as well as water pollution,"" said Suryawanshi.Two months ago, Gondia's additional district collector wrote a letter to MPCB's subregional officer, Bhandara , citing cuttings of a local daily containing news about air and water pollution caused by rice mills in the district, and asked him to send detailed explanation immediately. Following this, MPCB's field officers conducted visit at some mills situated near Wainganga river's basin. TOI learnt that the same industries were issued show cause notices last year for non-compliance of consent conditions. ""Despite this, there has been no improvement. We are now preparing a proposal for action plan which we will get approved from our higher authorities,"" board officials said.Locals informed that instead of properly disposing rice husk ash, mills often dump it anywhere in the open. ""As one enters Gondia, this ashcan be seen dumped on roadside. It blows with wind and is a threat to human health. Many times, the ash is dumped on barren land in the village interiors,"" they said.Board officials said that the ash should ideally be disposed at abandoned mines or landfill sites. ""Studies have proved that the ash also has some fertilizing properties and thus can be used for farming,"" they added.At Parboiled rice industries, pre-treatment is given to paddy to improve nutritional and cooking quality of rice. For every1000kg of paddy, 220-240 kg of husk is produced and when this husk is burned in boilers, about 55-6- kgs (25%) of rice husk ash is generated. Ideally, the husk should be disposed at landfill or construction sites. Some studies also revealed that it has fertilizing properties and can be of use for farmers."

The flowers have shed and the pods formed are too small. The total yield of soyabean is definitely set to take a hit, they said.The joint director of agriculture, Nagpur division, Vijay Ghavate told TOI that except for soyabean not many crops would be affected. soyabean can take a stress of 3-4 weeks but this year due to continuous rains in July farmers didn't get time to do other agriculture operations like weeding etc. However, the JDA of Amravati S Sardar said that except for orange crop at some places all other crops were doing well in Amravati division.The Krishi Vigyan Kendra in-charge in city at Central Institute for Cotton Research D Singandhupe visited some soyabean farms following complaints from the farmers. ""Since the soyabean roots are shallow, the break in rains has had a telling effect on the crop. Soil has cracked all over. The flowers have dropped or the pods are not fully formed. It will decrease the yield substantially,"" he said. Bhandara state agriculture department officer Nalini Bhoyar said that in Bhandara 72% paddy has been transplanted. ""There might not be much effect of less rainfall as there is enough water in the canals, nullahs and in wells,"" she said. Gondia agriculture officer H Chavan said that rice yield may not be badly affected.Archana Kadu, district superintending agriculture officer of Nagpur district, said the soyabean area has decreased but as such there was not much damage to the crop. But this year, the Lashkar Ali or army worms have attacked the crop due to erratic weather conditions, said Kadu.Ramesh Jichkar, MD of Maharashtra Orange Growers Association (MOGA), said that a large number of orange orchards with ambia bahar crop have been severely affected due to excessive rains. There has been about 25% fruit drop. ""Also, koltya, a fungal disease, has affected orange. Though Central Citrus Research Institute (CCRI) has issued guidelines to farmers on using tricoderma etc the suggestions have come very late,"" he said.Jichkar also pointed out that though measures were suggested to tackle koltya at a meeting of directorate of horticulture held in Pune on Saturday, they were all commercially driven.

Out of a total of 400 acres in the Maruvakkadu pokkali paddy collective in Chellanam panchayat, around 260 acres have been identified as cultivable.Of these, only 20 acres came under sowing this year and paddy from 16 acres was harvested late last week in a bid by a dedicated group of people eager to keep the traditional pokkali farming alive for posterity.Pokkali rice cultivation has had a bad season, says Francis Kalathungal of Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti, which has tried to protect the remaining pokkali fields in Alappuzha and Ernakulam districts from totally disappearing. The efforts in the Maruvakkadu panchayat this year stands out because it has come against heavy odds.The rains were scant last season. Pokkali cultivation is totally rain-fed as the fields need to be inundated with rainwater to help drain the salt content in the soil until the sowing takes place.Mr. Francis said the Maruvakkadu farmers used the traditional Chettivirippu variety of pokkali seeds and most of the little yield they received would be dried and stored as seeds for the next season.The Chellanam panchayat authorities have declared that pokkali cultivation would be protected. On the occasion of the harvest of the Maruvakkadu fields, vice president of the panchayat K.D. Prasad said the authorities were duty-bound to solve the problems facing the pokkali farmers in the area.He also said he expected the State to provide protection to the paddy variety, which withstands salt water and flooding. The threat to pokkali rice cultivation has come from the shrimp farmers.The Pokkali Samrakshana Samiti said though the State provided fund for pumping water out of the pokkali fields and for protection of bunds of the fields, the help directly benefited the shrimp farmers rather than the rice cutltivators.Maruvakkadu pokkali paddy collective in Chellanam panchayat fighting odds to preserve the traditional farming"

All he had managed on that occasion was 0 & 3 -combined with 4 & 18 in the previous game at Old Trafford, his two-Test comeback was a disaster, prompting many to write his international career off for good. The left-hander, however, wasn't willing to give in so easily. Those who know him say that while in `exile,' for the last four years, he was disappointed, but not defeated. He continued to introspect and work on his game. Interestingly, he was willing to put the team ahead of his personal cause.As a Delhi skipper, he opted for green tracks, ignoring the advice of his India colleagues to play on flat pitches and make runs to stage a comeback in the Indian team. He made it clear that he didn't want to be selfish, and wouldn't sacrifice the team's cause for his personal cause. In the IPL too, he chose to play on tracks that suited his bowlers and not pitches which would aid slam-bang cricket. The emergence of Murali Vijay, Shikhar and Rahul didn't bother him as he maintained that the only way to beat the competition was by training harder. Looking for an intense workout, he went to Australia and worked with former Australian opener Justin Langer and his personal coach Noddy Holder. Both suggested to him that he should play with a more open stance, so that he could play short-pitched bowling better. To his credit, Gambhir adapted well to this massive change, which is a bit like a golfer changing his swing, and slammed four fifties in the Duleep Trophy.He worked hard on his fitness too, and modified his diet-going completely off carbs, sugar and oily food. It has been almost two years since he hasn't had rice or rotis. Instead of contemplating quitting the sport, Gambhir pressed on the accelerator and made a state-of-the-art indoor batting facility at his home, and a personal gym in Delhi. Even the DDCA doesn't have an indoor batting facility.The Gambhir story, though, isn't so simple. The man is known to have a fiery temper. His clashes with India skipper Virat Kohli (during the IPL in 2013) and Manoj Tiwary (in the last season of the Ranji Trophy) are well-documented. During the last IPL, he kicked a chair in disgust after losing to Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore.It leads one to the question: 'Gambhir ko gussa kyon aata hai?' Those who know him well say that the Delhite's pensive and intense look is just his 'game face.' Off the field, he's extremely jovial and a prankster, something that his teammates vouch for. A close friend of Gambhir stressed that he doesn't have any issues with either MS Dhoni or Kohli.""It's the sheer desire to win at all costs that brought out the conflict between Virat and Gautam. In fact, both he and Virat dined in his Taj Gardenia hotel room the day they fought in Bangalore in 2013, but sadly, these things never get reported. Both admire each other, GG calls Virat 'Cheeks,' while Virat addresses him as 'Bhaiya.' Both love Man United and play stations, and are even currently together in the gym in Indore with Team India trainer Shanker Basu,"" a close friend of Gambhir tells TOI.He also clarified that Gambhir wasn't taking a pot-shot at Dhoni, when he tweeted recently that saying sportspersons didn't deserve to have biopics made on them. The tweet had again triggered speculation that there was a problem between him and Dhoni somewhere. ""He never tweeted against any individual's movie. All he said was that the Indian soldiers deserve a biopic more than a sportsperson. He doesn't feel that MSD was responsible for his exit,"" he says.Another friend describes him as a fierce patriot. ""He's extremely emotional and loves his country to bits. He often says that if he wasn't a cricketer, he would have been in the army. In fact, a couple of years ago, he wanted to join the territorial army."""

However, the smoke-filled air reverberating with the cacophonous din, and the plight of the dogs and the pigeons made her averse to crackers.Ira is in the habit of keeping rice and water in her balcony for the pigeons. Interestingly enough, her mother, Madhurima Das, a research associate at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has not burst a cracker for more than a decade. ""We had a quiet Diwali . Neither I nor my spouse burst crackers. Also, being asthmatic doesn't help. Although the festival gets over, its effects linger for a while. But, I felt that the situation was a tad better this year,"" she said.Across Bengaluru, a large number of citizens made a conscious choice to celebrate a quiet Deepavali . Sarita Gupta, a resident of Malleswaram, said, ""We had a fabulous puja, which was attended by family and friends. We lit mud lamps and placed flowers everywhere in the house. We also wanted to brighten the lives of others and so sent food, sweets and clothes to an orphanage.""Noting a perceptible decline in the amount of crackers burst this year, Sarita added, ""We had a designated area in the building for bursting crackers. The amount of dirt there was much lesser compared to the previous years.""Concurring with the observations made by the residents, officials of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) said that pollution levels were much lesser in comparison to last year.The National Air Quality index, which provides real-time data on air pollution indicated that particulates that could travel deep into the respiratory tract were the prominent pollutants on Sunday. Exposure to these particles could lead to short-term health problems in the eye, nose, lungs and throat. While the maximum level of particulate matter touched 436g/m3 and the average was 11 g/ m3. On Sunday, the carbon-mono-oxide remained the major pollutant, touching 103g/ m3 in the morning. The average CO levels remained at 56g/ m3.Particulate matter was the main pollutant in Peenya, while the air quality index (AQI) was 199 on Saturday. It remained the same on Sunday as well. PM 2.5 levels are commonly used as the best indicator of severe air pollution, while PM 10 particles are a cause of public health concern, but less lethal.In the other air quality monitoring centres, at City Railway Station and SG Halli, particulate matter, CO and Nitrogen Dioxide were the main pollutants over the past three days."

Sadly, in Tamil Nadu, the logic of the Dravidian parties behind providing subsidies is just to win the confidence of the masses  even if it costs the Centre and the state exchequer heavy losses.In 1967, it was the offer of three measures of rice per rupee that catapulted the DMK to power. And over the years rice has been effectively used in the successive elections platforms of both DMK and the AIADMK. With the AIADMK government adopting universal subsidization of rice, the state has around 33,222 public distribution system (PDS) outlets as yet. This despite the fact that the Centre has been incurring hefty losses in procuring rice, wheat and other essential commodities at prices decided by the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices and supplying these to the state governments at highly discounted prices. Further there have been rampant complaints on the quality of items supplied under PDS and that only a small section of people above poverty line avails them. The system also faces a threat of PDS stocks being diverted to the open market.When the UPA government introduced the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 34 states and Union territories fell in line; but not Kerala and Tamil Nadu. These states continued to draw rice and wheat from the Centre at heavily subsidised prices, but sold them on their own terms. Tamil Nadu, for instance, supplied 35 kg of rice free and at `3 per kg for additional supplies to the Antyodaya Anna Yojana card holders. For another 18.63 lakh BPL cardholders, it supplied 20 kg of rice free and additional supplies at `5.65 per kg. For those above poverty line, the state sold rice at `8.30 per kg. The state had a total of around 2 crore cardholders.In the face of such delinquencies, the Centre's recent decision to hike the price of subsidized rice meant for APL families in TN came as a bold step. It is estimated that Tamil Nadu would have had to bear an additional cost of `2,700 crore if it continued to provide subsidised rice to all ration card holders under its existing scheme. The Centre's revision would have further inflated the already hefty food subsidy bill of the state. But the Centre is also in a severe resource crunch  a higher quantum of devolution as per the recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, increase in salaries and pensions as per the 7th Pay Commission, and a decelerated growth in tax revenues demand a sharper focus on subsidies.To avoid the additional cost, the state government has agreed to adhere to NFSA, but with certain modifications. Under the state's revised scheme all rice card holders (around 192 lakh) will be eligible for 5 kg of rice per person per month and rice will continue to be free of cost for all rice card holders. Priority households are estimated to number nearly 97 lakh card holders (3.64 crore people).The state's subsidy largesse leaves little for development expenditure. In the TN's budget three items  salaries and pensions to government employees, subsidies on various welfare measures and debt servicing  cost higher than the total annual revenue receipts. The state mobilises additional resources through public debt and access to multilateral institutions like the World Bank. This essentially means higher cost of debt servicing in the future.It is not as if the UPA leaders were not aware of such abuses. During his tenure as the Union finance minister P Chidamabaram was among the earliest to talk of merit and non-merit subsidies which, he estimated, together accounted for 15% of GDP. He stressed the need for targeting the benefits to the most deserving. He however seemed to forget that when he campaigned along with DMK supremo M Karunanidhi for the 2004 and 2006 elections.It is time the state government learns its lessons and cooperates with the Centre not only in NFSB but in areas like GST too.(The author is a veteran journalist and editor of Industrial Economist)"

But the environment-friendly cultivation is facing heavy odds. The labour-intensive farming is yet to gain the confidence of farmers though government agencies have been trying to draw people to the traditional farming practice.The Pokkali farms at Maruvakkad, situated on the borders of Alappuzha and Ernakulam, present a typical picture of the realities in the sector. The padasekharam (cluster of farms) extends to 400 acres, including fallow land. About 260 acres is suitable for Pokkali farming, but only 20 acres are under cultivation now, says Francis Kalathungal, head of the Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi, an organisation formed to protect the interests of farmers.The State had about 25,000 acres of Pokkali fields 15 years ago.The area has reduced to one-third now and cultivation is taken up in a few hundred acres on a regular basis, says Mr. Kalathungal.'Government incentives are not reaching the farmer on time. People are more interested in aquaculture than Pokkali farming because of higher returns, he says.Conflict of interests between paddy farmers and an aquaculture lobby has resulted in counterproductive measures, according to him. Salty water has to be pumped out to prepare the fields, but breaches in outer bunds occur at times raising doubts of sabotage. Coordinated action by the police, Revenue and Agriculture departments is required to thwart such attempts, he says.The government is offering a minimum support price of Rs.50 a kg of Pokkali paddy. The private sector is ready to buy Pokkali rice at Rs.150 a kg, but the current production is not enough to meet the domestic and foreign demand.The Agency for Development of Aquaculture (ADAK), a government agency, offers schemes to support the twin farming pattern, but the sector is plagued by scarcity of labour and poor mechanisation. Though transplantation is successfully done recently, non-availability of machines would pose problems.ADAK has a project to cultivate Pokkali in 300 hectares 100 hectares each in Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts  during a four-year period.Farmers needed to be convinced of the back end subsidy, and there was some hesitation initially, U.S. Sajeev, head of the organisation, says.ADAK gives equal importance to aquaculture and Pokkali farming as it is mutually beneficial, he says with an air of expectation.Experts want the government to deploy workers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme in the fields. But there is a similar demand from the aquaculture sector also, worsening the conflict of interests with the proponents of Pokkali farming."

But when it comes to producing rice, it has fallen behind the national average despite the area under paddy cultivation being more than other states.Over the last decade the all-India average of rice production stands at more than 2,000 kg/hectare (kg/ha). In the same period Odisha has steadily increased its production from 1,554 kg/ha in 2005-06 to 2,361 in 2012-13. But over the past few years the number has started declining. In 2013-14 the yield was 1,821 kg/ha while in 2015-16 it had dipped to 1,491 kg/ha from 1,989 in 2014-15.Explaining the change, agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy said in a written reply in the assembly recently: ""Odisha faces natural calamities like drought, cyclone, flood and untimely rain almost every year. Despite all odds, there was a gradual growth in rice production every year due to a number of steps taken by the state government. Effort is on to match the national average.""The reason for the sharp decline in production in 2015-16 was attributed to drought-like situation in as many as 27 of the 30 districts, official figures revealed. Over 200 farmers allegedly committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden though the state government claimed that most of the deaths were due to other reasons.Asked about the low yield despite paddy being cultivated in two-thirds of the total cultivable land, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor of OUAT S N Pasupalak said: ""Factors like low mechanization, poor nutrient management, structure of land and low irrigation potential are responsible for low production of rice in the state.""Among all districts, Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, stands at the top in producing highest amount of rice constantly for past 10 years. Other districts like Boudh, Dhenkanal, Nabarangapur, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur and Sundargarh have been recording high production of rice for past two years.Despite drought in 2015-16, Jagatsinghpur and Bhadrak produced 2,571 kg/ha and 2,505 kg/ha, respectively, among the highest in the country.""For increase in productivity, Odisha has been promoting modern methods like system of rice intensification (SRI), practice of multiple crops, soil testing, supplying quality seeds and augmenting irrigation potential,"" said an officer in the agriculture department.A number of centrally-sponsored schemes like National Food Security Mission, Bringing Green Revolution in Eastern India, National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology, National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana are being implemented in the state to increase the agriculture productivity.Odisha has been winning successive krishi karman awards among category-II states for record foodgrain production.According to sources in the directorate of economics and statistics, states like West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab are ahead of Odisha in rice production.."

The test results for the grains are expected this week.PMC has cancelled their contracts and blacklisted them. The groups would not be allowed to participate in the scheme again.PMC officials said that an offence was initially registered against one such group in Bhavani Peth. After that, investigations were carried out and revealed the scam. Nearly 1,155kg of rice was sold in the open market.The civic body supplies rice at Rs 3.86 per 100g for students of Classes I to V and at Rs 5.86 per 150g for students from Class VI to VIII. Around 168 city-based SHGs are registered under the urban community development department of PMC. They shoulder the responsibility of running the scheme.A senior official of PMC confirmed this and said, ""Yes, we have taken action against the erring SHGs. Their registration with PMC stands cancelled.""""The administration has seized the rice grains. They have been sent for testing. The results are awaited. We are expecting them in a couple of days,"" the education board's head, Vasanti Kakde, said.She said that the group members were summoned to the board office for an inquiry. After prima facie report, the board has asked the groups to stop their work. Other SHGs have replaced them. The test results will identify the ""source of rice grain confiscated in the raids"" and if they were taken from the quota provided by the state government.The scheme has been in the news here for wrong reasons earlier too. The umbrella organisation SHGs had allegedly demanded a bribe for releasing payments for mid-day meals. The standing committee of PMC had ordered an inquiry into the alleged corruption.Citizen activists claim that the financial powers of the board must be taken away.""This is not the first scam of its kind. Every now and then some scam comes up. The key problem is that the board has the rights to issue a contract. It should be curtailed,"" Vishwas Sahastrabuddhe , member of citizens' organisation Sajag Nagrik Manch , said.He added that a system of rate contract must be introduced in the board. ""Materials purchased by the board must be bought on a fixed-rate basis. These rates can be calculated on the basis of the state government's rate or market survey,"" Sahastrabuddhe said.""The PMC administration or commissioner office should carry out a tender process. It will reduce third-party interference,"" he said.As per PMC data, the board wants to spend an extra Rs 36 crore on education in the next financial year. The education board has submitted a Rs 377-crore budget proposal for 2017-2018. The budget for the current fiscal is Rs 341 crore and it was Rs 286 crore in 2015-16. The board has not proposed many new schemes, but emphasised on the augmentation of facilities at schools.""Many corporate houses are giving funds for board activities. They can be involved in the process of mid-day meal. Their participation can help in improving the overall management of food production and distribution system. It will also reduce political interference and reduce corruption,"" a PMC official said.The school education board of PMC has started a special CSR centre at the education board office in Shivajinagar. The school board had set up the CSR wing in 2014 to coordinate with the CSR cells of IT and automobile industries to involve them in civic schools. The cell helps in procuring educational material for students from corporate houses in cash or kind.The civic body and its corporate social responsibility wing have planned the model school project where modern teaching facilities, limited number of students in a class and better education infrastructure would be developed in some schools.The civic body runs 320 schools in Marathi, English and Urdu mediums, where more than one lakh students study. They get educational material and uniforms from the civic administration. In 2013, the civic body had announced a scheme providing free bicycles for students studying between standard VII and standard X."

Similar were the cases of fumes emanating from fish or of plastic rice entering the market or dye being injected into watermelons.Unfortunately, all such reports reached the electronic media and certain sections of the print media, almost confirming peoples fears over instances they saw first on social media.However, why the same social media or the mainstream media did not give much space to reports exposing the hoax remains unclear. The same media which spread the hoax earlier should take the responsibility of clearing the air, believe people with scientific authority and temperament.Ordinary people are misguided by such videos and news, says Thomas Biju Mathew, professor and head of the pesticide laboratory of the Kerala Agricultural University. He was involved in a series of tests regarding the Chinese eggs and other issues. The social media, instead of complementing our lives, is now almost a disease, he adds.Dr. Mathew takes a serious view of the fake news spreading through the media and says the government should come up with some cyber law to tackle the problem because it is a crime to create fear and confusion. There are methods to zero in on persons spreading unverified news regarding prominent persons. The methods should be utilised to find the source of fake news as well, he adds.The government has facilities to check any aspect of food adulteration and contamination, and Food Safety offices and inspectors are available in all districts. People should alert Food Safety officials if any such issue occurs in their locality or if they come across a message or news warning of such dangers, says K.V.

Both also seem trend driven and of the moment.Kitchen Garden, the new urban caf from the folks behind Suzette, translates healthy eating into an expansive salad bar and a menu that uses 90 per cent organic produce to prepare salads, smoothies and sandwiches.212 All Good, a new clean eating restaurant at Phoenix Mills, takes a different tack. Here you can get a cocktail, a snack or a meal made of ingredients sourced locally. There are also substitutes for everything from cola to ketchup.The motivationJeremie Sabaggh, one of the three partners behind the Kitchen Garden, says, We wanted to do something like a Subway, but with good ingredients. Romil Ratra, Group Director, Bellona Hospitality, says the impetus for 212 All Good was people realising there are huge benefits in eating the right stuff without compromising the meal experience. Without saying, I cant eat this. Fried is not bad. Cheese is not bad. It is like, alcohol is not bad. How do we make it better so that theres less guilt at the end of everything?The original idea for 212 All Good came from Deepti Dadlani, who heads marketing at Bellona. She says, Theres this whole other conversation where you can say what you eat is how you feel, and what you are.The scale of the undertaking cant be experienced in a single dish, though the Andaman Island Tuna Poke Bowl gives you a fair idea of the complexities involved: from sourcing and transporting fish from the Andamans to substituting traditional rice for red rice, to serving it with lightly fermented carrots. Seven months of intensive research have gone into formulating recipes for everything from soda to bread.The same can be said of the devotion put into sourcing the produce at Kitchen Garden. The crockery has been brought from Vietnam the bread is as a crusty sourdough is airy and moist (the breads are organic). The kitchen turns out only 20 loaves a day, though that is set to expand. Also on the menu is ciabatta bread, though not the flaky croissants that are available at Suzette. This is in keeping with the healthy focus of Kitchen Garden, where even the bread is made from three ingredients: wheat and rye flour, salt and water.Sabaggh says, I started attending bread classes in France in 2012, working on baguettes and everything like croissants for Suzette. And then I did some internships in Paris. This led to a second internship in Paris with a baker who is totally crazy guy, very passionate and working only with sourdough. Its this tutelage that has led to the sourdough that is served at the restaurant.Ratra and Sabaggh are committed to the quality of their product. Sabaggh says, With Kitchen Garden, the idea is to do something more urban, maybe a bit more young. More international, less French. Where we can do something like soba noodles, that we are doing here, or ciabatta breads or twisted hummus or have some edamame, or veggies, which were not exactly, fitting our Suzette concept.That said, there are some things from Suzette that theyre carrying over. The reason why we kept the by Suzette [label] is that we want people to know that this is the same way of making things, always from scratch, using organic products, never using shortcuts to make food, no artificial flavours, no ready-made stuff. We dont have ready-made stuff, I dont like that.Good for your gutThe focus of the food at 212 All Good is that it should be good for your gut. The team has worked on fermentation of vegetables as well as things like kefir, a fermented milk drink made with yeast. Tacos, all-day breakfast, salads are available for a dining experience that is similar to the one you would have at any of the malls other eateries, but with ingredients that are free from preservatives.Both restaurants work with suppliers to bring farm fresh ingredients to their customers. At Kitchen Garden, cherry tomatoes to cheeses are supplied from a farm in Gujarat. The vegetables, grains and meats are brought from farmers in Maharashtra and close by. If it is not possible to get quality ingredients locally, for example Haas avocados, Parmesan cheese, its imported.At 212 All Good, everything is sourced locally, be it cheese, fish or vegetables. Salmon was dropped from the menu as it could not be sourced from the country. Behind the bar, tetrapacks of juice have been banished in favour of freshly squeezed juices and even bitters are being made in-house.If this signals anything, it is that city consumers are looking to eat out, but not at the expense of their health. Sabaggh sums it up, What we discovered also from clients in Mumbai is that people really know what they want, and they like to experiment.Both restaurants offer something for everyone: catering to diets that range from vegan to keto to gluten free. And perhaps more innovatively, to those that arent on a diet; rather just choosing to watch what they eat.The author is a freelance writerTo make a reservation at Kitchen Garden, Bandra West; Call 26459775212 All Good opens on October 17 at High Street Phoenix; Call 62216020/ 8655012212"

This is the season when they get to forge food security through cultivation of jowar (sorghum) and chana (chickpea or Bengal gram).The most extensive rabi cultivation, takes place in Nirmal district with 28,782 hectare out of a total of 71,631 hectare with Mancherial being a distant second at 15,200 hectare and Adilabad and Kumram Bheem following in that order with 14,733 hectare and 12,816 hectare. As Nirmal is by far the most developed district in terms of irrigation, it has more farmers going in for the second crop and the area is likely to increase this season thanks to the fully recharged groundwater reserves.Jowar was once the staple diet of Adivasis and other poor people in the erstwhile Adilabad district but it has been replaced by rice thanks to the supply of the subsidised variety through the public distribution system. The cultivation of jowar has come down drastically since the last two decades but it still remains a favourite with people in these parts. Jowar accounts for 11,159 hectare and chickpea for 14,604 hectare in these districts. While much of jowar cultivation is concentrated in Kumram Bheem district, more area under chana crop falls in Adilabad district.According to independent estimates the total yield of jowar from the 6,450 hectare cultivated in Kumram Bheem district would be about 2.5 lakh quintals. This definitely takes care of the needs of the 1.1 lakh tribal population inhabiting the mandals of Wankidi, Kerameri, Asifabad, Jainoor, Sirpur (U), Tiryani and Bejjur, to quote a few.Adilabad district has the highest normal area of 8,903 hectare under chana cultivation concentrated mostly in Jainad, Bela, Ichoda, Bazarhatnoor mandals. The good rainfall in monsoon usually results in early morning dew which helps the chickpea grow. The Agriculture department has made preparations for supply of required quantum of seeds on subsidy to farmers for the forthcoming season. Its action plan includes supply of a total of 45,730 quintals for Rabi."

India was home to over one lakh rice varieties till around 1960s.The emphasis on high-yielding varieties led to the disappearance of the traditional ones and now only a few thousand traditional varieties are believed to be in existence.This was one of the greatest genetic losses of the planet. The saving grace is that individual farmers and some social organisations across India are putting efforts to conserve the traditional rice varieties, says Bandaru Naresh of Sumaja Eco Wellness of Vizag.About a dozen traditional varieties of rice were put up on display at the Rice Mela, organised by Sumaja Eco Wellness, an organic shoppe, on the eve of World Food Day at its outlet Pandurangapuram on Saturday.The black rice from Burma is known for its high amount of antioxidants that prevent cancer. It also has the highest amount of iron and zinc. It is now grown in Wayanad and Mysore. It also helps control diabetes, he says.Navara rice has been identified to possess anti-carcinogenic properties. It has an important place in the Ayurvedic system for treatment. It is said to cure circulatory, respiratory, digestive and nervous system ailments. Navara rice is grown in Palakkad in Kerala. Boiled Navara rice is a good weaning food for infants, particularly those with low weight and broth made by adding Navara to meat is recommended for pregnant women as it increases the weight of the foetus.Rajamudi, red rice variety, was grown exclusively for the royal family of Mysore Wodeyars. Bamboo rice is obtained from the seeds of bamboo flowers.Bamboos bloom once in 40 to 60 years and often die after flowering. This variety is not commonly available as it takes many years for an aged plant to flower. Bamboo rice is said to have high nutritive value as also rich medicinal values.Studies conducted on the Kani tribes in the Kanyakumari forests have shown they consume bamboo rice for its fertility enhancing properties. This variety has higher protein content than both normal rice and wheat, controls joint pain, lowers cholesterol levels and has anti-diabetic properties.Sumaja, which has outlets at Gopalapatnam, Seethammadhara and Pandurangapuram, sources its products mostly from farmer cooperatives and reputed research institutes from across the country."
