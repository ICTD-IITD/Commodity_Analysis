The department found that most of the firms, from which he had showed the purchases, either did not file the returns or filed nil returns implying that they did not issue any bills to him.In an order dated August 5, excise and taxation officer-cum-designated officer, Kapurthala, Baljit Kaur mentioned that in the tax assessment for the financial year 2007-08 then ETO on February 9, 2011, had ordered recovery of over Rs 64 lakh from Aggarwal's firm.""The main contention for raising the additional demand by the designated officer was that this dealer had availed wrong ITC on purchases made from cancelled dealers or dealers who have wither not filed their returns or filed nil returns,"" the recent order said. It also reproduced list of 19 dealers from whom purchase transactions of worth over Rs 3.34 crores were shown.After the 2011 order, Aggarwal filed an appeal before district excise and taxation officer (DETC) and VAT tribunal, who remanded the case for re-assessment back to the ETO. Latter now again assessed the case and also confronted Aggarwal with the documents and records procured by the department from different places, which showed that there were no actual transactions.Out of these ""purchase transactions"" of over RS 3.34 crore only those worth Rs 15.54 lakh could be verified. The ETO in her order also mentioned that verification of transactions with a particular company were verified from a bank and it was found that even as Aggarwal's firm deposited the money in the account of M/s Sandeep Rice and General Mill, Ferozepur and latter withdrew the amount to show genuineness of the transactions but TIN of M/s Sandeep had already been cancelled on April 18, 2006.The ETO also found that perusal of the VAT-20 it was detected that the dealer (Aggarwal's firm) had managed to change the data in the return because the data fed in the computer system differed from the data in the VAT-20. The ETO rejected the VAT-20 and took the data fed in the computer for assessment.While tax due has been computed to over Rs 20.28 lakh, the department has also levied 200% penalty and interest for 106 months, after which the total demand notice raised to over RS 95.49 lakh.However, when contacted, Aggarwal said that he was facing these issues due to political conspiracies by a group of BJP leaders. ""The department is working under pressure and we shall go in appeal against the order,"" he said."

58f66fca7be9e031f13b4cbf,Here is how vegetarianism changed our lives,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/Here-is-how-vegetarianism-changed-our-lives/articleshow/54622448.cms,2016-10-01,"You must be so starved, eating just fruits and leaves"" would be a common reaction 'newly converted' vegetarians face, on revealing their diet choice.But not only are they happy with their new food choices, going vegetarian is becoming a lifestyle for many Malayali youngsters, who are welcoming the healthy changes in their minds and even attitudes towards life. On World Vegetarian Day , we speak to a few newbie veggies in town to learn more about what it is like to become one.For Kochi-based yoga practitioner Sudakshna Thampi, who joined the vegetarian bandwagon a year ago, vegetarianism has impacted her mind the most. ""The past one year has been a life changing journey for me. Vegetarian food is lighter, more sattvik, karmically better, good for nature and animals as well. Mindful eating is the best way to eat appropriately and I have become more mindful now. I am aware about the food I have on my plate and know how it tastes and smells, its texture and how I feel after consuming it. Turning vegetarian has been the best decision of my life,"" she says.Karthika Nair, a vegetarian by choice for the past two years, doesn't shy away from saying that she owes her recent success to the veggie diet that she follows. Karthika bid good bye to her long-time digestion issues after turning a vegetarian two years back. ""My job demanded a lot of travel and I used to suffer from acidity, stomach upset and digestion problems all through. My career was at stake and that is when I opted to be a vegetarian. The results were magical. I am perfectly healthy now and haven't consulted a doctor for a year. I also used to get issues like joint pains, body aches and also eye sight issues. But after being a vegetarian, my sight is improving and my doctor even said I can go for a laser surgery now. What more do I need to go green?"" she asks. Karthika has now become an advocate of vegetarianism, and many of her friends are also trying out a vegetarian diet to see the transformation for themselves.Kasaba actress Neha Saxena who had an on-and-off relationship with vegetarianism says her diet keeps her fresh and beautiful. ""If you ask me what foods I prefer? I will always say leafy vegetables, cereals, pulses and fruits. It purifies the blood. Carrots are good for the eyes, green veggies keeps my hair healthy and my skin glowing. I also avoid masalas as much as possible,"" she says.According to Neha, a meat-free diet also keeps one physically and mentally more energetic. ""I don't feel exhausted during back-to-back shoots, after I added raw vegetables to my diet,"" she adds.You are what you eat', they say, and that is what Ashwini Prem goes by. Ashwini and family are now vegetarians and she says there has been a drastic change in the family's approach towards other living beings and life in general. ""Five years back when I met my husband he was a pakka non-vegetarian. But now he is a pure vegetarian and there is a huge transformation in his behaviour. He has become more compassionate, spiritual and sensitive. Not only him, our maid and driver too have joined the cause and admit that they have become more empathetic towards both animals and human beings. It also amplifies your patience levels,"" she adds.Ashwini describes their lives as full of happiness and positivity now. ""The word vegetarian comes from the Latin word Vegetus which means full of vitality, vigour and cheer. Plant foods signify peace and harmony; are soothing and cleansing and instill positivity in you. Meat spells death, blood, harm, pain and foul smells, all of which gives you negativity,"" she says.Vegetables are rich in antioxidants. They neutralise free radicals in the body and prevent a lot of lifestyle illness. Different antioxidants bring different benefits to the body; while some boost our immune system, others benefit the skin, eyes, memory problems, moods etc. To be more specific, beta-carotene is good for the eyes, iycopene for prostate health and proanthocyanidin for the urinary tract.However, when a full blown non-vegetarian opts for a vegetarian diet, they should take care to add protein substitutes as well. Only in animal proteins do we get complete proteins which have all the mild amino acids. Soya beans are the best substitute for protein. Combination foods like idly/dosa and sambar provide the benefits for cereals and pulses. And also while making flour batter for chappati, use water with boiled dal. Vegetarians should also take substitutes for Vitamin D and B12 following a rainbow diet - including vegetables of all colours. Have lots of legumes, pulses, cereals, green leaves and fruits!-Mumtaz Khalid Ismail, clinical nutritionistMeanwhile, does the taste of non-veg side dishes stop you from turning a vegetarian? There are many who have been saying that even though they want to follow a vegetarian diet, they find it really tough to replace the taste of fried chicken, fish and beef that dominate their taste buds.

Patil committee appointed by the High Court of Karnataka to look into malnourishment of children and pregnant women, the State government had introduced the practice of supplying mixture of locally available tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar.This not only helped improve the health of malnourished children admitted in the anganwadis but also of pregnant women.However, she said, the State government changed the nutrient food supplied to anganwadis by introducing a mixture of ragi, soya and wheat payasa, rice kheer, navadanya kheer, multigrain chapatti flour, and others.Although these mixtures were highly nutrient, people of the region, particularly children and pregnant women, were not used to eating ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food.Children in the anganwadis rejected the ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food. Pregnant women too did not use these nutrients supplied to them in their houses.She said that the intake in anganwadis also came down sharply after the new nutrients were supplied to children.Ms. Patil demanded that the government revert to the old nutrients consisting of tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar. She also demanded that the government not use the services of anganwadi workers for any work other than maintenance of children in the anganwadis."

MOHANThe idea of protecting the biodiversity-rich Kattampally wetland area spread over six panchayats and parts of the Kannur Corporation as a community reserve is an answer to the practical difficulties involved in declaring some migratory bird sites in the area as a protected sanctuary. The proposed community reserve at Kattampally is an initiative launched by the Forest Department as an alternative to the earlier proposal for declaring Munderikkadavu that formed part of the Kattampally wetland area as a bird sanctuary. The entire wetland area is known for its brackish water rice and prawn cultivation system (kaipad farming in local parlance).A one-day workshop on the new proposal was held here on January 2 to secure the support of local environmental activists, farmers, land owners in the area and local panchayats for the new initiative.The proposal for community reserve has been mooted in the wake of the demand from environmental activists and bird watchers that Munderikkadavu be declared as a bird sanctuary, said A.P. Abdullakutty, MLA. The proposal followed a realisation that the entire wetland had to be protected with the involvement of local people and local bodies, he added.Much of the Kattampally wetland area located in Chirakkal, Narath, Kolachery, Chelora, Mundery and Kuttyattoor panchayats and Puzhathi and Elayavur areas of the Kannur Corporation is owned by farmers.The entire area is biodiversity-rich and it is kaipad farming system that supports the bird habitat there, said Dineshan Cheruvat, Joint Director of Fisheries (North Zone). It is also not practical to declare one location as bird habitat, without measures to conserve the entire wetland area, he added.According to Forest officials, the plan is to constitute a committee with representatives of the panchayats and of the Forest Department as a mechanism to ensure the conservation of the area.The community reserve proposal means no government takeover of land, said Khaleel Chovva, environmental activist. The wetland is rich in migratory birds and has all the characteristics of being declared as a Ramsar site, he added."

The food products are not only easy to use, but are also delicious.This is the first-of-its-kind programme in the state to address malnutrition among children. Four months ago, the institute began distributing 7 nutritious foods to the children in 13 anganwadis in Hegdalli, Ramapura and Chamalapurada Hundi villages of Nanjangud taluk.The department of women and child development had recently found that the district has about 329 severely malnourished children, of which 100 were in 13 anganwadis in the taluk. CFTRI developed advanced 7 nutritious products - rice mix, high-protein rusk, energy food, nutria chikki with spirulina, nutria sprinkle, sesame paste and fortified mango bar - containing macro and micro nutrients.Geetha Lakshmi, child development project officer of Nanjangud taluk, who is overseeing the project, said: ""After we added these nutritious foods along with regular menu comprising different types of sprouts and milk (given under Ksheera Bhagya), there has been a positive change in the children's health. Malnourished children gained weight and their resistance power (immunity) has also improved. Children who used to fall sick regularly are doing fine now. CFTRI's new range and the government-sponsored Ksheera Bhagya are playing an important role in improving the health of these children.""Ahead of launching the programme, anganwadi workers and parents were educated about the project. A year ago, Nanjangud district had 710 malnourished children, 270 in the taluk alone. But now, their number in the district has dropped to 310 (it is 99 in Nanjangud taluk). The food provided by CFTRI has also ensured good student strength in anganwadis too with the dropout rates coming down. ""There is more than 50% attendance,"" she claimed.""The performance of malnourished children will be reviewed after six months. The impact of the programme on their health will also be assessed. If found successful, the food products will be served to malnourished children in the district,"" said Radha, deputy director of women and child welfare department. The six-month pilot project will end in August."

The larvae scrap the leaf tissue, leaving only the papery upper epidermis. When one looks at the crop, there is characteristic leaf damage with horizontal rows of green material giving a ladder like appearance. The larvae wrap themselves in the cut tips of the leaves and these cases are seen on the sides of leaves or float in water, sources said.The adult caseworm has white wings with pale brown spots; while caterpillars are pale green but the head is orange.The female deposits 50 eggs singly on the leaves of rice and grasses which hatch in two to six days. The larva lives in a tubular case and is completely grown in 14 to 20 days. It becomes a pupa inside the leaf case which remains attached to the base of the tillers. The adult emerges from the pupa in four to seven days.

""It hasn't sunk in yet. Each time I hear somebody else say it, I feel the same excitement and happiness. It is surreal. I just remember Urvashi Rautela being happier than me while passing on the crown to me. It was like we both won,"" she says. Roshmitha was completely surprised when the results were announced as she's the sort of person who works towards the outcome, but keeps her expectations low. ""I knew I had given my best, but did not expect too much. The journey wasn't easy, but I did not lose hope and my confidence kept growing.""There is this Bengaluru magic in the air now. It makes us happy and immensely proud that we are from Karnataka. Also, now we will be together for a year in the same house, and eat South Indian food. Of course, relocating to Mumbai will be difficult because I have lived with parents all my life. Let's see how it goes.In school (Sophia High School), I was a quiet girl, but I came out of my shell in college (Mount Carmel College) and took part in cultural fests. Both institutions played a big role in shaping me. I loved the moral science classes, during which they spoke about our behaviour. I always remember being a good kid and following rules and regulations from an early age. I don't understand the is perception about bad girls having the most fun. It is good to be a good girl and it is not boring. I think discipline and the art of listening helped me.I performed all the tasks  be it dancing, ramp walk or any other thing  with grace and confidence. Though I am an introvert, I was outspoken when I needed to be and voiced my views loud and clear.Her sister Rakshitha being an influence Rakshitha, who is two years younger than me, took part in Miss India 2015 and was in the top 10. That inspired me to get into this pageant. Though I would love to pass my crown to her next year, I want her to come back to the stage only after improving certain things.I've always followed a very simple exercise regime and diet plan. I work out every alternate day and do not overeat. It helps that I have a good metabolism, but I do not take it for granted and hog. Of course, now that the Miss Universe pageant, in which I will represent India, is in four months, I will be working out in full swing as we need to have good bodies. I have four months to prepare and I hope to improve myself holistically. I also hope to improve my Hindi, which has already became better since I went to Mumbai. But during the transformation, I don't want to lose the parts of myself that made me win Miss Diva. I just hope I get to eat rice and sambar once a day at least.Once, during high-tea, judge Lara Dutta gave us tips on what a true diva is all about and that was beautiful. I also enjoyed late-night swims with the girls. After the whole day, we used to go to the pool after midnight and chill. It was the most relaxing time for us. I also remember the time spent with my friends Sophia Singh, Natasha Bharadwaj and Srishti. I also waved at Amitabh Bachchan and he waved back, which made my day.I will focus on Miss Universe right now. As for Bollywood , not everyone is approached with an offer. If I do get a movie, I'd love to do it; otherwise I won't enter the field as I do not think it is my cup of tea. Ten years down the line, I want to be an entrepreneur and be seen not on the cover of a fashion magazine, but on a business magazine."

Once the park is established, production of shirts is expected to go up to 500 per day from the current 200 pieces per day, said Ms. Thomas. The launch of the garments cluster in 2007 has given a big impetus to the garments business in an around Angamaly with the cluster members sourcing large stocks of raw materials from places Ahmedabad, Surat and Mumbai and supplying them to the garments units.

Pet taluk in Mandya district on Friday.Rice mills in Mandya district appear to have turned into a safe haven for illegal hoarding of millets.The Department of Food and Civil Supplies raided about 10 rice mills here since January 3 and unearthed clandestine activities of purchasing millets from farmers at low prices and storing it in rice mills. About 23,000 bags of millets of 50 kg each and estimated to be worth about Rs. 2.41 crore were seized during the raid.Of them, 10,000 bags of millets were seized from Adilakshmi Rice Mill at Pee Hosahalli in Srirangapatna taluk, 3,000 bags from Sri Siddeshwara Rice Mill at Gorawale, and 2,650 bags from Sri Jayashankara Rice Mill at Kiragandur.We have also seized millet bags from Keregodu, Gorawale, Shankarapura, Chikkabyadarahalli, Sollepura, Kapanahalli Gavimath and other places in the district, Kumuda Sharath, Deputy Director of Food and Civil Supplies Department, told The Hindu.Ms. Sharath suspected that traders had illegally stocked the millet bags to sell them to government.The Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Ltd. (KFCSC) had recently established 165 paddy and millet procurement centres across the State. Of them, seven were in Mandya district alone.The objective was to enable distressed farmers to get remunerative price for their produce. The price of millets varies between Rs. 15 a kg and Rs. 17 a kg in direct market and the KFCSC is offering Rs. 21 a kg.A majority of uneducated and small farmers are unaware of the MSP scheme. Illegal hoarders might have purchased millets from such farmers to sell it for MSP, Ms. Sharath said.The secret and systematic storage of millets has exposed a well-organised and well-planned network of traders. According to a revenue official, owing to the easy road connectivity and lack of proper monitoring, traders from neighbouring districts are preferring rice mills here for illegal storing of millets.Meanwhile, no complaints have been filed against the rice mill owners concerned.We have sought reports from tahsildars concerned. Once the reports reach us, we will register first-information reports (FIR) against the mill owners, Ms. Sharath said.The department is also contemplating of recommending the authorities concerned to cancel the licences of the rice mills."

A farmer displays the order in his field near Ambur. Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyThe delay in settling dues for sugarcane crushed last season has left hundreds of farmers in dismay. Financially hit, the sugarcane farmers say they are in no position to take up cutting this season.Like the Vellore Cooperative Sugar Mill at Ammundi, the Ambur mill too has not settled the dues for sugarcane supplied last crushing season. With the price per tonne last year being Rs. 2,550, farmers registered with the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said the mill is yet to pay Rs. 300 per tonne till date.The Ambur mill has issued cutting order for the forthcoming crushing season. But farmers said they do not have the money to pay for labourers for cutting the cane, and cannot borrow as they were already facing mounting debts.Ramamoorthy, a farmer in Kammavanpettai said, I supplied 150 to 160 tonnes of sugarcane to the Ambur mill last season. I am yet to receive the pending amount of Rs. 300 per tonne. This year, I have raised sugarcane on more than 1.5 acres of land but how can I bear the cutting cost for labourers without the dues being settled?Farmers said that they will have to pay Rs. 450 to Rs. 500 per tonne for labourers as cutting cost. Apart from this, they will have to give one kilo rice and Rs. 25-30 for cooking for each labourer. While the government bears the transportation cost, the farmers said they end up paying the lorry driver at least Rs. 600 to Rs. 700. Our family has been supplying sugarcane for the mill for close to 30 years but this is the first time that the dues have not been settled for nearly a year. In the previous season, the pending amount was settled in six months, he added.D. Kumaran, another sugarcane farmer, had supplied 110 tonnes of sugarcane last season. The mill officers told us that the bills will be settled before Pongal but nothing has happened till now, he said.It is a different problem for another farmer, K. Anbazhagan of Saduperipalayam in Tiruvannamalai district, who had supplied 60 tonnes of cane last season. The mill had diverted the cane to another mill and I am yet to receive the full payment, he said.There are farmers who had borrowed up to Rs. 1 lakh to meet the cutting cost, and had also taken the governments interest-free loan for planting. As the dues have not been settled, the farmers could not repay the loans on time. The interest rate has shot up to 14 per cent now, he said.An official of the Ambur Cooperative Sugar Mill said at a Minister level meeting, it was said that the dues will be settled before Pongal."

GovarthanRunaway success in experimental animal feed production has brightened prospects for the Amma Pannai Mahalir Kuzhu at Vellivalasu to transform into full-fledged entrepreneurs.That the group with 20 members, who do the production work themselves, has clocked turnover of Rs. 62 lakh comes in as no surprise since there are buyers for the entire 50 tonnes produced a month at a rented building for which they pay a monthly rent of Rs. 5,000.They had a confident start after receiving training at the Animal Feed Analytical and Quality Control Laboratory attached to Veterinary College and Research Institute, Namakkal.They have named the brand Chinnamman-periyamman after their traditional deity. The Kuzhu was among 32 such farm women groups initiated in the district during November 2014.The feed is sold at a competitive rate of Rs. 15.80 a kg and hence the demand. The consumer network was created with the support of other farm women groups and cooperative milk societies, said Kulandaivelu, Assistant Director of Agriculture, Modakurichi Block.The samples are tested regularly for validating the right ratio of inputs -- rice bran, groundnut cake, minerals mixture, black gram husk, jaggery, bajra, maize, sorgam, palm cake, cotton seed, common salt, red gram husk, and bengal gram husk.The customers have responded positively saying the milk yield has increased by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.Though the formula is uniform for all branded animal feed, the women group is able to offer their product for a few rupees lesser per kg since the overheads is low on account of own labour.In all probability, the Vellivalasu group that has invested Rs. 15 lakh by itself for the venture will qualify for the State Innovative Scheme that would entitle it for substantial subsidy benefit, Mr. Kulandaivelu said."

The decision, first reported by The Hindu , would hit Tamil Nadu hard, he added.In a statement, Mr. Ramadoss said, Out of 2.03 crore families in Tamil Nadu, close to 1.91 crore families receive free rice. Though all of them receive rice, it is procured at different rates from the Central government. The State government buys a kilogram of rice for very poor families, those below the poverty line and above the poverty line at Rs. 3, Rs. 5.65 and Rs. 8.30 per kg, respectively. Now, the Centre is all set to raise the price of rice distributed to those above poverty line to Rs. 22.54 per kg.Arguing that this move would put a severe strain on Tamil Nadus public distribution system, he said that 42.56 per cent of the rice procured from the Centre is sold to families above poverty line.

With a runtime of a week, you have the opportunity to check out a variety of international and local cinema. Besides figuring out where, when and what to watch, the toughest task is to ensure sneaking a bite around the venues.To help with the task, heres a handy list of places to eat at, between movies.Regal CinemaTheres no dearth of options in Colaba, but if youre price conscious you may find it hard to fill your stomach without making a hole in your pocket. And if you plan to catch snacks between movies, all that spending can add up. Go instead to the Gupta Sugarcane Juice Centre (22023124) outside Dhanraj Mahal, where you can cool down with a fresh glass of sugarcane juice. If youre looking for a bite, grab a roll from Bademiya (22021447), where the popular chicken bhuna roll or mutton baida roti is an easy-to-eat, on-the-go snack. For a more elaborate sit-down, go to Lings Pavillion (22850024) for delicious pork dumplings, steamed fish and garlic bok choy.PVR PhoenixWith multiplexes in malls, its harder to hit the street for dining options for the sheer reason of navigating your way out of the complex. If you do have the time, theres a row of dosa guys right outside neighbouring Raghuvanshi Mills. Gorge on their mean Mysore masala dosa for a shareable snack. In the Phoenix Mills compound, its probably a good idea to make your way to Cream Centre (24982277), where you can either sample a traditional plate of channa bhatura, or the tasty American cheese corn balls and cheesy nachos. The all-vegetarian eatery is quick with service, making it ideal for time-pressed film-goers. For a sit-down meal, stop by at the just-opened 212 All Good (62216020).

Both our other recommendations are closed for the afternoon, but theyre worth stopping by for either lunch or dinner. Theres Jai Hind Fine Dining (26512822) well-known for its Konkani seafood, which can be lapped up with rice, wade or chapatis. For rooftop Mediterranean, go to Mediterra (69455554) and ask for the Jibnah kebab or pizza.PVR Market City Kurla ECXThis mall in Kurla is like a city unto itself, and getting out is confusing and a waste of time. Your best options when it comes to eating here are all in the mall itself, where you can grab a chaat, lassi or meal. Were partial to the sai bhaji from Kailash Parbhat (61270927).

If youre skipping a movie or have some more time to spend on your meal, head off to Craft (61802073), a well-appointed deli that does a great three-course power lunch for Rs. 599. And if its dinner and drink youre after, theyve got that covered as well.PVR MulundAfter youve caught a screening at PVR Mulund, hail a rickshaw and go to Sarvodaya Nagar , which is a short three- to five-minute ride away. There youll find an array of street food stalls selling everything from doses to pav bhaji and more. Thambbi (25620402), which is directly across from Nirmal Lifestyle Mall is known for its south Indian fare, though theres a north Indian menu available as well. Ask for the molgapudi neer dosa, and wash it down with a filter coffee. For a sit-down meal (thats still about seven to 10 minutes away by rickshaw), make your way to The Food Studio (65334999) on the Goregaon-Mulund Link Road.

So at Citimall, which is all but shuttered, weve widened the net. First up, theres Carters Blue (8898087931), for a quick roll, shawarma or plate of kebabs. Another option is PotLuck (65016500), a relatively new eatery that serves filter coffee and all-day waffles for anytime breakfast.

At present, the rice supply comes with a ceiling of 20kg/card in PDS outlets. While the NFSA seeks to provide food security to targeted priority households, the state government reiterated its commitment to continue universal public distribution system (PDS), ensuring that rice will continue to be supplied in PDS outlets free of cost to all 1.91 crore rice card holders.An order issued by chief secretary P Rama Mohana Rao said: ""All rice card holders will be eligible for 5kg of rice per person (including children) per month, while ensuring that the quantity supplied under the new system is not less than the present entitlement under universal PDS. Further, there shall be no upper ceiling of 20kg per card per month."" With the offtake per month expected to go up, the state will have to bear an additional subsidy burden of around 1,193.30 crore every year.It was TOI which first broke the news about the Union cabinet deciding on September 28 that food grains for distribution to above poverty line (APL) families in Tamil Nadu would be made available at a minimum support price of 22.54/kg, as the state has not implemented the Food Security Act. Earlier, 15.15 lakh tonnes of rice was supplied annually to the state at Rs 8.30 per kg.In case of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), the existing scale of supply of 35kg of rice per card per month will continue free of cost.The supply of food grains will be uniform both for priority and non-priority households under universal PDS. The revised scale of supply will be implemented in the state from November 1, except in three constituencies where polls are scheduled."

When it was over, Marin, the reigning World No 1, fell to the floor and wept with relief. Sindhu, 9 ranks below her, put up such a fight that at moments it looked possible that she'd be biting on the gold medal at the finish. Sakshi Malik, who was at zero to her opponent's 5, closed the gap and wrested a 3-point lead with seconds left to spare. Dipa Karmakar, who missed the bronze by a sliver, was defying death each time she whipped out the Produnova from her arsenal. Because the move the best gymnast in the world won't touch was the only one that would give Dipa any real chance of a medal.""Tumhara match iss mulk ke unn sab logon se hai jo sochte hain ki ladkiyan ladkon jitna achha nahi khel saktin, ladkon jitni achhi naukri nahin kar saktin, ladkon jitne achhe faisle nahi kar saktiin."" - Coach Kabir Khan to the women's hockey team in 'Chak De! India'Malik ended India's medal exile. Sindhu became its youngest ever Olympic medallist. Karmakar took the country the farthest it had gone in gymnastics. Many of our women at Rio finished their matches like they were a fight to the death, with all the chips they had, and some they didn't have. It may so happen that the medalled squad that returns from Rio is an all-female one.""Tumhare sapne mein ye jo boxing ka shabd hai na, woh nikaaal ke chhodunga."" - Mary Kom's father in her biopicIn 'Chak De! India', Shah Rukh tells his team before the final to think of all those who thought they couldn't, or shouldn't, play. If visualising those who stood in your way is a secret to winning, for India's sportswomen, it's a cinch. Because if the male athletes have to battle a soul-sucking system and a whole country's belief that sports aren't a 'career option,' those have been only a small part of the women's problems. Their battles start at home (or in the womb. Malik's district, Rohtak, is listed as 'gender critical' for its scary female-male ratio), to the extended family, neighbourhood, town and the general populace referred to in the dreaded ""log kya kahenge"". If the family or support system isn't a hurdle, the administration is, that mostly doesn't see women's sports to be as valuable as men's. With so much fighting behind them before they even step into the ring, it's natural that the last, bout-sealing punch you throw is a knockout one. Enough fighting. Let's get this over with.""State champion hoon main, zindagi mein ek dream hai, ek goal hai. Aur teri aukaat ke hai... Koi laqshya hai tera?

Chak De! of course, remains the go-to for every sporting parallel you need. Then there are 'Mary Kom', 'Saala Khadoos', and the upcoming 'Dangal', which tells the story of the first family of women wrestlers. And yes, 'Sultan' too. Aarfa is a proud athlete before and after she chooses to be a mom.""Main kahan se gawar ho gayi? Maine Dilli University mein athlete kote pe apne dum pe admission liya.

Main thaare jaise over-smart na su, par main roti bhi kamaa sakoon, aur baalakon ko bhi paal sakoon."" - Kusum to Tanu in 'Tanu Weds Manu Returns'This cinematic wave has also caught something else - that the female athlete making global waves has more often trodden hinterland roads on substandard gear than trained on the shiny floors of metropolitan sports clubs; the non-flashy, non-moneyed, non-privileged pedigree. The wrestler who stopped going to weddings to avoid people's barbs (Sakshi), the landless rice farmer's daughter whose father was hell-bent on ending her boxing dream (Mary Kom). And, in cinema, the Datto who refuses to be branded a 'gawaar' by a polished Tanu, or the hockey player who rides an elephant to get to her team in Delhi. Maybe it's not a coincidence that more women champs are from 'aggressive' sports like boxing and wrestling. Is in those body shots and tackles a hitting back at patriarchy? Internalising years of inhibition to produce the ultimate gender reversal? Or maybe it's just filmi-ising life. But the story of Gopichand not letting Sindhu leave the practice court till she screamed her lungs out with a crowd watching isn't filmi, it's real. They've all had to scream their lungs out at some point, sometimes several points. At some point too, the medals had to listen."

But to-days decision taken by the Government, however, says that the Commission shall hear the concerned parties and make its recommendations. This departure from the wording of the Working Committees resolution is presumably because the Commissions recommendations could be implemented only by Parliament. No time limit has been fixed for submission of the report by the Commission or for concluding its deliberations. It is believed unlikely that the recommendations would be made before the next general elections in February 1967.Use substitute for rice & wheat: PMThe Prime Minister, Mrs. Indira Gandhi said here [New Delhi] to-day [Oct. 17] that in view of the difficult situation facing the country due to shortage of wheat and rice, people should take to substitute food. She said that in the Soviet Union, for five years after the revolution, people ate substitute food like potatoes and vegetables for wheat. If rice and wheat were not available, people should be asked to try substitute food, she said.Mrs. Gandhi, who presided over the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Congress Parliamentary Party to-day, is reported to have said that she had learnt about the bad drought situation in eastern U.P. and Bihar. The Central Government was trying its best to help these States by supplying wheat and rice, but how much it would be able to supply would naturally depend on the overall supply position.The Executive which discussed the drought situation in U.P., Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan for over 130 minutes felt that emergency measures should be taken to meet the situation."

Manjunath and K. Ravikiran, during the research work on flaura and fauna of the forested area of Chincholi taluk in Kalaburagi district, chanced upon the rare frog which fell down from a tree branch.According to Mr. Manjunath and Mr. Ravikiran, the species is also known as Sri Lankan Painted Frog or Sri Lankan Bull Frog. This narrow mouthed species is found in Nepal, Bangladesh, Southern and Eastern India and Sri Lanka.The adult grows up to 75 millimetres in length from snout to vent, with females being slightly larger than the males. The colour of the dorsal surface is greyish black with a symmetrical pattern of reddish brown patches on either side, including a band of colour stretching from the back of eye to the base of the arm. The under parts are pale yellowish grey, mottled with black and brown. During the breeding season, males develop a dark throat patch.They said that the frog, which is native to Sri Lanka and India, is a fossorial species, spending the day buried in leaf litter, loose soil or under fallen logs, but can climb into the branches of the trees. It is found mostly in dry forest, coconut and rubber plantations, wetlands and rice fields."

The tip off came that rice was stacked in huge sacks there.Delay by a day would have given the racketeers time to move a tonne of rice across the inter-state border, about 35 kms away and it would have made its way to Palakkad in Kerala.It is no wonder the smugglers from Kanyakumari use autorickshaws to take the rice across the border. Luxury cars, which are rarely intercepted at the checkposts are increasingly put to use. Far north, a bus driver and conductor of Andhra Pradesh State Transport Corporation were detained for aiding the smugglers to transport 1.5 tonnes of rice in the bus bound for Mallanur from Tirupattur Town.Polished either in the mills in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh, the rice which originally comes free under the Tamil Nadu PDS system, is sold for not less than Rs 40/kg.Intensified enforcement has made no difference, as the problem lies with the source itself. Explaining the modus operandi in Coimbatore, an officer said the PDS staff who siphon off the stock sell it to agents of the smugglers for up to Rs 5 per kg. ""It was sold for Rs 2 until two years ago. The price has shot up due to hike in market price,"" he said. The moment the commodity crosses the border at Walayar, the price shoots up to Rs 16 and when it reaches Palakkad and gets polished, it is sold at Rs 25 in grocery shops. Some traders in parts of Kerala polish it further, pack and even brand them for a higher price.In fact, four civil supplies officials were suspended and penalty to the tune of Rs 20 lakh was slapped on various staff for aiding smuggling in Coimbatore last year, besides detection of bogus billing in huge numbers. On an average, ten tonnes of PDS rice is seized every month in the district, but actual quantity of rice smuggled could be at least five times more. ""We had even seized upto 50 tonnes per month a few years ago,"" a source said. In 2015, 41 rice smugglers in the district including a notorious smuggler identified as Edison from Pollachi, were held.Kanyakumari District consumer protection association president S R Sriram said that much of the PDS rice from the affluent coastal villages goes to Kerala, in connivance with the civil supplies staffs, police personnel and agents."

They have revolutionized the way agriculture was done in the dust bowls by flattening ravines and irrigating land with high-power pumps.""Every time, these migrant farmers switch on pumps, the water table dips by almost 40 feet, triggering water crisis in Sheopur. Villagers too have also taken cue and have begun sowing paddy,"" said S K Mohor, deputy director agriculture of Sheopur.Last year, 93,198 tonne of paddy was cultivated in Sheopur, with Sikh farmers accounting for more than 90% of the produce. The yield is taken to Kota mandi in neighbouring Rajasthan where they get a good price.A few hundred Sikh farmers migrated from Punjab two decades ago by selling ancestral land at a premium and began tilling land in the Chambal region, said Satnam Singh, while spraying fertilizers in fields with knee-deep water on outskirts of Sheopur. ""Soon, more farmers from north India followed to reap a harvest in what was once parched terrain, he said. ""I sold 18 bigha of land in Punjab and purchased 65 bighas here,"" he said with a smile. When he arrived in Sheopur, he along with other farmers had to smoothen ragged sand mounds on large swathes of the ravines to begin cultivation. Now, more than 200 hectares of land are being cultivated.""After filling fields with knee-deep water, we drain out water and again replenish it after a few days as temperatures rise and crops get damaged. We are now waiting for monsoon as our tube wells have begun drying up,"" he said. ""Wahe Guru will help us,"" he said looking at the sky.Deputy director agriculture S K Mohor said, ""For three years, the area under paddy cultivation is decreasing. From 19,600 hectares in 2014, it has dipped to 18,585 in 2015. This year, 16,000 hectares of land has been cultivated for paddy. We are growing the 1121 Sugandha basmati variety here,"" said Amanpal Singh, another farmer from Haryana. Former district collector Shivnarayan Rupla had recommended to the government to ban paddy cultivation in Sheopur because of water crisis.""We know ground water is depleting and you can imagine how much is wasted when they drain out and refill water with 16 HP water pumps,"" said Pannalal Solanki, district collector, Sheopur. ""There is no provision to ban crops. We can only advise them. Everybody is free to cultivate food grains and pulses of their choice,"" he said."

Far away, Bhavani of Erode district used his 70 trucks only to traffic the 'commodity' that fetched him lakhs of rupees, and 'Namakkal' Kumar raked in the profits before the law finally caught up with them.The kingpins of PDS smuggling face charges under the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Essential Commidities Act 1980 - an equivalent of Goondas Act -- under which offenders could be detained for six months without trial. ""All of them are still under our watchful eyes day and night,"" Director General of Police (Civil Supplies CID) K Radhakrishnan said. So far 886 persons have been detained under the PBM Act in TN in the last five years on charges of smuggling rice, kerosene, cylinders and dhal. Special patrols are continuing their operations in Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Krishnagiri and Pollachi, the transit points.But that does not deter the offenders. Insiders say the Vellore unit alone detained 21 notorious smugglers since January 2015 and confiscated over 700 vehicles, including nearly 400 two-wheelers, during the period. Smugglers operate from Thamalerimuthur, Somalnaickanpet and Patchur villages in Tirupattur Taluk and Mosur and Arakkonam Town in Arakkonam Taluk. ""The kingpins are based in Chennai and they are exploiting the poverty of the people living along the border areas and using them to transport the rice in small quantities if the police vigil is stepped up,"" a source said.Unlike the earlier practice, the goods are not largely smuggled in trucks. Law enforcers point to a circular issued by the state government in 2012, which clarified the Essential Commodities Act - that calculation of penalty to release vehicles carrying smuggled goods should be based on the market value of the vehicle, and not the commodity seized. ""This has broken the backbone of smuggling, as owners could not pay a fine which was close to its market value. It is no longer a high-profit, low-risk business,"" Radhakrishnan said. In a recent incident, Krishnagiri district revenue officer imposed a fine of Rs 5 lakh to release a private bus.But trains bound for Bengaluru and Tirupathi continue to be the prime means of smuggling tonnes of rice. Women engaged to carry 800 to 1200 kg of rice in trains, travel mostly in unreserved compartments in Katpadi-Tirupathi Passenger, Bangalore Express, Lalbagh Super Fast, Kaveri Express and Sangamitra Super Fast trains. ""They board the night trains in Perambur in Chennai, Arakkonam, Anwarthikhanpet, Sholinghur and Jolarpet in Vellore district,"" said a senior railway police officer."

Mohammedali, general convener of the coordination committee and chairman of the All-Kerala Retail Ration Dealers Association, told The Hindu . But, it should not lead to our own food insecurity.Mr. Mohammedali said that when the food security scheme is implemented, only 1.54 crore people, listed under the priority category, would be eligible for the subsidised rations. This would mean that a large number of ration outlets would have to shut shop. It would also mean that the quantity of food stuff supplied by each dealer would be greatly reduced, leading to the shrinking of the returns of the already poorly-compensated dealer.The strike and the march were to press the government to give rations to all people, irrespective of BPL and APL, so that the current dealerships could pull on and the dealers current income would not fall, Mr. Mohammedali said. He also wanted the Central government to restore Keralas share of the PDS (public distribution system) rice and other food stuff which has been slashed under the new scheme.He urged the government to consider payment of honorariums to the ration dealers and sales assistants, at the rate of Rs.25,000 and Rs.15,000 respectively a month. He also demanded that the government take care of the expenses of the proposed computerisation of rationing and the door delivery of foodstuff.A large number of outlets will have to shut shop if the scheme is implemented."

To set up a coal-fired thermal plant there would cause loss of investment, as the project would lead to a rise in water temperature, causing convection. Coupled with strong winds, this would create cyclones that would damage the project within the next ten years.According to UNESCO, the 1,320-megawatt Rampal super thermal power plant, a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, is to be constructed 65 km from the Sunderbans, a World Heritage site. A report published by UNESCOs World Heritage Centre and The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) mentions key concerns related to the project as being: pollution from coal ash by air, pollution from waste-water and waste ash, increased shipping and dredging, and the cumulative impact of industrial and related development infrastructure.The report also says the flow of freshwater into the Sundarbans has been drastically reduced, resulting in substantial increases in siltation and salinity that are threatening the overall balance of the ecosystem.Human-animal conflictMr. Sahgal, who is also the founding editor of wildlife and ecology magazine Sanctuary Asia , said conflicts between humans and animals is because humans have invaded the animals territory. Just because [politicians] want to win elections, theres no point giving away a part of forests to the people, force them to come there and then expect the animal to understand the signboard (meaning it is a human territory).He also added that ecological problems caused by humans, who believe they control the environment, cannot be rectified as the remedies dont match the damage. People think climate change is a disease. It is not a disease, it is a symptom of the disease that environment is giving you, and the disease is over-consumption of our resources, Mr. Sahgal said. He said the need of the hour is non-carbon energy, more equitable distribution of resources and humility [towards animals and environment], as we are dependent upon them and not the other way around.Water wastageWastage of water is aggravating the problem of climate change by 20 per cent, Mr. Sahgal said. We will never solve the problem of climate change if we waste water on industrial farming, chemical farming, mass-produced meat, sugar and rice production. If we keep using it the way we are, it would not only be delusional, it would be criminal.He added, By my reckoning, in a decade the death toll by climate change due to water will start and social unrest will start and tribunals will start being held and the decisions being taken by world leaders today will be like the Nuremberg trials; that you [leaders] knew [what the consequences will be] and you still did it.In a decade, the death toll by climate change due to water will start and social unrest will startBittu SahgalEnvironmental activist"

As one gets close to Haji 's kitchens, the air is suddenly filled with the aroma of boneless meat soaked in ghee, saffron and a rose-water puree, blended with a burst of other ingredients.Haji carefully counts drops of 'itar', lemon juice and kewra-water to prepare a ""chashni"" (syrup), while Saud stirs meat chunks in boiling butter-milk and rich cream over a low flame of burning wood.Then comes the time for rice to be semi-cooked with salt, along with saffron, nuts and rose-water in three layers. The semi-cooked rice is added to the boiling chashni and meat, and covered to cook for an hour.Finally after around four hours, the dish is ready to be served with Haji pouring a layer of desi ghee all over the cooked rice and meat. He tops up the dish with sprinklings of cardamom powder and rose petals.The final produce is the mouth-wateringly sweet mutanjan, which Irina Chowlic , a Ukrainian traveler who visits India every year, and makes it a point to drop into Haji's Lucknow outlet to savour the special dish, says: ""With every spoon you take, you feel more and more like a royal."" A lover of Awadhi and Mughlai cuisine, Irina terms mutanjan as a dessert for the royals.Haji says he earned the art of making mutanjan from his grandfather Raheem , who was a famous cook of his times. ""He (Raheem) started making Mutanjan in 1980, and since then made it on every Bakried to distribute to his dear ones. He used to make it and distribute it, without charging for it. It has become a tradition since then and we are following it,"" said Haji.Speaking of the dedication needed to make the dish, Haji says: ""Staying in 50 degrees of heat from the flames emerging from burning wood and coke is a big challenge."" It took him two-and-a-half hours just to make the chashni and cook the meat.An expert in making Mughal and Awadhi dishes, Haji said: ""I have made it again after an entire year. The sweet and salty tastes impart a flavor of their own to the sweet dish.""A recipe that may soon be historyChefs and food lovers say that mutanjan may soon be history if hotels and restaurants don't take a page from Haji's secret recipe book.""Mutanjan contains all that one can imagine in a sweet dish. Maybe, even beyond that. Even then, not many people have ever heard about it,"" says Sonalika Azaad , an expert on desserts.Some even confuse mutanjan with ""meetha pulao"" and ""zarda"", but zarda does not contain meat chunks."

All the 32 seats were filled up this year while last year a large number was lying vacant.""A large number of seats used to be vacant over the last few years. Probably the name of the course was too women oriented. We not only changed the name of the course but completely revamped the course with more emphasis on village industries and entrepreneurship development,"" said vice chancellor of the university S N Pasupalak.The four-year degree course had subjects like food and nutrition, family resources management, human development and family studies, textile and apparel designing, extension and communication management. ""We tried to bring major changes in the curriculum keeping present day needs in mind,"" said Pasupalak.Besides home science, the university has also revised its curriculum for all courses and increased the credit points. Earlier, agriculture technology was not regarded at par with other technical courses but after we increased 25 credit points in the course, it will now get technical recognition at the national level. OUAT is the first few universities in the country to take this step this year, he added.The vice-chancellor blamed shortage of teachers as a major problem in research and development work in the university. In the last five years no new variety of rice has been developed. ""Most teachers are overburdened and not much research work can be taken up due to staff shortage,"" Pasupalak said. Of the total, 500 teaching posts nearly 171 posts are vacant, sources said."

But if the government is not ready to pay honorariums to the retailers and their sales assistants and pay for the door delivery, we are not going to cooperate with it.Mr. Moosa said from November 1, the retailers would not lift foodstuff stocks from Civil Supplies godowns, which would mean virtual shutdown of the outlets. On Monday, hundreds of retailers had taken out a rally in Thiruvananthapuram to raise their demands.At the talks with the commissioner of Civil Supplies held later, Mr. Moosa said no assurance was received on the question of honorarium nor on the door delivery. This had led to the collective decision of non-cooperation with the scheme.This non-cooperation would immediately affect the ongoing stamping of priority ration cards by retailers aimed to facilitate the November 1 launch of the scheme. We will totally boycott the stamping drive, Mr. Moosa said. On Monday, the rush for the rectifying the listings in the cards had caused stamping at taluk offices and city rationing offices at several places. The government has now allowed panchayat offices and village offices to do the task.Under the new scheme, over 15 million ration beneficiaries in the priority category will get 5 kg of highly subsidised rice a month. The non-priority beneficiaries will have to pay prices close to the market rates.Mr. Moosa said that since the commission currently paid to the retailers (Rs.88 to Rs.92 for supplying a quintal of rice to the cardholders, after paying for the transportation and other sundry tasks) was paltry, the government should pay an honorarium of at least Rs.20,000 to the retailer and Rs.10,000 to the sales assistant. The cost of transportation was hefty, too. He said the Act provided for free door delivery of the stocks to the outlets.If the government does not find a solution to our issues by November 1, Mr. Moosa said, all the 14,000-plus retailers will not cooperate with the scheme implementation."

The lack of a coordination committee at the district-level is hampering proper monitoring of the scheme, claims activist Shahid Sharif. ""The committee is part of the guidelines given by Supreme Court and it will ensure that all loopholes in the system are plugged.""Sharif, who is founder-chairman of an NGO that focuses on education, said, ""MDM is such a massive project which requires a lot of manpower just for the sake of monitoring. The committee suggested by the SC has people from all walks of life and that will ensure that each and every aspect of this crucial public scheme is looked into.""He alleged that there have been various instances of malpractices and negligence towards hygiene in the implementation of MDM. Sharif said, ""Recently, at a school we saw that no MDM was being served to students, to which the school claimed that it was because supply of rice had stopped. I am confident that detailed inspection of records and rice stock will reveal a clearer picture.""Sharif further said that at another school there were reports of worms in raw rice but the education department denied it. ""Not everyone is comfortable when we try to point out the problems but that particular rice stock was replaced by the department. So if the rice was not contaminated, like I had claimed, why did they change it in the first place?"" asked Sharif.Earlier this month, a teacher was caught by the NGO trying to transport rice outside of school. Sharif said, ""She accepted that she was taking the rice home as compensation for her unpaid salary. Later, when the school management and education department got involved in the issue she changed her statement claiming that rice was being taken for making idli batter.""

For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.WILD RED RICE, FROM NORTHEAST INDIAWILD RED RICESANTA'S FANTASEAA tribal dish, the wild red rice is big in the northeast food scene. It's unpolished, unlike the white rice we commonly use. ""The unpolished dhenki-chhaat chaal is full of nutrients. It might not look very shiny, but it is much better for our health,"" says Kaushik Ghosh, owner of Santa's Fantasea. In this restaurant, it is served with a gravy that is made from traditional northeastern herbs and the superhot bhut jolokia, or raja mirchi, as it is known in Nagaland.CHORIZO, FROM SPAINCHICKPEA CHORIZOBODEGA CANTINA Y BARA Spanish pork sausage, chorizo is increasingly becoming one of the staples at new-age restaurants in Kolkata. It is spicy, made from coarsely ground pork and seasoned with chili and paprika. It is widely used in Spanish and Mexican cuisine. ""Chorizos are centuries old, but it is relatively new on India's palette. We buy it from a Spanish couple in Bangalore, who make the chorizos themselves, to preserve the authentici ty. The spicy pork goes wonderfully with the flavours of chickpea, and present it as tapas,"" shares Urvika Kanoi, head chef and owner of Bodega Cantina Y Bar.CHIMICHURRI, FROM ARGENTINACHIMICHURRI PRAWNSSMOKE HOUSE DELIThis is an Argentinian sauce, which is used as a dip with fried fish or grills. In Smoke House Deli, they make it from scratch, which is their take on the original chimichurri, and use it as a marinade for prawns.""The prawns are marinated in this sauce for 30 minutes, before being grilled and baked,"" said head chef Fatik Mir. Apart from infusing the prawns with a burst of flavours, the vibrant green chimichurri contrasts with the slight pinkish shade of the prawns.UNAGI, FROM JAPANUNAGI NIGIRIFUJISorry to burst your bubble, but Unagi is not the total state of concentration that Ross of FRIENDS claimed to have mastered. It is actually a freshwater eel that is a very common component of Japanese seafood. If that makes you squeamish, remember that Fuji uses this fish with wasabi, gari, rice and sushi vinegar to make a nigiri, which is also another form of sushi. Not take a look at the plate, doesn't this look like art on a plate?RIBOTIDE, FOOD ADDITIVENACHOS WITH CHEESE SAUCECREAM CENTREThe controversy surrounding MSG, a flavour enhancer widely used in southeast Asian cuisine, came as a huge blow to Chinese restaurants and food manufacturers. But then, as they say, when one door closes, another opens up. So now there are powder flavor enhancers in the market, known as Ribotides. These can be used in a way similar to MSG and are considered safe. It is a Japanese derivative and is used in the cheese sauce of Cream Centre, which is served with their nachos. Though the nachos cheese and mozzarella cheese here are both customized with secret ingredients, at least we know that they use a highly expensive flavour enhancer, which accounts for their huge fan following!COUSCOUS, FROM NORTH AFRICAVEGETABLE TAGINE WITH COUSCOUSTHE FACTORY OUTLETCouscous has been a part of Kolkata's menu for quite some time now. However, with the trend moving from traditional grains such as wheat and rice to uncommon ones such as quinoa and buckwheat, couscous is also getting its share of limelight. A traditional North African dish, it is made of moulds of semolina and flour. A dish in itself, more and more restaurants are deconstructing it to suit Indian palettes. It can be served with broth, veggies or meat. Sometimes it's had just by itself -a bowl of comfort food. For the veg tagine with couscous at The Factory outlet, they serve the steamed dish with preserved veggies."

But parts of the greens acres, especially the area hosting the stalls put up by the various states, have turned into giant pools. Many tin sheets have been spread out to ensure that visitors don't have to wade through water and slush. They are inadequate though. The schoolkids have taken off their shoes.On a raised platform a Navy band in all-white plays with polished control. You have heard the tunes though you cannot remember the tracks until they start playing Sare Jahan Se Achcha. Young boys and girls shoot videos, take pictures.

You can get Lal Chawal ki Idli (two for Rs 30), made of low-starch rice grown on steppe-fields. And cutlet made of Gahat, a local daal.

Japan's stance is precisely the same as that of the US, as if they have discussed their lines,"" it said.The tabloid daily said that on the contrary the attitude of the Philippines - which filed the petition against China at the tribunal - is relatively mild as it called for restraint.Part of the ruling Communist Party publications, the daily is known of its nationalistic rhetoric.""An old Chinese saying goes 'the emperor doesn't worry but his eunuch does,' meaning the outsider is more anxious than the player. In this case, Washington and Tokyo are the worrying eunuchs,"" it said.""The calls for the use of force have only been heard when the US clamoured to safeguard the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, which mirrors that the US hasn't made the determination to use the arbitration for a showdown with China in the waters.""""The People's Liberation Army should enhance its military deployment in the waters of the Nansha Islands (Spratly islands) and be fully prepared to counterattack if the US makes further provocations,"" it said.""We do not wish for any direct confrontation or friction between the military powers...

RELATED STORIESincreasingly confident military +BEIJING: China's leadership is resisting pressure from elements within the military for a more forceful response to an international court ruling against Beijing's claims in the, sources said, wary of provoking a clash with the United States.China refused to participate in the case overseen by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.It denounced the emphatic July 12 ruling in favor of the Philippines as a farce that had no legal basis and part of an anti-China plotThe ruling has been followed in China by a wave of nationalist sentiment, scattered protests and strongly worded editorials in state media.So far, Beijing has not shown any sign of wanting to take stronger action. Instead, it has called for a peaceful resolution through talks at the same time as promising toBut some elements within China'sare pushing for a stronger - potentially armed - response aimed at the United States and its regional allies, according to interviews with four sources with close military and leadership ties.""The People's Liberation Army is ready,"" one source with ties to the military told Reuters.""We should go in and give them a bloody nose like Deng Xiaoping did to Vietnam in 1979,"" the source said, referring to China's brief invasion of Vietnam to punish Hanoi for forcing Beijing's ally the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia.The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.President Xi Jinping has assiduously courted and thoroughly cemented his leadership over the PLA and faces no serious challenges to his command.While he is overseeing sweeping military reforms to improve the PLA's ability to win wars, he has said China needs a stable external environment as it deals with its own development issues, including a slowing economy. And few people expect any significant move ahead of Xi's hosting of a G20 summit in September.But the hardened response to The Hague ruling from some elements of the military increases the risk that any provocative or inadvertent incidents in the South China Sea could escalate into a more serious clash.Another source with ties to the leadership described the mood in the PLA as hawkish.""The United States will do what it has to do. We will do what we have to do,"" the source said. ""The entire military side has been hardened. It was a huge loss of face,"" he said, declining further comment.Chinese defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun, asked whether the PLA was pushing for a stronger response, repeated that the armed forces would resolutely defend China's territory and maritime rights, and peace and stability, while dealing with any threats or challenges.Retired military officers and army-linked academics have pushed home a strongly martial message.""The Chinese military will step up and fight hard and China will never submit to any country on matters of sovereignty,"" Liang Fang, a professor at the military-run National Defence University, wrote on his Weibo microblog about the ruling.It is not clear exactly what steps military hardliners are considering.Much attention has been focused around the potential establishment of an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) for the South China Sea, which would require international aircraft to identify themselves to Chinese authorities.Other options floated by those linked to the PLA include putting missiles on bombers patrolling the South China Sea capable of hitting targets in the Philippines or Vietnam.Yue Gang, a retired colonel, said China's announcement promising regular air patrols over the region showed it was seeking to deny the US air superiority afforded by aircraft carriers. China should be confident enough to provoke an incident and drive the US out, he added.""China is not intimidated by US carriers and is brave enough to touch off an inadvertent confrontation,"" Yue wrote on his Weibo account.China's military build-up in the region looks set to quicken regardless of any action.""We must make preparations for a long-term fight and take this as a turning point in our South China Sea military strategy,"" Li Jinming of the South China Sea Institute at China's Xiamen University wrote in the Chinese academic journal Southeast Asian Studies.Despite the saber rattling, there have been no firm military moves that could cause an escalation of tensions. Diplomats and sources said the Chinese leadership was well aware of the dangers of a clash.""They're on the back foot. They're very worried by the international reaction,"" said one senior Beijing-based diplomat, citing conversations with Chinese officials.""They are genuine about wanting to get talks back on track. The leadership will have to think long and hard about where to go next.""Within China's armed forces there is a recognition that China would come off worst in a face-off with the United States.""Our navy cannot take on the Americans. We do not have that level of technology yet. The only people who would suffer would be ordinary Chinese,"" said the source with ties to the military.Those voices appeared to have the upper hand for now, the source said, pointing to a realization that the 1979 border war with Vietnam did not go as well for China as the propaganda machine would like people to believe.Even setting up an ADIZ, like the one Beijing set up over the East China Sea in 2013 to anger from the United States, Japan and others, would be difficult to enforce given the distance from the mainland.China has repeatedly said it has the right to set up an ADIZ but that the decision depends on the level of threat it faces.A second source with leadership ties put it bluntly: ""War is unlikely"".""But we will continue to conduct military exercises,"" the source said. ""(We) expect US naval vessels to continue to come,"" and ""miscalculation cannot be ruled out"".Foreign minister Wang Yi has stressed the importance of dialogue, saying it now was the time to return things to the ""right track"" and to ""turn the page"" on the ruling.The United States has responded positively to these overtures, sending US National Security Adviser Susan Rice to China this week with a call for calm.Washington is also using quiet diplomacy to persuade other regional players not to move aggressively to capitalize on the ruling.China has been angered by US freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, but its forces have responded only by shadowing US vessels and warning them, showing China's unwillingness to goad the US military unnecessarily, according to Western and Asian diplomats.China is also wary of any incident overshadowing the G20 summit in Hangzhou in September, the highlight of this year's diplomatic calendar for Xi when he will be host to the leaders of most of the world's economically most powerful countries, the sources said.The Beijing-based diplomat said it was more likely China would choose the period between the end of the G20 and the US presidential election in November to make any move.""But that is a misjudgment if China thinks the United States will just sit back and do nothing,"" the diplomat said."

Closure of 90 per cent of rice mills has not only impacted the revenue to Government but also to individual millers, bankers and also the general employment.Rice mill industry provides direct and indirect employment to 30,000 persons who are now jobless. Further, labour migration from Bihar and other States during harvest season has came to an end.Continuous failure of monsoon, heavy burden of current and salary bills, stoppage of levy rice and purchases by Government, supply of low quality rice from primary cooperative agricultural societies are the main factors leading to the present situation of rice mills. Boiled and raw rice milling is totally shut down.Millers, unable to repay the loans, are handing over keys to the bankers for seizure of the mills. In the last two years we lost the repaying capacity. Our appeals to the Government to increase the commission has fallen on deaf ears. We are incurring losses if we run the mills. For big mills power bills is coming in lakhs, says president, district rice millers association Moturi Dayanand Gupta.The industry will collapse if the Government does not take steps immediately, say the millers. Quantity of rice being given to millers through custom milling needs to be increased, opines K. Ramesh, a miller in the town. Almost one third of mills are located in and around district headquarters and when they were in operation the district economy used to be vibrant.We requested Finance Minister Etala Rajender to use his good offices to prevail upon bankers to reschedule the loans and waive interest amount on dues from millers to help the industry recover, but to no avail, deplores Mr. Gupta."

58f688c47be9e031f13b6c50,When Kabali echoed Ambedkar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/When-Kabali-echoed-Ambedkar/articleshow/53485574.cms,2016-08-01,"Pa Ranjith, maker of the Rajini blockbuster, has shown that a Dalit perspective is not bad for the box officeIn the early 2000s, a long-haired, brooding art student travelled daily by suburban train to his Chennai college from Avadi in neighbouring Thiruvallur district. During the journey, he would often call out to the kids who cleaned the trains and stations along the way and, to the bemusement of other commuters, engage them in conversation about their education. Sometimes he would sketch them on paper, sending the kids into raptures.That young artist was Pa Ranjith -- the filmmaker behind the Rajinikanth blockbuster, Kabali. The movie helped Rajini break a bad run of two flops. The superstar, who's acknowledged that it wasn't a Rajini but a Ranjith movie, delivered powerful dialogues espousing the philosophy of B R Ambedkar, offering a rarely seen Dalit perspective to audiences of Tamil commercial cinema.As the second child of a Dalit couple in Karalapakkam, a village set amidst acres of jasmine plants and rice plantations, 45km north-west of Chennai, the unusually quiet Ranjith had three passions: painting, reading and cricket. ""He picked up painting from his maternal uncles. My father, an office assistant in an industrial estate nearby, would get paintboxes, brush, etc for him. He would sit under a tree near the fields and sketch all day,"" says his elder brother, Pa Prabhu, an advocate in Madras high court.When not wielding the brush, he would be out in the fields with his friends, rattling stumps with his bowling or smacking sixes.Prabhu introduced him to books -- on religion, law, agriculture.... ""Everything would be lapped up,"" Prabhu says. Ranjith admits that his brother was the force behind his early political consciousness. Writers like Maxim Gorky and Albert Camus, and the Tamil poetry of Shobha Shakti firmly instilled a sense of equality and self-respect from childhood, which now gets reflected in his films. ""Books tell us about life. Words make you imagine. They explain politics not directly, but by engrossing us in words,"" Ranjith says.There's clarity in the way his films tackle politics and caste discrimination. In Kabali, Rajinikanth's eponymous character would be dressed royally in a suit, a powerful statement of self-respect. ""Ranjith himself was like that; he would skip school on days his uniform was not clean or ironed properly,"" says his father, Pandurangan.Kabali is Ranjith's third film; his Karthi starrer, Madras, too had portrayed the lives of subaltern communities living in Chennai's slums, with Ambedkarite sub-texts. Observers have applauded Ranjith's boldness, given that Tamil Nadu politics is controlled by powerful intermediate backward castes, many of whom have opposed Dalit upward mobility. ""Ranjith has smartly managed to highlight the plight of Dalits, but in a universal language,"" says C Lakshmanan, a professor at Madras Institute of Development Studies.His father says Ranjith was initially scared of expressing his views when he entered the industry, but gradually got over it. ""Caste discrimination is not absent in the industry, but it operates in a subtle manner, as people from a similar background work in closeted groups,"" Ranjith says.Ranjith, though, firmly opposes any move to shoe-horn him as a Dalit filmmaker, insisting that his films deal with issues affecting the entire Tamil community. ""Periyar and Ambedkar both spoke about Dalit consciousness. But Periyar was appropriated as a leader of the masses while Ambedkar remained a leader only of Dalits. This is wrong,"" he says.In a state where politics and cinema are virtually inseparable, Lakshmanan says Ranjith's films have made youth aware of the real political issues of the state. ""There is no doubt that he is emerging as a powerful voice on Dalit perspectives, whatever aversion one might have to commercial cinema,"" he says. This is evident when one drives to his village -- locals have put up Kabali flex boards with Ranjith and Rajinikanth all along the roadsides.Ranjith's cousin Suresh, who's an advocate, says the filmmaker has become a symbol of upward mobility among youngsters, irrespective of community. ""He came here during Pongal and played cricket with us. There was a big crowd. Everybody in the villages nearby was proud to be associated with him,"" he says. Ranjith has also helped start a library and spoken English classes in these villages.But the filmmaker doesn't want the caste identity. ""I believe in annihilating caste. I want to speak on problems common to everyone. Please don't tag me with a caste; it will pain me if it creates differences in people,"" he says. However, the filmmaker agrees that cinema by itself might not be able to destroy caste barriers, but only help in engaging people in dialogue. ""People want to engage, but it's the political leaders at the top who create differences,"" he says.He points to the recent commercial success of movies tackling issues concerning Dalits, such as Fandry and Sairat (Marathi), Kammatipadam (Malyalam) and Tithi (Kannada), which have provoked discussion and debate among the larger public. Things have certainly changed from the time when he was told that having Ambedkar's photo in his first movie would kill its commercial prospects."

It was when as a 12-year-old she stood in the kitchen of her familys ancestral home in Aversa, 20 km from Karwar in Karnataka on the Konkan Coast. The kitchen was as big as a room, and dark, says the home chef as we order a thali at Maya at the Trident, BKC. The only light came in from a small window above the chulha . The sight was almost divine.The ongoing Rivaayat-e-Karwar offering is part of chef Ashish Bhasins pet project to revive lesser-known Indian cuisines. Last time, we were here for Osama Jalalis Delhi Durbari khana, and the taste of mutton kheer is still on our palates.Having eaten Deos food at a previous event, Bhasin tells us he patiently waited for the rains to bid the city goodbye before inviting her. It is all about coastal food, so the fish should be fresh, he says.Deo says that Karwar cuisine mainly consists of coconut, rice and fish. In our vegetable curries, we use a lot of ash gourd, snake gourd, and ivy gourd, she says. The use of garam masala is minimal, mainly dry coriander and sukha byadgi mirchi with tamarind. Even chicken and mutton is not relished. Though the recipes of mutton stew and curry, and chicken sukke on the menu are recipes I learnt from my grandmother.As a child, Deo reminisces her visits to the village with her parents. My father would go to the river and catch fresh fish, which my mother and aunt would cook, she says. I remember the rawasa ambat (fish curry), fried prawns, and sungta ambat (prawn curry). We even made fish wrapped in banana leaf.Karwari sweets are mostly made using coconut. We have the chana dal payasam and kesar bhaat. In our village, there is a festival called Nopi, which follows Ganesh Chaturthi. Every year, one family has to cook for the entire village. Our turn comes every five years. No matter what is cooked in the main course, the kesar bhaat is always made. We love it, she smiles.Deos family also makes their own sevaiya (homemade rice noodles). We soak the rice, make a paste and cook it in a pan till it thickens. We make balls of it and steam them in banana leaves. And then put it in the moulds and make them, she says.While our chat continues, a veg thali arrives with fish and mutton dishes on the side. The former comes with a raita, dal, a dry vegetable of okra and turiya (ridge gourd), a watery curry with whole green moong dal, valval (vegetables with coconut and green chillies), dry aloo sabzi and rice and neer dosa. It could jolly well be a meal sampled at a home in Karwar. The toor dal has a light tadka of curry leaves, and pairs well with the paper-thin neer dosa. We have this with the gourd and okra sabzi, which is crunchy and cooked in coconut oil.The fried Surmai has a coating of a masala paste comprising garlic, coriander, red chilli powder, kokam and salt. This is shallow fried with rice and semolina flour, which gives it a delicious crust.When the lid on the Karwari Lamb Biryani is lifted, aromatic steam escapes. This biryani is sweet (from the onions) and spicy (from the green chilli and ginger paste) at the same time, and the chunks of mutton are succulent. Laden with coriander and onions, green chillies and coriander powder make up most of the masala.As a sweet end to the meal, we are served the chana dal payasam: a thick, hot and milky concoction, with cashew nuts, chana dal and raisins. The coconut milk lends a smooth texture and we lap this up wondering what Bhasin has in store for his next gastronomical adventure.The author is a freelance writerRivaayat-e-Karwar is on till October 21 at Maya, Trident, Bandra Kurla Complex.Call 66727777 for reservations."

It is considered auspicious to initiate a child's education, Vidyarambham, on the occasion of Vijayadashami , which marks the new beginning after Navarathri.Temples across the district were crowded with young parents who had brought their children for initiation by a guru or the temple priest. The children were made to write on rice grains, by the priest or an elderly person.A family had requested the help of their family doctor, who they considered to be the best person to initiate their child's education. The child was made to sit on the doctor's lap and write the first few letters of the Tamil alphabet and also recite them. The parents then gifted fruits, flowers and sweets to the doctor.At the Vanamaleeswarar temple in Nagercoil, small children were seen sitting on the laps of priests and their grandparents, who offered worship to the goddess there and then used a golden needle dipped in honey to write on the child's tongue.

The procession of Lord Siva was held at the Siva temple with people donning tiger costumes dancing in front of the procession. Tight security arrangements were made in view of the event."

There are just two utensils in her kitchen, barely any grain and little hope of a regular income.Her son Ishwar Savra was underweight and fell ill often over the years. When he died, he weighed just over 5 kg, half the weight of a normal child. Left with two older children, the family, which belongs to the Katkari tribe, is still struggling to earn a living.Like many in this tribal district, 100 km from Mumbai, the Savra family is landless and work as farm labourers. ""We get Rs 100 a day for working on rice fields. But work comes only twice or thrice a week. On some nights, we have to go hungry,"" she says.The district is now in the spotlight with reports of children dying due to malnutrition coming forth. Deaths of 209 children below six years of age have been recorded between April and August. The number of malnourished children below the age of five is 6,034.Yet, beyond the holes in the state 's scheme to provide food and emergency care for the children in this deprived belt, the larger crisis is economic: the lack of livelihood for the mainly tribal population.In the four rural talukas of the district, the tribal population is as high as 85%. These include Warlis, Kolis, Thakurs and Katkari tribals . The last group, though smallest in number, has been categorized by the state as the most vulnerable.Most of the tribals here have no land. Many cultivate forest land but its degradation over decades has pushed them to the edge. ""They used to cultivate calcium-rich nachni in the forest. Also, they had access to food from the forest, including fruits and honey, but this has also gone down,"" says Milind Thatte from the voluntary group Vayam.Forced to turn to other sources of livelihood, the tribals were left with few options but to migrate to nearby Nashik, Silvassa and Thane. Neither jobs nor skill training has been a priority with the state, says Thatte.Many of the tribals here do not have job cards for the employment guarantee scheme, which is supposed to provide 100 days of work per household. Those who do, say it does not suit them.""Under the scheme, we earn around Rs 150 per day and get paid after a month. Construction work in Thane gets me Rs 300 daily and I get paid at the end of each day,"" says Kashiram Wadkar from Ruighar village in Jawhar.It's not just Palghar. The entire tribal belt in the state has faced decades of neglect. The scheduled tribes account for 9.4% of the state's population and are concentrated mainly in north Maharashtra and Vidarbha.But there are stark gaps between the tribal and general population. In rural Maharashtra, 40% of children under the age of five years are underweight, according to the National Family Health Survey 2015-16. But in rural Nandurbar, which has a large tribal population, the figure is as high as 57%. While the literacy rate in Maharashtra is 82.3%, it is a much lower 65.7% in the scheduled tribe population."

Instead, it has called for a peaceful resolution through talks at the same time as promising toBut some elements within China'sare pushing for a stronger - potentially armed - response aimed at the United States and its regional allies, according to interviews with four sources with close military and leadership ties.""The People's Liberation Army is ready,"" one source with ties to the military told Reuters.""We should go in and give them a bloody nose like Deng Xiaoping did to Vietnam in 1979,"" the source said, referring to China's brief invasion of Vietnam to punish Hanoi for forcing Beijing's ally the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia.The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.President Xi Jinping has assiduously courted and thoroughly cemented his leadership over the PLA and faces no serious challenges to his command.While he is overseeing sweeping military reforms to improve the PLA's ability to win wars, he has said China needs a stable external environment as it deals with its own development issues, including a slowing economy. And few people expect any significant move ahead of Xi's hosting of a G20 summit in September.But the hardened response to The Hague ruling from some elements of the military increases the risk that any provocative or inadvertent incidents in the South China Sea could escalate into a more serious clash.Another source with ties to the leadership described the mood in the PLA as hawkish.""The United States will do what it has to do. We will do what we have to do,"" the source said. ""The entire military side has been hardened. It was a huge loss of face,"" he said, declining further comment.Chinese defence ministry spokesman Yang Yujun, asked whether the PLA was pushing for a stronger response, repeated that the armed forces would resolutely defend China's territory and maritime rights, and peace and stability, while dealing with any threats or challenges.Retired military officers and army-linked academics have pushed home a strongly martial message.""The Chinese military will step up and fight hard and China will never submit to any country on matters of sovereignty,"" Liang Fang, a professor at the military-run National Defence University, wrote on his Weibo microblog about the ruling.It is not clear exactly what steps military hardliners are considering.Much attention has been focused around the potential establishment of an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) for the South China Sea, which would require international aircraft to identify themselves to Chinese authorities.Other options floated by those linked to the PLA include putting missiles on bombers patrolling the South China Sea capable of hitting targets in the Philippines or Vietnam.Yue Gang, a retired colonel, said China's announcement promising regular air patrols over the region showed it was seeking to deny the US air superiority afforded by aircraft carriers. China should be confident enough to provoke an incident and drive the US out, he added.""China is not intimidated by US carriers and is brave enough to touch off an inadvertent confrontation,"" Yue wrote on his Weibo account.China's military build-up in the region looks set to quicken regardless of any action.""We must make preparations for a long-term fight and take this as a turning point in our South China Sea military strategy,"" Li Jinming of the South China Sea Institute at China's Xiamen University wrote in the Chinese academic journal Southeast Asian Studies.Despite the saber rattling, there have been no firm military moves that could cause an escalation of tensions. Diplomats and sources said the Chinese leadership was well aware of the dangers of a clash.""They're on the back foot. They're very worried by the international reaction,"" said one senior Beijing-based diplomat, citing conversations with Chinese officials.""They are genuine about wanting to get talks back on track. The leadership will have to think long and hard about where to go next.""Within China's armed forces there is a recognition that China would come off worst in a face-off with the United States.""Our navy cannot take on the Americans. We do not have that level of technology yet. The only people who would suffer would be ordinary Chinese,"" said the source with ties to the military.Those voices appeared to have the upper hand for now, the source said, pointing to a realization that the 1979 border war with Vietnam did not go as well for China as the propaganda machine would like people to believe.Even setting up an ADIZ, like the one Beijing set up over the East China Sea in 2013 to anger from the United States, Japan and others, would be difficult to enforce given the distance from the mainland.China has repeatedly said it has the right to set up an ADIZ but that the decision depends on the level of threat it faces.A second source with leadership ties put it bluntly: ""War is unlikely"".""But we will continue to conduct military exercises,"" the source said. ""(We) expect US naval vessels to continue to come,"" and ""miscalculation cannot be ruled out"".Foreign minister Wang Yi has stressed the importance of dialogue, saying it now was the time to return things to the ""right track"" and to ""turn the page"" on the ruling.The United States has responded positively to these overtures, sending US National Security Adviser Susan Rice to China this week with a call for calm.Washington is also using quiet diplomacy to persuade other regional players not to move aggressively to capitalize on the ruling.China has been angered by US freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, but its forces have responded only by shadowing US vessels and warning them, showing China's unwillingness to goad the US military unnecessarily, according to Western and Asian diplomats.China is also wary of any incident overshadowing the G20 summit in Hangzhou in September, the highlight of this year's diplomatic calendar for Xi when he will be host to the leaders of most of the world's economically most powerful countries, the sources said.The Beijing-based diplomat said it was more likely China would choose the period between the end of the G20 and the US presidential election in November to make any move.""But that is a misjudgment if China thinks the United States will just sit back and do nothing,"" the diplomat said."

I approached the Indian Farmers Cooperative who gave those affected offered 1,500 tarpaulins to protect the huts of the villagers as well as 1,500 bags of rice.""Balamurugan said that his efforts were inspired by one of the villagers who sought his help, saying, ""Your father migrated from the village for your education but all of us cannot do that. Children have to walk seven km on the farm road to reach the Panruti town school. After their school hours, girls have to rush to reach our village before dark as there have been instances of harassment and there are no street lights."" The bureaucrat also hopes to prevail upon the authorities to construct a causeway between Siruvathur and Panikamkuppam as both villages are isolated and the villagers have to take a circuitous 15 km road around the Keedalam river. The bureaucrat said that these words touched him and being in an official capacity he took the help of those officials whom he knew and interacted with as part of his job and ensured that his village began to get the basic facilities they deserved.Balamurugan has tied up with the Neyveli Lignite Corporation to rebuild the dilapidated government high school at a cost of Rs 60 lakh. ""The school classrooms and compound were frequented by anti-social elements who turned it into a den for drinking and illegal activities. I took the help of officials to stop this menace and ensure that children who had stopped schooling came back to continue their education,"" he said. Balamurugan said adding that that electricity board has assured to put up new street lights in the village. He said that he was in talks with the transport authorities to ensure regular bus services to the villages as the girls return late from school as it is a long walk and they are teased by the youth. He said no cash was involved in this initiative and government organisations and the Neyveli Lignite Corporation have chipped into this as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).The official signed off by saying that he hoped to make his village a model one for others to emulate."
58f689d67be9e031f13b6dd4,"Decades later, Calapor boasts old-world charm",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Decades-later-Calapor-boasts-old-world-charm/articleshow/53714419.cms,2016-08-16,"On any leisurely afternoon, if one finds themselves wandering through the village of St Cruz, the sight of its green cover, charming mansions and tranquility of the interior roads is bound to transport them to an era bygone.Charming to a fault, the village sits along the luscious green expanse and is lined with houses akin to ginger-bread homes. Tucked in the suburbs of Panaji, this chocolate box hamlet with a population of approximately 20,000 people was one of the early settlements in Tiswadi.Much of Tiswadi is comparatively new, reclaimed from the sea by a continuous process of sedimentation and siltation. With its low-lying tracts crisscrossed by creeks and streams, elevated plateaus and hillocks, St Cruz is as pretty as a postcard.Meaning holy cross in Portuguese, St Cruz was previously called Calapor. The vast expanse of this village stretches from Morombim in the north to the foothills in the south and from its eastern border tipping the villages of Mudra and Cujira. Thereon it goes on to Taleigao that merges into the Arabian Sea in the west.Though well-connected today to neighboring village Merces through the highway, veterans from the village say that residents had to earlier cross the mushy pond and adjacent fields by way of a canoe to get to the other side.The highway connecting with the winding roads of the village offers alternate routes to Merces, Bambolim and Cujira.While St Cruz and Merces were the salt-pan mecca of the state, this traditional practice has declined over the past two decades.Initially Hindu-dominated, there were temples in the village dedicated to various deities like Santeri, Kalbadevi, Maya, Betal, Ramnath, Brahma, Purusha, Panchdevta and Ravalnath. The list reveals definite proof of Kadamba devotion to the mother goddess and the presence of the Nath cult in Goa around 1150 AD.Some sites in the village have names that are pointers indicating what they used to be in ancient Calapor. Bondir- the name of a ward in the village comes from the old wharf along the creek to the east. Another branch of the creek skirts the western flank of the village where laterite stones marking the bund are seen. Even today the inhabitants of the place refer to this area as tarri korem meaning 'near the ferry wharf'.According to local tradition, the area in the vicinity of the chapel of St Anthony is known as Cujir vaddo because it is believed to have been the habitat of a colony of Gujarati tradesmen. This sliver of information is a clear indicator of Goa's trade relations with Gujarat in the past.Like most other villages in Goa, St Cruz is also rife with folklore. Teresa Albuquerque in her book St Cruz Calapor, Profile of a village in Goa, speaks of an interesting relic called don fator (two stones). Stationed close to the highway, one encounters this strange monument of gleaming black stones, about a metre in height, propped next to each other.Legend has it that a generous housewife who was giving tamarind to a needy neighbour was scolded by her mother-in-law for taking things from the house without permission. She is said to have dropped two stones from her hand which turned into don fator.Despite the Muslim invasion in the 14th Century, St Cruz's villagers were bound together by allegiance to their deities and administered the lands in their name. When the Portuguese imperialists arrived, these deities became a target of attack.Temples that even the Muslim rulers had spared ultimately suffered at the hands of the Portuguese. Soon after the destruction of the temples of Ilhas (the new name given to Tiswadi by the Portuguese), Fernao Rodrigues de Castello Branco, the comptroller of finance who was simultaneously acting as governor, convened a meeting of 30 leading gaunkarsof the island.Since their temples were eliminated, they were to surrender the income derived from the produce that had been used towards maintenance of temple personnel. This would now be utilized for the erection of churches on the island and for charitable deeds of the confraternity of the Holy Faith.The Portuguese retained the gaunkari system but called it comunidade. It greatly simplified village administration for the rulers.Thereon the village was fostered and developed by Portuguese influences on architecture and the depth of its history can still be felt today.The village church called Igreja de St Cruz was erected which to this date is a visual spectacle. Though instructions to build the church date back to March 5, 1546, wherein King of Portugal D Joao III instructed the vicar general at Goa, Miguel Vaz, work didn't kick off until 1555.The village is also lined with charming old houses giving passersby the feel of the idyllic Goan-Portuguese village. Even in their interior they conform to the European pattern. They're mostly built in a cubic plot with gardens in front and to the rear, a shaded porch or balcao at the entrance, additional balconies projecting from each room and wide windows.Elaborately furnished in the contemporary western style with heavily carved pieces in the drawing room, huge wall mirrors reflect the array of portraits of the ancestors. One of these gracious mansions is the bleak-looking yet stately edifice built very much in the manner of the high court at Panaji with striking Spanish-styled grilled balconies. Locals refer to it as Correio-Mor. This house is said to have belonged to the celebrated postmaster general of Goa Joaquim Tomas Xavier de Rego.Another mansion worth mention which has become more of an ancestral house for its descendants is the Dempo palace. Around 1846, Srinivasa Sinai Dempo acquired vast landed property at an auction sale. This once belonged to the Augustinian order but was confiscated by the authorities in 1835 after the expulsion of the religious congregations in Goa. This dwelling is outwardly in the Portuguese style of architecture but the living quarters of its older section are said to be traditional.Despite the onslaught of change and modernity, the old mansions of St Cruz have retained their aesthetic appeal.To this date, fractions of population continue to refer to St Cruz by its original name, Calapor. The addition of Cujira to its jurisdiction has not been able to shake the nee off.Even though new premises for Hedgewar School, Mushtifund School and Dempo HSS have been erected at Cujira, locals still swear by the convenience of the St Cruz high school and Efigenia primary school, both of which are located in the heart of the village. A government school and balwadi also serve as education outlets for the financially-challenged migrant population.St Cruz's favourite sport is volleyball and not football. You can see young boys playing volleyball each Sunday morning and the village has produced some of the most famous Goan volleyball playersCharming shops selling patties and other confectionary items continue to be thronged irrespective to the widespread variety of bakeries in the city.The village is now marred by the ugly monstrosity of the construction boom, like most other villages in the state, yet the allure of a quaint dainty hamlet continues to persist.Renowned ResidentsSt Cruz comprises a long list of illustrious citizens who have served not only the state but who've contributed to the country as well. Some of them are:Augustin Fernandes plays as a defender for Salgaocar in the I-League. In July 2015 Fernandes was drafted to play for Atletico de Kolkata in the 2015 Indian Super League (ISL). He is now a defender for ISL's FC Pune City.Anthony Xavier Moraes was the first Goan to achieve the position of chief engineer, roads and buildings, joint secretary to the government in 1929. Walter Anthony Gustave Pinto was a war hero. Often in the theatre of war, between 1943 and 1945 he saw active service in Burma and Thailand. In 1962, he served on the Sikkim Tibet frontier at an altitude of 15,000 ft during the Sino-Indian conflict.Antonio Pedro Fernandes was a diplomat for the Portuguese government. While acting in charge of the consulate from 1919 to 1921, Fernandes most solicitously arranged for 50,000 bags of rice to be dispatched weekly to the famine stricken people of Goa.Printer and publisher Antonio Caetano Fernandes, was the entrepreneurial hero of the village. He ventured into investing in a moving motor printing press and achieved tremendous success. He was the son of famous book binding businessman J D Fernandes.Francisco Paulino Dias was acknowledged as one of the greatest Goan poets in the Portuguese language. Deriving his poetic inspiration from Indian culture and tradition, his work expresses the strong flavour of the soil.Jose Vincente Baldomeiro Fernandes published a number of works in Konkani and was an active member of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal.Christovam Pinto was a member of Partido Indiano. He was thrice appointed as representative of Portuguese India in the Parliament at Lisbon. Because of his extraordinary flair for writing and journalism he was also appointed as the librarian of the prestigious Instituto Vasco Da Gama.Joaquim Luis Araujo was a Goan nationalist who operated from Bombay. He participated in the Quit India movement from there. He also was an active member of the Goan Youth League and in 1947-48 he edited Porzecho Ulhas, a Goan national weekly and participated in the demonstrations against the Portuguese institutions.The earliest medical practitioners were said to be Antonio Jose Pereira (passed out in 1806), Marcos de Araujo (passed out in 1808) and Antonio Annes (passed out in 1813). Prior to the establishment of Escola Medica in 1844, some practical medical expertise was being imparted at Velha Goa back then.Locals speakRoadsTraffic congestion is a serious problem as the village has very narrow roads. Also, migrants indulge in hawking and selling various articles on the busy roads during peak hours. This makes the roads even more congestedKishore Naik, driver, Radha taxi servicesThe 100-year-old man-made lake called Bondvol lake is unattended now. It used to collect water in the monsoon and was released later for irrigation. But now the water continuously flows without any supervision. The wealth of the village has to be reclaimedFr Alexander Pereira, parish priest, St CruzSarpanch's take:Garbage issues are rife in the village with a tonne of garbage being generated from the village on a daily basis. We are trying to acquire land for garbage management and will begin door-to-door collection in September. Traffic congestion owing to narrow roads is a serious issue. We require more funds to have better and broader roads, parking space, gardens and a community hallIndira Fernandes, Sarpanch, St Cruz"

However, come August and the rains have suddenly disappeared leaving. As the dry spell stretches, citizens are worried and farmers concerned. Regional meteorological office (RMO) says there is no cause for concern so far with the region still having 12% excess rainfall since June 1, 2016. Up to July, rain surplus in region was 57% in all with Buldhana district seeing 91% excess rainfall.For the month of August, Vidarbha is as much as 45% deficient with just 108.6mm rainfall against the expected 200.4mm. Nagpur district has recorded 55% less than normal rainfall in August till Friday. The deficiency in August is in all 11 districts. With just 12 days left in the month, deficits ranging from from 13% in Gondia district to as 65% in Chandrapur may be hard to overcome.Experts are still not sure what effect this rain gap will have on the ongoing Kharif crops. If rains continue to play truant, even Rabi season may be affected with not enough moisture in the soil.Cumulatively, since June 1, 2016, Bhandara , a rice growing district has a steep rain deficit of 22%. Nagpur and Gondia districts too have small deficits of 2 and 6% respectively. All other districts have surplus ranging from 2% in Washim district to 28% in Akola. ""This is no break in the monsoon as rain are occurring at isolated places in the region. Only in last 5-6 days there is very little rain all over. There is little chance of rain in the next few days except for areas adjoining Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh where there are good rains. This is because the monsoon current flows from Bay of Bengal to Chhattisgarh and MP and then moves to Vidarbha,"" said A D Sathe , director of the forecasting division at RMO.From August 1 to 19 Chandrapur received just 84.3mm against a normal of 242.1mm. It is followed by Yavatmal, Washim, Nagpur and Bhandara district that are deficient by 57%, 56%, 55% and 54% respectively. The other six districts which too are deficient for August are  Buldhana (-41%), Gadchiroli (-40%), Wardha (-39%), Amravati (-38%), Akola (-27%) and Gondia (-13%)."

For, they not only have to steer clear of the sewage, but also have to skilfully manoeuvre past the bulges and depressions on the road.C.V. Road, which earlier housed rice mills, is a hub of metal and plastic dealers now. Residents in the adjoining Bannimantap area too are frustrated with its neglect by the authorities. Ever since I moved here more than a year ago, I have seen sewage flowing through the road. No repairs have been undertaken to fix the problem despite it posing a threat to the residents health, said Ateeqh, who has a shop on the road.Residents of the adjoining area also complain about the virtual absence of governance in the locality. Little or no cleaning takes place in the area by the civic authorities, with mounds of waste piling up every few days. Plastic waste is routinely burnt in the lanes and bylanes of the area, not only letting out an offensive smell, but also forcing people to inhale the toxic fumes, said Aftab, a resident.Ramu, the councillor representing the area, said the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) will soon take up repaid works at a cost of Rs. 2.5 crore.Work on the 1-km C.V. Road stretch from Nelson Mandela to Pulakeshi Road, including the underground drainage and side drains, has been approved. The tender process is under way and work could start in a months time, he said.However, sources in the MCC said a majority of the shops in the area were functioning without obtaining trade licence. When MCC officials visit the area to collect tax, they are chased away. The activities in the shops include burning metal in hazardous conditions. Two to three fire accidents have taken place during the last few months, said a source, who also accused the shopkeepers of burning plastic waste."

That there is a resurgence of Goan culture is now being increasingly acknowledged and was on display as the villagers opened their church yard and hearts to everyone.One was greeted by a carnival of colours and villagers on the grounds of the Our Lady of Socorro church. The happy mood and camaraderie overflowed as one eased into the festivities. The yard was brought alive by zigzagging coloured flags while the church stood stoic, almost indulging the community celebration.The festival, in its fifth year, was originally conceived by Marius Fernandes from Divar , who is most devoted to reviving Goan traditions. That this fest also coincides with India's Independence Day makes it even more collective and welcoming. The festival has stuck to it guns of no plastic, no alcohol, no sponsorship, no contests or prizes, and most of all, no chief guests.Fernandes tells TOI, ""We want to empower women and children, remind everyone of their Goenkarponn , help each other with organizing the festival. Remind everyone that it is our festival and that the community is in control,"" he adds, ""the highlight this year is that we trained our youth to use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to spread the message and that is why we have people from as far as even Daman ."" He says he's thankful, ""for the villagers from Saligao who sent no less than four dance troupes this year"".Guests are in for a treat of liberally doled out patolles (a traditional sweetmeat of newly-harvested rice ground to a fine paste, grated coconut mixed with jaggery and steamed to perfection in turmeric leaves).While the feast is essentially celebrated as a community gathering, organized by the Socorro Socio-Art and Cultural Association - Soccorrkars invited dance troupes from nearby villages and even a troupe from Jharkhand that perhaps drew the most interest with their rhythmic slow hip and feet dance, low chants, accompanied by a solo drummer.Cultural personalities of Goa such as Alexyz, Prajal Sakhardande, Pantaleo Fernandes, Socorro de Santacruz volunteered their time, while Fr Santana Carvalho , parish priest of Socorro, took over master of ceremonies duties.It begins to feel even more culture-soaked Goans with a display of proud heirlooms, a dance troupe from far Jharkhand, visitors from across the seas, urban-settlers and Goans from hinterlands across generations with all faiths mixing against a background of a church and the India tri-colour.Ivy Rosario flew in from Goa's former colonial outlier, Daman. What drives her to make it all the way just for the fest? ""I had promised Marius and I wanted to be at this fest which is everything Goan and community-driven. I have not seen such a fest before!"""

Since the rice varieties have been discovered by these farmers, the agricultural university will give them royalty after the varieties get notified and registered by New Delhi-based Protection of Plant Varieties And Farmers' Rights Authority.As per IGKV scientists, the Tilkasturi and Korma varieties of green colour rice have been sent for testing to the Indian Institute of Rice Research in Hyderabad to test their nutritional content.Talking to TOI, IGKV's Department of Genetics and Plant Breeding's principal scientist Dr Deepak Sharma said, ""These green varieties of rice are rare of the rarest thing, which I have never come across in my entire career. IGKV is in the process of commercialising the products, as it will bring fame to the farmers of Chhattisgarh . These rice varieties are soft in quality and highly aromatic while the husk is also very thin. After being cooked, the natural green colour and aroma will appeal to rice eaters.""The farmer Prahlad, who has been growing this variety since 15 years, said, ""Korma variety should be kept unpolished. Only then will it retain its natural colour. The green colour is removed once rice sheller process is used for removing husk. Hence, it should be promoted for sale when unpolished.""""These green rice grows to a height of 125 centimetres and takes 135 days to mature while total yield is four tonnes from an acre of land.

Addressing workers and leaders at the partys district executive committee meeting here on Saturday, she also raised doubts about the misuse of funds.After Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister, he had increased the annual funds released to the State by Rs. 25,000 crore. However, the State government was not spending it properly. It was not even distributing crop loss relief to farmers who suffered drought or floods, she said. Ms. Karandlaje alleged that the money was rotting with deputy commissioners as the government had not given proper guidelines to them on how to spend it. This was despite the fact that the Prime Minister released Rs. 1,520 crore in two days after BJP leaders asked for it, he said.She also alleged that some Congress leaders were diverting rice meant for distribution among the poor and selling it to Amma canteens in the neighbouring State.Reacting to Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharges charge that the Centre was not releasing money for Railway projects in the State, Ms. Karandlaje said that the senior leader should ask Mr. Siddharamaiah to release the States share of the cost of the projects first. She, however, did not mention Mr. Kharges name.The Congress government was punishing whistle-blowers. An officer who uncovered a Rs. 2500-crore scam in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike had been transferred 20 times in less than two years. The government was misusing the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to close files of sensitive cases and give clean chit to leaders accused of serious crimes, she said. Ms. Karandlaje alleged that the State had transferred the D.K Ravi case to the Central Bureau of Investigation after allowing CID officers to destroy all evidence. People of the State have no faith in the government. They want change, she said. Even Congress MLAs were upset with the performance of the government, the BJP leader added."

The implementation of National Food Security Act and continuing with the free of cost rice would cost the exchequer an additional Rs. 1,193.30 crore per annum.The decision to implement the Act in Tamil Nadu was taken in a Cabinet meeting on the advice of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa for the welfare of the people and the Act would be implemented though it would put an additional financial burden on the State Exchequer, the release stated.The decision to implement the Food Security Act followed a communication from the Centre that if Tamil Nadu didnt implement the Act immediately, the Centre would be forced to provide rice for Above Poverty Line (APL) families only at Rs. 22.54 per kg instead of Rs. 8.30 per kg. The Hindu was the first to have reported about this earlier this month.Though as per the FSA, one-person and two-person families are entitled only for 5 kg and 10 kg rice per month respectively, the Tamil Nadu government would continue to give existing ration of 12 kg rice and 16 kg rice to these families respectively.Replacing the ration of 20 kg rice for every ration card, every member in the card would be entitled for 5 kg rice per month. For instance, in a family of seven persons, who were entitled to only 20 kg of rice for their ration card, they would now be entitled to 5 kg per person and thus would get a total of 35 kg of rice instead of the existing 20 kg per ration card per month.The Antyodaya Anna Yojana cards would continue to get 35 kg of rice per month."

From recruitment drives to the restructuring of police stations, the department is in for a major rejig in the coming months. A committee has been formed to review constables' pay scales, home minister G Parameshwara told TOI in an interview. Excerpts:Probably for the first time in recent years, the constabulary revolted. How has the government responded?The biggest problem faced by the constabulary was the overwhelming pressure on them owing to the manpower crunch. Police stations had 30% vacancies. We have put in place a three-year plan for recruitment, by the end of which at least 22,000 policemen will be added. It will also solve the problem of weekly offs, allowing constables to unwind. We are thinking of doing away with the rice benefit and transfer the money (about Rs 500) to the constables' salary.What about the salaries?We have formed a committee to study how constables' salaries can be made more respectable. Comparisons were made with their counterparts in other states so we are examining their pay scales too. We hope to make the grievance redressal system more robust. Every Friday, after the parade, constables will get time to air their grievances in front of the Station House Officer (SHO), who has to note down the problem and report how it was addressed. This will be monitored by senior officers.There were talks of restructuring city police for better work distribution...The committee has submitted its report and we are considering it. There are certain conditions which have to be met when it comes to setting up a police station - an area of 250 sqkm, population of 60,000 and crime rate of 700-800 cases per month. In a city like Bengaluru, meeting these criteria may be difficult. However, the jurisdictions of police stations need a relook. Our objective is to scientifically divide the city's area, population and workload among the existing police stations. A new division may be carved out. We are also taking steps to modernize the force.How does the department plan to bridge the gender gap in police stations?The number of women joining the force is on the rise. What's even better is that a majority of them are graduates. I attribute this to an improved image of the police force. Of the 251 women who recently completed training, 117 are BA graduates, 14 have completed MA, 16 BCom and 53 D Ed. Only 31 applicants haven't studied beyond PUC. At present, about 5% of the police staff are women. In the next five years, we want the figure to touch 20%. With more women in the force, we will require better facilities for them - be it basic amenities like toilets or addressing concerns like sexual harassment within the department. Women cops are free to complain about sexual harassment at the Friday parade by submitting their complaint in a sealed envelope."
58f68dfb7be9e031f13b7423,Paradise for birds and birders,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Paradise-for-birds-and-birders/articleshow/54802019.cms,2016-10-12,"Luxuriant hills, vast stretches of fields and mangroves, a world famous Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) also known as Carambolim lake. This is what a small village nestled in Tiswadi has to offer its visitors.A rural area adjoining Old Goa towards north and industrially-bustling Corlim in the northeast, Carambolim's habitated areas have grown over the years. Towards its south, the village is skirted by Azossim, while Goalim Moula partly skirts its western border. Life here may be slow like the train chugging along the track through its green fields, but its pockets of isolated patches and open spaces offer solace.Also known as Karmali or Kormbole, the meandering roads of this village, on the edge of khazan lands, also lead to some spots off the beaten track - the small wards of Dhado and Panch Manos. One might sight crocodiles basking in the mangroves or rousing from their slumber to quietly slither into the Cumbharjua canal that forms its eastern border.With its rich inventory of native and migrant bird species, the Carambolim lake has been a fascinating sight of a vast, lotus carpeted water body, where birders have documented around 100 bird species.Environmentalists were aghast when its western bank was reclaimed for the Karmali station, but the dust settled down long ago and birds visiting it have also adjusted to the passing trains. The reduced number of birds is attributed to other reasons, such as deterioration of water quality and increasing construction activity around its periphery.The village has had a traumatic past of two migrations on two different occasions. In the early era of the Portuguese rule, four elephants are said to have drowned in the pristine lake. For reasons unknown to people today, the carcasses of the elephants were not pulled out of the water. This caused an epidemic which triggered off an exodus from the village. Various families like the Viegas in Carmona, Barros in Velim, Lobos in Aldona and Calangute and Afonsos in St Estevam are known to have migrated from Carambolim following this unfortunate turn of events.Prior to this, the previous migration was caused by the arrival of the Portuguese missionaries in the mid-16th century. The act of conversions forced many to leave their native village and hunt for homes in other locales.Agriculture has been the main occupation of villagers for the longest time with paddy being the principal crop cultivated. Coconut, betel nut and millets (nachni) were also grown in the village, though they have dwindled in recent years.The vast Carambolim khazan, once a rice granary, has been largely abandoned for farming due to rising costs of labour. But pisciculture is thriving in its sluice gates and water bodies, often at the cost of agriculture and flooding of fields.The ancient temples in the village were dedicated to the deities of Betall, Sidnatha, Gram-Purusha, Khetrapall, Ravalnatha, Santeri, Ganesh, Vanavdeta, Butapriadhar, Fondde-Gaosalo-Purusha and Nirvaocipurusha, states an excerpt from Antonio Victor Couto's book translated by Rui Gomes Pereira Since the Portuguese were notorious for desecrating temples and mosques in Goa, the Hindu devotees transferred the image of Lord Brahma to another village of the same name, Kormoli in Sattari taluka. Formerly known as Chandiwade, the name of this village (Kormoli) was changed to Carambolim-Brama following the arrival of the idol.The Tiswadi-based Carambolim also boasts of one of the oldest churches in the state. Dedicated to St John, it was built sometime during 1714 and was originally a chapel known to have been built in 1541. It was raised to a church in 1553, during the tenure of Bishop D Joao Albuquerque.The village is considered a stronghold of the gaudas, more or less on par with other villages of Tiswadi, like Taleigao. The backward community comprises 60% of the village's total population. While the non-gaudas are mostly spread all over the village, the gaudas are concentrated in D Maria Bhat, Gavant and Parkhe Bhat.Past migrations from the village caused a vacuum, but new settlers and villagers have put the past behind them. Those who migrated to other villages have achieved success in their own spheres.While the Karmali railway station is an important medium to commute in the state, the future of the village perhaps lies in protecting the Carambolim lake from further degradation and in reviving agriculture. Otherwise, Carambolim may lose its importance and become just another suburban sprawl, a direction that many of Goa's picturesque villages seem to be heading towards.(With inputs from Paul Fernandes)POLLUTIONThe nullah that passes by the Carambolim lake is posing a major problem for us.

And if you want to learn of the sheer variety of desserts of a runny consistency the lady of such a household can prepare, this is the moment you need to seize.Catholic households in Goa are known to make rice dessert with sheaves of the season's first harvest thrown in to celebrate the konsachem fest. The equivalent of this practice can be seen on day two of Ganesh Chaturthi in Hindu homes.The preparation is strikingly similar.Rice of an aromatic variety is boiled and cooked with few soaked sabudana globules in milk. Sugar, cashewnut pieces, and a haldi leaf are added to the preparation, and the sheaves of the newly harvested rice are thrown in last. Needless to say, the aroma of the rice, the haldi leaf, and the freshly-harvested rice combine into a heavenly experience for the senses when eating this kheer.Sabudana always makes an appearance on days when Hindus are required to observe a fast or just any auspicious occasion in Hindu households.Kheers with sabudana as an ingredient are aplenty, as the globules help bring volume and give a fuller texture to the runny dishes.One homemaker in Margao prepares banana kheer during Ganesh Chaturthi with soaked sabudana, coconut milk, banana, jaggery, and the haldi leaf as its ingredients.Manganem is another favourite in many households during Ganesh Chaturthi.""Soak the chana dal for 20 minutes, Cook it, and keep it aside,"" explains Sonali Vernekar from Mapusa. ""Keep the first thick coconut milk extract that you get separately from the thin extract that you get from the grated coconut later. Cook this thin extract with jaggery, the boiled chana dal and salt. Add little sugar as this enhances the taste. Add pieces of cashewnut and roasted sesame seeds and the thick coconut milk last, and bring to a boil. Add soaked sabudana to the dish, take the dish off the gas stove, and keep it covered for 20 minutes for the sabudana to cook inside.""Manganem is also high in nutritional value and so is the moongachem konn and soji made during the festival. This is the reason these desserts are not restricted to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival alone. This is also reason to not to hold yourself back from asking for a second helping of these sweet dishes when you visit your friend's home on Ganesh Chaturthi."

Though the legends behind some of the peculiar customs lack any authoritative or convincing explanation, locals have steadfastly observed the traditions through generations. Knowledgable sources say some of the unique practices concerning Ganesh worship are rooted in incidents that may have occurred in the past and left some indelible impressions on the locals' collective psyche.While Ganesh Chaturthi is generally celebrated for days ranging from one-and-a-half days to five, seven and more days, the Desai community in Tudal hamlet of Gaodongari in Canacona celebrates the festival for an unusual period of three days. Cooking rice and performing rituals on the bank of the rivulet is a tradition that is followed here since ages, old timers in the village say, though they fail to come out with any rational explanation for the uncommon practice.In Agarwada hamlet of Pernem, Chodankar family worships clay idols of Shiva and Parvati, parents of Ganesha, instead of worshipping Ganapati Bappa himself. The tradition dating back to several generations has been religiously maintained by the family.The idol of Ganesha is always shown mounted on a rat. In order to pay their obeisance to Ganesha's vehicle, on the second day of the chavath, known as Undirbij, the elders of the house prepare a special plate, consisting of cooked food items, and keep it in the paddy field allowing rodents to relish on it.Ganesh Chaturthi celebrated among the Shetye families of Korgao in Pernem, popularly referred to as 'Chaupatitlo Ganapati' also follows a different tradition. Here, the headgear of the nearly 10 feet Ganesha changes every alternate year from a turban to a crown.What's remarkable about this custom is that the idol of Ganesha is crafted by the artists at the Shetye residence, weeks ahead of Ganesh festival. Significantly, the eyes are painted only at 12 noon on the day of Ganesh Chaturthi in the presence of most of the family members, numbering over 1,000. Sources said that the artists start making the idol of Ganesh on the day of Nagpanchami festival by using only twelve heaps of kneaded clay, symbolizing the twelve main families of the Shetye clan.""The celebration continues for five days in which our family members take part wholeheartedly. Families scattered in areas of Goa and Maharashtra come specially to our ancestral house at Pethechawada in Korgao for the festival,"" says Rajmohan Shetye, from Korgao.Folklore researcher Ulhas Prabhudessai points out to a custom in Cotigao where the idol of Ganesh is brought home the day before Ganesh Chaturthi and kept covered for two days before worshipping it on the third day. The legends behind the practice are many but none carries any authoritative explanation.In the Raikar family in Shiroda, the festival gets transformed into a grand community affair with family members numbering over 4,000, converging at the ancestral house to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi.Kanta Gawade, a folk artist from Veling, Ponda says, ""Our forefathers, working in agricultural and horticultural fields, worshipped Lord Ganesha and prayed for a bountiful, good crop. As a manner of thanksgiving, the first pinnacles of paddy of the season are offered to Ganaraya by tying it to the matoli (wooden canopy) installed over the Ganesh idol.""Though 'visarjan' of the Lord Ganesh into a water body marks the end of Ganesh Chaturthi in most homes, there are many families in South Goa where the idol is retained throughout the year to be immersed only during next year's Ganesh Chaturthi. In these households, once the 'uttar pooja' is over, the idol is placed in the pooja room for the rest of the year."

Several people who have met the affected tribals were highly critical of the government saying that the administration was completely insensitive with not even water being provided to them. They also have no power supply.South Goa district collector Swapnil Naik told TOI that he would hold a meeting with PWD assistant engineer, electricity department officials and those from the Goa Energy Development Agency (GEDA) at Ponda on Wednesday to provide the affected tribals temporary water, power and solar light facilities to comply with the directives issued by the Goa Human Rights Commission on Tuesday.AAP's Gandhi Henriques, along with his colleague Yousuf Khan, visited the affected community and distributed essentials including bags of rice and wheat, clothes and biscuits.He also offered the tribals a plot of land measuring 1,000sq m free of cost, either at Chandor or Bicholim.

Anand told a special meeting of rice millers here on Wednesday.A release later said that 57,781 metric tonnes of custom milled rice worth Rs. 134 crore was due from 115 rice millers from 2010-11 to 2014-15. Mr. Anand also told the millers that paddy would be allotted to them for custom milling as per milling capacity if 75 per cent of the dues were cleared now and balance 25 per cent by January 31. Those who delivered 50 per cent dues now should complete the remaining process by March 31.No relaxation will be allowed for millers whose delivery was below 100 metric tonnes. The rice should be delivered in the gunny bags of millers. Remission of cash was also allowed as per the market rates if they were not in a position to deliver custom milled rice.Responding to their request to exempt them from payment of interest on dues, Mr. Anand said there was no such possibility as the civil supplies corporation was paying interest running into crores of rupees on cash credit owing to purchase of paddy from farmers. He advised the millers to make the best use of the opportunity given to them.The release added that the total quantity of paddy misappropriated in the five years was 86,025 tonnes.

At present, the bill for rice subsidy is around Rs. 2,393 crore.The implementation of the NFSA has been necessitated by the Centres decision to increase, effective November, the rate of rice meant for Above the Poverty Line cardholders from Rs. 8.3 per kg to Rs. 22.54 per kg. Also, an additional allocation of nearly 28,000 tonnes a month would be stopped. Consequent to these decisions, the State would have to incur an additional expenditure of about Rs. 2,730 crore every year. The Centres actions were attributed to the State governments non-implementation of the Act. In view of by-poll to the constituency of Tiruparankundram and elections to Thanjavur and Aravakurichi, the revised scale of supply will begin in these constituencies only after the election process is over.The order also stated that the government would constitute a State Food Commission. The District Revenue Officers would also be re-designated as District Grievance Redressal Officers to handle complaints on non-distribution of foodgrains."

""We have been able to reach out to 55 needy people so far, courtesy the reception from the public,"" says Padmanabhan Gopalan of No Food Waste, a city-based NGO, which is instrumental in launching the enterprise along with the local restaurant Kollywood Cafe.The food and beverage ATM is an initiative to collect surplus food from the haves and distribute it among have-nots. All one has to do is pack their excess food, bring it to the cafe and place it in the sidewalk refrigerator set up outside Kollywood Cafe, RS Puram. The ATM, which was set up on August 14, has the capacity to feed around 20-30 people on a daily basis.""The project is solely based on human relationships, goodwill and crowdfunding. We have been providing coupons to customers who walk into the cafe and educate them about the initiative. They in turn pass it on to the needy and tell them about the ATM. We are primarily concentrating on rag pickers and their children. Since, they do not have access to the media or other means of communication; it's a tad difficult to reach out to every one of them. As part of No Food Waste, we had worked with malnourished children in the Vellalore dumpyard and had a mechanism to feed them. We are using the takeaways from that project in the food and beverage ATM. We have full-time volunteers who are involved with our projects and are using their services to reach out to maximum number of people,"" says Padmanabhan.The public is encouraged to bring their surplus edible food. Perur Hariharan Suresh, who runs the restaurant, tells us, ""We had to fill the refrigerator with the restaurant's food on the first two days, but the public has taken in charge now. Though we encourage food items that last 2-3 days, we have been receiving food items like biriyani, parotta and curd rice as well. We have been able to feed at least 10-12 people every day. The restaurant will be open till 12 pm and if someone wants food after that, all they have to do to show the food coupon to the security at the ATM. The coupon will collected from them and handed over to the next customer, and the process will be repeated. The ATM will be open all days."" Padmanabhan adds, ""Unfortunately, some of the food items that we received were on the verge of getting stale, which is why we are encouraging people to bring chapathis, fruits, snacks and other raw food materials. We also want to stress upon the fact that the other person's stomach is not a dumpyard. So, we request the public to donate only fresh food.""In an attempt to reach out to more people, the group is now trying to collaborate with restaurants in the city. ""Tying up with restaurant chains in the city would help sustain the initiative in the long run. We will be holding a meeting with the restaurants in the first week of September to discuss the same. After we gauge the reception for the ATM at RS Puram, we will contemplate setting up more food and beverage ATMs in the city. We have started identifying places for the same. We want to reach out to all- the helpless poor, who cannot afford a good meal and a middle-class man who has lost his wallet and is hungry, but has no money to eat, ""Padmanabhan sums it up."

At a press conference held at the TNCC headquarters here, he denied that there was unease in the partnership, reportedly over the DMKs reluctance to award more seats to the Congress in the upcoming local body elections.Mr. Thirunavikkarasar, who appeared to have been irked over questions about the seeming strain in the alliance, said, We have made clear that the alliance will continue. I say this only because you keep asking about it, he said. His party would work for the DMK candidates in the November 19 elections for Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and Thirupparankundram constituencies.As for the local body elections, we have completed seat-sharing for some districts. For the others, we will resume talks when the election notification is issued again, he said. When pointed out that Congress as well as DMK candidates had submitted nominations for some seats, Mr. Thirunavukkarasar said that it had occurred because of the ongoing talks. The last date for withdrawal had not lapsed; candidates of either party would have withdrawn nominations once it became clear who would contest there, he said.Referring to BJP leader and Union minister Pon Radhakrishnans comments blaming the Congress for not forming the Cauvery Management Board during the UPA regime, Mr. Thirunavukarasar quipped, You (Radhakrishnan) meet your Prime Minister and ask him to form the Cauvery Management Board and help the farmers of Tamil Nadu.The TNCC president also requested the Central government to withdraw the hike in the price of rice distributed to people above the poverty line from Rs. 22.53 per kg to Rs. 8.3 per kg. The hike will impose a Rs. 2,100-crore burden on the State government. I request the Central government to reduce the prices, he said.He also called for restrictions on the import of crackers made in China so that the local fireworks industry that employed 2.5 lakh people could be saved.Aid for kin of cadreThe party announced financial support of over Rs. 5 lakh to the family of Swaminathan, a party functionary who died in a road accident in Thanjavur on Saturday evening.

We will also start a signature campaign against it, he said.Mr. Thirunavukkarasar extended his partys support for the protest against the proposed UCC. We realise that the minorities are against it. We have always stood with the minorities and will fight alongside them. Even the New Education Policy of this government is against minorities and we condemn such policies, he said."

File Photo: M. GovarthanThe Tamil Nadu government had faced Hobsons choice before it decided to implement the National Food Security Act (NFSA).A few weeks ago, the government was administered a shock when it got a letter from the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, stating that with effect from November, the State would no longer get about 1.26 lakh tonnes of rice at Rs. 8.3 per kg. Besides, additional allocation of rice would be stopped. The reason cited was simple: non-implementation of the NFSA. In monetary terms, the decisions meant that the State government would have to bear about Rs.2,730 crore more annually. Originally, rice subsidy was estimated to cost around Rs. 2,393 crore for the current year.In Tamil Nadu, where the politics of rice has always dominated the public discourse, the State government had its own reasons for not implementing the law for over three years. Apart from various reasons, the fundamental difference between the Tamil Nadu government and the Centre is that the former favours the universal PDS, whereas the latter, targeted PDS. Neither side has budged from its position.As part of the NFSA, only 50.55 per cent of the States population  around 3.6 crore out of 7.2 crore  is eligible to be given rice at a subsidised price. Each person is entitled to five kg per month. So, if a family card has 10 beneficiaries, it will get 50 kg a month. Those who are eligible are called priority households and those who are not, non-priority households. Under its scheme, the State government has, so far, been providing rice free of cost virtually to all family card holders, irrespective of economic background. Till now, around 1.92 crore card holders have been getting rice free and the maximum quantity is 20 kg per card per month. If one were to go by stipulations of the NFSA strictly, the present coverage would undergo drastic changes, a scenario those in power can ill afford.This is why the State government has chosen to combine the essential provisions of the Act with some of its traditional practices, explains a senior official. While keeping the minimum entitlement at 12 kg per card per month, it has removed the ceiling on the quantity of rice to be provided. If a card has only one beneficiary, it will fetch 12 kg. If there are two beneficiaries, such a card will get 16 kg and for three, 20 kg. In respect of those cards having four or more beneficiaries, the entitlement of five kg per person will operate. Consequently, a total of eight lakh tonnes more will be required annually, taking the total requirement to 44 lakh tonnes. This means that the additional financial commitment will be at least Rs. 1,193 crore.The State governments various demands, such as a legally binding assurance on the issue price for the non-priority households and 75 per cent coverage of urban population, have not been met with.Confirming this, an official in the Union Ministry points out that the Centre has issued an order to the State on rice allotment as per the NFSA.

Most of them advised farmers to use micro irrigation systems like drip irrigation and sprinklers to grow crops.While discussing 'Minimizing water use in agriculture' here at the ICAR-Indian Institute of Water Management (IIWM), the agricultural scientists expressed concern over declining per capita availability of surface and groundwater resources in India. As demand for water is increasing in other sectors, including industry, providing water to agriculture has become a challenge. ""If we fail to use water efficiently, we cant meet the water demand in future,"" said an expert.Himanshu Pathak, director of National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, said climate change has become a major problem in the world. Due to the impact of climate change, drought, flood and other natural calamities occur across the globe. It badly impact water resources too. ""So to save rainwater and use the existing water resources judiciously are a big challenge for us,"" he added.Principal scientist at IIWM Gouranga Kar said micro irrigation can bring in big change in use of water. ""We can't check population or industry, but we can control use of water.""He suggested three tricks to minimize water use in agriculture. Cropping system needs to be changed. ""We have to develop seeds which can be grown with minimum water. Second, we have to recharge the groundwater by preserving the rainwater. Third, use of micro irrigation system in agriculture,"" he said.Director of IIWM SK Ambast said micro irrigation is considered as a very economic and efficient way for irrigation."

In desserts there was sabudana pudding with rich creamy bliss of sabudana mixed with berries. Sabudana crispies served with tamarind sauce were also liked by many.Eateries were busy experimenting with the fasting menu like mini thalis for the health freaks.""It is not just quantity but also quality,"" said Vikas Sharma , who fasted during Navratri. He admits that his fast, which he has been observing for the last 34 years, faced a stiff challenge in the wake of the delicacies being offered by the local restaurants.""This time we had much variety in bakery items,"" he added.Nilesh Garg of Udham Singh Nagar said, ""Fasting has become difficult if not an impossible during Navaratri . One has to follow a strict vegetarian diet during this time and I like nuts, sabudana khichdi and special fasting curd and want the eateries to keep it on their regular menu.""Harsh Oswal, a city-based bakery owner said, ""The demand for these special matthis and biscuits is growing and we are doing brisk business during Navratri. We did a lot of research on special food for fast and now these special biscuits, matthis, cakes and bhujia are selling like hot cakes.

However, fasting must be done in a healthy manner while making sure you remain energized throughout the day.""Dr Avnita , a dietician from Model Town, said, ""Fasting can be a little tedious especially for stomach. Long gaps between meals could lead to acidity and one may end up ruining their metabolism. Eating small meals like these baked items is healthy as the base is of the same flour chestnut and buckwheat flour. Sabudana, rajgira , buckwheat and saamak rice are rich in carbohydrates and proteins so they can also be taken on a regular basis. Also, as the season is changing one must avoid foods that generate a lot of heat in the body. That is why onion and garlic are avoided during fast. One can opt for cool foods like curd topped with fruits. Even eating salads can help curb cravings.""City-based nutritionist Dr Simrat Kathuria said , ""Liquid intake is also advised like milk, coconut water, lemon water, buttermilk and fresh juices that can help detox.""She added, ""Balancing everyday eating patterns with controlled eating, which is done during fast, must be practiced on regular basis. It will not only help in controlling weight but also improves digestion and energy, prevents diseases and promote a feeling of well being ."""

""Inside the ring, she is all fired up,"" said her trainer Asit Kumar Saha, leaving it unsaid what she might be like outside.Galvanized by Sakshi Malik's bronze at the Rio Olympic Games, the 26-yearold woman wrestler -the most accomplished in the state with two medals under her belt -is now determined to make it big in the global arena.""Sakshi's feat has inspired me to win medals for my country at the international level,"" said Runu, as she watched her two-year-old son run amok on the wrestling mat, sometimes jumping on the other women wrestlers or smothering them with kisses. ""Wrestling runs in his blood,"" she smiled, her kohllined eyes following him.She might be the seniormost woman wrestler in the state, but when it comes to playing with her son, she turns into an adolescent girl, doing cartwheels in the air and breaking into somersaults. But not all is fun and frolic for Runu, who had to work hard to earn her two medals -a silver at the junior National Games and bronze at Federal Games in 2012. Now, to achieve her Olympics dream, she has decided to leave home and live at Panchanan Byayam Samiti at Jorabagan in north Kolkata, the biggest and the best facility in the entire state. ""It is difficult to commute from Howrah. So I stay here so that I do not waste any moment to realise my dream,"" Runu said. Though the only place in Bengal that has a wrestling mat, only 20 women train there. Of them, merely three to four were regulars, said Saha. Among them are Pinky Shashmal, whose father is a tea vendor at Liluah, and Bela Saha, whose father sells scrap.After practice gets over, Runu, along with her fellow wrestlers, returns to her shared accommodation in the club, where she boils rice and makes dal and fish on her stove; fearing indigestion, outside food is not really an option either for her or her son.Before Sakshi became her role model, Runu would idolise boxer Mary Kom from Manipur. ""Both of us are in combat sports,"" she said. Just as it has been for Kom, Runu's never-say-die spirit comes in handy not only in competition but in life, too. Like Kom, who grew amid penury in Manipur, Runu has had a hard life. Not only did she have to fight poverty at her humble home in Howrah's Salap, she also had to struggle against resistance from society. ""It is difficult for a girl, no matter what you try to do,"" Runu said.In a jersey and shorts, Runu looks more like a rookie than the combative wrestling exponent and trainer that she is. But her list of achievements tells a different story , one of her biggest triumphs being tackling stereotypes head-on. Slogging it out in the wrestling ring might take up the lion's share of her day, but she loves visiting the salon, catch movies with her friends, and above all, raise her child. ""The biggest hurdles are in our mind,"" Runu said.It's, however, a hard and long way ahead: the ring demands the highest level of fitness and a diet that Runu, Pinky or Bela can't afford. The trickle of donations is gratefully accepted but isn't enough. But what they don't lack is inspiration. Runu, who hadn't stepped on a wrestling mat till 2010, is convinced if Sakshi could, she can too."

Before the brain conjures up a macabre vision, local elders will remember that it was the dear departed that the bridal couple sought. Given the importance that ancestors have in Indian culture, the couple, along with their family, would organize an elaborate meal for the poor of the village in honour of departed souls. Today this tradition is well on its way out.Bhikareanchem Jevonn, Bhik'ream Jevonn or Bhuim Jevonn is a ritual meal held for the poor in honour of one's ancestors and is usually organized a few days before a wedding or ordination in a Christian family. ""For a couple of days before the wedding, preferably on a Tuesday, the otherwise unfortunate folk are treated to a lavish feast known as Bhikareanchem Jevonn or beggars' lunch,"" says priest and writer Fr Nascimento Mascarenhas This traditional Christian wedding custom continues, albeit in a sporadic manner.Traditionally, seven or nine people classified as poor are invited from the village. ""The Christians have a Bhikareanchem Jevonn just once, around the time of a wedding, and it must not be confused with the shraddh that Hindus conduct every year. The Bhikareanchem Jevonn is not similar to the devkarem either that Hindus have, which is a thanksgiving to God.For the Christian community it is to seek blessings of God for the newly wedded couple through the poor,"" writer and researcher Maria de Lourdes Bravo da Costa Rodrigues says, quoting from her ongoing research on Goan food traditions.The custom requires a plate of food to be placed outside the house, near the gate, for a crow to feed on, and only after a crow eats the food does the Bhikareanchem Jevonn commence. Goans settled in Karachi, Pakistan, have an interesting take on this tradition. It is said that the couple would go outside the house with a bottle of fine Scotch whiskey or some other liquor and break the bottle on the compound wall to appease the souls of their beloved dead.In earlier days, guests would be invited to sit on a bamboo mat known as souiem. A patraouli (plate made of jackfruit tree leaves woven together with sticks from coconut tree leaves) is placed before each one of them. The special invitees are then treated to a sumptuous spread that includes mouth-watering preparations of pork, beef, fish, rice and a curry of a special type called samarachi koddi, which is cooked with dry prawns and mango sol (dry, unripe, salted mango).And what is a Goan meal without ample quantities of the local feni?""We have to always appease the souls, and in Konkani tradition there is a special prayer for the wandering soul. In fact, during the Bhikareanchem Jevonn there is one person who represents the wandering soul - often called 'sandlolo atmo',"" Rodrigues says.As the hosts, it is the duty of the engaged couple to serve the ""poor"" because it is through them that the departed forbearers of the family make their presence felt. If, for some reason, the couple does not hold a meal for the poor of the village, the poor are given one measure of rice and some money.""The Bhikareanchem Jevonn has special significance among Christians and the intention behind the ceremony is to remember and pray for the dead ancestors of the family. Generally the 'beggars' are selected carefully, to correspond in sex and age to recently departed members of the family at the respective times of their death,"" Mascarenhas says.During the lunch preparation, certain traditional songs are sung. These are called 'zotis' and are basically prayers for the engaged couple, wishing them a happy and long wedded life and lots of children.""Noman, Noman, Noman Bapa re vivaNoman, Noman, Putra, Ora Viva tanduanc bensanvSorgimchi sorgimche Ankvar Moriek""Ask any couple today and most may have not heard of these 'zotis'. With the passage of time the custom of Bhikareanchem Jevonn has been diluted to a point where most Goans have forgotten about it. Today, the jevonn has morphed into a common meal for relatives, friends and neighbours held a few days prior to the wedding.""Christians have, over the years, adapted and adopted various practices and today not many offer the Bhikareanchem Jevonn. They see no need for the tradition. There is the trend to have a small meal at home. Some do donate some money or food to orphanages and old age homes, which as a practice is good,"" Rodrigues says.The origin of the practice is slightly hazy, though some historians say that the early Goan Christians adopted a Hindu practice, which, over the years, came to become a way of seeking blessings of ancestors.""In the Hindu community, the practice of devkarem is not intended as a remembrance of the ancestors of the family. During the devkarem, a married woman will serve the bride-to-be a meal in the form of sivrak - essentially vegetarian preparations  and ghodxem  a semi-solid sweet dish, while also placing in the bride's lap two coconuts and a sari. A prayer is also performed before the family God,"" says Mascarenhas."
58f698627be9e031f13b823d,'Act of God': Ruinous flooding catches Louisiana off guard,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/Act-of-God-Ruinous-flooding-catches-Louisiana-off-guard/articleshow/53717107.cms,2016-08-16,"BATON ROUGE (Louisiana): An act of God is how some are describing it, a catastrophic 48-hour torrent of rain that sent thousands of people in Louisiana scrambling for safety and left many wondering how a region accustomed to hurricanes could get caught off guard so badly.At least six people have been killed and more than 20,000 have had to be rescued since Friday in some of the worst flooding the state has ever seen.A seventh body was pulled from floodwaters on Monday, said Casey Rayborn Hicks, a spokeswoman for the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office. A volunteer patrolling in his boat found the body, and sheriff's units confirmed the discovery. The manner of death and identification  confirmation of a flood-related death  will come from the coroner's office, Hicks said.As of Monday, the rain had mostly stopped, but rivers and creeks in many areas were still dangerously bloated and new places were getting hit by flooding. In areas south of Baton Rouge, people were filling sandbags, protecting their houses and bracing for the worst as the water worked its way south. In Ascension Parish officials said some small towns have already been swamped by floods.More than 11,000 people were staying in shelters, with a movie studio and a civic center that usually hosts concerts and ballets pressed into service.""It was an absolute act of God. We're talking about places that have literally never flooded before,'' said Anthony ""Ace'' Cox, who started a Facebook group to help collect information about where people were stranded. He was in Baton Rouge to help his parents and grandparents, who got flooded out.""Everybody got caught off guard,'' he said.Forecasters said one reason was the sheer, almost off-the-charts intensity of the storm and the difficulty of predicting how bad it would be.Meteorologist Ken Graham of the National Weather Service's office in Slidell said forecasters alerted people days in advance of the storms. The forecasts Thursday were for 8 inches of rain, with higher totals expected in some areas.But Graham emphasized that forecasting exactly how much rain is going to fall and where is nearly impossible. ""It's one thing to say we're getting set up for a lot of rain. It's another thing to say where is this going to be,'' he said.Some areas, such as the town of Zachary, received more than 2 feet of rain in a 48-hour period that ended Saturday morning. Another hard-hit area, Livingston, got nearly 22 inches over the same stretch.Graham said the odds of that much rain were 1 in 500 in some places, and 1 in 1,000 in others.Army National Guard vehicles travel through floodwaters as rescue operations continue after heavy rains inundated parts of Louisiana. (AP photo)Those rainfalls sent river levels in the region to historic highs, in some cases shattering the old records mostly set during the 1983 floods.Unlike in a hurricane, when shelters are established well in advance by parish governments and the Red Cross when the threat becomes obvious, shelters for those driven from their homes by the flooding were set up more haphazardly by parish officials.As the scope of the disaster became clear, churches, schools and other places opened their doors to take evacuees. Shelters filled up so fast that some people had to sleep on the floor Saturday night because not enough cots had arrived. And some shelters had to shut down when they, too, started to take on water.Marc and Crystal Matherne and their three children loaded up their cars with their three dogs and drove out of their flooded Baton Rouge neighborhood on Sunday before the water got too deep to pass.After a night in the shelter, Marc Matherne planned to head back to see if he could help stranded neighbors. His wife said she felt pangs of ""survivor guilt,'' knowing that their home was probably still dry while so many neighbors had flood damage.""I want to blame somebody because of all the hurt that's going on, but I don't know if anybody knew'' how bad the flooding would be, she said. ""It just seemed like a normal event for us, but it wasn't.''A Louisiana Army National Guard dump truck that drove off the road is submerged in flood waters. (AP photo)Volunteers have been dropping off supplies and food like jambalaya or red beans and rice at shelters. They have also been going out in boats  locally referred to as the ""Cajun Navy''  to rescue people, supplementing the efforts of National Guardsmen, state officials and Coast Guardsmen in high-water vehicles, boats and helicopters.Governor John Bel Edwards defended the state's response, saying the unprecedented flooding had ""presented tremendous challenges for everyone.''""But I'm very proud of the effort that we're making. More than anything else, I'm proud that Louisianians are taking care of their own and people are being neighbors to one another,'' he said, stressing that search and rescue operations were still ongoing.Lt Davis Madere of the Louisiana Department of Wildlife & Fisheries, who spent days rescuing people and their animals, said the floodwaters are a potential minefield of submerged vehicles, fences and mailboxes that can trip up boats.Above the water, he said, snakes trying to escape the deluge have been spotted in trees, and rescuers must be careful of power lines that are close overhead because the water is so high.National Guard Col Ed Bush said parish officials want the volunteer rescuers to coordinate more with the authorities overseeing the rescue effort.""What they're trying to do is prevent overzealous people from getting stuck themselves. We've had a couple of examples of that,'' Bush said.The slow-moving, low-pressure system moved into Texas , but the National Weather Service warned there is still a danger of new flooding, as the water works its way toward the Gulf of Mexico."

Whoever comes to eat, wonders why Ive price it so low.One would think, this would have spared them of competition, given the taste of the idlis. Not really, she says. Walk a few ten meters to the left and turn right to the main road, and there is a new outlet.Taking a cue from the couple, some others have set shop in the vicinity of the lane, for the same price.Earlier, people from the government hospital on the main road, would walk down the lane of Poonthottam to eat.They make Rs.150 daily.Ask Gowramma if she had thought of increasing the price by just a rupee to double the daily earnings, and she seemedconvinced that it would not work.What if customers stop coming? What if they go elsewhere she worries, lazily lying down by the fire place, winding up the days business by forenoon. Their three daughters and a son, are in Chennai and Hosur, with their families, leading lives of their own.The world may have moved on weakening the value of a rupee.

While most farmers manage to get around 8-10 quintals of ragi from one acre, this group is reaping 18-20 quintals from the same area.The Guli Vidhana technique is similar to the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), popularly known as Madagascar method of cultivatio n. The farmers in Haveri district have designed and developed a system that works on simple steps which can be adopted by all farmers.One of the farmers in Chinnikatte village in Byadagi taluk, Shrenik Raj told TOI that t he SRI method was followed across the country for paddy cultivation.""But, we have adopted the method for cultivation of ragi,"" the farmer said.He added that Norman Uphoff, professor of government and international agriculture at Cornell University in America , who visited the region in 2006 had acknowledged the unique practice. ""When Norman visited our village, he prepared a report on this method and published it on the university's website. This move opened the eyes of many farmers, who were on the verge of sacrificing the method in their eagerness to cultivate commercial crops,"" Raj said.Mukappa Pujar, another farmer who has benefited from Guli Vidhana, said, ""We plough the land twice till it reaches fine tilt. We then add manure to the soil at the rate of7-8 tonnes per acre. Before transplanting, we apply handfuls of manure of vermin-compost into the pits. This step increases the growth and enhances yield. After 15 days, we transplant the saplings into pits dug up in the field.""Convener of Sahaja Samruddha, G Krishna Prasad said that the organization was increasing awareness about the benefits of the method across the state.""This method of cultivation, used to cultivate Guliragi or Nettiragi, was possibly developed before SRI was devised to improve rice production in Madagascar in the early 1980s,"" he said.""Inspired by the results of this method in Haveri, we experimented with it in Kanakapur and found that granule was less and straw was high, in comparison to the improved varieties of finger millets. Farmer gets good quantities of grain and fodder simultaneously. For consumers, ragi grown using this method has good nutritional value and aroma,"" said Prof N Devakumar , nodal officer, Research Institute on Organic Farming, UAS, GKVK, Bengaluru."

The only major incentive being offered now is interest subvention. If a person does not get the capital, what help s/he will get from the interest subsidy, former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said after his weekly janata darbar on Tuesday.Modi said every sector had a different policy, but now all have come under one umbrella. Textile, IT or hospital  every sector has different requirements and accordingly their policies had been designed. However, now that all have been merged under one head, these sectors may face operational problems, he said.The former aide of CM Nitish Kumar took on his Mondays statement when he had said that multiple business organizations were opening their chapters in the state, but the Bihar government only recognized Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) and Bihar Industries Association (BIA). Nitish doesnt like national level organizations such as CII or ICC because they praise PM Narendra Modi. The CM gets angry because they openly fault his policies at the Udyami Panchayat, he said.Modi said the state government has withdrawn over 90% subsidies offered in the last policy because it faced revenue crisis after enforcement of total prohibition in Bihar. The government has made up its mind that it does not want industrialization in Bihar. Otherwise, instead of cutting down on the subsidies, they would have increased it. Couple it with the deteriorating law and order and anyone can guess why no industries are willing to come here, he said.He cited the example of rice mills, saying most of them were on the verge of closure due to state governments policies. Of the Rs8,000 crore investment that came to Bihar in the last 10-12 years, Rs6,500 crore was from agri-based industries. Earlier, they used to get over 40% subsidy, but now its only interest subvention. Why will anyone come here? he asked."

At a meeting at the Collectorate on Thursday with the stakeholders, it was decided to lift paddy from the fields at Purakkad, a place hit by the non-cooperation of the millers agents.Cause of disputeThe millers had been complaining that the quality of paddy received from some of the padasekharams was not up to the mark. Their contention was that the stipulated quantity of rice wont be available upon milling of the sub-standard paddy. The millers are bound to give 68 kg of rice for every 100 kg of paddy collected from the farmers. On the other hand, farmers were of the view that pressurising tactics were being employed by the agents.

But every so often there comes a study or research that turns conventional wisdom on its head and everything you knew to be heart-unfriendly, in a heartbeat, is stripped of its status as a villain. Egg yolk  can't be so bad for the heart; exercise, well don't get worked up about it, your heart will do as fine a job of beating without all that huffing and lifting; fat can't be so bad, otherwise the porcine population would have been decimated. And so the list of studies debunking theories that we've held on to as the gospel truth keeps surfacing with alarming regularity. And, you wonder if you should also, accordingly, be revising and reviewing your cardiac care strategy with every new counter study..Sorry, guys, if this comes as a heart-break of sorts, but before you ditch the exercise and diet plan, listen to what a few well-known heart specialists from the city have to say about conventional wisdom in matters of heart. Take heart from it, we say, and keep 'em ticking and pumping as healthy hearts are wont to...There's no argument about it that a high-carbohydrate diet results in extra calories, which causes obesity; can lead to early diabetes, and the extra calories get deposited in the body as fat. When it comes to salt, it has been seen that simple salt restriction and lifestyle modification are often enough to control BP, and reduce the load on the heart. A low-salt diet always works. People in Tamil Nadu consume a lot of rice and it's advisable they cut down on carbs and increase protein intake. For one meal, they can opt for wheat and wheat products like chappatis, upma, and dalia. Fat should be taken in moderation, but not egg yolk, red meat and meat fat. White meat like fish, chicken, and white of egg are safe fats. We will do ourselves a world of good by going for one serving of fresh fruits and salad every day. Fresh fruits are rich in antioxidants. Those who drink alcohol should drink in moderation. Whatever people eat, they should keep a close watch on their calorie intake. Keeping one's weight under control and exercising every day will definitely help in keeping the heart healthy. These days many youngsters are getting heart attacks, and it's important for the 20-30 age-group to keep a close watch on their weight and play some game regularly. Smoking is strictly prohibited if you want to keep your heart healthy. It is harmful for the lungs, for the heart, causes cancer and vascular damage. Finally, it's nice to see that so many people in our city are taking time off for their walks.The basic thing here is that one should not go by one study or survey alone. What is the majority opinion  the one that all the leading doctors across the world go by? What is the unanimous agreement in the field of medicine as far as heart ailments go these days? There are three points here. One, diabetes and hypertension are the two major killers of the heart, and no one disputes this. So, one must cut down on the intake of sugar and go for a balanced diet, something that contains 30% carbs, 20% fat, 30% protein, vitamins, etc. Two, cut the carbs, and salt intake. At present, we Indians, and especially down south, we consume far too much rice and wheat, as well as grains. Prudence suggests that we reorient our dietary patterns, and prudence also suggests we reduce the intake of salt to the bare essentials. All these appalam, pappadam, pickles we eat  these were included at a time when our forefathers used to work in the sun, and the sodium content in these foods were needed to sweat it out. But you and I don't sweat at all, and this leads to sodium accumulation. So, we must keep our salt intake to about 5gm per day. And even for carbs, go for ones low on the glycemic index. And, three, exercise. It has been unanimously agreed that the human body needs exercise right from birth till death. So, light exercise every day, all days, is a must.Most of these studies that contradict conventional studies are without basis and they are not even clinically proven. The Chennai diet has more of carbohydrates. The south Indian diet  idli, dosa, puri  everything is loaded with fat and carbs. Consumption of carbs should be reduced. Smoking is a major risk factor. Salt consumption should be reduced. One does not need to totally avoid salt. Even if you are hypertensive, a daily intake of 3-5gm of salt should be fine. Be careful not to add extra salt to your diet, like adding salt to curd rice. Avoid pickles and the famous gun powder.Chicken, fish and egg white are OK. Avoid egg yolks because they have been proven to have a high levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. Mutton, prawns, crabs, squids have high cholesterol.Chennai is polluted, but pollution per se does not affect the heart. If there are lung and respiratory problems, it can affect the heart adversely by putting pressure on it. Try to avoid a smoke-filled environment, and never allow yourself to become a passive smoker."

This in a country where the monthly minimum wage is around $100.Incredible! she gasps, and returns the beans -- a staple of Venezuelan cuisine to the shelf.In recent months, the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro has begun to relax its price control system, allowing food sales at market prices in several Venezuelan states and, to a limited degree, in the capital Caracas.That is a sea change for a country where strict price controls had been imposed since 2003.In a way, the government has turned a blind eye to this with all the regulations they have implemented, said Asdrubal Oliveros, head of Ecoanalitica consultants.This has allowed many companies, many importers to start bringing in products, and those products are being sold at black market prices.Strict price controlsMany economists blame the scarcity on the strict price controls, together with tight currency exchange limits and Venezuelas over-dependence on its vast oil reserves, which has made it rely on imports for goods it once made at home.Lacking easy access to greenbacks, businesses are starved for U.S. dollars needed to buy supplies and equipment available only abroad. Now that the price control system is crumbling, Venezuelan businessmen are starting to bring in imports again  but at a high price.High inflationThere is plenty, but everything is super expensive and imported because nothing is made here, said Mendoza, a 75 year-old retiree, speaking at a supermarket in a posh Caracas neighbourhood.Venezuela is paying a heavy price for neglecting agribusiness and food production over the years to concentrate on petroleum, the source of 96 per cent of its foreign currency. With global oil prices in a slump, the countrys economy is in a tailspin and inflation is out of control.The IMF predicts that Venezuelas inflation rate, already the worlds highest, will reach 475 per cent by year's end  and with no changes, a whopping 1,660 per cent in 2017.

INTACH, under its cultural heritage programme, has joined hands with the Daricha Foundation, which also works to revive tribal and folk arts, to give alpana a fresh lease of life.INTACH is now exploring whether it can be made into a source of revenue for girls from underprivileged sections.Interestingly, also involved in this revival effort is artist Rabi Biswas, who was fascinated by this art form at a young age and learnt it from his grandmother and village elders. Today, he gives gives lecture demonstrations (lec-dem) and is regarded as an authority in this art form. He is also the pivot around which many revival efforts are woven.Although there is little awareness about alpana among the youth of West Bengal, it has generated interest among people across the seas who see in it a unique art form.Ian Beed, a religious studies scholar from Florida State University, told The Hindu after attending a lec-dem that he was fascinated by the way alpana provided women a vehicle for expression, irrespective of their caste or creed.Alpana is intrinsically linked with religious austerity (called brotos or vrat) practised by women of mostly rural West Bengal for the well-being of the family.Urban women until recently also observed such pujas, whose closure would always be marked by a special puja and alpana drawing with special motifs. So if it is to propitiate Goddess of wealth Lakshmi, it would involve her carrier, the owl, a granary, a conch shell and lotus flower motifs.Young girls and married women alike would draw these designs on walls and floors of their mud houses using rice powder paste."

Sowing of pulses that was expected on 21.08 lakh hectare has already touched 24.35 lakh hectare, registering an increase of about 3 lakh hectare.The department was expecting oil seeds' plantation in 35.67 lakh hectares but it rose to 40.09 hectares by the second week of August.Sowing of cereals has reached up to 78%. Rice has registered about 67% sowing, so far. Sources in the department said scanty rain in June led to lesser sowing of cereals.Of the available area, overall sowing has touched 123% in Pune, 110% in Aurangabad and 103% in Kolhapur. In Amravati, Latur and Nashik areas sowing is over has reached over 90% while in Konkan and Nagpur it has touched 75% mark."

He was hardly interested in his family business (his father and elder brother are wholesale rice traders). He claimed he would develop an app of his own. But the second-year student ended up behind the bars with charges of cyber stalking and money extortion slapped against him.However, Kishan is not the only stalker arrested this year. The cyber cell of Kolkata Police is swamped with online harassment and extortion complaints  there has been a whopping 255.8% rise in such cases in the state between 2011 and 2015. The figure for Kolkata is scarier. It shows a 933.3% jump during the same period. In the past six months, there has been a further 5% spurt.""We hardly had three to five such online cases till about 2012. Now, there are about five such cases each month where students turned out to be either online victims or the abuser,"" said a detective department officer.A recent survey by a private body  Uninor  that has been shared with CID has found that one out of two schoolkids were victims of cyber stalking in the country. The survey, which covered 10,500 children in 29 schools, also found that 30% of children who regularly accessed internet had experienced some kind of cyber harm, including cyber stalking, cyber bullying, hacking and defamation. Among them, just 34% spoke to their parents about their online activities.""The smartphone revolution has left us burdened with cases of online trolling. In many cases, these are nothing less than character assassination and sexual abuse. Unlike the computer where you need to log in and log off, there is no concept of logging off from your mobile. With wireless file-sharing technologies easily accessible, your personal data can become public if you are careless about the way you handle your phone,"" explained an investigator.But in many cases, not being selective also leads to trouble. For example, a 15-year-old girl from a reputable English-medium school was stalked online by a 21-year-old school dropout after a chance encounter with her. Days later, he posed as a girl and sent her a friendship invitation. Soon after the friendship request was accepted, he put pressure on her for a meeting, threatening he would otherwise leak her morphed pictures on porn sites. He was arrested after a six-month probe. John Vijay Sagar , an associate professor of the department of child and adolescent psychiatry, NIMHANS, pointed out: ""Of late, we have been witnessing a rising number of adolescents coming in with behavioural changes. When we go through their history over a period of time, we learn that it was owing to the overuse of social media and most of them were addicted to internet. This trend was not there earlier.""According to Supreme Court lawyer and cyber crime expert Pavan Duggal, six out of 10 people aren't aware of what constitutes a cyber crime. ""As a result, they aren't reported. Neither the victims nor the abusers know what is an offence,"" he said."

Upon arriving at Kudamuritti railway bridge near Kambarasampettai in Trichy, they established a 'pandal' (thatched makeshift shed) and started planting paddy nurseries along the tracks blocking train traffic.While speaking to reporters Ayyakannu alleged that since the farming community could not carry out agriculture activities on their lands for want of water, they resorted to do the same on the tracks using bullocks usually used for ploughing purposes.""We have also decided to meet Prime Minister Modi in Delhi in a few days to pressurise him to constitute CMB. His government has betrayed farmers in Tamil Nadu"", he alleged. Subsequently, a police team rushed in and arrested 47 people including four women.Meanwhile, hundreds of farmers staged a protest in Thanjavur railway junction where they cooked rice on railway tracks and consumed it to express their protest against the Union government's 'U' turn by defying Supreme Court 's instruction to constitute CMB.While addressing the media, Sugumaran, state deputy president of All Farmers Association's Coordination Committee, and Shanmugam, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangam , who led the protests said that they had decided to observe fast unto death if the Centre failed to form CMB even after the protest."
