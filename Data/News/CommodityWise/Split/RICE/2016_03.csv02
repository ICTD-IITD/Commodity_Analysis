The family rushed to Alipore Correctional Home on Friday evening to give him the news. But his homecoming is incidental to his kin and supporters. They are more curious about his political future.""He was calm, as always, and asked me not to rush. He put his hands on my hands and asked me to go home and take care of our grandson,"" said Archana while entering her home at Dhirendra Nath Ghosh Road in Bhowanipore's Sakharipara. ""This is the happiest day in the last few years of my life,"" she added.Alongside Archana was her daughter-in-law, Swati, who had campaigned for Mitra in the assembly election.""Months after I came to this house following my marriage, baba (referring to her father-in-law Mitra) was sent to jail. This is the worst situation any newly-married girl can face. I am happy that after almost two years, my baba will be back home,"" said Swati.She said the entire family had spent a sleepless night on Thursday. ""In the past two years, the circle of our life revolved around home, hospital, jail and court.""Swati said since Mitra was in jail, the family didn't even perform the rice ceremony of her son Maharup, who is now one and a half years old. ""We will perform the ceremony soon,"" she said.According to a relative, Mitra has instructed the family to ensure that no major celebration is held outside his home. In November last year, when Mitra was granted bail, his supporters had whisked him from SSKM within hours after the former minister learnt that CBI was gearing up to challenge his bail in Calcutta high court. Mitra was brought back home in an ambulance violating traffic rules and supporters from several parts of Kolkata had come to his house to celebrate his release. Nineteen days later, the high court cancelled the bail order and sent him back to jail.""We haven't planned any major celebration this time. We have asked the cops to help us and ensure there is no gathering outside our house,"" the relative said. Education minister Partha Chatterjee also made a similar appeal: ""Don't do anything out of excitement that can harm Mitra.""But supporters from Bhowanipore and Kamarhati have started gathering outside Mitra's house with sweets and 'aabir' from Friday evening. Though police asked them to move away, the crowd swelled at one point of time in the evening bringing traffic to a halt in the area."

Every year the 20 vagayaras of Nagarathars assembled to celebrate Sevvai Pongal and meet their relatives at this place.This year, the first slot for making Pongal was given to Lakshmanan by a draw of lots. As per the tradition, the family, after a special puja at the temple, cooked Pongal, a rice delicacy in a mud pot followed by others. The family was also given the first honour in the temple. The committee had allotted 900 slots this year, one more than last year.The slots were allotted to the families by draw of lots and they were issued tokens in advance to avoid confusion. The festival began at 5. 30 p.m. and went on till late in the evening. Other community people living in the village and surrounding villages were also allowed to take part in the festival but they were allotted slots outside the main arena.The District Tourism department had brought about 15 foreign tourists from Germany, Italy and France to witness the Pongal celebration and cultural events. The tourists came in a bullock cart and mingled freely with the local people. The local town panchayat had made arrangements for the festival and provided basic amenities for the visiting Nagarathars.Town panchayat Chairman Muruganandam, Executive Officer Balasubramanian and Tourism Officer Jayakumar were among others who participated in the festivities. The district police had made elaborate security arrangements."

On occasions, mid-day meal workers have stopped providing eggs and are serving only bananas as it not viable for them with the given commission.With the prices of red gram and green gram soaring high, workers are forced to serve dal prepared with Bengal gram, which is available at a cheaper price.Similarly, workers are unable to provide different varieties of vegetables due to escalation of prices, and they are forced to serve cheaply available vegetables such as cucumber, potatoes etc.How can we serve eggs twice in a week as per norms when the cost of each egg is Rs.4.50 paise to Rs. 5?, questions Lalitha, a mid-day meal worker in the Government High School, Mankammathota, in the town. The government just provides us rice free of cost. We have to purchase vegetables, oil, ingredients, firewood etc to prepare food at the cost of Rs. 6.64 paise per student, she says.The condition of mid-day meal workers serving food in primary schools is even worse.They are paid only Rs.4.76 paise per student."

The project is being executed through the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation An irrigation official said on the condition of anonymity, ""We have learnt that the administrative approval has been given by the state government. However, we are yet to get the notification. The project has been stalled several times since 1996, which has led to an increase in the cost. Around one-third of the district's area will be irrigated properly that will help increase yield. At present, crops such as rice are cultivated in these three talukas. Once the project is completed, the farmers can shift to cash crops such as sugarcane.""The scheme was stalled because of the agitations by project-affected people over the last one decade. The work will resume as the government and local public representatives have assured to rehabilitate people. There are 10 medium irrigation projects in the district and more than 50 minor projects, most of which are in various stages of completion.The state government has also given administrative approval to complete the Warana irrigation project at a cost of Rs 1174.98 crore. The project aims to irrigate 87,000 hectares of agriculture land in Kolhapur and Sangli districts. The work of the dam was completed long ago. However, the work of developing distributaries is yet to be completed. According to irrigation authorities, the cost of the project increased after people demanded to extend the scale of the scheme.""We expect the government to make allocation of funds in next year's annual budget. It is likely that the government will release the amount it pledged in a phased manner,"" the official said."

To ensure transparent and quick delivery of service to the end user, district collector Babu A has proposed a plan to rope in banks for all PDS transactions and asked the officials to collect bank account details of all white card-holders and ration dealers.The district officials will enrol all white ration card holders in the district for the new payment system according to which money gets credited to the dealer's account soon after purchase. The user's bank account will be linked with the dealer's and the latter can receive money in a fraction of second after the transaction is completed at the fair price shop.""Taking a key step to plug the leakages in welfare schemes and to weed out bogus card holders, we have created the system. All transactions will be monitored periodically. As many as 2,167 dealers in the district will have to submit the list of beneficiaries periodically,"" said district collector Babu A.Expressing confidence on the new system, he said both e-POS and Aadhaar-enabled public distribution system (AePDS) have reduced leakages in the welfare schemes and only the eligible card-holders are availing of the services. Bogus white ration card-holders can be in the district can be kept aside with the help of cashless transactions, he added.He said the system will analyse the customer behaviour and those that do not buy essential commodities for two months will not get subsidy from the government. ""For restoration of benefits, the ration card-holders will have to write to the district supply officer explaining the reason for failing to buy their quota of entitlement,"" he added.Out of the 11,89,774 white ration cards in the district attached to 2,167 PDS stores, only 13,002 cards were enrolled with the new scheme. Many applications were rejected for want of current bank accounts. As cashless transactions will be implemented in all Aadhaar-enabled welfare schemes in the future, the officials are asking people to open new bank accounts.Meanwhile, FP shopkeepers are asking the card-holders to submit bank details to them. As a pilot project, the district officials have started enrolling white ration card-holders in Gannavaram, Nuzvid and other surrounding mandals since a month ago. They hope to complete the maximum number of enrolments by December this year.In 2013, the Central government planned to introduce a similar system called the direct benefit transfer (DBT) for beneficiaries of food subsidy in six Union territories and the states which volunteered to join the scheme. Due to some hiccups, the initiative has been delayed for nearly three years. However, after the successful implementation of ePOS that has curbed irregularities in the PDS, the Central government is once again keen to put the mechanism in place by linking bank details of ration card-holders with their Aadhaar cards.""So far, as part of AePDS, bank accounts of 13,002 white ration card-holders have been linked to those of their respective fair price dealers. Subsidy amount of the beneficiaries will be credited to their bank accounts when they buy rice and other commodities at FP shops,"" said district civil supplies officer Hari Kumar."

Several villages do not have BT roads and hence we will take up measures for providing good road connectivity. The educational levels are also not very good in this district. There is high incidence of drop out of students after high school and they were unable to study beyond SSC due to lack of higher educational institutions in the region.

Are you implementing the same in Peddapalli also?When I was ZP CEO in Medak district, we launched a campaign called Vidya Vahini for the continuation of higher education of adolescent girls by collecting their parents telephone numbers and motivating them through experts for the continuation of higher education. The experts would inform about the availability of various courses after SSC such as Intermediate, ITI, polytechnic and other courses. Besides, they would also campaign against child marriages. We will implement the same in Peddapalli district also.What are your plans to give a fillip to the industrial sector in the district which was having lot of natural resources?We are planning to set up industrial parks, stone park for the stone cutting and crusher units and weavers park through small scale industries and see that the labourers do not migrate from the district in search of employment.You are a doctor turned civil servant.

We informed them to set up worksite schools for children and proper accommodation to the labourers.The pregnant women would be provided medical assistance. We informed them to provide information about all migrant girls below 18 years of age. We made arrangements for the payment to labourers through bank accounts only.How would you check corruption in various departments in general and revenue department in particular?If there is standard operating procedure we can check corruption.

The day begins by waking up early, bathing, wearing new clothes and faithfully making a trip to the agiary to seek Ahura Mazda 's blessings. Entrances to homes are decorated with colourful chalk (rangoli), incense sticks are burned in the house, doorways are bedecked with fresh, colourful flowers and sprinkled with rose water.For Parsis, celebrating New Year is about eating scrumptious food and spending time with loved ones. The festivities kick off with a hearty breakfast that comprises Parsi Sev (sweet vermicelli) or Rava, which is sprinkled with almonds, raisins and rose petals, sweet curd, Parsi Poro or the Akuri.Lunch is a more elaborate affair with Sali Boti and Dhan Dal Patia with rice.

Ramakrishnan accused the Central government of imposing its policies on reluctant State governments. It cited the Tamil Nadu governments decisions to reverse its previously held decisions on the National Food Security Act and UDAY and claimed that the Central government did not give States the choice to opt out of such programmes.The party also criticised Tamil Nadus decision to be a part of these programmes, saying they would be bad for the State. Calling for continued free distribution of rice, Mr. Ramakrishnan said that the State would have to spend an additional Rs. 1,190.3 crore to maintain the status quo, since the Central government would not supply subsidised rice under the Food Security Act. It pointed out that Mr. Narendra Modi, who criticised the Act as Chief Minister of Gujarat, had gone on to implement it when he became the Prime Minister.Mr. Ramakrishnan contended that UDAY would not assure any assistance from the Centre; all losses would have to be borne by the State government and its electricity board.UDAY would lead to privatisation and increase in power tariffs, it charged."

Puranik said that the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act 1997 bars a non-Hindu from performing any activities in a Hindu temple. He said that the High Court of Karnataka had barred the then Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada A.B. Ibrahim from having his name in the invitation card for annual fair of the Mahalingeshwara temple in Puttur.Mr. Puranik said that Deepavali was not just celebrated by Hindus but across all communities. We are not opposed to holding Bhavaikya Deepavali at the temple. But we are opposed to a non-Hindu holding it on the temple premises. We cannot allow our temples to be used for meeting their political ends, he said.Let Mr. DSouza hold the Goodu Deepa competition and other programmes at another venue and not at the Kadri temple, he said.Mr. Puranik said that a representation has been given to Deputy Commissioner K.G. Jagadeesha and Police Commissioner M. Chandra Sekhar to stop the programme.If the event is held, then the district administration will be solely responsible for breach of peace, he warned. Not only the VHP and Bajrang Dal activists, the Bharatiya Janata Party too will join in opposing the programme, he said.In his reaction, Mr. DSouza told The Hindu that the VHP and other organisations were trying to create an unnecessary controversy. I have just used the auspicious occasion to hold the event that will bring all communities together. There is no political gain here, he asserted.Mr. DSouza said that the executive committee of the temple has allowed him to hold the Bhavaikya Deepavali on the temple premises.He said that the Goodu Deepa (sky lamp) competition held as part of an event will be held outside the temple. Only the drawing and debate competition for students will be held in a hall on the temple premises taken on rent.He has also planned to distribute rice and present spectacles to the needy. I am here to build harmony at the temple that has followers across the communities, he said."

Emperumal, a national award-winning exponent of the Karuppur Kalamkari technique of textile painting, passed away in the early hours of November 1, in his native village of Sickalnayakenpet, Thanjavur District. He was 75.With his demise, the world of Indian handicrafts has lost a master craftsman who rejuvenated an art form that was originally used to adorn not just sacred structures, but also the garments worn by the erstwhile royals of Thanjavur.Karuppur Kalamkari, which is also known as Chithra Paddam (figurative drawing), has its origins in Andhra Pradesh. In 1540, the first Nayak ruler of Thanjavur, Sevappa Nayak, is said to have brought a group of Karuppur Kalamkari artists to work in the palace and temples, who later settled down in Sickalnayakenpet.Mr. Emperumal traced his lineage to these traditional practitioners, and later went on to highlight the intricacy of Karuppur Kalamkari through his works that were exhibited locally and in foreign museums. His skill won him the National Award for a traditional art in 1987. He also trained and collaborated with his son Rajmohan in holding workshops.While the art form initially had religious subjects such as the Ramayana, the Puranas and even Biblical lore, Mr. Emperumal was adept at utilising Karuppur Kalamkari in modern themes, particularly in signage. His Tanjore-style drawing of the mascot and logo of the 1988 Seoul Olympics have become permanent exhibits at the Olympics memorabilia museum in the South Korean capital. Mr. Emperumal has designed the emblem of the Bowdoin College, Massachusetts, United States, in 1991.A labour-intensive technique, Karuppur Kalamkari requires the cloth to be prepared for painting with at least three separate chemical-free treatments (using a cow-dung paste) before it is ready for the next stage. A mixture of rice water starch and milk is then used to stiffen the cotton. The cloth base is then beaten till pliable before the artist can start the drawing. Natural brushes made from tree bark and bamboo pens are used with vegetable dyes to create the intricate paintings.Mr. Emperumal is survived by his son Rajmohan and wife E. Banumathi."

Instead of the conventional grinding and mixing of ingredients, we adopt bigger grinders for preparing the rice flour - the only major raw material used for the produce, say traders.According to an estimate, there are 150 small and medium units in the town involved in preparing the snack.Each shop has a minimum of six labourers while the major shops has about a dozen men and women workers. Most traders are not able to tell their daily or weekly production, although they could confirm that they prepare it for about 10 hours from 7 a.m.The workers gather around two cauldrons while a couple of labourers squeeze the flour into white coils before sliding them into hot oil.The murukku is drained into a colander before shifting it into a bamboo basket. It is immediately packed . Traders attribute the distinctive flavour of the snack to the quality of water in Manapparai.The trade was confined to interior and cramped shops deep in the town all these years.But the four-laning of the Tiruchi - Dindigul National Highway has changed the face of the trade with a large number of outlets having come up all along the highway.In a majority cases, an entire family is involved in the trade. Marc Grace, a woman, who looks after the accounts of her shop, says that she had inherited the trade from her father-in-law Chinnappan. The process looks deceptively easy but involves hard labour."

While scientifically, the cucumber finds itself in the fruit category, gastronomically it lends itself beautifully to a wide range of cooking techniques. From being able to be eaten as is with just a dash of salt and chilly powder, cucumbers can also be pickled, used in salads, soups, savoury dishes and even desserts.These days, the local market abounds with locally-grown cucumbers; from the tender ones that are amazingly refreshing eaten raw, to the seasoned ones that can be cooked. Traditional Goan cooking, incidentally, boasts of numerous cucumber dishes, right from the delicious fodd where cubes of cucumber are cooked in a temper of mustard seeds, onions, turmeric and other spices of choice and then garnished with freshly grated coconut, or a curry-based preparation akin to caldinho. A few prawns added to a cucumber caldinho works well to raise the flavour up a few notches.A popular Goan dish that celebrates the cucumber is tavsali , or cucumber cake. A steamed cake, this one finds its origin in Saraswat cuisine.""All you need for this dish is grated cucumber, jaggery, wheat or rice semolina (rava), grated coconut, ghee, flavourings such as cardamom or turmeric and cashewnuts for garnish. A tavsali can either be baked or steamed, as per one's preferences,"" says Ponda-based homemaker Ashwini Tendulkar To make tavsali, one needs to the combine grated cucumber, coconut and jaggery in a large vessel and cook till the jaggery melts and the mix starts boiling. In another pan, roast semolina and ghee till the former assumes a golden-brown tinge. This mix must then be added to the cooked cucumber mix and stirred till the mixture thickens. Following this, the mixture is transferred into a baking tray lined with either parchment paper or, if you want to keep it traditional, with turmeric leaves. Bake till it is ready.While tavsali is best eaten hot, it also stores well in an airtight container for close to a week. In this case, all you need to do before eating it is toast on a hot tava for about half-a-minute on each side.""The most important thing to keep in mind when cooking cucumbers is to remember not to cook them for too long. As the fruit is high in water content, it can easily turn mushy and that's not a very pleasing texture to eat,"" says chef Subhash D'Souza. About five to eight minutes is ideal cooking time for cucumbers, he adds.Bearing testimony to the versatality of the cucumber, Aldona-based Mabel D'Sa, whose green fingers have ensured that she always has an abundant harvest of cucumbers, uses the fruit for various preparations such as salad, raita, vegetable dishes and even jam.The Gujarati kadi is also another amazing cucumber dish prepared using diced cucumbers cooked in a besan and buttermilk-based curry. The kadi pairs amazingly with hot steamed rice."

Thilothaman said the ration bill of the State was expected to go up from the present Rs.819.75 crore to Rs.1,126.39 crore.The National Food Security Act came into effect from November 1 with the Centre insisting that the draft list published on the website on October 5 be approved for distribution of foodgrains.The State needs time till March 1 to complete all the formalities of the Food Security Act but the Centre was adamant, he said.Verification and appeal committees had been set up by the government to look into the complaints over the priority and non-priority sections (BPL) under the Act. The Minister said the economically forward sections should emulate the 13,000 families who took the stand that they wanted only ration card and not ration.The State would get 14.24 lakh tonnes of foodgrains consisting of 80 per cent rice and 20 per cent wheat under the new system compared to the 16 lakh tonnes provided now, he told the House. As many as 2.76 crore people were being provided ration at concessional rates. But under the new targeted PDS, the figure would come down to 1.54 crore. The Minister said government aimed at giving free ration to all on the priority list.All Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) families on the priority list would be provided 35 kg of rice per card and the remaining 1,29,21,411, five kg of foodgrains per person. This is 57,15,231 more than the 97,64,811 getting free ration in the State now.PDS would be made efficient and transparent. Door-delivery mechanism and computerisation would be completed by March 31. Ration retail outlets would be modernised and income of ration shop owners would be increased, he added."

Situated near the present governor's palacewhich was earlier known as 'Palacio do Cabo ' and served as the residence of Portuguese governors and lieutenant governors of Goathe cemetery has 47 tombs and 56 graves.Built for British garrisons that were stationed at Fort Aguada, Cabo and Mormugao between 1799 and 1813, it is the only cemetery that features in the directorate of archives and archaeology's list of 51 monuments protected under the Goa Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1978.After the French Revolution, Great Britain occupied French settlements and a few Dutch footholds in India, with the only exceptions being Portuguese settlements in Goa, Daman and Diu. ""The loss of their settlements had not perturbed the French much as they were drawing a lot of confidence from their occupation of the Isle of France (Mauritius) since 1721 and Bourbon since 1664 in the Indian Ocean . The signing of alliance treaties with Tipu Sultan had emboldened them further to reoccupy territories they'd lost in India. But, the two hurdles they faced were the blockage of Europe by the Emperor in Berlin and a free sway of Great Britain over the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, indomitable Napoleon tried to put into effect a formidable plan to conquer Egypt first in 1798 and from there, to launch a massive attack against India. And, as per the French strategy, Goa was the most suitable territory on the western coast from where they could envisage a major thrust on British possession with the help of Tipu Sultan. According to French plans, the port of Goa, along with the entire territory, would go to Tipu Sultan and Bombay, subsequent to its capture, would go to France,"" noted indologist and archaeologist, Prakashchandra Pandurang Shirodkar wrote in the July-December 1983 issue of the research journal, Purabhilekh Puratatva.It was Bombay governor Jonathan Duncan who, in 1799, sent soldiers in seven ships commanded by Col William Clarke to Goa, no sooner had he received the news from Bassora that a French fleet of 26 ships and 14 frigates were proceeding through the Suez Canal to India. They reached Goa on September 6, 1799.The British are reported to have constructed fortifications at Aguada, Gaspar Dias (the present Miramar), Caranzalem, Dona Paula and Mormugao, which were later demolished on Portuguese governor Jose Fereira Pestana 's orders in 1848.A British traveller, W Walker , in 1855 described the cemetery thus: ""I visited the burial ground at Cabo built and used by the British force of 10,000 (sic) men when they held possession of the seaboard points of Goa, to prevent the French entering India by this route in 1805. The massive laterite stone wall that surrounds it is as perfect as the day it was built, the laterite in this neighborhood being the best I have anywhere seen, but the lofty arched entrance gates have long been despoiled of every particle of wood. The burial ground is used for rice cultivation and the very tombstones are worn down from the sharpening of native tools on them; where not cultivated, it is overgrown with high rank grass said to be alive with deadly cobra de capello (king cobras). If it be true, as I have heard, that the collector of Belgaum allows an annual sum to keep it in order, I can assure him that not a piece worth of care is bestowed on it.""In November 1983, former UK prime minister, Margaret Thatcher , who was present in the state for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (Chogm), visited the cemetery along with her husband, Denis The directorate of archives and archaeology decided to lock the gates to the cemetery after it found that the site was being used as a cattle pound. The directorate grants access to researchers and anyone interested in visiting the site. Post the monsoon each year, the cemetery is cleaned and its overgrown grass cleared, making the tombs visible again.The cemetery has the advantage of being located at a strategic point, what with a number of tourists already visiting Dona Paula each year. The directorate of archives and archaeology has plans to develop and beautify the historic site with lawns and putting it to adaptive reuse by encouraging educational activities to keep the protected site alive, says Varad Sabnis assistant superintending archaeologist.The Goa Heritage Action Group (GHAG) is also planning regular heritage walks in the cemetery.""Sacred to the memory ofHENRY WILLIAM MAYNEwho was an employee of the Madras Southern Maratha Railway for many years.Died on the 10th August 1912Gone but not forgottenErected by his daughter""...reads the inscription of the last burial at the site."

And he is not new to competitions at that level having won a silver in the Natural Olympia bodybuilding meet in Las Vegas last November.So, when 40-year-old Venkatesan embarks on yet another journey to probable stardom, he finds himself in a competition which is exclusively held for vegetarians.For someone who earns a livelihood by being a personal trainer to some celebrities besides being with the Apollo Group, this soft-spoken bodybuilder reminds that having been there earlier twice, he is aware of what he has to do to be in the top three at least.The dream is always to win the gold.

The technology developed by International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is being implemented by some states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha now.The main advantage of this new technology is that reports on crop condition can be prepared with ease every 12 days and during natural calamities such as cyclones and floods, the government can get accurate information on the extent of crop damage. The other advantage of the ease of data availability is that crop insurance amounts can be released without any delay by getting yield information. Principal scientist and director of Economic Division and Programme Leader of IRRI Samarendu Mohanty and Economist of IRRI-India programme's Delhi representative Aldas Janaiah, met Telangana Agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy on Monday. Mohanty explained the advantages of the satellite-based technology to the minister.""IRRI has developed a software where satellite maps can be quickly analysed. Under the existing National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), rice production report assessment is not accurate and the maps can give only information about areas. Countries such as Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam have been using the IRRI technology for crop assessment,"" Mohanty told TOI.He said by knowing the crop condition, yield assessment and weather conditions every 12 days, it is easy for releasing crop insurance to farmers. The state government or insurance companies can make part payment of insurance to farmers without waiting till the end of season.

Farmers, doctors, scientists and environmentalists in at least 150 locations across the nation questioned the safety clearance given to GM Mustard by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee 's (GEAC) technical subcommittee.Adding star power to the cause were filmmaker Vetrimaran and actor Rohini, aside from soil biologist Sultan Ismail, Supreme Court special appointee for TN food security Dr V Suresh and state traders union president Vellaiyan. The regulatory process of approval for GM Mustard is secretive, non-participatory, and unscientific, claimed scientists.City-based Newton Science Club founder P Ilangovan Subramanian explained, ""People need to understand the ill-effects of genetically-modified seeds. If you want greater yield, we create hybrid varieties. In the case of genetic modification, greater yield is achieved by crossing a mustard seed gene with an herbicide gene.""""The farmer will have no choice but to buy new seeds every year. The biotech companies are guaranteed large profits at the expense of poor farmers' food security."" Said Ilangovan.The protestors expressed alarm that the Centre is processing a GM application that chose not to reveal the fact that the genetically-modified organisms in question are herbicide-tolerant crops. ""This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from their employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food,"" said Ismail, adding that data from data from field trials of the GM crop has not been made public.Given that mustard is widely used in all cuisines across India, the protesters objected to moves by the Centre to approve transgenic mustard in the name of yield improvements. Alternatives to GM Mustard exist for yield improvements such as non-GM hybrids available in the market, in addition to agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification (like System of Rice Intensification).Vetrimaran expressed his support to organic farming and voiced his opposition to GM foods entering the country. Rohini said, ""When Bt brinjal was approved, a people's movement broke out and the government was forced to ban the transgenic brinjals. The case of GM Mustard must be taken up the same way."""

He also appealed to her to send a team of experts to the Cauvery basin in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu who could verify the ground realities presented by the state on shortage, inflows and outflows.""The sharing of water in a distress situation cannot be decided on a mathematical reduction formula as Tamil Nadu proposes, particularly at the end of August or September. The whole thing has to be seen at the end of the season based on ground realities which include performance of south-west and north-east monsoons and the available ground water in the delta region of Tamil Nadu,'' he added.According to the presentation, Karnataka has only 31 tmcft of live storage. The expected inflow into Karnataka reservoirs in the remaining months up to February will not be more than 40 tmcft going by distress years in the past, totalling about 71 tmcft.Of these, Karnataka requires at least 26 tmcft to meet the drinking water requirement and about 60 tmcft for standing crops.The south-west monsoon was expected to yield 257 tmcft inflow into the four major reservoirs of Karnataka in a normal year till the end of September based on 41 years average (1974-75 to 2014-15) against which the four reservoirs as on September 28, 2016 have received only 129.85 tmcft (50.5% of average flow). This clearly shows that in all probability this year will be a severe distress year.The inflows into four major reservoirs (Harangi, Hemavathy, Krishnarajasagara and Kabini reservoirs) up to August-end was 114.66 tmcft against the average inflow of 219.38 tmcft, resulting in an enormous deficit of 104.72 tmcft.The live storage in all four major reservoirs was 48 tmcft against the designed live storage of 104.55 tmcft, which is about 46% and indicate precarious water availability.The position in Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, is far more comfortable than in Karnataka. The present storage at Mettur in Tamil Nadu is about 43 tmcft live. In the remaining part of the season upto the end of February 2017, the Mettur reservoir in Tamil Nadu would receive about 42 tmcft from the uncontrolled intermediate catchment in Karnataka and catchment between the interstate border and Mettur.""The total of 85 tmcft should be sufficient to meet the needs of Tamil Nadu if we consider what was drawn by Tamil Nadu for its samba rice crop of 15 lakh acres even in the bad years,"" he said."

Besides, timings of opening and closing of shops was not followed. On liquor a higher price of up to Rs.30 was being collected and the poor were ending up spending more money, he said."

They came into the bar, in Chinas Yunnan province, with tales from the Ayeyarwady region, the rice bowl of Myanmar, where life hadnt changed much since the days of George Orwell. The Myanmar they saw, from Rangoon to Mandalay, along poor delta backwaters to colonial hill stations, was aided by a book by Emma Larkin. Finding George Orwell in Burma tells the tale of Myanmar through the experiences of Orwell. The political travelogue brings together Burmese Days , Animal Farm and 1984 as a trilogy that offers the most accurate reading of the dictatorship of Myanmar, one that the country is still struggling to shake off.Living the present by revisiting the past is a theme I encountered time and again in my four years on the road. In Chinas Guangxi province, in a wonder of a village called Yangshuo, I met a Swedish biker who was travelling with a China guide from the 1960s that he picked up in Tehran. Facebook had exploded in the West in a big way and he was keen to disentangle himself from technological vortex. So he picked a time, a place he wanted to be, and let literature be his compass.We travel to seek new experiences but we travel expecting a glimpse of a past we idealise. Perhaps that is why so many of the books you pick up on the road are second-hand. The Beat Bums, my bookshop/coffee shop that I ran for a couple of seasons, tucked away in Old Manali and later in Hampi, was stocked largely with second-hand books picked up from the street vendors at South Bombays Flora Fountain. Old books crystallise a part of travel, its impermanence, and the fact that everything is transient. And, in the days after the Bob Dylan Nobel, it is worth recalling how much the Road in India is informed by his poetic expressions.The high hills of ManaliIts a long climb to the top of Old Manali. Travellers wander past stores selling mystical stones, apple wine, and trance music CDs, lugging massive backpacks up the slope while stealing glimpses at the Himalayas. Nestled amidst the many stores is a small caf called Dylans Roasted and Toasted Coffee House. The faade of Dylans lends itself to a mural of Bob Dylan in psychedelic colours. Dylans is more often than not the first stop for the weary traveller, a place that buzzes with energy, where the gathered jam to sounds of the country musician, their voices rising with the smoke from their joints.Bob Dylan of the 1960s, the icon of an age of protest, and his words and music, are the soundtrack to the Road in India. Dylans lyrics, of revolt against convention and hierarchy, follow you across India  from the barren plains of Leh to the beaches of Anjuna where travellers recite his poetry. They strum on their guitars in 300-rupee guesthouses, around bonfires in the boulders of Hampi and along the banks of the Ganga in Rishikesh. Dylans classics unite strangers, lessening the distance between foreign languages and alien customs. His lyrics are etched on the walls of Noahs Arc guest house in Arambol, asking the traveller, taunting the traveller: How does it feel/ To be on your own/ With no direction home/ A complete unknown/ Like a rolling stone?Dylan presides over as a patriarch, a prophet. The bond forged by travellers traipsing all around India for months on end is furthered strengthened by the ideas of the road and idealism associated with it. For many cling on to the values of the 1950s and 1960s counterculture, they quote Jack Kerouac and recite the words of Allen Ginsberg. It is their howl we hear at late night jam sessions that the local police and forestry department officials so desperately try to silence.No longer a lonely planetThe traveller comes searching for a romanticised version of India: of hippies and hash, of enlightenment and 20-rupee meals. Instead they are confronted with an industry that has rapidly developed, with touts on every corner, where a chain of Dylans Roasted and Toasted has opened in multiple locations on the path well trodden. This taints the organic experience. Now it feels like the first bite of a McDonalds burger in a foreign country, sounds like the reassuring ring that accompanies the sliding door at a 7-Eleven. The traveller in mystical India has been transformed into a tourist in Incredible India and the industry pulls at the most predictable strings.But the lonesome traveller isnt willing to let go, is protesting and resisting the Lonely Planetisation and gentrification of the road. Communities come together and create new enclaves to retreat into. Some have acquired lives of their own such as the one on the shore of Paradise Beach where long-haired hippies trek along a winding path and into secret coves. They set up camp on the idyllic harbours every year, living in the most threadbare conditions and dance naked to the sound of the guitar on the beach. Others, such as Sadhana Forest, have piggybacked on older communes such as Auroville and use its legitimacy to bring people together for outlandish projects such as the creation of a forest.An older compactBut the global nomad isnt relenting. Just like the original hippies of Arambol, who have camped in the jungles, have called the banyan trees home for decades and resisted the pressure to leave. They arent giving in to the stereotypical image of the selfie-wielding tourist travelling to document his or her journey on Instagram. Instead they have formed cliques and this year they meet in the forest of Uttarakhand, far away from tentacles of the tourist industry for a month-long love-in.They gather away from the eyes of officials, secure in their isolation, and sing: Come gather round people/ Wherever you roam/ And admit that the waters/ Around you have grown. But they refuse to accept that the times they are a changin.AliaAllana is a Mumbai-based journalist who writes for Fountain Ink.Dylans lyrics, of revolt against convention and hierarchy, follow you across India  from the barren plains of Leh to the beaches of Anjuna where travellers recite his poetry"

Siddaramaiah reiterated the state's stand that no further water could be released to Tamil Nadu since it would destroy the standing crops of farmers and cause shortage in drinking water supply . He also appealed to her to send a team of experts to the Cauvery basin in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu who could verify the ground realities presented by the state on shortage, inflows and outflows.""The sharing of water in a distress situation cannot be decided on a mathematical reduction formula as Tamil Nadu proposes, particularly at the end of August or September.The whole thing has to be seen at the end of the season based on ground realities which include performance of southwest and north-east monsoons and the available ground water in the delta region of Tamil Nadu,'' he added According to the presentation, Karnataka has only 31 tmcft of live storage. The expected inflow into Karnataka reservoirs in the remaining months up to February will not be more than 40 tmcft going by distress years in the past, totalling about 71 tmcft. Of these, Karnataka requires at least 26 tmcft to meet the drinking water requirement and about 60 tmcft for standing crops.The south-west monsoon was expected to yield 257 tmcft inflow into the four major reservoirs of Karnataka in a normal year till the end of September based on 41 years average (1974-75 to 2014-15) against which the four reservoirs as on September 28, 2016 have received only 129.85 tmcft (50.5% of average flow). This clearly shows that in all probability this year will be a severe distress year.The inflows into four major reservoirs (Harangi, Hemavathy , Krishnarajasagara and Kabini reservoirs) up to August-end was 114.66 tmcft against the average inflow of 219.38 tmcft, resulting in an enormous deficit of 104.72 tmcft. The live storage in all four major reservoirs was 48 tmcft against the designed live storage of 104.55 tmcft, which is about 46% and indicate precarious water availability .The position in Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, is far more comfortable than in Karnataka. The present storage at Mettur in TN is about 43 tmcft live.In the remaining part of the season upto the end of February 2017, the Mettur reservoir in Tamil Nadu would receive about 42 tmcft from the uncontrolled intermediate catchment in Karnataka and catchment between the interstate border and Mettur. ""The total of 85 tmcft should be sufficient to meet the needs of TN if we consider what was drawn by the state for its samba rice crop of 15 lakh acres even in the bad years,"" he said."

Nothing comes to mind,"" she said when asked what she was thinking about. ""The truth is its everything I dreamed of and it's all happened so quickly.""Her victory was the first for Spain in the Olympic pool since Martin Lopez Zubero won the men's 200 backstroke at Barcelona in 1992.She still had to work hard for victory, with Groves leading at the first turn after Hoshi had made the fastest start from the blocks.Groves was also ahead at the halfway stage but Belmonte came back strongly and dashed her rival's hopes of becoming the first Australian to win the event since Susan O'Neill in Atlanta in 1996.Australians Leisel Jones , Libby Trickett and Stephanie Rice are the last Australian women to win individual golds in swimming, all at the 2008 Beijing Games.Groves' time of 2:04.88 was still a personal best.""To come away with a silver medal is just like the best thing ever,"" she said."

It is also the only time when specific regional cuisines are actually available at different venues.During the day it is the bhog which is prepared by special cooks for offering the goddess at the Bengali Durga puja . ""We have items like khichidi, chorchori, (a mix of brinjal, radish and pumpkin) and bati chorchori, a more sophisticated version made with cauliflower, beans and carrots offered as bhog to the deity during day time,"" says Soumandra Sarkar, organizer of Katol Road Durga puja which is famous for its food stalls. In the evening the stalls offering various Bengali delicacies do brisk business at these venues. Beguni, made by frying brinjal dipped in gramflour batter and smeared with poppy seeds, Dimer devil, an egg preparation in which boiled egg is halved and stuffed with potato paste, dipped in besan and deep fried and ghughni, made with chickpeas are all quintessential Bengali food items which sell fast. ""Equally famous are the stalls which prepare fish, mutton and chicken cutlets, fried pomfret, fish curry and rice and biryani. Noodles and egg, chicken and mutton rolls are equally popular,"" says Sarkar.Caterers who specialize in these cuisines are given contracts for these occasions. ""Bengali families do not cook at home during puja days as they are busy attending the rituals at puja pandals during the day and then flitting from one venue to the other in the evening. So we keep these wholesome food combinations which are moderately priced and enjoyed by all,"" Sarkar adds.At the Ram Nagar Durga puja it's an all vegetarian fare. ""Our puja pandal is in between two temples and so we are hesitant of keeping non-vegetarian food stalls here,"" says Datta Satyendu the organizer. ""We will have no control over the plates and the waste is disposed and this may hurt the sentiments of others,"" he says. But Satyendu feels that there is hardly any loss of footfalls. ""There are a lot of non-Bengalis who visit our pandal and once they know that only vegetarian food is sold and served here they enjoy it."" Only Bengalis eat non-vegetarian food during puja days, the rest turn vegetarian during the Puja days. ""Bengalis keep moving from one venue to other so it really doesn't affect us,"" he adds.""Since women are not cooking at all during this time, the husbands know that all the meals will have be at the stalls here and are ready to indulge us,"" says Madhumita Bannerjee, a schoolteacher. ""I would say nothing matches the bhog in terms of taste but I especially look forward to the beguni,"" she adds.If the Bengali puja pandals are all about Bengali delicacies, the garba pandals are more about quick refreshments. An array of food stalls are lined up here as the crowds are much larger. ""Lemon soda and juice stalls along with those selling instant noodles and pasta are a big hit,"" says young businessman Karan Grover. ""The ten minute breaks are too short for people to spend time on eating,"" he adds.""There is so much of frenzied dancing happening here till late night that juice stalls do a thundering business ,"" says photographer Surpeet Kapoor who is a regular at these venues. In terms of food the one at Queta colony is a big favourite and it's a final destination for all dancing enthusiasts. ""The wide range of food stalls serve dosa, ice-cream, sandwiches and pasta,"" says choreographer Sidhartha Joshi. ""The idea is to grab a quick bite and gulp a cool refreshing drink in between dancing. So only 'super' fast food is sold here,"" he adds with a smile."

Before coming to the snake pit, we have to do puja at home and make sweets for the festival. Fasting is observed from dawn to dusk and in the night we consume fruits, sweets and milk, says G. Savithri, a resident of MVP Colony, adding that growing urbanisation gave way to dwindling snake pits.Those who could not locate a snake-pit in their colonies went to neighbouring places to offer worship to snake god.Temples across the city witnessed huge crowds. As scores of devotees offered eggs and milk at snake pits, a few collected the eggs in buckets and boxes to make seasonal business."
58f6ab757be9e031f13b9aa6,Rural girls chase big-city dreams,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Rural-girls-chase-big-city-dreams/articleshow/54506017.cms,2016-09-25,"BENGALURU: The factory floor is going full throttle when the new girls walk in. Everywhere is the thrumming of sewing machines, the hum of fans, the faint burning smell of steam irons. On narrow tables that run between the machines, half-assembled Marks & Spencer miniskirts are thrust forward by fistfuls. The tailors, absorbed in the task of finishing 100 pieces per hour, for once turn their heads to look.The new girls smell of the village. They have sprinklings of pimples. They woke well before dawn to prepare themselves for their first day of work, leaning over one another's faces in silence to shape the edges of each eyebrow with a razor blade. Their braids bounce to their hips, tight and glossy, as if woven by a surgeon. On their ankles are silver chains hung with bells, so when they walk in a group, they jingle.But it is impossible to hear this sound over the racket on the factory floor. The tailors glance up for only a moment, long enough to take in an experiment. The new workers  teenagers, most of them  have been recruited from remote villages to help factories like this one meet the global demand for cheap garments. But there is also social engineering going on.A government program has drawn the trainees from the vast population of rural Indian women who spend their lives doing chores. In 2012, the last time the government surveyed its citizens about their occupation, an astonishing 205 million women between the ages of 15 and 60 responded ""attending to domestic duties.""Economists, with increasing urgency, say India will not fulfill its potential if it cannot put them to work in the economy. They say that if female employment were brought on par with male employment in India, the nation's gross domestic product would expand by as much as 27 percent.Experiments like the one in Bangalore run against deep currents in India, whose guiding voice, Mohandas K. Gandhi, envisioned a socialist future built on the small-scale economy of the village. They also collide spectacularly with an old way of life, in which girls are kept in seclusion until they can be transferred to another family through arranged marriage.Bangalore is the first city the 37 trainee tailors have seen. They are dazzled by the different kinds of light. Picking their way through the alleys around the factory, a column of virgins from the countryside, they stare up at an apartment building that towers over the neighborhood and wish their mothers could see it.Among them are two sisters, Prabhati and Shashi Das. They have come from a village at the end of a road, a place so conservative that the single time they went to a movie theater, their male cousins and uncles created a human chain around them, their big hands linked, to protect them from any contact with outside men. They are, as far as they know, the first unmarried women who have ever migrated from the village to work.Neighbors in the village are waiting to see what happens. The nasty ones say, with obvious relish, it will end badly. They whisper about migrant workers whose eyes were removed by organ traders while they slept. They say Prabhati and Shashi will be ""used this way and that.""Still, they go. Prabhati, at 21, is stubborn and able, and Shashi, two years her junior, pretty and fizzing with suppressed laughter. The two sisters hook pinkies when they walk down the lane that leads to the factory.""All the flirts and ruffians in the whole world must have been born on this lane,"" Shashi grumbles, but she is laughing. Attention is like water to her.The sisters are waiting, too, to see what will happen to them. They are both at the age when they could be summoned at any moment to be displayed to a family of strangers as a potential daughter-in-law. And each of them wants something else, something impossible.It is late May, the first day of their factory summer  of love letters folded into squares and dropped onto work stations; of fevers sweated out on the floor of a bare hostel room; of supervisors shouting in a language they do not understand, a couple of words  ""work"" and ""faster""  gradually becoming clear; of capitalism, of men and of a bit of freedom.It all started in March, in the drippy jungle of rural Odisha, when two distant relatives happened to meet on the roadside.One of the men had found employment as a ""mobilizer"" for Gram Tarang, a for-profit agency contracted by India's government to recruit and train workers. He mentioned that Gram Tarang was offering a cash incentive  roughly 450 rupees, or about $6.75, a head  to mobilizers who identified young women willing to enroll in a training program for garment factory jobs.The second man, Hemant Das, perked up, sensing the approach of a change of career. Hemant had an underfed look and teeth rimmed with tobacco stains. Among the first college graduates from his family, he had tried his hand at laying bricks, tutoring schoolchildren, programming computers, setting up wedding tents and waiting tables before finally falling back on the only job widely available to men here, working as a field hand for 200 rupees a day.Hemant was from a village called Ishwarpur, and as it happened, idle young women were something Ishwarpur had in great quantity. That they could be monetized came as good news.On its economic merits alone, Hemant figured, the government scheme would prove tempting: After two months of training, their daughters would be placed in a factory in the industrial center of Bangalore, where they would earn the legal minimum wage, 7,187 rupees per month, or about $108, which is more than most of their fathers make. Six months after arriving in Bangalore, they would be free to return home if they wished.Hemant set out the next day with a fistful of pamphlets and an uncharacteristically sunny disposition. But as he made his rounds of local families  30 of them, at least  they shook their heads. No.""Letting go of female children is dishonorable, in itself,"" explained Pramanand Das, who presides over an informal family council.Minati Das, the mother of a 19-year-old, got to the point quicker.""Not everyone wants a daughter-in-law who is a working woman,"" she said. ""They think she has lost her chastity.""Hemant would have been completely out of luck if he had not thought to try Karuna Das, who had two daughters of marriageable age  Prabhati and Shashi.Karuna was a sinewy day laborer, and he had roamed far from the village in his younger days to work in iron foundries in Chennai and Hyderabad. The gossip was that Karuna agreed to enroll his eldest daughters because he was unable to scrape together 100,000 rupees for dowries. That was undoubtedly the case.""They were reluctant to go anywhere because they were a bit scared,"" he said. ""I told them being scared is OK. OK, you're scared. Now you have to move on.""Prabhati has never seen a train, much less ridden in one, and on the 33-hour journey to Bangalore the earth seems to heave under her. As miles of paddy fields slide by, she vomits. Thatch roofs are replaced by peaked roofs, and she vomits. When they reach south India, rain begins to hit the window in fat spatters.It had come as news to Prabhati that the training program involved traveling 900 miles. But some intention had hardened within her. She wanted to prove the neighbors wrong. She did not care about her marriage prospects because, after examining the marriages that surrounded her in Ishwarpur, she had decided she does not want to marry at all.""I will go to Bangalore,"" she told her parents. ""If I come back, then you can get me married. If I don't come back, you can't get me married.""Shashi sits beside her retching sister and strokes her back. She had not wanted to come. Happy enough with a future as a housewife, she had focused her energy on making mischief. Among friends, she introduced herself as ""45 kilograms of hotness."" Out of the corner of her mouth came a stream of dirty jokes, and she made the other girls dissolve in helpless laughter by comparing breast sizes to vegetables (including, mournfully, a kernel of corn).Working on an assembly line was not Shashi's idea of fun. But Prabhati plunged forward, and, as usual, Shashi cruised along in her wake.The sisters, lugging a bag of clothes, sit with 35 other girls from Odisha who are making the same journey.They have all dressed in baggy purple-and-gray uniforms, with ID cards swinging from their necks. Their parents had made last-minute attempts to keep them from leaving, which had to be repelled with sustained tantrums. A girl called Baby, who is 18 and bespectacled, said that she had secured her mother's permission only by refusing to eat for two days.""They wanted me to come home,"" she says. ""I'm not going home.""The sun has not yet risen when they arrive at the hostel that will be their new home for the next six months: 137 women in 15 unfurnished rooms, every inch covered with girlish flotsam, underwear and bras drying on the window grates, sentimental verses penciled on the walls.Prabhati and Shashi's room is being painted, so on the first night 25 of them crowd into two rooms, so tight that one of their roommates stretches out on the kitchen counter.For the first few weeks, everything is new. Stepping out of the hostel, the trainees are surrounded by men: Men on balconies, men on scooters, men lounging in doorways, staring. The road is plastered with signs saying ""tailors wanted,"" and one girl gives a yelp of alarm, mistaking them for wanted posters.In rural Odisha they like to say that ""a girl's shyness is her jewelry."" But here, there is no space for the newcomers unless they make space for themselves. To cross the street  a throbbing two-lane road coursing with auto rickshaws, clattering cargo trucks, scooters carrying whole families  requires stepping in front of the slower-moving vehicles, if necessary stopping them with their bodies. The girls waver, and then they plunge.When they are introduced to a factory supervisor and dive to touch her feet, a traditional gesture of respect toward elders, the supervisor jumps back as if she has been stuck with a hot poker. She then assumes a slight crouch, as if preparing to defend herself from further reverence.Back in their bedrooms, the girls laugh hysterically at this. From childhood, they have been told that it is disrespectful for a girl to laugh out loud in the presence of elders. In the event of irrepressible laughter, girls must cover their mouths with anything at hand: the corner of a dupatta, a hand, a washcloth. This lesson, too, flies out the window. In the hostel they laugh like tractors. They laugh so loud they spit their water out.""I'm giving you 25 seconds to thread this needle,"" the supervisor says in Hindi. The recruits, whose native language is Oriya, barely understand. Thirty-seven tailors bend their heads, trying to guide frayed threads through a maze of eight loops.At the K. Mohan & Co. Exports Private Ltd., the girls have entered a world of machines: massive industrial extractors, laser cutters, a rapid-response protocol that kicks in when a needle tip breaks off.And yet, incredibly, garments worn in the West are still made by humans  nearly all of them women, working exhausting hours, with few legal protections and little chance of advancement, for some of the lowest wages in the global supply chain.As the trainees practice sewing straight lines on pieces of scrap fabric, supervisors pace the aisle, hoping to spot one with machine-like dexterity and speed. One of them slows, and then stops, beside a girl called Cuddles, the daughter of a truck driver. The supervisor blinks, looks again. This is  there is no other word for it  talent. She has covered the fabric with seams as straight as the lines on ruled notebook paper.Cuddles is among the first in the group to be integrated into an assembly line, bent over, eyes straining. Her task is to stitch together three small tags for the Marks & Spencer stretch corduroy skirt: one that identifies the brand, one that gives washing instructions and one the size, a scrap so tiny that it is nearly impossible to hold straight between finger and thumb. If she allows a tag to slip to the floor, or fly away in the gusts from the ceiling fan, her salary will be docked. She will be under pressure to complete this task 100 times per hour for eight hours, with one half-hour break for lunch, for a base daily wage of around $2.A man with a loft of dyed black hair steps out of his office to greet the group. This is N. Manjunath, the assistant general manager for human resources at the factory. He is recruiting rural workers through the government program because he is desperate: City-dwellers are no longer interested in factory jobs like these, with their low pay and punishing conditions, and attrition rates are high. Migrant women are more docile. This is what Manjunath is hoping.Manjunath thinks of himself as a kind man. But the complications of employing village girls have strained his last nerve: the weepy petitions for leave to return to the village for essential functions, like a father having a hemorrhoid removed; the domestic squabbles, which on one occasion ended in the consumption of toilet cleaner; and the ""love cases,"" in which a tailor, upon forming a romantic attachment in the factory, is summarily ordered home.Lately, when the girls come to him with complaints, he listens skeptically, with a sardonic smile. He assesses this latest batch of recruits, the second from Odisha, as ""lackadaisical."" He believes they have come here for an adventure, and will gravitate back to the village as soon as their parents tell them to come home.He is right to worry. After six months on the job, when the government incentives are paid out, around half the trainees brought in by Gram Tarang return to their villages. Only 40 percent stay longer than a year.It comes down to this: If the village has a plan for the girls, so does the factory. Leading them through the rows of machines, Manjunath wags his finger.""Don't get married too soon,"" he warns them.Within two weeks of their arrival, one of the sisters' roommates has eloped straight from the factory gates, not even stopping by the hostel to pick up her clothes. Those who remain spill their secrets to one another. Tanushree Behera sleeps entangled with a girl she calls her wife. Jayasmita Behera is divorced, having left her husband less than two weeks after the wedding.""If I had stayed,"" she says, ""my life would have been destroyed.""Sitting cross-legged on the floor, they compare notes on evasive maneuvers they use to avoid being shown to prospective in-laws, like Roadrunner slipping away from Wile E. Coyote. Shradhanjali Mallick, the beauty among them, says she used to have success with bouts of hysterical crying, but that moving to Bangalore has been more effective.""How can they marry me off if I am not physically present?"" she asks innocently, and Prabhati laughs. ""Let them hold a wedding of mothers-in-law and fathers-in-law,"" she says. ""Because that's the only kind of wedding they will be able to pull off.""This is not something Prabhati can laugh about at home. Her views on marriage were set in stone several years back, when a young wife in her village was set on fire in a domestic dispute. Prabhati has been arguing for years that she should be allowed to remain single, that her parents should proceed to fixing a marriage for Shashi, who is pretty and will get better offers.""I will become a nun,"" she says. But her parents flick away her comment, casually, as if it were a fly. So she thinks of escape.This is a subject she cannot discuss with her sister. Three years ago, Prabhati came across a mobile phone that a secret boyfriend gave Shashi as a way of keeping in touch, rigged, as if for espionage, with no audible sound or light, to be switched on at times when they have agreed to speak. Prabhati snatched the phone away and informed her father. Shashi screamed at her father that day  don't break that phone!  but she never saw it again. For months, she could not look him in the eye.The sisters were never as close again. When it comes to the future, Prabhati and Shashi keep their own counsel.By the first week of June, the new girls are praying for Sunday to arrive. Their joints hurt. Their backs hurt. They come home from the factory with fingers punctured by needles or sliced by industrial clippers. Sitting still for eight hours is strange and new, and at times, the boredom is maddening. They sing to their machines. They pull hairs out of their chins. Baby amuses herself by giving herself little scratches on the wrist.They are locked into the hostel except for ""out passes"" on alternate Sundays, which are granted by the factory human resources staff. A Gram Tarang ""life skills"" instructor makes the rounds inside the hostel, selling them 600-rupee jars of an Herbalife energy drink, which she tells them will help them keep up with the pace of work in the factory. It does give them energy  it includes caffeine and maltodextrin  but it also gives them diarrhea and eats up their remaining cash. This is no small problem, because they are running out of money for food.They count the days until June 10, when they will be paid for their first two weeks of work. Prabhati and Shashi, who had left home with 5,000 rupees, or about $75, find themselves with 100 rupees between them.""If there's no salary today, it's going to be a problem,"" Prabhati says.On June 10, they are not paid. Three more days pass, and they still are not paid. Outside the factory window the sky has turned black and the air is churning; a curtain of monsoon rain is about to sweep in.About 15 girls walk into Manjunath's office, hearts pounding, to demand their pay. He looks up from his desk, annoyed. The usual genial expression has vanished from his face. He explains that he cannot solve their problem: The company has opened bank accounts for them, but the bank has not delivered their ATM cards. Anyway, he dismisses the suggestion that the girls are running out of money. And who, he wonders, has given them the idea that they can make demands? He surveys the group in search of its leader.""My clear understanding is that if you have a basket of fruits and only one is not good, it will spoil the other fruit,"" he explains. ""You have to take one out.""When Jayasmita steps forward to say they have not eaten since yesterday, he swivels his head in her direction. He does not speak Oriya. ""What did she say?"" he asks a caseworker.The girls are promised an advance for rice and are ordered to leave his office. They shuffle out. They had been planning to stop working unless they were paid immediately, but their strike has lasted less than 5 minutes. Jayasmita slumps against a wall, and vows never to try anything like that again.""When you come to a new city,"" she says, ""you have to learn to care for yourself, and not bother with others.""The money for the first two weeks' work comes through three or four days later  after withholdings for pension, health insurance, lodging, food and kitchen furnishings, a grand total of 1,874 rupees, or roughly $28. This sum must last them for the next month. In the hostel room where Prabhati and Shashi stay, the amount of the paycheck is not relevant. They have never earned money before, only asked their fathers for it. A wave of happiness washes over all of them. They do not feel like girls, they say: They feel like boys.They transfer credit  30 rupees, 50 rupees  to the cellphones of their mothers, brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and boyfriends, as if they were distributing sweets to celebrate some windfall.Shashi dances down the stairs and most of the way home. The money sends a wild thrill through her, so that she wishes she could fast-forward through the next month, and the month after that, and after that. So that life is a long string of paydays.The two sisters make a pact: They will stay in Bangalore at least a year. They spend much of their paychecks on nose rings for each other, tiny specks of 22-carat gold. They place them on each other in front of their roommates, beaming, their faces so close together that they could be kissing.Then Prabhati lies down on her stomach, full length, cheek to the cool linoleum. She is not feeling well.It is strange that one of the first girls to falter is Prabhati, who was the most resolute about staying in Bangalore.She has contracted a fever that comes and goes for two weeks. She stops eating and then stops talking; her eyes are so hollow that you could place a handful of rice in them. Shashi stays home, combing her sister's hair and forcing her to bathe. But then she must return to work, and Prabhati is left shivering on the floor.""In city life,"" Prabhati says, ""even if you are dead, people will just get dressed and go to the factory without being bothered ...(Continued on next page) .""Minati Mahji, who has lived in the hostel for six years, observes them wearily. Of 130 women who arrived at the same time, only she and her four roommates have stuck it out. She tried switching to another factory, but it was no better, and she wound up back in the hostel. Her pay has crept up to 9,800 rupees, or $146 per month.She has seen wave after wave of young women arrive from the countryside, freshly hatched, and she knows how it usually ends  with the girl's disappearance into that old world as a daughter-in-law.""Whatever they are planning, it doesn't happen like that,"" she says.Even through her fever, Prabhati knows she wants to stay. She tries to keep her illness from her family, handing her crisp new 500-rupee bills to a street-corner doctor who seems to give all his injections in the buttocks. It is Shashi who tells their father that her sister is sick. Her father calls the Gram Tarang training center, demanding that Prabhati be sent home, and the training center calls the factory.On the day she is to board a train to return to Ishwarpur, Prabhati stands at the edge of the roof, tears streaming down her face, and watches her younger sister walk down the lane toward the factory. The mood in the hostel sags.""The day she left, she told me: 'I told you I would stay a year. And I couldn't even stay for two months,'"" Jayasmita recounts.Minati doubts Prabhati will return. The family, having violated custom once by letting the daughters go, is not likely to do it twice.""People mean to come back,"" Minati says. ""But they don't come back.""It turns out factory life agrees with Shashi. She has been absorbed into an assembly line expected to produce 100 pairs of khaki chinos an hour. In the morning she takes her seat among hillocks of pants, and spends the next 8 1/2 hours in a work-trance, punctuated by the shouting of supervisors and a half-hour break for lunch. A whiteboard lists the per-hour target. They are always behind.Behind her in the assembly line, a potbellied man in his late 30s peppers her with the gustatory queries that pass for small talk in south India. Have you eaten today? Are you hungry? Do you want to eat more? She swivels in her chair to ask him, ""Would you like me to shove these pants down your throat?""Shashi finds it interesting that she, the screw-up in the family, is the one becoming a city person. She examines her face in the mirror for signs that she is becoming paler. She tells the family that Prabhati should not return, and that she cannot send money home this month. Instead, Shashi arranges for a meeting with Sunil, a boy from a neighboring village whom she wants to marry.Six years ago, when Sunil first asked Shashi to meet him in person, she was escorted by a female cousin and was too shy to look at Sunil's face. When he sat on the chair, she would go to the bed. When he went to the bed, she would go to the chair. Finally he told her to stop and listen. She sat still. Whatever it was he said to her, it made her feel that he was her own.""I love him, you know?"" she says. ""I do not know whether he is good or bad.""Now that her sister is gone, it is no longer necessary for Shashi to keep this a secret. It is a blessed relief, like taking off a shoe that is cutting into a tender part of your foot.On the August day when her third paycheck comes in, Shashi doesn't tell anyone what she has planned. Leaving the hostel means breaking curfew, but she persuades her friends to go with her. The small group threads its way along the darkening street, past rotting cauliflower and coconut shells. The girls are headed to a bright shop where smartphones are displayed in glass cases.The shopkeeper is about 25, his shirt unbuttoned to reveal a glint of gold chain. He has seen many girls like these, provincials, fishing out coins at the vegetable market. He does not hide his disdain. But when Shashi announces that she wants to buy a 4,000-rupee Lava A59 smartphone, he is suddenly wide awake, respectful.Shashi's face is a mask of concentration as she repeatedly counts the bills and arranges them into a fan to show the shopkeeper. The girls around her are hushed. The amount is more than half her month's pay. It is the weightiest decision she has ever made.When they step back onto the street, something flickers across Shashi's face  triumph  and she pumps her fist. Back at the hostel, she drops her new purchase into the hands of her roommates, who immediately go through it, looking for WhatsApp, which they discovered the week before.Sunil will be calling soon. He has been badgering Shashi to make this purchase so she can send pictures over the internet. She disappears into the bathroom to splash cold water on her face. She is gone a long time. She lies for a moment on the floor, staring at the ceiling. Then she dials a number in the village.""Elder sister,"" she says. ""I got my phone!""September has arrived, and every day there is a new reason Prabhati cannot return to Bangalore. Her mother has stomach cramps. Her younger siblings' tuition bills are due. No adult male is available to accompany her on the train journey. Prabhati mentally reviews the cost of the ticket: 1,350 rupees for the train, 300 more for the auto rickshaw from Majestic Station. She jokes, a little nervously, that she should steal the money. A voice in her head tells her that if she doesn't go now, she never will.And yet that voice is becoming fainter. She can feel the village's drowsy peace overtaking her. Her mother says, in an offhand way, that it is time to start finding a groom. This is not how it was supposed to go. Shashi ensconced in the city, and Prabhati stuck in Ishwarpur.""Before, I was at home, and I didn't know anything, and it was OK,"" she says, dully. ""Now I know something, and it's not OK.""Back in Bangalore, the factory girls' fathers have begun to call. They expect them to come home on leave in December, after the six-month factory stint is up. Jayasmita's father says a marriage proposal has come from a man in Cattuck.""I tell them I'm not going anywhere,"" she says. ""The moment I heard talk about marriage, I hung up.""Shradhanjali says she will return, and plans to wriggle out of yet another proposal. ""If possible, I'll fight it off,"" she says, but sounds uncertain.""You know where you'll find her in a year?"" Jayasmita says, teasingly. ""At her in-laws.""The factory girls seem less afraid every month.Shashi sees her boyfriend, Sunil, as planned. He takes the overnight train in from Kerala , where he has migrated for work. They meet at a nearby gas station and walk in a park for most of the day, holding hands. At 4 p.m., he returns to the train station and boards another overnight train back to Kerala. She uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate with him, as if the internet were two tin cans attached by a piece of twine. Every time they get into a fight, she uninstalls the apps.Her smartphone has become an appendage. She presses it to her ear while she is walking down the lane, striding over rats flattened into the pavement. Waking in the night, she rolls over and checks it for new messages. A group of her friends are toying with the idea of leaving the hostel, seeking higher-paid work at another factory.She is amazed at how far she has come.That's another thing: Shashi and her friends are not the new girls anymore. The new girls are arriving from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand . Their braids are tight and glossy. Dropping their bags in their rooms, they climb up to the roof to gaze at the 22-story building, which is the most amazing thing they have ever seen.Their eyes widen at the girls from Odisha, in their jeans and T-shirts. The girls from Odisha regard them with friendly condescension. They invite them into their rooms, as if they've been here forever."
58f6abf67be9e031f13b9b3f,"Our paddy fields too require water, says Karnataka",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/Our-paddy-fields-too-require-water-says-Karnataka/articleshow/54010537.cms,2016-09-05,"BENGALURU: The Karnataka government has prepared a report based on the ground reality to reiterate its inability to release Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu.While Tamil Nadu argues that Cauvery water should be released to commence Samba cultivation on about 15 lakh acres and to protect the standing crop, Karnataka countered it by citing the dismal scenario with regard to paddy cultivation. ""Only 8% (4,920 hectares) of paddy sowing has happened in the state's Cauvery basin so far against the total target of 63,000 hectares. Releasing more water would spell doom for paddy farmers in the Cauvery river basin area,"" irrigation department sources told TOI.The Supreme Court is scheduled to continue hearing in the water dispute on Monday. Last week, the Supreme Court had suggested Karnataka follow the 'live and let live' principle with regard to releasing Cauvery water.Paddy is grown widely along the Cauvery river in Kodagu, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Bengaluru Rural districts. Of the 63,000 hectares, preparations have been made to plant rice saplings in 24,255 hectares and there has been cultivation in 33,825 hectares. A shortfall in paddy cultivation because of non-availability of water will change the dynamics in the rice market in the coming months, claim the state's irrigation and agriculture department officials. It's the same with regard to sugarcane cultivation: Of the 26,708 hectares in the Cauvery basin where sugarcane is grown, Karnataka claims the standing crop has reduced to 19,450 hectares.Chief minister Siddaramaiah, who reviewed the water availability situation and also held talks with state's counsel Fali S Nariman on Saturday, had said: ""The storage levels in the four reservoirs in the Cauvery river basin are depleting following a drop in the inflow of water because of low rainfall in the catchment area. We're facing a distress situation. We have already put the brakes on cultivation of water-intensive crops in the region. We'll be hit by a severe drinking water crisis in Mysore, Mandya and Bengaluru if we release water to Tamil Nadu, which expects good rainfall by mid-September.""With regard to Tamil Nadu's claim that Karnataka has built several tanks and lakes near the four reservoirs and has been illegally storing water in these lakes, the state government stated there are no illegal lakes and existing tanks too are drying up. ""The Cauvery basin expected 347 mm rainfall in July this year but the actual rainfall is 250 mm; a shortfall of 28 per cent. In August too, there was a shortfall of 42 per cent as the catchment area got only 117 mm rainfall against the expected 203 mm. How can tanks get filled with such poor rainfall?"" irrigation department officials said.Meanwhile, the state has been put on high alert in the backdrop of Monday's hearing by the Supreme Court.Water situation in Karnataka's Cauvery basinReservoirTotal capacity (tmcft)2004-1015 storage status (tmcft)Current storage, on August 26, 2016 (tmcft)Harangi8.508.147.78Hemavathi37.1033.3520.7Krishna Raja Sagar49.4543.3618.6Kabini19.5217.8615.1Total114.57102.7162.15Source: Irrigation dept, Karnataka"
58f6ac427be9e031f13b9b9c,Cauvery water dispute: The reason behind the rage in Karnataka's Mandya,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Cauvery-water-dispute-The-reason-behind-the-rage-in-Karnatakas-Mandya/articleshow/54264903.cms,2016-09-10,"Venkatesh P, a 30-something progressive farmer in Panakanahalli of Mandya taluk, the hub of the Cauvery basin in Karnataka, talks about how the rice they grow and eat has run out. Karnataka has had continuous drought and it's been two seasons since farmers have been able to grow rice. All the grain stored for the figurative rainy day has been used up this year.""My family, which grows rice and which has sold it to feed the town's people for generations, is now dependent on rice from the public distribution system. Is there anything left for me to say?"" he asks.As the 125-year-old dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing the waters of the Cauvery runs its latest course this year, there are heated debates, intense politicking, hate speeches and street protests - this time spilling over to social media also.However, the real issue is not Karnataka versus Tamil Nadu, as was the case in 1991 - it is the shortage of water in Mandya for its standing crops. The situation could affect everyone in Mandya, including the sizeable Tamilian presence in the district - many farm workers are Tamilian, each village has a Tamil colony and most of the farm equipment comes from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.""What are the Tamils here going to eat if we don't grow our rice? Why doesn't anyone understand that it's a human problem, not a language one?"" asks Mukudappa, a farmer who took part in a tyreburning protest in Mandya city.The official website of Mandya district describes it as 'the land of sugar and rice' and 'a prominent agricultural district.' In 2014-15, which was the second successive drought year for Karnataka, state agriculture department figures show that paddy and sugarcane cultivation in Mandya district was almost 60 per cent of its target. This year, despite copious rains all over the state, except in the traditionally rain-rich Malnad region, the catchment area for the Cauvery, Sharavathi and Tungabhadra rivers, farmers have sown 26,757 hectares of paddy and sugarcane, 63 per cent less than the target of 72,460 hectares.This has provoked rage on the streets, with traffic blocked on the Bengaluru-Mysuru state highway leading to estimated losses of over Rs 100 crore in just four days. Farmers pin their woes on water mismanagement by the state government and the perceived ""inadequate preparation and presentation"" of their case in the Supreme Court.""We planted our crops this year two months late, only after district in-charge minister DK Shivakumar told us to go ahead. He promised us water. Last year, though there was water in the Cauvery, the government took up repair work of the Visvesvaraya canal that feeds our district and didn't release water. We have missed two crops of paddy, three crops of sugarcane. If they give whatever water we have now to Tamil Nadu, what are we to do? Even if we starve, what are our politicians sitting in their cushy houses in Bengaluru going to eat?"" asks a furious farmer, Vivekumar TC of Tandasanahalli.Acre upon acre of standing crops in Mandya will wilt unless water is supplied through the canal. ""We have spent Rs 15,000 an acre for paddy, Rs 25,000 for sugarcane. If we don't get crops this year also, we have no option but to kill ourselves,"" says Ramu of K Gowdagere, raising the bogey of last year's 400-odd suicides in just this district.Ramesh and Govindaraju point to their newly planted crop in Hosabudanuru. ""If this doesn't get water and dries up, we will have to migrate, take up labour jobs and forget farming,"" says Ramesh.The Congress government in the state, caught in a cleft stick with hardly 46.7 thousand million cubic feet of water in all four Cauvery basin reservoirs, has released some water into the Visvesvaraya canal as well as to Tamil Nadu, while complying with the Supreme Court's September 5 directive to release more water to the neighbouring state. Angry farmers have attempted suicide by jumping into the swirling waters going to Tamil Nadu, while others are sitting by the Visvesvaraya canal, waiting for water to come.While their children protest on the streets, other farmers are quickly sowing more paddy, hoping for divine intervention, rains or relief from the Supreme Court and fervently hoping the state government will find a way to provide them with water in accordance with the schedule up to November 10.On the streets, however, there is visible fury against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah , whose face is being hammered even on ambulances carrying patients. Water resources minister MB Patil and senior advocate Fali S Nariman, appearing for Karnataka, are the other favourite targets, while there is both anger and grudging admiration for Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa , who has managed to get a favourable verdict from the Supreme Court every single time.There are references to Jayalalithaa's childhood in Melkote of Mandya district. ""She is a woman born here and yet each time, she targets us. M Karunanidhi (DMK chief and former CM of Tamil Nadu) has more concern and understanding - he doesn't behave like she does, he tries to be fair to everyone,"" says Chetan, another protester at Mandya's Sanjay circle.""She can get things done. Our politicians are useless,"" protester HK Nandakumar of Holalu chimes in. There are the usual vitriolic Congress-Janata Dal (S) political discussions and some references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the youngsters, who want their protests WhatsApp-ed to the PM in the hope of some relief.There are, however, no discussions on whether water conservation methods and alternative cropping patterns suggested by the state's agriculture and water resources departments could solve the problem.""Forget the government - our traditional methods will work in this situation. Why can't we try to grow crops from water that we conserve ourselves? There is absolutely no awareness or knowledge of how to sustain and work with nature. We have lost all that our ancestors knew and are instead sinking bore wells for water. At this rate, we will also turn into an arid district like Chikballapur,"" says SC Madhuchandan of Sunaganahally, who runs a farmers' cooperative in Mandya that is trying to revert to water-conservative organic methods in the district.Another member of his cooperative, Mahadev KN of Karaswadi, says he has managed to sow one acre of paddy at a cost of Rs 3,000, which makes growing it more sustainable. ""We need to opt for such methods and all our farmers have to stop taking water in the canal for granted. Not just us, even the people in Tamil Nadu have to think along these lines,"" he contends.State agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda says he has been constantly advocating a change in the cropping pattern and has issued directives asking people not to plant paddy this year due to the distress. Water resources minister Patil has been trying to promote the use of drip irrigation for paddy and sugarcane, which cuts water usage to a trickle and doubles output. He has even chalked out a project involving the government, private sugar mills and farmers, but this has yet to get off the ground.""We need to think along these lines of conservation and better use of water and soil for our crops.Nature is changing and we have to adapt. We cannot depend on governments and courts to bail us out when the rainfall itself is inadequate,"" says Sridhar, another progressive farmer from Holalu.The man on the street, however, is still burning wood and tyres, blocking traffic and burning effigies of Siddaramaiah and Jayalalithaa. Groups of them threaten to block water supply to Bengaluru and Mysuru to force the ""city people"" to fight for Cauvery. The political class is let through the blockades to address street meetings and plan padyatras against the governments and courts, rabble rousing as always, using distress to their advantage.Ugramma at Rudrakshipura, however, is left wondering where to get grains to feed her family of six the next day. All the shops are shut and her home granary is empty."

The highway resembles a paddy field in summer. The protest has been supported by Gulabi Gang commander Sampat Pal.Pal said, ""We appreciate the creative way of protest by locals and pledge support with a hope that authorities will listen to them and solve the problem. ""This is the first time that such a mode of protest has been adopted by the people,"" she added. After much persuasion, the work on the road had begun about a month ago. ""Instead of laying concrete road, the contractor used sand and mud, which has only worsened the situation of the road in the rainy season. Now, it is difficult to walk on it, leave alone drive a vehicle,"" another member of Gulabi Gang said.About a week ago, the protesters had also submitted a memorandum to the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Attara and served a seven-day ultimatum to improve the condition of the road or they will start planting rice saplings on the National Highway. The residents of Badausa, carrying rice saplings, gathered under the banner of Gulabi Gang at the highway last week and planted saplings. They said that the road looks more like a paddy field in rainy season. So, they have decided to plant the paddy saplings on the slushy road. The protest was aimed more at humiliating the authorities, who had failed to construct the road. ""It seems that the agency is indifferent towards the plight of the people of Bundelkhand region,"" Pal alleged and warned ofa big agitation. The villagers had already given a memorandum to the SDM a week ago but nothing has been done. If the authorities turn a blind eye to their problems, the villagers will start a fast and block the road, she added. Another villager Manav Chauhan said the raod had become dangerous for vehicular traffic and many mishaps had occurred. Tempo and private bus operators charge exorbitantly from locals, citing deplorable condition of the roads as the reason.Tehsildar Dhirendra Singh told TOI that the road is manned by National Highway Authority of India . They had apprised officers of NHAI about deplorable condition of road and the protest. ""They had assured us to look into the matter and get the road constructed at the earliest,"" Singh said."

This means that for rice alone, which Tamil Nadu offers 20 kg free of cost to all ration card holders, the state will have to bear an additional subsidy burden of around Rs 2,000 crore every year.Tamil Nadu, which operates a universal Public Distribution System (PDS), has opposed the Central Act that seeks to target PDS to the very poor. A state government policy note tabled in the assembly says that the Centre wants to reduce PDS beneficiaries by half.""The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , has approved a proposal to provide foodgrains to APL category to Tamil Nadu and Kerala at MSP instead of APL rate,"" food minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Wednesday after the meeting.Wheat will now be supplied at the MSP of Rs 15.25 per kg and rice at Rs 22.54 per kg to these two states. The state government police note says that Tamil Nadu receives every month from Food Corporation of India 1.26 lakh tonnes of rice for distribution to APL families at Rs 8.30 per kg. For BPL families, it pays Rs 5.65 per kg for distribution to 1.04 lakh card holders. For Antyodaya Anna Yojana, it receives some 65,000 tonnes every month. The total rice offtake every month is some 4 lakh tonnes in the state through PDS. State government officials have indicated that despite the latest move by the Centre there is no proposal to roll back the universal PDS in the state.In Kerala, there are 82.31 lakh ration cards holders, of which APL families comprise 61.54 lakh.Barring TN and Kerala, 34 states and Union territories have rolled out the NFSA, passed by the Parliament in September 2013 during the UPA regime, either partially or fully. The NFSA aims to abolish the APL and Below Poverty Line (BPL) criteria and uniformly provide 5 kg of wheat or rice to all beneficiaries every month at asubsidised rate of Rs 1-3 per kg."

In Goa, too, rice, in all its forms is a much-loved carb. While most people will swear by a good fish thali as the perfect lunch-time indulgence, rice in its other forms, is just as popular as a breakfast cereal or a tea time snack or even a post- meal sweet indulgence.Be it savoury or sweet preparations, beaten rice (fov) and puffed rice (chirmulleo) are a staple of most Goan kitchens. Pradnya Keni Naik lists out a host of traditional delicacies she makes using beaten rice. ""The all-time favourite undoubtedly is the godd fov made using beaten rice and jaggery. That apart, some of the other popular fov delicacies are batat fov, dudantle fov and rosantle fov,"" she says.The main difference between dudantle fov and rosantle fov is that while the former is made using milk, coconut milk forms the base for the latter. ""Also, in the coconut milk-based preparation, a turmeric leaf is used as a flavouring,"" Naik says.The key point to remember while making either of these two, Naik says, is to keep a little of the milk aside. ""The beaten rice is like a sponge and soaks up all the liquid. Hence, just before serving it up, the dish needs to be topped up using the liquid that is kept aside,"" she says.""Yet another popular savoury snack made using beaten rice is the tikhat fov,"" says foodie Neelam Dutta. Calling it one of her favourites, Dutta says that while most people these days make the dish using store bought beaten rice, using the traditional fullayle fov or rice that is puffed up using hot sand gives the dish an altogether different dimension. The other ingredients that constitute this dish are fine chopped green chillies, spice powders such as pepper, fenugreek, ginger and red chilly and dal or nuts for garnish.Puffed rice laddoos are one of the old favourites that homemaker Urvija Bhatkuly prepares. ""The dish comprises just two ingredients  the puffed rice and melted sugarcane jaggery. It is both, a tasty as well as healthy indulgence.

They have been shepherds, cowherds and buffalo keepers for generations. On the occasion of Dussehra , they worship an embodiment of the life sustaining soil in the goddess Mhalchi Pandhar, and other clan deities through the observance of age-old rites and rituals, consumption of vegetarian food and various folk performances.With the traditional dwelling places of the community having been located inside forested areas and plateaus overgrown with seasonal vegetation, Dussehra celebrations are an expression of the Dhangars, heartfelt gratitude towards the various elements of nature that have been integral parts of their lives. Reduced to a three-day extravaganza at present, the festivities were at one time spread over nine days.Known as Zagor, the first day of the festival sees clan members assembling at an elder's residence, which houses a sacred cane box or 'pud' inside a square 'mandapi' or marquee fashioned out of wild bamboo sticks. It is decorated with five coconuts that are stitched together and seasonal flowers and fruits, with the exception of brinjals.The assembly invokes Goddess Mhalchi Pandhar and other clan deities, praying for blessings to ensure the safety and prosperity of family members and livestock. An earthen pot containing buttermilk is kept at the worship site as an offering.On the morning of the second day, a woollen carpet or 'ghomada' is spread on the ground and an altar is built upon it using rice and finger millet topped with a coconut, betel leaves and nuts. Then the 'pud' is brought out in the open and placed at the altar, after which family elders perform invocations. Basaltic stones known as 'tandale' or metallic symbols known as 'patawa' are worshipped alongside as clan deities. Women perform dances and songs whose themes cover a wide variety of subjects ranging from the behavioural patterns of buffaloes to a description of the floral wealth of the forests and the community's relationship with it.Dressed in white cotton cloaks adorned with red cloth designs, and donning anklets on their feet, the men dance to the rhythmic beats of drums and brass plates. The cheery folk dance called 'Gaja nrutya' is further accompanied by incantations and the melodious tunes of the bamboo flute. The dancers are divided into groups who perform by turns at approximately 30-minute intervals.Offerings accompanied by milk cooked in earthen pots are made at the graves of the communities' ancestors at burial grounds or 'visave', on chandudo (Macaranga peltata) or kudo (Holarrhena antidysentrica) leaves.It is also a tradition among some sections of the Dhangars to worship household tools and equipment decorated with sandal paste, with offerings of seasonal wildflowers.People use the celebrations as an occasion to visit family and community members, relish on the delicacies and take part in the revelries as the sense of community is emboldened and strengthened amid the festive fervour."

But it also retains 80% of the original Kavuni rice's health benefits.""We crossed the original kavuni rice with the popular and widely consumed CO 50 variety of white rice way back in 2005,"" said P Jeya Prakash, head of the rice department at TNAU. ""It took us almost nine years to keep crossing them to finally arrive at a variety that had the properties we expected,"" he said.Cultivation trials of the rice are currently under way across the state.The traditional Kavuni rice is grown in small scale in the Karaikudi region, and gives a yield of hardly 800kg to 900kg per acre. It is mainly used to make sweet dishes.""There is a belief that despite being a sweet or dessert, consumption of the rice does not increase the sugar levels in the body,"" said Jeya Prakash. ""But since the rice can only be used to make sweet dishes, specifically requires shorter days to mature, flowers only between October and November and easily gets dislodged by wind, it was cultivated in just small patches,"" he said.TNAU began studying this rice in 2005 to see if it can be made commercially viable. ""We conducted biochemical studies on the rice to confirm if it actually contained anti-diabetic properties,"" said S Robin, the head researcher for the project and current dean of post-graduate studies at TNAU.""We then discovered that it contains less carbohydrates. The colour consists of phenols which inhibit the enzymes which break down the starch. So the starch breakdown and glucose release process is delayed by almost 30 minutes,"" he said. ""It also contains anthocyanin which fights stress and carotenoids which strengthens muscles in the eyes,"" Robin said.""The crop duration is 135 to 140 days, it can be cultivated year round, requires regular irrigation and does not get dislodged easily,"" Robin said. ""The yield is also 2,000kg per acre which is close to average white rice yield which is around 2,400kg per acre,"" he said.The rice is to be cooked by taking equal quantities of the Kovai Kavuni rice and white rice and boiling it to make idlis and dosas. While they do still retain the brown colour, they taste similar to the normal white rice dishes."

Thilothaman said a total of 1,47,947 complaints about the draft list had been received across the State. The last date for receiving complaints has been extended to November 5 and panchayat-level verification committees set up to ensure that all eligible people are included, he said while replying to the notice for an adjournment motion moved by former Minister for Food Anoop Jacob.Mr. Jacob said the anomalies in the draft list had led to a serious situation, with thousands flocking to panchayat and village offices to register complaints. The policy decision taken by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to prepare a State-level priority list instead of the taluk-level ranking had led to a setback in the revision of ration cards.In a sharp reaction, Mr. Thilothaman said the previous UDF regime had initiated work on the priority list only in 2015, two years after the NFSA was implemented. They are responsible for the cut in the States quota of rice from the Centre.The State government has done no homework to complete the preparation of the priority list, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said.Mr. Thilothaman assured the House that Ashraya beneficiaries, workers of the employment guarantee scheme, and marginalised sections would be included in the list of people eligible for ration supply.

Well, it's true, and Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers' Union (Milma) has now taken steps to help farmers make their cows belch and fart less through dietary interventions.India, which has the world's largest livestock population of 512 million, produces 11.75 million tonnes of methane - a strong greenhouse gas which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 as a heat-trapping gas, every year. This was revealed in a study done at the Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre in 2009.Figures released by ministry of statistics and programme implementation in 2015, based on 2007 data, pegged the figure at 10,099 thousand metric tonnes of methane, accounting for 49.11% of the total national methane emission of 20,564 thousand metric tonnes.After the recent Paris accord on climate change, the cattle dietary change is being touted as a new step to control emissions! Malabar Rural Development Foundation (MRDF), under Milma, has started a campaign to cut methane and other GHG emissions from livestock by prodding farmers to provide balanced rations to animals by popularizing its TMR (total mixed ration) feed. MRDF has dished out a short animation video, with handy tips, on methane mitiga tion to farmers.""Reduction of methane emissions from livestock is vital for long-term sustainability of dairy industry.It has been demonstrated that methane production by cows can be reduced by making appropriate changes in nutrition and feed.Apart from expanding the ration balancing programme to around 25,000 animals in the Malabar region, we are also popularizing our high quality TMR feed formulation, which is easily digestible,"" said MRDF CEO K Damodaran Nair MRDF officials claim that TMR had the optimum mix of fibre and protein content which helped in easy digestion and thereby causing less flatulence in cattle.He said that the ingredients in TMR include highquality forages like alfalfa along with groundnut, maize hay, grains like maize, tapioca powder, brans like rice bran, chunnies of black gram, green gram, molasses, salt, mineral mixture etc.Technical officer of MRFD's ration balancing programme (RBP) N Ahammed Khais , said that a study conducted by national dairy development board (NDDB) showed that cows fed with balanced ration under RBP programme emitted around 10-15% less methane.""Cows traditionally fed on low quality roughages like dried rice straw produced more methane.

It has four panels with a top crest,"" Costa explained.The stone was retrieved not far away from a rice field named ""Kinjalange"" situated to the north of the Kadamba capital Govapuri, in the village Sulibhatti (now Sulabhat in Agasaim). According to historian V T Gune, this is referred to in a Goa plate in the context of a donation of the rice field by Kadamba king, Shasthadeva III.The stone depicts on its panels exquisite and dynamic scenes, but some parts are worn out as the stone was buried. The second panel from the bottom is divided from the third by a natural defect in the slab, a vein of quartz (silica), said Costa.The important finding has become the latest addition to Pilar Seminary Museum, to which Costa has contributed significantly by setting it up in coordination with other Pilar society members. It has turned into a veritable treasure trove of history, showcasing artefacts found in and around the hillock. The artefacts belong to various religions.Perched on a hillock with a picturesque view, the museum is part of an extensive complex, which includes besides a theological college, educational and other institutions.The Kadamba capital sprawled around the Pilar hillock, extended up to the banks of Zuari river. Their glorious reign extended almost three centuries from 10th to 12th AD. Many artefacts from the Kadamba era find a prominent place in the museum.The Goa Kadambas often faced the heat in the four-pronged battle for power between them and the Chalukya emperors of Kalyani, Yadavas of Devagiri and Hoysalas of Halebid for control over the Deccan.The Yadavas were irked by King Sovideva's assertive moves and issuing of gold coins in 1241/2 and 1245/6. Their forces marched against Sovideva in 1246 and slew him.""Surely, Yadavs did not carve the hero stone but his son, Shasthadeva III did to honour him,"" said Costa.Others argue that the hero could be Sovideva or any other victim of Muslim invasions. ""But there is no allusion in records that anyone else 'was slain'. In addition, the hero depicted in the viragal is shown with a crown like a king in at least three panels,"" Costa said."

And one with pedigree calls for a celebration. Now if that establishment can serve as an impetus to breathe new life into a part of town that not many people visit, then may be well bring out those cocktail glasses to make a toast. The cherry on the top is the fact that The Clearing House  Ballard Estates new restaurant and bar  is located in what used to be an ice factorys machine room.Led by Rishad Nathani, nephew of Rahul Akerkar, and his company Breadbox Hospitality, The Clearing House is a 4,000-square-foot space that sits on Calicut Road in Ballard Estate. The eaterys name has been inspired by the locales history; a time when it was home to clearing houses, warehouses and offices for the ships that used to dock close by.In the kitchen is Nitin Kulkarni, who, like most of the team, worked under Akerkar at Indigo. He helms the kitchen that churns out dishes that include kale and bulgur wheat tabbouleh (ideal for lunch), red rice risotto with confit root vegetables, and five spice duck breast with pulled duck tortellini and cauliflower mash.Nathani says, This reminded me of the Meatpacking District in New York, back in the day. There's an ice factory next door, its functional, and this was the machine room for the ice factory. During the British days, this was the open-air water tank that supplied water into the factory. With evolving health and hygiene standards, the water tank was no longer needed and became a free-to-use space.The Clearing House has been divided into two parts: the bright (at least in the day time) Foyer and the darker, more nocturnal appropriate Chamber. During lunchtime, the former  with its monochrome flooring, skylight that looks up to an ancient chimney and blue walls  is where you can sit for a meal. On the other hand, dinners can be had in the sleek, circular booths that characterise the space in the Chamber. The delicate indoor lights are a contrast to the iron ceiling, that remains from its ice factory days. The interiors have been designed by Sameep Padora and Vami Koticha of sP+a architects, who have worked on the looks of a range of restaurant spaces in the past; from the gritty Khar Social, to the recently opened Hitchki in Kala Ghoda.The focus though is purely on the food, and Nathani is clear that he doesnt want it to become a nightclub or lounge. Rather, it ought to be a restaurant with a bar that is attached. Nathani, as a South Mumbai resident, has noticed that there is nowhere to go out on weekends, and hes hoping that The Clearing House becomes a viable option for those who want to let their hair down, without first having to crawl through traffic to get to Lower Parel or beyond. Theres no adult bar scene, so to speak [in this part of town], he says. I dont want to get pushed around [when out drinking], and so I thought why not have my own place, he adds alluding to the proliferation of cheap and cheerful watering holes all over the city.Expect the menu to be ingredient driven, rather than focusing on any particular cuisine. So youll see miso-glazed black cod rubbing shoulders with baby lamb bolognese . Thats good news for family diners, as those visiting can sample various cuisines, all handled competently by expert staff. Special mention goes to the plump green-lipped mussels served with a Provenal sauce, and the udon noodles with coconut basil broth that manages to be light yet packed with flavour.Desserts, which are crafted by Husna Jumani, feature a range of options, including some for those on a diet. The sugar-free and gluten-free honey flan is served with fresh figs, sour cherry and a balsamic reduction, while those looking to up their calorie intake can try the cheesecake with lemon curd, Swiss meringue and blueberry coulis, or the chocolate pot de crme.The Clearing House, Ballard Estate; 6223 2266/ 67; Timings: from noon to 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. onwards for dinnerThe author is a freelance writer"

Already 30 rice mill owners have entered into a contract with the Supplyco to procure the harvest of the cultivation during the rainy season (Virippu krishi).The allotments for each mills will be handed over as and when the padasekhara samithis's near the time of harvesting. Virippu krishi is active in Aymanam, Arpookkara, Vechoor and Kumarakom panchayats in the district. Among them Aymanam and Arpookara produces more. On Thursday, procurement from the biggest padasekaharam in the district Aymanam Menonkari commenced.Around 8000 farmers have registered with Supplyco for Virippu Krishi. The Government have taken steps to transfer the amount without much delay to the accounts of the farmers after procurement of paddy, said District Paddy marketing officer. The Supplyco officials have made it clear that those farmers who do not possess account in nationalised banks will get the cash through their accounts in Cooperative banks. The Supplyco officials have informed the farmers that based on the Food Corporation of India (FCI) guidelines the water content of the paddy should be less than 17pc. If the water content is above this level, paddy will be procured only after drying it. So the major threat faced by the farmers is rains which will increase the water content. Digital moisture metre will be used to determine the water content. Currently, the mill owners on behalf of the Supplyco are ready to procure one quintal of paddy from the farmers for Rs 190. The contract with the Supplyco is that 68 kg of rice should be given to them from one quintal of paddy."

A group of tribal villagers dressed in their traditional attire re-enacted the manual methods of agriculture.Also on display was the traditional tribal monsoon wear known as konddo made from moll (woven leaves of the coconut tree). Besides, the bunch of onions called chuddi, traditional household items like the bhann (copper pot), handdo, dhonn, aine, kunnnnem (vessel for cooking curry), tizal (vessel for cooking meat), mattttul (lid covering the cooking vessel), doulo (ladle made from coconut shell), nevonem (pot stand made of grass), dhavonn (vessel for storing rice, etc), kode/kodul (vessel for collecting rice water), gurguret (earthenware pot for storing drinking water), budculo/bindul/xidi (vessels to carry water), tamio (mug), potrall (plate made from leaves) and tost (a brass vessel in which plates were washed) were also exhibited alongside three percussion musical instruments  ghumott, madalem and kasalem (cymbals).While stalls selling Goan traditional sweet dishes like pattoleo, soji, pinagre, dos, xirvoio as well as sannas, fov, ross satiated ones hunger, others sold locally-cultivated fruits, vegetables, plants, home-made pickles, dry fish, tender coconuts, coconut oil and ayurvedic medicine.Participating troupes mostly hailing from the scheduled tribes (ST) community from Quepem, Verna, Nuvem, Lotoulim, Velim, Sao Jose de Areal, Ilha-de-Rachol, Dicarpale, Davorlim, Fatorda and Raia enthusiastically displayed their talents in the Kapodd nhessop, Ghumott dance, zagor, kharvi and kunbi dance, Goan traditional cuisine and fancy dress contests.: Verna Industries Association (VIA) has commissioned a pilot study to prepare a comprehensive map of the industrial area through a private agency.The expansion of Verna industrial zone, first styled as an electronic city, but deviating beyond the non-polluting norm during the five-phased expansion has left many villagers and environmentalists pained by the damage to ecology.The famed Kesarval spring drying up in recent years is just one graphic example. A large natural cave near old Mardol faces threats from the ever-increasing industrial activity.The study envisages mapping of the area and various levels of the plateau. Once we get the data, anybody will be able to use it. We are willing to collaborate with environmentalists to promote sustainable development, VIA president Damodar Kochkar said.The association had initiated a scheme to identify points for groundwater recharging. The units are hoping for a dedicated pipeline to supply 30 million litres per day (MLD) raw water to more than 400 units to help mitigate one part of the problem. The pumping of water from bore wells will stop once the pipeline is commissioned, Kochkar said.Villagers point out that the industrial area has reached saturation point. With requirements of water and power inadequate, where will migrant labour stay when they are already a burden to villagers, as problems of open defecation, waste collection, health and other issues crop up, Joao Philip Pereira, a Nagoa resident, said. Sez Virodhi Manch, a group opposing special economic zones, had demanded that 25 lakh sq m of SEZ land in Loutolim and Verna be utilized for social needs like educational institutions.

58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

Photo: S. Harpal SinghWhile the world measures wealth in terms of currency the Adivasi Gonds and Kolams of Agency areas in Adilabad district continue to measure wealth in terms of number of cows and for these tribes Lakshmi Puja, on the day after Diwali, is time to worship cows.On Monday the members of the two tribes performed Mura Mituswal or cow worship, an important event in the Adivasi ethos. The cows are fed with sauted round eatable made of green gram garkang, a stuffed sweet roti puran poli and rice with ghee ghato before its puja.According to the tradition the woman of the household stands close to the cattle shed handing out rice to neighbours for sprinkling on the cows to bless the animals. The householders are then greeted by those who worshipped their cows.As Gond and Kolam farmers were livestock breeders the tradition was well celebrated until about three decades ago. Every Adivasi household in the Agency areas of the undivided Adilabad district had boasted of at least five cows.For example, Kanaka Pollu of Marlavai village owned 30 cows in the mid 1990s. Now he has only three as taking care of the bovines became an increasingly difficult task due to lack of hands in the family. From a milk consuming society, these aboriginal people have strangely been rendered as those who have no use for the dairy product, within the last three decades. Not many own cows these days and those who do, are a shade better in terms of resources but aim only at breeding bullocks.Pastures are dwindling, fodder has become costly and we are unable to spend time for herding the cows to graze in nearby jungles, Kodapa Rama Rao of Jainoor in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district said explaining the reasons for the dwindling number of livestock."

If we make agriculture even slightly more efficient in water use, we will never need to worry about drinking water shortage for a long time, said the party.It suggested that an independent monitoring authority be established to oversee the process by which agriculture in the Cauvery basin could be made less dependent on water.Drawing attention to some of the prevailing methods of crop cultivation, Prithvi Reddy, State convener and national executive member, AAP-Karnataka, said agriculture should be more water-smart and both paddy and sugarcane could be cultivated with less water by switching to techniques such as System of Rice Intensification (SRI).Defunct servicesBut adopting SRI has been extremely patchy and the extension services that the government operates are most defunct, and may as well be closed down, said Mr. Reddy.The party also called upon the Centre to overhaul the water infrastructure of Bengaluru, which consumes about 4 per cent of the river water. It said the scheme should have multiple objectives of plugging the 20 per cent to 30 per cent loss of the piped water, putting at least 40 per cent of all Cauvery-sourced water to multiple use through dual piping in homes and offices, and establishment of a more nimble infrastructure to source water for the city from the 300-odd lakes in and around it.Other suggestionsA scheme like this will double the piped water supply in Bengaluru and it will additionally have the effect of infusing some financial and technological life to the moribund BWSSB, which today operates like an unscientific infrastructure company rather than an intelligent manager of water resource, according to AAP.The other suggestions included de-silting of the existing reservoirs so as to augment their storage capacity, while a sincere effort should be made to restore the flow in the many tributaries of the river, the party said.Establish an independent monitoring authority to oversee agriculture in the Cauvery basin"

Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the two States that were holding out against pressure from New Delhi to implement the National Food Security Act (NFSA), have also fallen in line. By threatening to raise the price at which it was allocating foodgrains if they did not implement the law, the Centre has managed to get these two States to agree to the implementation of the Act from November 1. If they had not done so, they would have had to pay Rs.22.54 a kg for rice for their monthly allocations under the above poverty line (APL) category, as against the Rs.8.30 a kg they are paying now. For Tamil Nadu, it would have meant an additional expenditure of Rs.2,730 crore, over and above the Rs.2,393 crore it is spending on its universal public distribution system (PDS). The State says it will implement the Act and also continue its universal PDS coverage. In the bargain, it will have to maintain a uniform supply of 5 kg of rice per person as stipulated in the NFSA, and protect the existing entitlements of PDS beneficiaries. The resultant increase in offtake would result in additional expenditure of Rs.1,193 crore for Tamil Nadu. Kerala maintains an APL-BPL distinction in its PDS. However, its concerns over the implementation of the Act related to the possibility that many beneficiaries may be left out under the Centres categorisation of PDS consumers into priority households and others.Over the last year or so, Kerala and Tamil Nadu had been warming to the idea of joining the NFSA, but sought time to do so. They wanted to complete end-to-end computerisation of their PDS and the process of seeding Aadhaar numbers with family cards. One clear advantage of joining the national food security system now is that the computerisation and Aadhaar seeding process may result in the elimination of bogus cards and beneficiaries. Tamil Nadus case for such a clean-up is glaring as the number of people covered by its family cards is about 7.81 crore while the States population is 7.21 crore. There are lessons for both the Centre and the States in this conflict involving a zealous Central government seeking to force its idea of food security on States that believe they are already addressing the issue with the same, if not greater, level of seriousness. A national food security law may hold good for States with weak food security systems  but for the rest, it would perhaps be better if States implemented their own schemes. On the other hand, the States need to temper their zeal for more than universal coverage with a realistic assessment and identification of beneficiaries."

The order was issued by the Andhra Pradesh State Legal Services Authority, based on a petition filed by a student organisation and a news item published in The Hindu , in April this year. The rice issue has come to the fore when students staying in the hostels protested for being served sub-standard rice for both lunch and dinner.The issue was brought to the notice of the Registrar and the then Vice-Chancellor several times, but no action was taken and then we decided to take the legal route, said a student from the science hostel.But after the new Vice-Chancellor G. Nageswara Rao took over he removed all the old wardens and appointed new persons in their place, but has not recommended an inquiry. Though there is an improvement, we demand that an independent inquiry panel be set up and a detailed investigation be taken up, as the irregularities have been going on for the last five years, said a student leader. The 90-year-old university has about 6,100 students, including women, spread across five major hostels, and the daily consumption of rice is about 2,280 kg, which makes the monthly requirement tune up to around 68,000 kg and yearly about 680 tonnes.The students alleged that sub-standard rice was procured by the earlier wardens without following a proper tendering procedure and there was a cut of about Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 per kg. The Registrar had then informed The Hindu that the procurement of rice lacked a tendering system and had reports of sub-standard rice being served and even assured to look into the matter. Now, with the Collector initiating the move based on the court order, we look forward for a fair inquiry and the necessary action taken, said Srinivas Rao, a student leader.Now, with Collector initiating a move, we look forward for a fair inquiry.Srinivasa RaoStudent leader"

The temple authorities supplied pulihora and chakkera pongali prasadam to the officials and other employees.Even as the meeting was going on, the Minister intervened and said, EO garu is this the quality which you are maintaining in the preparation of the prasadams? I found an impurity in the pulihora.Going further, he asked the employees attending the meeting to spell out their experience. As the officials and employees laughed nervously, the Minister said, The quality of chakkera pongali is good. I hope you maintain the same quality and standards in the preparation of the prasadam for the common man.Common complaintThe quality of prasadam at the Kanaka Durga temple hits the headlines now and then. The devotees complain that the quality is not up to the mark. Most devotees complain that quality ingredients are not used and cashew nuts and green chillies are missing in the preparations of pulihora. The rice used for cooking pulihora is not of fine quality and laddus are getting dry and hard in summer, they allege. There were instances that the devotees lodged complaints with the higher ups in Hyderabad during Dasara festivities.Every day about 25,000 to 30,000 laddus and six to eight quintals of pulihora are sold at the prasadam counters in the temple. During Fridays, Sundays and general holidays, laddu sales increase to nearly 40,000 and 12 to 15 quintals of pulihora is sold per day.Though pulihora is a much sought-after prasadam on normal days, it is less preferred on the festive days. On an average, no less than 20,000 packets of pulihora are sold every day during the festival.wwAnd the sale touches 40,000 packets on important days during the festival."

Our objective is not to oppose the judiciary. We do not even dream of such a thought.We are in an extremely difficult situation and the State is facing distress for the second consecutive year and hence it is not possible to release water.The resolution means the Karnataka government has the backing of the State legislature to continue to refuse to implement the Supreme Courts September 20 order to release water at the rate of 6,000 cusecs to Tamil Nadu from September 21 to 27.Tamil Nadu had demanded water for sowing of the samba rice crop in the delta districts of the State.Interestingly, the carefully worded one-page resolution adopted by the Houses had no reference to the Supreme Court orders in the matter or statements made by Tamil Nadu.

Anand sacked four employees on corruption charges, on Friday.He also issued a stringent warning to all the staff saying he would not tolerate any kind of malfeasance and wanted them to turn a new leaf as the department was a crucial one for the government.The four employees - M.S.A. Saleem (Karimnagar), V. Venkataramana (Khammam), J. Bhaskar Reddy (Nalgonda) and A. Bal Reddy - were working in the quality control cell.Mr. Anand told the staff at a meeting of district managers that he has observed the functioning of the department closely in the last couple of months and would come down mercilessly on those continuing their malpractices.Stating that he was armed with a list of those resorting to corrupt practices from the reports submitted by the vigilance and intelligence officers, he said the government would not hesitate to even remove the staffers from service if they do not mend their ways.Farmers should be helped at the rice purchase centres and any delay in online payment should be immediately brought to the notice of the head office. Earlier, in a meeting with the ration shop dealers, the Commissioner was equally firm with them and told them in no uncertain terms that their demands for increasing the commission and other issues would be taken up only after he receives a positive feedback from the general public.There have been complaints about diversion of cheap rice to black market, shops not maintaining timings etc, and the department was refraining from cancelling any licences to give an opportunity to rectify their work.However, Mr. Anand offered to consider their request for introduction of electronic weighing machines, biometric systems and printers at godowns."

A large part of the country is witnessing drought, declining ground-water levels, and shortage in reservoirs, following two consecutive sub-normal monsoons.Deficit rainfallRainfall deficiency in 2014 and 2015 stood at 12 per cent and 14 per cent of normal, respectively. In 2015 rainfall received by Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Punjab and West Uttar Pradesh was more than 50 per cent below normal. This has taken a toll on agricultural production, according to the report.As per the third advance estimates for 2015, rice output was down two per cent, coarse cereals fell 12 per cent, pulses declined by 0.5 per cent along with sugarcane (0.5 per cent) and oilseeds, (six per cent) exacerbating rural distress. Agriculture GDP growth averaged 0.4 per cent in the last two fiscals, much below the long-term trend of 3 per cent.An above-normal monsoon this year will augment groundwater and reservoir levels and in turn increase crop production, according to the report.The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reiterated its April forecast of a good south-west monsoon  at 106 per cent of the long period average (LPA). However, the report said that the sensitivity of crops to rainfall signals the need for improvement in irrigation facilities, change in cropping patterns, harnessing of rainwater, adoption of water conservation techniques and availability of stable electricity. Also, efficiency of water usage needs to improve. India currently uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, compared with half that  or 1,321 cubic metre  in China. This underlines the need to address structural issues. An important source of irrigation in India is groundwater, which accounts for as much as 60 per cent of water used for irrigation. Also, irrigation accounts for close to 90 per cent of the total groundwater consumed in the country  the proportion is 98 per cent and 94 per cent for in Punjab and Haryana, respectively.Farm outputDuring the green revolution, the report said, with excessive use of inputs to pump up farm output, farmers increasingly moved towards using groundwater compared with surface water for irrigation. This was supported by government subsidies for electricity supply and irrigation equipment. Excessive use of groundwater has led to depletion of the water table. Between 1993-94 and 2014-15, the share of wells with groundwater less than 10 metre has fallen by 6 percentage points, while that of wells with groundwater more than 60 metre has risen to 6 per cent from 4 per cent, making it increasingly difficult to access ground water.India uses 2,800 cubic metre of water to produce 1 tonne of rice, while China uses half that amount"

Late at night, when his parents are asleep, as an adolescent boy admires a picture of Misty Mountains, Los Angeles former favourite porn star, lasciviously posing in a car, a real car comes crashing down the terrace of the house. The boy goes outside to find the other casualty of the accident  a car that looks similar to the one in the picture. And in it lies Misty Mountains, dead and naked. He takes off his jacket to cover the body of the same woman he has been fantasising about a few minutes ago.The scene is a hark back to several Hollywood noir classics set in LA. The deceitful world hiding government corruption with a private eye in hot pursuit as in Chinatown, the mysterious disappearance of Hollywood-hopeful starlet from Mulholland Drive, the inner circles of the porn industry as in Boogie Nights. Deliberately or not, it also has two important cast members from LA Confidential that was based on the citys dark underbelly  Russell Crowe and Kim Bassinger.The Nice Guys is a comedy but not a dark one. For one, it doesnt take itself too seriously. The film by Shane Black is completely comfortable in being a light, fun film. Even though the humour is silly, there is drollness in it. And with a handful of characters solidly etched, we also have a decent drama.Holland (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to investigate the dead porn star  Misty Mountain. It leads him to encounter Jackson (Russell Crowe), another private eye on the case, but with less reputable credentials. They dont really get along very well. They are never on the same page.Yet, there is a brotherhood, an understanding that they need to watch each others back. Meanwhile, Jackson also develops a fondness for Hollands daughter and vice versa. Together, their quest to find the truth about the murder becomes an LA adventure through private poolside parties, hotels and hilly driveways.The film is set in late 70s and the period gives the film a warm, retro, fluid texture.But more than anything else, The Nice Guys works because the chemistry between its actors is crackling. Gosling shows great comic timing as the low on confidence single father, Crowes perfect as the ageing officer who has his own way of doing things. Angouri Rice as Goslings good-hearted and courageous daughter adds to the buddy-movie fun.The familiarity of where the story is heading stops it from being a piece of its kind. None of the twists really have the shock but the action has a whimsical quality about it.The Nice Guys is a nice-ish film that doesn't try too hard. And that is a relief.

In Daan we will feed a 100 orphaned children at a leading restaurant in the city. Other organisations supporting the drive too had similar ideas.We are starting a rice bucket challenge in which people are encouraged to donate rice, dal and pulses for the needy. We will also mobilise funds to support the needy by conducting a walkathon for morning walkers who come to Osmania University, said Ali, a student leader of Osmania University and a member of, Yuva, an NGO run by OU students. Students of Vishnu Group of Institutions too have decided to contribute rice and necessary groceries to the economically under privileged.The citys needy will also get medical support.

As per Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) of Malkangiri, Uday Shankar Mishra, till now around 14 children between the age of two to eight years have been identified to be suffering from symptoms of encephalitis. Some of them are being treated in Malkangiri district hospital and six have been referred to MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur. All these children had developed symptoms related to encephalitis that includes fever, lethargy and vomiting.This time the suspected encephalitis cases are being reported from Korkunda, Kalimela, Pandripani blocks of the district, the CDMO added. Blood samples of these children have also been sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre (RMRC) for tests to ascertain whether they have been infected by JE or any other form of encephalitis. Remote pockets of Malkangiri district have history of encephalitis infection, especially among children. In 2012 during monsoon months, several children had died in the district allegedly due to encephalitis. Some suspected cases of the disease were also reported from the district in 2013. In 2014 it was alleged that around ten children had died in the district because of it.So, as precautionary measure, awareness drive as well as measures to curb mosquito menace has been started in all rural areas of the district. Medical teams are visiting most prone areas. The virus causing JE is transmitted by mosquitoes belonging to the Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex vishnui groups, which breed particularly in flooded rice fields. Bodies of pigs are its major breeding points. All these factors are prevalent in rural areas of Malkangiri district. So, there is extra watch on areas where pig population is high."

58f6d59fa3d24b0b70c2f7a7,Dark clouds over the PDS,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Dark-clouds-over-the-PDS/article14631425.ece,2016-09-10,"Indias Public Distribution System (PDS) has improved steadily during the last 10 years. The system used to be most ineffective and corruption-ridden, with leakages of around 50 per cent at the national level, going up to 80 or 90 per cent in some States. Around 2007, Chhattisgarh took the lead in reforming the PDS  making it more inclusive, methodical and transparent. Within a few years, the system was overhauled. Today, most rural households in Chhattisgarh have a ration card, and are able to secure their entitlements (typically 7 kg of rice per person per month) on time every month.The Chhattisgarh modelLater on, it turned out that the Chhattisgarh model (so to speak) was replicable. Odisha was among the first States to emulate Chhattisgarhs experience, with similar results. Many other States also initiated Chhattisgarh-style PDS reforms: broad coverage, clear entitlements, de-privatisation of PDS shops, separation of transport agencies from distribution agencies, computerisation, fixed distribution schedules, tight monitoring, active grievance redressal, and more.In the last few years, I have been involved in several surveys of the PDS initiated by independent researchers with student volunteers. In 2011, we studied the PDS in nine States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. We found that the system was working reasonably well for below poverty line (BPL) households: on average, they were receiving 84 per cent of their foodgrain entitlements from the PDS. A similar picture emerged from a follow-up survey in 2013. However, high leakages continued in the above poverty line (APL) quota, which tended to be used by the Central government at that time as a dumping ground for excess food stocks.The National Food Security Act (NFSA), enacted three years ago, was  and still is  a chance to complete the process of PDS reform and ensure a modicum of food security for everyone. Under the NFSA, the APL category is abolished and eligible households come under two well-defined categories: priority households, entitled to 5 kg of foodgrains per person per month at nominal prices, and Antyodaya households (the poorest), entitled to 35 kg per household per month. The PDS is to cover at least 75 per cent of rural households at the national level, rising to 80-90 per cent in the poorest States.Impending setbackIn June this year, we went back to six of Indias poorest States (Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal) for an update. We found that four out of six had a fairly good PDS, with most NFSA cardholders receiving the bulk of their entitlements every month and relatively low exclusion errors. The last two, Jharkhand and especially Bihar, still have a long way to go. Even there, however, the situation is much better than it was a few years ago. In Jharkhand, for instance, the transparency of the system has vastly improved, and the official NFSA website is among the best in the country. However, recent progress is in danger of being undone soon due to the Central governments counter-productive push for Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at PDS shops, and verifying the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet.This system requires multiple fragile technologies to work at the same time: the PoS machine, the biometrics, the Internet connection, remote servers, and often other elements such as the local mobile network. Further, it requires at least some household members to have an Aadhaar number, correctly seeded in the PDS database.This is a wholly inappropriate technology for rural India, especially in the poorest States. Even in State capitals, network failures and other glitches routinely disable this sort of technology. In villages with poor connectivity, it is a recipe for chaos. Note that Internet dependence is inherent to Aadhaar since there is no question of downloading the biometrics.Recent developments in Rajasthan illustrate the dangers of forcing biometric authentication on the PDS. During the last few months, the Government of Rajasthan has tried hard to enforce the system. The use of PoS machines is compulsory and every PDS shop has one. Yet, according to official data compiled by Nikhil Dey, only 61 per cent of Rajasthans foodgrain allocation found its way through the PoS system in July 2016, with a similar figure (63 per cent) for August. The rest is either siphoned off or delivered using the old register system  which of the two is hard to say since utter confusion prevails about the permissibility of using registers as a fallback option.Further evidence comes from Ranchi district in Jharkhand where the PoS system is also mandatory. In July 2016, NFSA cardholders in Ranchi district received less than half of their foodgrain entitlements through that system, according to the model website mentioned earlier. The situation was much the same in August.As in Rajasthan, it is not clear whether those for whom the PoS system does not work in Ranchi are getting any grain through the old register system. Officially, that is not allowed, according to local PDS dealers and officials (indeed, some dealers have been suspended for using this fallback option). Even if it happens unofficially, this dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the PoS system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst. The reason is that only PDS dealers know whether and when the register system is permissible, and they have no incentive to share that information with the cardholders. Quite likely, the new system is reviving PDS corruption in Jharkhand, reversing a healthy trend towards lower leakages in recent years.A short visit to a PDS shop just outside Ranchi quickly brings out the multiple vulnerabilities of the new system. Within minutes we met many people who had been deprived of their food rations for months because they had no Aadhaar number; or because their Aadhaar number had not been correctly seeded; or because their biometrics did not work, or simply because the PoS machine returned various error messages.Even those for whom the system works face huge inconvenience. Often they have to make repeated trips to the PDS shop, or send different members in turn, until the machine cooperates. Sometimes schoolchildren are asked to skip classes and try their luck at the PDS shop. This unreliable system causes a colossal waste of time for everyone.By the way, all this is one year after I was told by the Food Departments upbeat consultants that the PoS system is functional throughout Ranchi district.The Aadhaar juggernautIn spite of ample warnings, the Central government continues to push for compulsory Aadhaar-based biometric authentication in the PDS. Incidentally, this is a violation of Supreme Court orders. The court did allow the use of Aadhaar in the PDS, but not making it compulsory for PDS users. Nor can the government invoke the Aadhaar Act to justify this move: the relevant sections of the Act are yet to be notified.PoS machines seem to be expected to ensure a corruption-free PDS. This expectation, however, builds on a misunderstanding of PDS leakages. The main vulnerability today, at least in the States I am familiar with, is not identity fraud (e.g. bogus cards), but quantity fraud: PDS dealers often give people less than what they are entitled to, and pocket the rest. PoS machines are ineffective in preventing quantity fraud. They may help in reducing identity fraud, such as it is, but that does not justify depriving people of their food entitlements when the technology fails.As with many other applications of Aadhaar, this one is proceeding like a juggernaut, without paying serious attention to the collateral damage. Instead, the Central government peddles bogus figures of Aadhaar-enabled financial savings (often relayed by unsuspecting columnists or economists) to justify further imposition of the technology. It is only when concerned journalists, activists or researchers make enquiries from the victims that we learn about the adverse effects of Aadhaar on the PDS.The Central government and its advisers pride themselves on their commitment to evidence-based policy, but this is a case where evidence is being systematically ignored to press on with technological solutions based on blind faith (handsomely nurtured by commercial interests). The drive to impose biometric authentication on the PDS must stop immediately to avoid further damage. There are better ways of plugging last-mile leakages, including the use of simpler technologies not dependent on the Internet. Imposing a technology that does not work on people who depend on it for their survival is a grave injustice.Jean Drze is Visiting Professor at the Department of Economics, Ranchi University.The dual system, where PDS grain goes partly through the Aadhaar-based Point of Sale system and partly through the fallback register system, is the worst"

Though the outbreak has been reported from several parts of Cheyyar, Vandavasi, Vembakkam and Arani taluks in the district, it is severe in villages such as Thandarai, Mukkur, Thavasi, Purisai, Alathur and Dusi, etc.,Vakkadai V.G. Purushothaman, state office-bearer of Thamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam (non-political) said that crops in about 500 acres of land have been affected by disease. In Navarai season, about 3,000 acres were hit. We submitted nearly petitions of farmers who sought compensation for the loss and took up the issue several times, but the government has not responded yet. Officials need to educate farmers on how to protect their crops from the outbreak. If farmers adopted the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), the disease could be curtailed, he added.Reduce urea levelsAn agricultural department official said that excessive application of urea and wrong selection were the causes for the outbreak of the disease. Only half a bag of urea should be applied for an acre of paddy crop. However, since urea is easily available, farmers even apply up to four bags. More urea might make the crop look greener but it would reduce their immunity making them susceptible to planthopper attack, he said.Another reason for the outbreak is the indiscriminate use of Pyrethroid pesticides. They apply this for any kind of pests based on unstudied referrals. These pesticides invite planthopper and if it is already present, they aggravate it further. If the pests are found in crops, people need to spray 400 ml of imidacloproid pesticide per acre. It should be applied on tillers after draining water from the field. If SRI method is followed, there would be sufficient space between rows that facilitates easy application on tillers. Hence the disease is better controlled, the official said."

A worker engaged for catching rats using conventional net on Thursday. Photo: B. Velankanni RajRodents have been posing a problem to farmers who had taken up kuruvai paddy cultivation in parts of Lalgudi block. The crop has been raised on 4,874 hectares, with Lalgudi block accounting for a maximum of 3,215 hectares while Thuraiyur and other areas account for the balance 1,659 hectares.Farmers said that the recent showers had come as a blessing for them as the crop has started registering appreciable growth. But, the showers had also brought a problem in the form of rat menace.Realising the need for controlling rats, the Agriculture Department has planned to organise an awareness campaign among the farmers to destroy rats from the fields. Normally, the Department recommended use of zinc phosphate but it should be handled carefully and any negligence in washing hands would prove injurious to health. The Department has planned to conduct a campaign recommending the use of anti-coagulants which ensured safe disposal of rats, an official told The Hindu here on Thursday. The use of anti-coagulants along with rice flour or some eatables would attract the rats.M. Muruganandam, a farmer of Koyyathoppe in Andanallur block said that the problem has come at a time when the crop was registering a fair growth. He had been availing the services of labourers who are skilled in catching rats.The labourers said that they were fully aware of the movement of rats from the burrows to the fields.

Pulses bring in more profits, take lesser time to grow, require lesser water than paddy and fix nitrogen in the soil, thus reducing the use of fertilizers for the next crop.Though the price of pulses in the retail market is quite high, farmers dont get much. The end consumer pays thrice the amount the farmer gets for his work. It is the middlemen who make a killing. If we find proper buyers, who will procure our goods on a continuous basis, it would help us take up pulse cultivation, said V. Ravichandran, Nannila Progressive Farmers Forum from Thiruvarur district.Though the Agriculture department has been suggesting that rice fallow cultivation be taken up, farmers say if they sow urad seeds a few days before paddy crop is harvested, mechanical harvesters destroy the seedlings or chop off the top of tender plants.Also, farm labour is tough to find and many of us share mechanical harvesters. In such a situation, only those who have pumpsets prefer to take up urad cultivation under irrigated conditions, Mr. Ravichandran said and added that the government could consider renting out pump sets or offer subsidised rates to small farmers so that they too could benefit. Around 85 per cent of Indian farmers are small farmers, who cannot afford pumpsets.Agriculture scientist M.S.Swaminathan said though the government fixes a minimum support price for pulses, it does not procure them.There is no procurement mechanism in place as in the case of paddy or wheat. When that comes, it would attract more farmers to take up pulses cultivation and break the pattern of three paddy crops a year, he said at a recent consultation on increasing pulses cultivation.P.K. Deivasugamani, State president, Tamil Nadu Vivasaya Sangangalin Kootu Iyakkam, said the government should create facilities for storage and intervene when prices are less.For instance, ten days ago farmers sold onions at Rs. 7 a kilo a big loss for many. When the prices go up only those who have storage facilities benefit, which is why we have been demanding creation of storage facilities and procurement by the government when prices go down, he said.Sources in the Civil Supplies department said as of now pulses production was very low in the State and most of what is consumed is sourced from elsewhere.Government procurement alone will not help. Even with respect to paddy, which the government procures, of the total production of around 100 lakh tonnes only 1516 lakh tonnes are purchased by the Civil Supplies Corporation. If the farmer becomes a player in the agricultural commodity market, his interests would be protected, explained a former Civil Supplies department official.Though they need less time and water and fetch a good price, it is middlemen who reap the benefits"

On Thursday, a foundation stone was laid on a 1.5 acre land in Narsingi for the construction of a technologically-advance kitchen that will serve mid-day meals to thousands of children.The kitchen, which will be operational from next academic year, can prepare rice for 1,000 children in just 15 minutes and sambar for 2,000 people in two hours.Not just that, the kitchen will also provide direct and indirect employment to around 500 people. The new facility is coming up with the support of funding to the tune of Rs 10.5 crore by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. as part of its CSR initiative. The upcoming kitchen will be the 26 such facility of the Akshaya Patra Foundation in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.Speaking at the stone-laying ceremony, the chairman of the Akshaya Patra Foundation, Madhu Pandit Dasa, said that from feeding 1,500 children in 2000, the foundation now provides food to 15 lakh children on a daily basis. Our target is to feed 5 million children every day by 2020, he said.By providing nutritious food, we are not only supporting the childrens education but also making the child a capable citizen who can contribute to the country, he said.We are trying to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor. There are 120 million school children in this country, and if any of them do not get proper food then it is a shame to the countrymen.He said that the foundation was leveraging modern technology in its kitchen to prepare high-quality food, and they plan to start another kitchen on the outskirts of Hyderabad in three months.According to the members of the foundation, they are spending Rs. 60 lakh every day for the initiative, even after financial support from the government.

The value of the research project is about one million USD.Sergey Shabala, School of Land and Food, UTAS, said developing a salt-tolerant rice variety was imperative for food security. By 2050, the worlds population is estimated to grow to 9.3 billion and to feed such a large number, there has to be an increase of 38 per cent in food production, he said adding that switching to saline agriculture was inevitable.Salinity is a quiet crisis with 950 million hectares of arable land globally affected by it, he added.Holger Meinke, Director, School of Land and Food, University of Tasmania, Hobart, who signed the agreement on behalf of UTAS, said We need to produce as much food in the next 50 years as we did in the entire 10,000-year history of agriculture. This is the reason why we need these kinds of projects.V.

She had learnt about the NESTs sparrow conservation project by setting up sparrow nests made of ply in every home along with sapling donations.It was easier to emulate this conservation in Hosur because of the cool climate. Lakes are being restored, and intensive sapling plantation is already being carried out. It is only natural that birds will flock wherever there are trees, says Ms.Jeyapriya Sivaraman.NestThe sparrow nest is made of laminated plywood, salvaged from interior dcor wastes from Ms.Jeyapriyas interior designing unit in Chennai. With no material cost, and only labour cost and the transport cost, TPSOHs womens wing has now proposed to given away nests free through sponsors.The sparrow nests are machined assembled, to ensure there are no rough edges that could hurt the birds.The womens wing has also collected 60 kg of rice, donated by the group members. The ground rice will be distributed as feed to the installed houses.The FB page of TPSOH is buzzing with queries from people keen on giving a corner of their porch or a shade for sparrows.Organisations and institutions are welcome to take part in the project.A dedicated Facebook page is proposed to be created to upload photos and videos on the behaviour of sparrows, once the nests are installed. On August 15, Ashok Leyland School will have three nests installed on its campus, and 8 others will be distributed to individuals. Shishya School, Hosur, has also come on board the project.(Interested persons may contact Geetha-(Coordinator) -9443377185; Sivaraaman on 9842784234.)"

Through this initiative, those seed varieties could be protected for future cultivation.Crops cultvatedThe crop varieties at the farm include thoppicheera, pachamutti cheera (spinach varieties) sirukeppa, neelakanni,(ragi varieties), vellavaraku (kodo millet), malapoondu (garlic) maize, coriander and pumpkin.He said that when the forest officials convened a meeting for protection of traditional seed varieties through the model farm, the tribal settlements deep in the forest responded. A woman brought a three-year-old seed variety from the last stock of it in the settlement. This variety too is grown in the seed farm, said Mr. Chandran kaani. Tribespeople abandoned traditionally grown seeds primarily because the crops were small though highly resistant to pest attack and climatic changes (Thayannankudy is in the rainshadow area). However, the new crop variants decayed and dried easily, forcing many farmers to abandon cultivation.Much supportMunnar wildlife warden G. Prasad said they got immense support from the tribespeople in the endevour to save endemic crops.Our aim was to supply the seed to the tribespeople on condition that they would return the same quantity when harvested. This would be a cyclical process to protect the traditional crop varieties, he said.Arya Gopinath, a sociologist in Munnar forest division, said malnutrition was found a major issue among tribespeople and the change in their food habit from ragi to ration rice had an impact on their health.The endemic crop varieties are highly pest-resistant and protein-rich. They need to be protected for the tribes healthy living. The remedy is to make the tribespeople self-dependent in food production through protecting the traditional seeds, she said."
