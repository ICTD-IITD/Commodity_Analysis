This emotion need not necessarily be religious and may even sometimes convey social concerns. It is the emotion however which breathes life into what otherwise would be empty form with no meaning, says author Shakuntala Ramani, whose book Kolam and other Ritual Arts of India was released on Saturday at a simple function at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan by former judge of the Supreme Court S. Mohan.She said her fascination with the intricate patterns and designs that are kolams began early. These days, with people living in high-rise buildings, there is no space for kolams or else, there is an ugly looking sticker in its place. Over the centuries, drawing kolams developed into a very sophisticated art but in recent years, it has begun to disappear, which was one reason I began to study the art form, said Ms. Ramani, who has also penned a book titled Sari and the art of natural dyes, among others.She recalled how she has watched hens pecking at and squirrels licking off kolams drawn using rice flour, which used to be a tradition. People now use stone dust, which keeps away the tiny insects that used to feed on kolams, she said, adding that kolams had also become a part of religious practices at homes.The book is published by Oxygen Books.Archaeologist R. Nagasamy said the kolam was the common mans art and was glad that Ms. Ramani had concentrated on such a ritual art.He suggested that the book be prescribed to students in colleges to introduce the traditions of India."
58f71b76a3d24b0b70c32113,Snacktrack: A serving of semolina goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/snacktrack-discovering-bengalurus-rava-idli/article8547420.ece,2016-05-02,"There are times when the tummy rumbles and grumbles. You dont want to go in for something heavy, but are looking for that perfect snack that keeps your body light enough to keep working without feeling drowsy. So, we zero in on rava idlis.A staple, delicious food, the rava idli has become popular in not just Karnataka but also around the world. This idli is created from roasted semolina, mixed in sour curds and seasoned with mustard and curry leaves.After this the idli is steamed, topped with cashew nuts and served with a tangy coconut chutney, sambar or a vegetable kurma. Some versions also have tiny chopped pieces of beans, grated carrots or coconut and chopped coriander.To find the origin of this popular dish we take off to MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms), on Lalbagh Road, which is associated with the dish for years. We meet Vikram Maiya, the Managing Partner, MTR, who narrates the history of rava idlis.As we wait for our dish to arrive, Vikram starts, The history of rava idly has been retold a number of times. It started off with grain middlings. When the grain is milled, whatever is left out is called semolina. We have wheat, maize and rice semolina. The story starts there. During World War II, there was a shortage of rice. It has not been documented, but my grand uncle  Yagnanarayana Maiya  who was a prolific cook, started experimenting with various ingredients and then zeroed in on the rava idli recipe. He created the recipe. It worked with curds and cashew and seasonings. The original ingredient is still used. Rava idli is now made pretty much the same way everywhere.Then about MTR he says, It started in 1924 as Brahmins Coffee Bar. My grand uncle worked as a cook and later started MTR in 1951. The rest is all history.Our rava idli arrives, piping hot with a sweet and tangy potato curry, coconut chutney and a tiny bowl of melted ghee. We generously layer our cashew-topped idli with the ghee and dip it into the chutney and then the next bite into the potato gravy and theres absolute silence for the next few seconds as we get immersed in our plates.The original recipe is followed everywhere, Vikram says. The consistency has also been followed as the recipe was written down and handed over to the cooks down the years.With our mouths full, we ask why it is not served with a kurma, and Vikram explains, I personally feel the aroma and the strong masalas of the kurma kill the subtle flavours of the rava idli.The rava idli does indeed feel lighter on the tummy and great on your palette. That is because it does not have urad daal or rice, making it a healthy, savoury option, beams Vikram. As he does most of the talking, we do most of the eating. Finally crunch go the roasted cashews in our mouths, adding that grand finale to the taste and the history of the famed rava idli."
58f71b77a3d24b0b70c32114,Decoding Didi’s popularity,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/decoding-didis-popularity/article8622684.ece,2016-05-20,"one-woman army:To understand Mamata Banerjees victory, one has to understand the nature of her appeal and carefully crafted image built over the years. Trinamool Congress supporters smear colour on a poster of their leader. Photo: PTIThe Trinamool Congress won a spectacular two-thirds majority in West Bengal thanks in large part to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees charisma, energy, never-say-die spirit, and ability to think on her feet. Even in these elections, when she realised that the Left-Congress combine might capitalise on both the series of scams that had hit her party and the widespread unpopularity of her party workers, she swiftly made a public apology.In early April, at a public meeting in Kulti near Asansol, riding on the adulation she enjoys among the people, she said she should be held responsible if any mistakes had been made, but voters should not withdraw their blessings and good wishes from the party.Interestingly, even on Thursday after her magnificent win, grim-faced even in victory, she said she would attend to any shortcomings in her party.Ms. Banerjee has always been far more popular than the cohorts of street warriors she leads, something everyone this writer spoke to emphasised last month, even as complaints floated about her partymen spreading terror in the districts.Without pretensionsIndeed, to understand this victory, one has to understand the nature of Ms. Banerjees appeal and her carefully crafted image built over the years. She is still a hero for her largely lower-middle class urban and rural constituents, who took on the mighty Left machine virtually single-handedly. While in Opposition, she fearlessly led michils (walkabouts) to the bastions of government power in Kolkata, stormed Singur, Nandigram and every other site of state oppression, unmindful of brutal baton-wielding cops. As Chief Minister, she outdid the Opposition in leading protest marches. Through it all she retained a simple lifestyle, and stuck to her entertaining colloquial Bengali speeches that keep the audience hanging on to every word.But beyond the legend, there were other factors in this election. One, the results make it clear that the Left-Congress understanding did not work as well as it should have. While the clearly more disciplined cadres of the Left parties shifted their votes to the Congress, making the latter the second largest party in the State Assembly ahead of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress workers appear to have shifted their votes to the Trinamool Congress, a legacy of years of antipathy to the Left.Two, if the battle had initially appeared to be a direct contest between the Trinamool Congress and the Left-Congress combine, at some stage the Bharatiya Janata Party upped its game. Once the BJP realised that the gains it had made in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls in the State, when it got around 17 per cent of the vote, could shrink to the roughly four per cent it got in the 2011 Assembly elections, it became more aggressive. It eventually got about 10 per cent of the vote  just 2 per cent behind the Congress  and three seats.Three, a factor that cannot be discounted, according to Left leaders, is the silent polarisation in various pockets. In the past five years of Trinamool Congress rule, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh shakhas have grown at a rapid pace. And in January this year in Malda, riots broke out in Kaliachak after a rally led by Muslims protesting against Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwaris derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad turned violent. It was immediately seized upon by the BJP. In fact, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury credits the Trinamool Congress for the entry of the BJP in West Bengal.Simultaneously, Ms. Banerjees overtures to Muslims (the controversial stipend for imams , and her direct appeal to the community from political platforms) who constitute 28 per cent of the population have also helped create a Hindu vote. The converse of this is that it has helped the Trinamool Congress consolidate the minority vote.Four, if the Congress in the State is sitting smug, saying it hopes to build on the fact that it is the second largest party  even though by a wide margin  disappointment in the CPI(M) is acute because of the extent of defeat. Party leaders said they will analyse the data before pronouncing what went wrong, but one candidly confessed: The problem probably lies with us; we have not done enough for organisational renewal.Finally, the Kanyashree scheme  education stipends for girls, including a one-time payment of Rs.25,000 at the age of 18, provided the beneficiary continues to study  cycles for schoolchildren, the Rs.2/kg rice for the poor and a vast improvement in roads may have helped too, especially in the absence of an alternative that appealed to the people.Thanda thanda, cool coolOn Thursday morning, as it became clear that the Trinamool Congress was heading for a second consecutive triumph, party workers, their faces coloured green, danced through the streets of Kolkata to the beat of the dhak-dhol. Outside Ms. Banerjees home, exultant supporters shouted,  Thanda thanda, cool cool, ghore ghore Trinamool [Trinamool Congress in every home].But a little over 200 km away in Asansol, Trinamool workers in celebratory mode vandalised a CPI(M) office  an ominous start to the partys second term, especially as it comes days after Ms. Banerjee publicly threatening senior police officers who were just obeying the Election Commission and maintaining law and order.smita.g@thehindu.co.in"

Not really. Think noodles ball, kilikoodu, breadpola, cone pathiri and such too, for the popular cuisine is witnessing an infusion of a new snacky variety that builds on its feted traditional flavours, taste and textures of rice powder, egg, meat, banana and semiya. Leading this culinary innovation is Bibi Jan, a self-taught cook, from Thalassery, who has been spreading the authentic cuisine across India to great response.She has been adding her novel creations to the traditional menu that are being consumed with as much lip-smack as the rest.Bibi Jan began 20 years ago by plainly watching the goings on in the kitchen of her mother-in-law, when she came as a young bride to Thalassery. She started home cooking for small numbers. Over the years she grew in confidence.The turning point in her culinary route was after she provided snacks at a wedding and began receiving enquiries for more such presentations. She was flooded with requests to cater for small and big functions. Her food grew famous and so did she. A lady who she had taught the intricacies of the cuisine invited her to Delhi to present authentic Thalassery cuisine at ITC.Working in big modern kitchens and for a different palate came easily to her just as compliments for her cuisine rained in. One food festival led to several others and Bibi was showcasing the food of Keralas northern district in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi and even Jaipur.In Jaipur I was invited to cook for a big birthday bash at the palace, says Bibi for whom cooking for 200 to 300 plates is not a big task. She even worked as a chef in Hotel Malabar Plaza in Ernakulam for two years. Now Bibi heads food festivals and caters at big events. She has, unintentionally , played a big role in popularising food from Thalassery.I dont know about that, she says modestly The taste of Thalassery food is very unique. What is being passed off as from that region is not authentic; even those teaching the cuisine are not doing so correctly. The difference comes from the combination of spices.On the new innovations that she has brought in Bibi is clear. She says that preparing this cuisine over so many years has led her to experiment and try different kinds of recipes using the same ingredients.That has resulted in these new foods. Her noodles ball from milk boiled noodles that encase thick prawn or chicken filling is dipped in egg, rolled in bread crumbs and deep fried. The cone pathiri too has meat filling and is shaped in a cone. The kilikoodu or birds nest that has become a popular snack, though not invented by her, has been innovated with different fillings. It has at its centre, quail egg wrapped in potato, patted with vermicelli and deep fried.Other popular new wave foods are the mutta surkka and mudi pathiri. The kakka roti, called kunju roti in Kozhikode, is rice dumplings in thick beef or mutton curry, a wholesome dish.From all these rich and party fare that Bibi prepares, she loves the simple rice and sambar.Bibi Jan is presenting Malabar Spice Route, a culinary experience at East Indies restaurant, Eight Bastion, Fort Kochi for dinner till June 26."

Started by IT couple Krishnan Subramanian and Gauri Krishnan, TheYellowBag aims to bring back the Manjappai.The environmentally-inclined couple felt the need to contribute towards the cause of sustainability. As the first step, they started to avoid plastics at home. Thats when I realised how the manjappai has vanished right in front of our eyes. There were no cloth bags in my house and I only had the kattappai which is non-woven Polypropylene, which is again a plastic allied material. Its as harmful as plastic, says Krishnan.

I went searching for cloth bag manufacturers in Madurai and found a few old women who had left the job. Initially, I ordered some 200 cloth bags to be made in Madurai and distributed among friends at an environmental event in Chennai. The response was overwhelming and I understood the need for cloth bags.Started three years ago, TheYellowBag today operates out of Madurai and supplies bags to clients in Bangalore, Chennai and Delhi. We decentralised the production and there are nearly 25 small-time tailors in and around Madurai, working for us, says Gauri. The sewing machine lies as a dead inventory/asset in most villages and we made use of that. We cut and print the cloths here and the tailors stitch them into bags. Apart from organic shops, handicraft gift outlets, handloom showrooms and eco-conscious organisations and individuals, the couple supply bags for innovative events. For instance, there are schools that urge students to use cloth bags for regular school bags. Likewise, green weddings are becoming a trend and more young people are conscious these days. We have made wedding cards and thambulam bags out of cotton fabric.They procure bundles of raw cotton fabric from Erode, Palladam and local vendors in Madurai, depending on the volume and urgency. Every bag is a message. Manjappai is an inseparable identity of Madurai. By the term Manjappai, we dont merely mean a yellow bag, but a sustainable, simple and eco-friendly lifestyle option thats a substitute for plastics, explains Krishnan. Nowadays, yellow-coloured non-woven polypropylene bags are masquerading as manjappai. They are used only in the jewellery shops and rarely in some weddings, because of the sentiment attached with it, he adds.We dont dye our bags in yellow as we want to go entirely eco-friendly. Dyeing is again a toxic harmful process for the environment and we would lose the whole objective. Hence, our manjappai is actually not yellow and our clients take it with that understanding. We are just trying to re-establish the relationship between us and cloth bags. Its renewable and comes from plant and is eco-friendly. Not many know that kattapai is a plastic product too.Until a year ago, TheYellowBag was making 1,000 to 2,000 bags per month. Now, we do 20,000 bags per month and our target is to make 1,00,000 bags. We want to expand our network from 25 to 65 tailors so that we can reduce the cost per piece, says Gauri. We also want to turn entirely organic, by taking in desi cotton. All we use today is the genetically-modified cotton. In future, we want to use locally produced desi cotton. We have tied up with small time farmers around Madurai, Dindigul and Tiruppur and organisations like Nanal Nanbargal for this.Currently, the brand makes six models of bags in four sizes -- surukku pai, gazette bag, tote, sling bags, backpacks and grocery bags that are used for various purposes. The prices range from eight Rupees to Rs.75. Our bags are simple to stitch and elegant in design. We have made bags for over 150 clients so far, some of them are regular and others are one-time customers. There are few individuals in Madurai that buy from us, says Krishnan. For more details, visit www.theyellowbag.org or call 9884952604Made in MaduraiR.S.Sundar, who has been making manjappai for over two decades, now works for TheYellowBag -- I used to work under K. Gopalsamy in Ezhuthanikkara street in the town area. He was a pioneer in manufacturing cloth bags in the 70s. I used to cut and stitch rice bags, advertisement bags and manjappai for jewellery shops, in various sizes. Gopalsamy was a popular brand of cloth bags and was the first to make multicolour bags. It was a style statement then. Later, when the business went down, the non-woven variety took over. Now, I do printing alone. Sometimes, I get work seasonally for cutting the non-woven fabric for rice bags. Non-woven was a cheaper option and people stopped buying the manjappai, especially since it was a give away. We used to make 10,000 bags in a day. There were at least 100 employees, and the place also had a dyeing and calendaring unit. We used to supply all over Tamil Nadu and the bags were sold from Rs.one to Rs.five depending on the size. During the Palani and Ayyapan season, we used to make jolna bags for the padayatris. The images of the gods were screen-printed on the bags.Jute bagsAnother option against plastics is jute. Jute Cottage, a recently opened outlet in K.K.Nagar offers a wide range of bags, coasters, mats and other items made of jute. The bags come in a variety of designs, colours and sizes, ranging from Rs.100 to Rs.1000. From wallets, laptop bags, school and lunch bags to shopping bags and hand bags, the choices are aplenty."

Something drastic has to happen before we realise our limitations and Brahma was no exception to this. Not aware that beside Lord Narayanas powers his own powers were insignificant, Brahma steals the cows that Krishna and His friends are looking after in Gokula.But the Lord takes the form of every cow, every piece of rope used to tie the cows and every stick used to herd them, so that things continue in Gokula as before.The cows Brahma has taken away to Brahma Loka are there in Brahma Loka, but they are also there in Gokula! In fact, Brahma finds that there is another Brahma too in Brahma Loka.A humbled Brahma then sings the praises of Lord Krishna. This is known as Brahma Stuti and is a part of Srimad Bhagavatam, said Kidambi Narayanan in a discourse.Brahma says: You have come from Paramapada. You are so lovely. I offer my salutations to You. Brahma talks of Lord Krishnas attractions. This attractive One has come to live in the midst of cowherds! Krishna eats simple food. A fistful of curd rice is enough for Him.The One who holds the conch and discus, holds a stick to direct the cattle. The flute and this stick mark Him out as Krishna.Every person has some identity. Dharma is what identifies Rama. His bhaktas are identified by the service they offer Him. Bhakti identifies Prahlada. Karma identifies Janaka. In the case of Bharata, his subservience to Rama identifies him. But the Supreme One in His Krishna avatara is identified by a cowherds stick and a bamboo flute! What simplicity it denotes! That is what Brahma Stuti seeks to convey."

All the minor irrigation tanks under the command area of the project would also get filled.The SRSP received only 14 tmcs of water in the year 2014 against its capacity of 90 tmcs. Again in 2015, the project received only 2 tmcs of water due to drought, forcing the irrigation authorities to declare a crop holiday under the command area. This year, the project received steady inflows after the Babli gates were opened on July 1. On Tuesday, the project had 43.7 tmcs of water with inflows of 30,000 cusecs.The SRSP is the lifeline of north Telangana, in general, and Karimnagar district in particular. The project provides irrigation facilities to 5.73 lakh acres in the district. With further inflows expected till October, the farmers in the district are likely to increase the area of cultivation of paddy since Karimnagar district has emerged as the rice bowl of Telangana State."

File PhotoThe demand from farmers in the tail-end region of Bhadra reservoir for an extension on the period of release of water into the canals for kharif crops has created apprehension of shortage of water for plantation crops during summer.It may be mentioned here that, Irrigation Consultative Committee (ICC) of Bhadra Command Area Development Authority (CADA) had decided to release water into the canals for kharif crops for a period of 100 days. As per the schedule, the flow of water along the canals should be stopped on November 11.However, the farmers in the tail-end region of the command area have said that stopping the flow of water at this juncture would result in moisture stress owing to which the process of formation of flag leaf in paddy crop, that plays an important role in grain filling, would be adversely affected. They have demanded an extension in the period of release of water along the canals till the end of this month.Water levelThe water level in Bhadra reservoir at present is at 149 feet against the maximum level of 186 feet. At present, the reservoir has 34 tmcft water, of which 13 tmcft is dead storage and 7 tmcft should be stored for drinking purpose. The remaining 14 tmcft can be released along the canals for 45 days at the rate of 0.30 tmcft per day.ConsequencesIt was planned to use this water to save plantation crops including arecanut, coconut and banana in the command area during summer by releasing it on an on-and-off basis. If the period of release of water for kharif crops is extended as per the demand of the farmers in tail-end region, there will be acute shortage of water for plantation crops during summer.To discuss the issue, a meeting of ICC of Bhadra CADA has been convened in Bengaluru on November 9. Ministers Kagodu Thimmappa and S.S. Mallikarjuna will take part in the meeting.H.R. Basavarajappa, working president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, told The Hindu, that the area under paddy in the tail-end region is much less compared to the area under plantation crops in the command area. If period of release of water is extended for kharif crops, the plantation crop in around one lakh hectares of land will face acute shortage of water in summer, he said.Alternative methodsIt would be unwise to extend the period of release of water for kharif crops. Instead, the government should compensate the crop loss caused by moisture stress to the paddy growers in tail-end region and reserve the remaining water for plantation crops in summer. To avoid this situation in future, the farmers in command area should be motivated to take up non-water intensive methods such as the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) in the cultivation of paddy, he said.The ICC had decided to release water into the canals for kharif crops for a period of 100 days"

According to studies done by the geography department of the Government College in Chittur, near here, the district has lost 1,03,980 hectares of paddy fields in the last four decades.The decline in paddy cultivation and large-scale reclamation of traditional rice fields have started adversely affecting groundwater availability in the district. As paddy fields can regulate atmospheric temperature to some extent, study by the department attributes the increasing daytime temperature in Palakkad district to large-scale reclamation of paddy fields.The district had 1,83,181 hectares of rice fields in the beginning of the 1970s. At present, it has hardly 79,201 hectares. Even the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act of 2008 to conserve paddy fields has failed to arrest the trend, said Richard Scaria, an assistant professor with the department.Dangerous trendThough rice fields in Palakkad constitute hardly 38.51 per cent of the acreage under paddy cultivation, it still accounts for 62 per cent of rice production in the State, he said. As per surveys conducted by the department, about 25 hectares of rice fields are reclaimed every year to cultivate cash crops and to convert to real estate. If the trend continues, paddy fields in Palakkad will disappear in another 35 years.Lack of government support, delay in release of procurement price, climate change impact, and change in land-use patterns are preventing farmers from continuing with paddy cultivation.Besides, there is a growing preference among farmers for ginger cultivation. Rice fields are being leased out to farmers from outside the State to cultivate ginger. Real estate lobbies buy paddy fields from farmers at cheap rates and convert them to housing plots. The farmers are forced to sell the fields owing to loss in paddy cultivation, says farmers leader Muthalamthode Mani."

Swaminathan too has turned out to be a hype created by ruling political leaders.Mr. Eapen told The Hindu that the Kuttanad package envisaged implementation of certain scientifically chalked out schemes with Centre-State financial partnership in 75:25 ratio. Implementation of the package in toto would have been a landmark as it would have boosted the States agro economy to a great extent, besides bringing many positive changes in the socio-economic spheres and its tremendous environment conservation potential, he said.Mr Eapen, who himself is a farmer in the Upper Kuttanad village of Peringara, said the government should first take the farming community into confidence by initiating paddy farming promotion schemes well suited to the geographic conditions of Upper Kuttanad.He said Dr. Swaminathan had prescribed certain innovative schemes to rejuvenate various canals and other streams that have been choked or destroyed in the unscientific development spree over the past few decades.Bio-rice parkMr. Eapen said the much-publicised bio-rice park for Kuttanad and Palakkad proposed by the State Government in 2013-14 had been a non-starter.He said the proposal was to set up a bio-rice park at Pulikkeezhu, near Thiruvalla, where government land and soft water required for the project were available in plenty. But that project too turned out to be a hollow promise, disheartening the paddy farming community of Kuttanad, he said. +Mr. Eapen has called upon Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunilkumar and Water Resources Minister Mathew T. Thomas to take necessary initiatives for the sustenance and rejuvenation of paddy farming sector in Upper Kuttanad."

A helicopter would later come to take the bodies away.In the combing operations the next day, four more Maoists were found hiding in the hills. They were killed as well.When this reporter and photographer, along with the Human Rights Forum team reached this village, ten days after the shootings, signs of the bloodbath still lay strewn around in mute witness: cauliflowers, bottle gourds, pointed gourd, cooked rice that was rotting, half burnt caps, tiffin boxes, plates, raincoats, shoes, the smell of it all rising above the flies and the ants. The tree line stood silent 50 metres away. The villagers were reluctant to even point to the site where the shootings occurred, so scared are they.They recalled how on the evening of October 23, the Maoists went calling on the neighbouring villages, seeking about half a dozen able- bodied men, who, armed with bows and arrows would provide logistical support to Maoists. The underlying hope was that the adivasis would later venture to sign up as Maoists as well. Some 15 or 16 men had been taken to the camp.No one had seen the Greyhounds. They had come through the forests, not taking the narrow, beaten path unusable in the rains, reached the hill overlooking the Maoist camp that began where the gradient began, took up positions, and waited for the day to break. From up the hill they had a clear line of fire. They could pick their targets, take them out one by one. Some of the dead must have been brushing their teeth when the bullets started coming.Villagers still missingWhile the police declared that 30 Maoists were killed, the latter in a letter identified 27 of them. According to local villagers, about 17 locals had been taken away by the Maoists for support. While nine were from Dakapadar village, six were from Bachilipadar and two from Kajuriguda village.Of these, only three from Bachilipadar have returned. One was accounted for as dead. His body was found in a culvert five days after he had died, when Maoists came to the village to do an aftermath assessment. The dead man was identified as being from Bachilipadar.The whereabouts of as many as 13 villagers is not known.Five days after the shooting, on October 30, villagers from all the surrounding villages met but decided not to inform the police. We are in a state of confusion. We do not know whether they are alive or in police custody or the Maoists have taken them, said a villager from Beijingi, where the meeting was held. Not surprising, for in these parts where bullets can come from any direction, and sometimes you cant tell who is doing the shooting."

So we are advising the farmers to curtail the area under basmati rice to less than 5 lakh hectares during the current kharif season. This would help clear the accumulated stocks, said the PAU release.In Punjab, basmati rice was planted on 8.62 lakh hectares in 2014-15.In 2015-16, the crop was cultivated on 7.60 lakh hectares.Higher sowing coupled with huge carryover stocks led to a crash in basmati rice prices in the domestic market, the PAU said.Decline in pricesLast year, farmers in Punjab and neighbouring Haryana suffered losses as the premium basmati variety was sold at a price that was even below regular paddy (rice).Basmati PUSA 1509 variety was offered in the range of Rs. 1,000-Rs. 1,200 per quintal last season, which was almost half the price that farmers got in 2014-15.Price of long-grain staple could stay weak in the coming season due to carryover stocks"

58f756f6a3d24b0b70c34172,The inheritance of loss,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-inheritance-of-loss/article8602080.ece,2016-05-15,"senior literacy activist once told me about how the great Shivaram Karanth wrote a set of stories in the 1950s to help illiterate adults learn to read. It was for a UNESCO project in Mysuru. Whether for children or adults, stories must be interesting if learners are to be engaged. It would be patronising to ask adult learners to read childrens books; at the same time, as beginning readers, they could not straightaway attempt Karanths novels.Hearing this, Karanth stayed up one night to write a set of new stories specifically meant for adult learners. The next morning, a pile of discarded drafts on the floor showed how carefully he had worked on these stories.Decades later, these stories by Karanth, illustrated with beautiful line drawings by the artist K.K. Hebbar, became part of the Dakshina Kannada literacy campaign. Karanth told the literacy activists that the books should be small in size and easy to hold, with large print for adult learners who would use them to learn to read. Like childrens picture books, but with deeply philosophical stories to which adults could relate.Parables of the mustard seedOne of the stories in Karanths primers was a retelling from the tales of the Buddha: the parable of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds. A woman came weeping to the Buddha one day because her son had died. She pleaded with the Buddha to give her some medicine to revive the child. The Buddha asked her to bring him a few mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death. Going from house to house in search of one where no one had died, the woman heard story after story of grief and loss  until she realised that death came inevitably to every home. Thus her grief was calmed.I imagined the learners sitting in a circle in some volunteers house, exhausted after a day of daily-wage labour but with a hunger to learn to read, slowly decoding the words, looking at the illustrations, making meaning out of the sentences, feeling a kinship with the grieving mother at the storys heart.I thought again of the story of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds on the day my mother died in a cancer hospital in Mumbai eight years ago. We had known for days, weeks even, that the end was near. My mother had slipped into a coma and the oncologist told us gently that her organs were shutting down one by one. There are standard phrases for these situations: she is sinking; the end is near; it will soon be over.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone. The next morning I brought more books.And yet when it came  the end  I was unprepared. The death rituals gave us things to do and matters to arrange while our minds were elsewhere. Earthen pots were procured. Flower garlands. A bowl of rice grains. Coins. In the morning, my mothers body was sent into the furnace at the electric crematorium at Chandanwadi. That evening, we poured the still-warm pot of ashes into the sea at Breach Candy. No food was cooked in the house. A neighbour sent idlis , someone sent paranthas . A small mud lamp flickered in a corner all night and all day. On the tenth day, a young priest  he worked night shifts as a BPO staffer  texted on his phone while chanting shlokas . We arranged rice balls and unsalted food on a banana leaf and waited for the crows in order to (the priests said) turn my mothers drifting soul away from earth and towards heaven.As I imagined my mothers winged soul flying further and further away, I felt a mother-shaped hole open up in my heart. Would I ever see my mother again? Her tired smile, her quizzical look? Would she ever discuss Bertie Wooster stories with my husband again? Would I be able to joke with her saying, I knew you would say that! the way we did? Would I ever be her daughter, and she my mother, again?We all need our parables of the mustard seed.The mystery of deathI thought of the story again when I read Amitava Kumars moving essay Pyre, about his mothers death in Patna. The image that accompanies the memoir in Granta is one of marigolds  a broken garland, some petals  floating on water. I felt my stomach lurch when I saw this image. I remembered how we poured my mothers ashes, including pieces of bone, into the water, along with thick fistfuls of marigold petals.Because it isnt when the doctor is signing a death certificate, or when your mothers body goes into the fire, but only when you have poured the ashes into the water and tossed all the flowers into it and your hands are finally empty  it is only then that you begin to comprehend the loss. Your mother is no longer on this earth.I dealt with my sorrow by writing in my notebook, says Kumar. There is a long tradition of writing about mortality. Faced with the end, the writer reflects upon the life that preceded it. Joan Didion about her husbands death and her daughters illness ( The Year of Magical Thinking ); Cheryl Strayed about the loss of her mother and her subsequent journey of self-discovery ( Wild ); Paul Kalanithis memoir about his own mortality ( When Breath Becomes Air ); and most recently, Jenny Diskis cancer posts. Each ones treatment of the subject is vastly different. Didions prose is filled with taut clarity; Strayeds narrative is spirited, adventurous, wild; Kalanithis the measured, precise account of a medical professional. No syrupy self-help, no clich, no false promises in these memoirs. The writers are at their most thoughtful, but also unguarded and honest as they come up against the final mystery of death.In his essay, Kumar reflects on another short story, A.K. Ramanujans Annayyas Anthropology. A young Indian graduate student at the University of Chicago, sitting in a library engrossed in a book by an American anthropologist, sees a picture of a funeral ritual. On closer inspection, he discovers that it is his fathers body which is on the pyre. He realises that his father is dead.Apart from Ramanujans profoundly ironical point about Indian self-discovery in Western knowledge, adds Kumar: The story tugs at the immigrants dread that distance will prevent his fulfilment of filial duty. Not to mention the distance that lies beyond. Death is an individual grief; for others it may have only academic interest.I had been luckier than Annayya, reflects Kumar. But there is sadness in his words.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the Indian Administrative Service and currently based in Bengaluru.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital where my mother was admitted. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone.

SubrahmanyamThousands of fishers affected by the 61-day annual fishing ban enforced from April 15 are in distress as the cash compensation promised to them by the State Government is yet to reach them.Enquiries with the Fisheries Department revealed that once funds were released, the amount would be transferred online to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. It could reach them anytime, an official pointed out.The list of beneficiaries was finalised as per the revised government guidelines. The compensation being given this year Rs.4,000 per head is double the amount paid to them last year. Before that, the Government used to give rice to the fishers in lieu of the loss of livelihood.Whatever amount they give, it should reach us on time to prevent us from borrowing money at hefty interest, Ganagalu Eurkodu, who works in a mechanised boat as a crew member, told The Hindu. Official sources said 16,021 fishers engaged in mechanised and in motorised boats were identified in the district for payment of compensation. In the Fishing Harbour here, the number of beneficiaries selected is 4,607 from mechanised boats and 268 from motorised boats. The number has gone up by a few hundred.The Association of Indian Fisheries Industries, AP Mechanised Boat Operators Association and the Dolphin Boat Owners Welfare Association have been representing to the Government to cover fish vendors, dry fish sellers, push-cart and rickshaw-pullers under the compensation scheme on humanitarian grounds.Fishing Harbour Workers Union general secretary J.D. Naidu said several eligible fishers and fish workers were not found eligible for compensation due to rigorous procedures followed this time. He said all those affected by the ban should get the compensation.Mr. Naidu said they were planning to organise a protest at the Collectorate to highlight the plight of fish workers."
58f75ae7a3d24b0b70c3430f,Dosas chutnify Berlin,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Dosas-chutnify-Berlin/article14403939.ece,2016-06-27,"When the crisp golden masala dosa, encircled by various accoutrements, arrived, it didnt look like it was made in Berlin, about 7,000 km from home. It might have been made by my mother who, somehow hidden in the confines of the kitchen, dispatched it with the short-haired blonde who gently placed it on my table. The sambhars tanginess awakened my long-hibernating taste buds (I have been living on store-bought gnocchi and ready-to-eat couscous). The green chilli chutney seared through my tongue, and the coconut chutney, albeit made with frozen coconut, brought back memories of sunny mornings and clanks of steel spatulas on dosa pans in my moms kitchen. However, I am at Chutnify, a restaurant specialising in dosas, in Berlins hip Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood.In this wonderfully-grungy, instantly-affable capital city of Germany, Indian food simply means a variety of ingredients (vegetables and/or meat) in greasy orange gravy. The piquant flavours of Indian spices are usually doused in cream, sahne, to tame them for the German palate. Native Germans familiar with Indian food and homesick Indians complain about this homogenously bland version of Indian cooking.In this market of culinary misrepresentation, one woman saw opportunity. Aparna Aurora, a fashion design entrepreneur-turned-restaurateur with Indian roots, started Chutnify two years ago, branding her cuisine South Indian street food. Between serving masala dosas and tandoori chicken dosas, Chutnify has received unanimous admiration from German and English media in Berlin. It might seem that, finally, the dosa has found a place in Berlin.I felt there were no good Indian restaurants, and definitely, no South Indian ones in Berlin, Aurora says on one leisurely Saturday afternoon at her restaurant. Behind her, a cupboard is lined with glass jars half-filled with kabuli chana, musty green coriander and brick-red chilli powder. A baby-faced man from a beedi packet is painted on a side wall, beside which a German couple sits, nursing drinks over thalis. There is other paraphernalia to complete the kitschy Indian ambience: a pack of neem toothpaste, a can of coconut oil, a bottle of sanitiser and an auto meter. She has tapped into the cool vibe Berlin is known for and given it an Indian touch.Perhaps, the hardest part in serving dosas is the fermentation of the batter. Even in tropical South India, on a rainy day, the batter can lie flat, refusing to rise. I did a year of research. Dosa batter here changes because the weather changes every day. My home was like a lab and I made dosas every day before we opened the restaurant. It took us a long time but I think we have perfected it now, she says. As a South Indian with a good eye and taste for dosa, I can tell her creations are close to perfect. The underlying tang and additional fluffiness that comes with the fermentation of batter is missing, but it is the best one can do with unpredictable Berlin weather and a limited availability of ingredients. The menu is a curious mix of South and North Indian dishes: chicken curry rice rubbing shoulders with masala dosa and pepper pork. However, Aurora says dosas are the bestsellers. The frequency with which plates of masala dosas shimmy out of the kitchen seems to prove her point. For variety, there are also keema dosas, seasonal pumpkin dosas and chana dosa.The name Chutnify is derived from Rushdies Midnights Children , where he refers to flavouring of prose with Indian English in his feted book. We wanted to chutnify Berlin, says Aurora. Chutnifys clientele is a complete mix: A lot of Germans visit us after reading the reviews, because we have been covered by the German media. A lot of South Indians are happy that we exist. In less than two years of its opening, Chutnify has received an enthusiastic response, prompting Aurora to open a second branch in the Neuklln area of Berlin. There are also talks about opening a Chutnify in Madrid.But through it all, Aurora has one goal: to serve dosas and serve them as best as she can.My home was like a lab and I made dosas every day before we opened the restaurant. It took us a long time but I think we have perfected it nowAparna Aurora"

Bhadrakali is shown in a fierce mood, after the killing of Darikasura.Hariprasad, a class 11 student of the school, said while he was aware of the Kalamezhuthu ritual, he had not heard of Theeyattu, and found the Kalamezhuthu interesting.Another student Achyuth S. said he found it amazing how the artistes drew the Kalam freehand. The programme, he hoped, would help the students learn more about the States diverse culture.Kalamezhuthu starts with songs in praise of gods, to the accompaniment of traditional instruments such as Para, Elathalam, and Chengila. Once it is over, lit oil lamps are placed to heighten the colours.Then comes Sandhyakoothu in which the percussion instruments join in concert in a ritual to announc the performance. Gurudi is performed to appease the demons who assist Kali. Only then does the Theeyattu performance begin. A single actor dons the make-up of Kali, minus the headgear. After several chants and invocations, the actor dons the headgear to represent Kali. The performance is presented as if Kali is reporting the killing of Darikasura to Lord Siva, her father. The act concludes with the killing of Darikasura.Theeyattu was the first of bimonthly performances to be held over the next 12 months as part of a programme in 11 States across the country to protect and promote art forms that are on the verge of extinction and support their practitioners who are neglected.Students of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan get to experience the colour and vigour of Theeyattu"

Krishna Rao said that the present intensive and pest-management-based cultivation had resulted in over-production of superior cereals - rice and wheat- and neglect of the healthy raggi and other millets.He attributed the shortage of red gram during last year to non-maintenance of the critical balance between different crops including pulses and edible oil.Giving finer details of the plan to turn A.P. into organic farming State, Agriculture Special Chief Secretary T. Vijaykumar said noted natural farmer Subhash Palekar would train for eight days 30 farmers each from 130 clusters across the State at Kakinada this month-end on organic farming and sustainable agricultural practices.We planned to train this year about 1.5 lakh farmers, who, in turn, will inspire 50 to 60 lakh farmers to take up organic farming, he explained, adding that 30 to 40 new agricultural practices would be taught to the selected progressive farmers to restore the soil health and ensure sustainable agriculture.The government had constituted a Core Committee headed by Mr. Vijaykumar to show assured market for millet growers.There is a need for increasing the carbon content in the soil to at least 2 per cent as against the present average carbon content of less than 0.5 per cent, he said, adding that the green revolution tools will not work in increasing food production to meet the expected demand in the year 2050.Food 360 Foundation President J. A. Chowdary said the next wave of opportunity would be for production of healthy millets. Realising the huge untapped market potential for millets, more and more IT professionals are turning themselves into agri-entrepreneurs to market value-added millet-based products to replace junk foods, added Mr. Chowdary, who is also advisor for IT and Special Chief Secretary to the Chief Minister.Sustainable food securityExpert to train 30 ryots each from 130 clusters across AP for eight daysTarget set to educate1.5 lakh farmers on organic farming this yearFarmers to be sensitised on 30 to 40 farm practicesPanel formed to guide farmers on marketing of millets"

He alleged that the separate Telangana State had helped Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his family members by securing posts and keeping aside the development of the State.Demanding the government to take up drought relief measures on war-footing, he demanded compensation of Rs. 10,000 per acre to the farmer who lost their crops and Rs. 20,000 per acre to the horticulture crops.He also demanded the waiver of all taxes and educational fees in the state following the drought.

It is a big lie as the State is ranked 21{+s}{+t}, she added.She said that the cost of all basic needs of the people, including all commodities, have soared in the past five years. After the death of Gandhian Sasi Perumal, all political parties and the public demanded closure of Tasmac outlets. But, the Chief Minister failed to respond, except for a statement by a Minister that the outlets will not be closed, she added.Ms. Premalatha said that the Chief Minister now seeks another term for closing Tasmac outlets in a phased manner and questioned why it was not done in the past five years.The DMDK leader said that both the DMK and the AIADMK will not close the Tasmac outlets as the companies that supply liquor to these outlets were owned by them. She said that under the noon meal scheme, in the name of variety rice, children are given white rice mixed with turmeric powder.We will provide two healthy meals a day to children after coming to power, she added.

The suggestion is still pending with various government departments.K. Rajesh, leader of a local collective of fishermen from the Puthiyappa region, says most of the temporarily displaced fishers are likely to depend on odd jobs in the unskilled sector during the trawl ban period. If the government had planned properly and initiated some schemes, it would have been a big relief for several poor families, he adds.Beypore Harbour Development Committee president Karichal Preman says the fishermen families deserve a special financial grant from the State or Central government to survive during the term. With just rice, they will never be able to meet the unexpected medical expenses, schooling expense of children, and the threat from monsoon-related calamities, he says.Awaiting govt. nodFisheries Department officials say they will not be able to go ahead with any other additional relief measures as it has to be first approved by the State government. There were recommendations to sanction a reasonable compensation for fishermen in case of any calamity, but an official order is still awaited.The officials say the fishermen are not eager to apply even for the free rice quota.Last year, we had to cancel the sanctioned quota as there were very few applicants for the scheme, they say."

But why forcibly take away all the labourers and close down the kiln when only one particular labourer is creating problem? If there is any fault with the kiln owner, the authorities should constitute a fact-finding committee and inquire into the allegations, but it should not completely close the kiln and cause losses, say the brick kiln owners.Varaprasad of VBC bricks say: We are protecting the environment from pollution by using the bottom ash of NTPC and burnt husk (black) of the rice mills to produce eco-friendly clay bricks.But, we do not have protection from the government and we are unnecessarily targeted for no fault, following the false allegations.He said that the authorities should also listen to the problems of the kiln owners before taking any harsh decision on closing down the units, particularly after making huge investments."
58f76824a3d24b0b70c3487e,Super sesame,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/super-sesame/article8118802.ece,2016-01-18,"In Mumbai, sesame comes into its own in til laddoos and chikkis, offered during Sankranti with the words  til gud ghya, god god bola  (eat sweet and speak sweet). But going beyond these popular sweets and the culinary versatility of sesame will thrill the cook in you. Sesame indicum , the cultivated type, which originated in India, continues to be an ingredient of significance today.A wonderful ingredient, sesame is extremely versatile, lending itself to both sweet and savoury dishes. Sprinkle it whole on salads, or knead into chapati dough. Make spice mixes to fortify the flavour and health of your meals. One sprinkle Im hooked to is gomasio, a condiment from Japan, in which toasted sesame is ground coarsely with salt. I just combine coarse sea salt and toasted sesame in a bottle and keep it within reach. Its perfect with anything from a simple bowl of brown rice to salads, noodles, steamed vegetables, even khichdi. Another favourite is the Middle Eastern zaatar (a mix of herbs and spices), a condiment popularly combined with olive oil and smeared on flat bread. Zaatar is also used to flavour meat and vegetables dishes, on labneh (a thick hung yogurt cheese) or fried eggs as a garnish. I toast sesame with dried thyme and salt and grind with amchur instead of the sumac that is traditionally used but not easily found in India. It works perfectly on naans, kulchas, and in raitas. I also like to sprinkle it on chunks of paneer or chicken and grill them.Grinding toasted sesame opens up many more options. Although south India is best known for its use of sesame, I discovered, after I married into a Garhwali family, that the cuisine of Uttarakhand uses a lot of ground sesame in its winter dishes. Crushed sesame adds a nutty accent to lobia khichdi. The piquant khatte aloo is made of potatoes tossed in yogurt, toasted sesame and chillies. And then there is addictive til ki chutney in which toasted sesame is ground with toasted cumin, ginger, green chillies, and the juice of the bada nimbu (large wild lemons that come into season in the winter). Another lovely dish is the earthy pinni ka saag that is made from pinni or compressed seed cakes left over from the oil extraction process of sesame. With the oil removed, these become extremely high in protein and dietary fibre. Grind sesame until it gives forth oil and you get tahini or sesame butter, a staple ingredient in Middle Eastern cuisine. Stir it into soups, or dips, or add honey to make a quick spread for toast or dip for fruit. I am endlessly confounded that we have been pressing sesame for oil for millennia but never thought of toasting the seed prior to extracting its oil, something that the rest of Asia has savoured for centuries. Toasted sesame oil is the most magical ingredient. The roasting process intensifies the inherent flavour of sesame and is used more as a condiment or flavouring oil. It quickly grows into being indispensible: drizzle over fried eggs, add to vinaigrettes for a delicious variation, swirl a few drops into soups it pairs well with any flavour but is especially good with Asian, tomato and clear soups.And we already know sesames nutty flavours work wonderfully in sweet dishes; our laddoos and chikkis are testimony to this. But sesame is also popular in sweets around the world. In the Middle East you will find sesame halva; which, unlike Indian halvas, come in large dry blocks from which portions are sliced off. They literally melt into a nutty, sweet toffee and glide down your throat. Addictive! In Asian cuisine, a favourite dessert is the sweet black sesame soup of Cantonese cuisine. Asian supermarkets worldwide usually carry instant mix packets but I have made it at home by boiling crushed black sesame or toasted unhusked sesame with water, sweetened with honey or jaggery. It is a great dessert for children.We should be eating a lot more of this super food, not just saving it for festive occasions.If you hate milk like I do, sesame offers a great substitute with three times the calcium content of milk. Plus, one tablespoon of sesame contains 52 calories, 88 mg calcium, 1.3 mg iron and 32 mg magnesium. Why look to the west for health-boosting foods when we are so fortunate in our own home-grown bounty?(The writer is a food consultant, writer, stylist and author of A Pinch of This, a Handful of That )"

But for the tribal youth from the Gandabaheli village of Odishas Nuapada district has executed government construction contracts worth over Rs.1 crore in the past couple of years.Hasut, who considers the ration card under the National Food Security Act as his most-valued possession, is a B Class contractor.In neighbouring block, Komna, Duryodhan Majhi of Dabri village spends most of his time in a thatched house near an agricultural field protecting farm produce at remuneration less than Rs.3,000 per month. But Majhi is a leading contractor in the government records who has completed construction worth more than Rs.8 crore in the past few years.Hasut and Majhi are not the rare government record-rich contractors in this poverty-stricken region. When three check dams constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.17 lakh were washed away in Sinapali block in 2014, investigation revealed the contract was executed by Manjulata Sagaria, a Dalit woman.There have been numerous examples of persons belonging to BPL tribes being used as dummies in lucrative government construction contracts.Rich and influential appear to be grabbing contracts in the name of poor people to evade legal actions in the event of poor and inferior execution of constructions. Besides, contractors from the tribal community, according to an official, are usually given 50 per cent concession on initial deposits such as EMD (Earnest Money Deposit). In case of additional Performance Security Deposit, the tribals get 50 per cent concession.However, the clear benefit of executing construction projects in the name of poor people is to escape legal action.Hasut has two bank accounts  one with the State Bank of India and another in a regional bank. His handler  Bikash Ranjan Meher, a rich person in his village -- operates his SBI account.Huge money has been deposited in my account by Meher. When he requires money to be withdrawn from SBI, I am taken to bank and asked to put my signature. Similarly, he renews my license as B Class contractor on my behalf. Although I am an official contractor for different government projects, I know nothing about project, my job is to drive the car of Meher, admits Hasut.He adds: I am landless and my father disowned me by giving Rs.20 and 2 kg rice after my marriage. My dream is to build a house for me as the old one-room house is crumbling. I once asked Meher what would happen if there were any problem with the construction and I get jailed. He assured me that he would bail me out.Hasut now finds it difficult to free himself from the clutches of his handler."

The scheme, a first of its kind in the State, is aimed at making the visits to the government offices here a more exciting experience.According to Francis Tharayil, president, Kunnukara panchayat the scheme covers four hospitals including the veterinary hospital and other government offices including the Panchayat office, Kerala State Electricity Board, Agricultural office, among others. The programme, envisaged as a way of giving back to the community, is run on the first five working days of every week and helps change peoples inhibition about going to a government office for some service.To start with, we are offering them a simple but nutritious meal of rice gruel with curry which will be later expanded to a sumptuous feast in the next stage. It is expected to benefit around 175 people on any given working day,  said Mr. Tharayil.The panchayat expects the number of people availing the service to reach 400- equal to the average number of outpatient tickets sold at the four hospitals in a day.The cost of implementing the scheme is estimated to be just around Rs.10, which is met from a contribution from the State government under the Akshya noon-meal scheme.We are also taking to organic farming of rice and vegetables on a massive scale so that that the scope of the programme is extended to more people and also to make sure that nobody is turned away from it in the long run, the president added.Kunnukara panchayat will offer free meals to people who visit hospitals, government offices"

Finding worthy leads to follow is not the demanding part; neither is reviewing, which you can learn on the beat. But getting artists to talk about their work? Thats a different story. It is easier to chat up random strangers in the street, than get some of our artists to sing about the thoughts and processes that govern their output.To be sure, there are exceptions to that rule. Ive had a wonderful time interviewing Sudhir Patwardhan, who is as gentle as he is eloquent, qualities that underline most of his cityscapes. Both Reena Saini and her husband Jitish Kallat, who I met recently, are not only articulate, they are also patient and engaging in their explanations. More often than not, however, I have to struggle to put together a structured interview; a process that leaves me feeling a bit guilty. The artists job really is to make art, not to offer lengthy elucidations on the subject, often in a language they might not be comfortable with.So it was with utter delight and surprise that I listened to Bharti Kher talk about her practice this last weekend at Sunaparanta-Goa Centre for the Arts. Housed in a beautiful bungalow in Panjims Altinho Hills area, the centre is hosting the second edition of its arts and literature festival, Sensorium. Curated around the theme of love, Sensorium brings together the work of several contemporary artists including Mithu Sen, A Ramachandran, Atul and Anju Dodiya, Thukral & Tagra, Anita Dube, and Chitra Ganesh. If you choose to visit it, Id point you to a particularly lovely installation by Tushar Joag, Remember you each night, where each broken object is a reminder of a lost love.The Centre has also been inviting artists to talk about their work, and the presentation by Kher, (whose 2006 sculpture, The Skin Speaks a Language Not its Own, created auction history in 2010 when it breached the $1-million mark, a record for a female contemporary Indian artist) was part of that. She spoke about her beloved art teacher, Martin Shaw, and the rigours of art school; about meeting a rice engraver at Dilli Haat who she went on to collaborate with for Sing to them that will listen (2008), where she displayed 2,50,000 grains engraved with matrimonial ads; about her inhibitions regarding working with sex workers whose bodies she used for life-size plaster casts for an upcoming exhibit.Refreshingly, she didnt make a single reference either to her 2006 sculpture or to the sperm bindis that are such an important motif in her work.But the part of the conversation that continues to linger with me is when she was asked about failure. You have to allow your material to fail, she said. The first thing I do when I start a new work, is to soil the paper with my hands.It isnt every day that you can draw such a rare, beautiful image informing a profound thought from an artist, one that offers such a keen insight into an artists discipline. But its well worth the wait.(The writer is a former deputy editor of National Geographic , India)"

NTR was the doyen of Telugu cinema and later carved out a niche as a political leader of tall order not only in Andhra Pradesh, but also in the country, he said.It may be recalled that the TDP adopted a resolution at its party conclave urging the Centre to confer Bharat Ratna on NTR a year ago.Nimmakuru pays tributeSeveral hundreds of fans of Telugu Desam Party founder and former Chief Minister N.T.

RangarajanGobbiyalo. Thus begins the folk song that sets the mood for Sankranti festivities here, and all lines rhythmically ends with the same word.Gobbi Patalu , a collection of folk songs rendered during Sankranti, is believed to have evolved from Gopikala Patalu , and it has striking resemblance to Tamil Nadus Kummi Paattu . While scholars recite Tiruppavai , a collection of 30 verses composed by Andal (Goda Devi) for 30 days ending with Sankranti, the unlettered womenfolk sing Gobbi Patalu, which is quite similar to the Tiruppavai verses. It has been a practice among people in rural areas to wake up early, make a bonfire (which is also used to boil water), take bath and sing during the season.Women make conical-shaped objects using cow dung and place them at the centre of Rangolis in front of their homes, with Thangedu (Avaram Senna) flowers as the topping.Sometimes, marigold or pumpkin flowers are also used. It is a practice among women to draw a circle around Rangoli, and go around, singing Gobbi Patalu . They clap while paying obeisance to Gobbemma and raise their hands up later to a rhythmic clap. We sing Gobbi Patalu only during this month, says Kakolu Siddhamma of Padipeta in Tirupati rural. Gobbiyalo, Goo Goo Goo and Gummadilo are the widely used refrains. The songs are devotional in nature. The lyrics are region specific. In Chittoor district, the songs are dedicated to Lord Venkateswara and Bibi Nanchari, while Krishna and Lakshmi form the base in the neighbouring Nellore, Peta Srinivasulu Reddy, Professor of Telugu at Sri Venkateswara University, says. The theme is woven around Gauramma in coastal districts. Strangely, Gobbi songs are not so popular in Kadapa and Kurnool hinterlands.While Gauramma in coastal districts is immersed in water at the end of the month, the ritual is almost absent in Rayalaseema districts. Interestingly, dung is made into cakes (Pidakalu) for fire, while the rice collected from people is used to make offering (Naivedyam).With dwindling patronage, women are even forced to stop traffic on highways and demand money. The present generation does not realise the importance of Gobbi Patalu , rues a woman, Siddhamma.The folk song collection rendered during Sankranti is believed to have evolvedfrom Gopikala Patalu and has striking resemblance to Tamil NadusKummi Paattu"

While he is not hopping across continents with corporate leadership programmes, he drops in to speak at global summits such as the World Economic Forum. He writes for publications such as The Guardian and The New York Times and is the author of Consumptionomics: Asias Role in Reshaping Capitalism and Saving the Planet , a critically acclaimed work.But all said, he is a romantic at heart  one who dreams of settling down along the serene backwaters of Kerala where his roots are.He was not born here. His parents had left Palakkad for Malaysia long before they were married. Growing up, Kerala was this mythical place of elephants, temples, rice fields and great natural abundance, says Mr. Nair, who is in the city with a global leaders programme organised by the Global Institute For Tomorrow (GIFT), an independent pan-Asian think tank, which he founded.As he got assimilated into the new society and tasted success, Kerala, for him, remained just that  a myth. As he travelled across the world, he realised the true worth of what he was missing. The first visit 25 years ago has since been followed by several others, including the one three years ago with his siblings to offer prayers for the souls of his departed parents.The first thing I noticed was the relative friendliness of the people here, and suddenly I could make those connections with my mothers obsession with being friendly, he said.He was bowled over by the peaceful co-existence of the three major religions here during these times of cultural, religious, and ethnic strife. He even plans to write an article about how Kerala can be an example to the world.Food and culture are the two other attractions. Savouring the traditional cuisine transports him to his childhood when dosa and chutney, moru curry and fish curry were imports from the faraway mythical land.One thing he is ashamed of and that is his lack of proficiency in Malayalam. While five of his siblings learned the language, the younger three, including him, were not fortunate, as by then English had become the language for success.The Kerala model that is not based on mindless industrialisation, Mr. Nair believes, holds significant lessons for the 21st century. People here have lived within the limits while maintaining the resources, he says.But, Mr. Nair, who loves the privilege of remaining a bachelor, wonders whether the land value in Kerala has become too steep to pursue his dream of buying a small piece of land here."

S. Swaminathan Research foundation (MSSRF) at Puthurvayal, Dr. Laladas said that seed production had been a service by the traditional farmers to society and now it was time for the local self-governments to take over this responsibility.The KSBB had requested the State government to make necessary amendments in the Panchayat Raj Act to constitute standing committees for Environment and Biodiversity in three-tier local bodies, he said.District panchayat president T Ushakumari inaugurated the programme. The fest, being organised by Wayanad District Tribal Development Action Council, Seed Care, a collective of traditional rice farmers, Kerala State Biodiversity Board, and NABARD, is aimed at making Wayanad a role model for other tates in conserving traditional seed varieties and thus complimenting the biodiversity conservation efforts.As many as 25 stalls had been put up at the venue to showcase the rare collection of gene bank of various crops. The organisers have also arranged facilities to the farmers to exchange their traditional seeds of various crops.Seed, Soil, Food-Rights and Responsibilities is the slogan of the fest.Farmers from all grama panchayats in the district and neighbouring districts of Tamil Nadu will exhibit and exchange their varied seed varieties in the three-day fest. Various programmes, including seminars, a photo exhibition and an agriculture-based film festival, would also be held."

I would be beaten up if I made a mistake, or if I asked to go back to my parents, says 10-year-old Imtiyaz Ali who worked at a zari factory in South Delhis Khanpur area.Imtiyaz added that he would get chapatti, and stale rice sometimes, to eat. Sometimes, he said, there was no breakfast.My employer told my parents over the phone that I was very happy and that I was studying a lot. I was never allowed to talk to them, the child said.Once when the police raided the factory, Imtiyazs employer asked him to pretend to be studying with his son. Once the police left, the boy was sent back to work.Things took a turn for the better after another police raid. Imtiyaz and the other children at the factory were finally rescued.I am in Class VI now. My favourite subject is Math and I want to become an engineer, Imtiyaz said.Little changeIt has been 14 years since June 12 was declared World Day Against Child Labour. But in India, as many as 65 per cent children suffer from poor health; while 40 per cent are child labourers.Add to this the fact that each child labourer has experienced abuse and exploitation at least once, and that girl children endure far more deprivation than boys.Further, it has been six years since the Right To Education Act was passed. Yet, majority of these children are school drop-outs, while there are others who never enrolled.One visit to the fringes of the Capital is enough to witness how this unorganised sector operates, how the laws protecting children are blatantly violated. Here, a large number of migrant families  including women and children  are recruited by labour agents and employed in brick kilns, construction sites, stone crushing and laying of roads and pipelines.According to the Young Lives at Work Sites study conducted by NGO Aide et Action and the Bernard Van Leer Foundation (BvLF), brick-making units absorb the maximum number of child labourers in the country.Out of every five bricks, two are made by children accompanying their parents who migrate in search of livelihood. The debt or the advance migrant labourers borrow from the middlemen is paid back not by working, but by involving their children in work sites, says Umi Daniel, Regional Head (Migration), Aide et Action, South Asia.In fact, work at a brick kiln is designed in a way that needs all members of the family to participate.Children at these sites are made to walk on the newly-made bricks, which are laid out to dry, in order to check their consistency.The study on the status and condition of young migrants living at worksites in Delhi, Chennai, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Jaipur, Patna, Hyderabad and Guwahati portrays a very grim picture of the children engaged here.A mammoth 90 per cent of seasonal migrant children are excluded from accessing the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), while 80 per cent of children in the school-going age do not access education near work sites.Except Hyderabad, almost all the children at work sites do not benefit from anganwadis.Governments in the other seven States are yet to extend the ICDS services to cater to the needs of the intra or inter-State migrants and their families.The study, which was conducted in 2013, says that children between the ages of 6 to 14 years comprise half of the total child labour population.Talking about the level of education of these children, Mr. Daniel says: Most school enrolments happen at the village of origin. The number of children who continue to study at the destination decreases substantially. On the other hand, 39 per cent of the total child labour population in the age group of 6 to 14 years never enrolled in any school, neither at the source nor the destination.Brick-making units absorb the maximum number of migrant and child labourersin the country"

Currently, Amma canteens are located in 300 neighbourhoods in Chennai.The construction of canteens is under way in 33 locations. Work orders for construction have been issued in another 47 places. In addition, we have identified 27 sites, said an official of the Greater Chennai Corporation.Each of the 107 Amma canteens is expected to commence operations this year. Hiring of workers for the canteens will begin shortly.With the increase in the number of Amma canteens, sales are expected to come down in some of the existing ones. But, most of the new canteens are likely to cater to hitherto uncovered low-income neighbourhoods. The financial loss incurred by the civic body is also expected to increase owing to the rise in number of canteens and labourers.At least 1,200 women belonging to self-help groups will be selected from all the 15 zones for the new canteens. The women will be trained to manage, cook and clean the facilities.In 300 canteens in the city, over 3,600 women have already been hired by the civic body. Idli (100 gram) for a rupee and curd rice (350 gram) at Rs. 3 continue to be the most popular dishes on the menu."

In the small window of time before the pleasant morning sun turns into unforgiving heat, a small group of people are gathered in a street next to the gram panchayat office.A group of volunteers from the Yogendra Yadav-led Swaraj Abhiyan, along with other fraternal organisations, are addressing the gathering. This is the second day of the Jal Har Padyatra, a 10-day march that started on Saturday from Sonwati village in Latur.The judgmentThe yatra will cover the drought-hit regions of Marathwada and Bundelkhand to inform people about their rights, especially following the May 13 Supreme Court judgment that lays down directions for States on providing relief to those affected by drought.In Khandapur, the Swaraj Abhiyan volunteers ask if the schools are continuing with the mid-day meal scheme through the summer holidays. The crowd says no. The volunteers then ask if they know that according to the SC, anyone, regardless of whether s/he has a ration card, is entitled to get wheat at Rs. 2 per kg and rice at Rs. 3 a kg. Many seem confused. Again, the volunteers ask how many people have work cards for employment in the MNREGA. Only a few hands tentatively go up, though by this time, the crowd has grown in size.Each village presents its own picture of the ground realities of drought relief. There seem to be gaps in the PDS system in many places but the one uniform thing throughout is that there is a huge failure of MNREGA, Mr. Yadav says. Which is a shame because Maharashtras scheme was what the MNREGA, was modelled on, he adds.Alerting stakeholdersAt another public meeting on Saturday night at Ganganagar village, Mr. Yadav asks the huge crowd if they were willing to work under MNREGA. Many people tell me that you people are not willing to work because the pay is just Rs. 190 a day. Is that true? he asks. The response is loud boos and protestations, especially by the women, who say they would indeed appreciate the work. Then why do so few of you have MNREGA work cards when the official list says there are over 350 holders in this village? continues Mr. Yadav. Again, there is a confused silence.Following the public meeting in Khandapur the volunteers are faced with a deluge of complaints  from wanting to know how to get MNREGA cards to complaints of not getting rations at the promised rate.Mr. Yadav and his team guide the villager towards a volunteer who takes down their names and helps with applications for MNREGA cards. He explains that once they have the card, it is the governments responsibility to provide them employment within 14 days.Social vigilanceWe will keep vigil at Delhi and with the Supreme Court but it is your job to keep vigil here. If the government doesnt deliver then inform us and we will go to the Supreme Court again, he tells them.Forming a group of concerned citizens is crucial not just to ensure delivery of services but also, Mr Yadav admits, to build a base for Swaraj Abhiyan in the Marathwada region.Six months ago, Swaraj Abhiyan and its volunteers came to Latur as part of their journey from Karnataka to Haryana to assess the drought situation across the country. The team wrote letters to many State governments informing them of their findings. When that did not work, they filed a Public Interest Litigation that led to the May 13 verdict that Swaraj Abhiyan is now discussing with villagers.We try not to get too technical with what we discuss. We highlight the issues that matter to people, Mr. Yadav says.The padyatra, he explains, was timed to happen two weeks after the verdict to see if State governments had acted on any of the points."

What distinguishes him from your common or garden ice-cream lover is the fact that he not only makes his own ice creams them, but uses local, seasonal fruits to create unusual flavours . The latest from his freezer is ice cream made from cashew apples.Hailing from a family of farmers, Mr. Kaje has been passionate about whipping up new ice cream flavours using seasonal fruits from his farm house in Vitla, 50 km away from Mangaluru. His coconut milk and jackfruit ice creams are much sought after at organic food fairs.Mr. Kaje says he was inspired to use the juicy cashew apple after a presentation by a horticultural officer from the Central Plantation Crop Research Institute.Tapping traditionThe juice is extracted by squeezing the cashew apple. As the juice is a bit sour, a few drops of rice gruel are added. This is the traditional way of removing or separating the sour portion, Mr Kaje says. The sour solids separate and settle while the sweet liquid can be decanted for use. This sweet juice is used in the same way as I have used coconut milk and jackfruit juice for preparation of ice creams, the engineer explains.Mr. Kaje had planned to present the cashew apple and Kadu Mavu (the local wild mango variety) ice cream during the ongoing two-day Vasantotsava at Shivarama Karanta Pilikula Nisargadhama that began on Saturday. But an unscheduled power shut down at his farm forced him to put off the launch of his new confections.He is now planning to introduce these flavours at a three-day organic food festival in Mangaluru from May 27.Palm cups tooApart from using local and seasonal fruits, Mr. Kaje has turned to another local product for his ice creams  the ubiquitous palm leaf. All his ice creams are available in 50 ml cups made from the fronds of the arecanut palm. Ice creams are also available in 500 ml arecanut palm cups that are supplied every week to an outlet in Puttur. People also place orders for his ice cream for family events, he says."

Though half a dozen infant deaths have been reported since January this year, only two are confirmed as the result of malnutrition and poor health of the mother.The area witnessed 58 malnutrition-related deaths in 2013. The figure came down to 30 in 2014 and further to 14 in 2015, as per the State Health Department. R. Prabhudas, nodal officer for tribal health in Attappady, said the multipronged approach of the Central and State governments since 2013 had brought down the infant mortality rate. The community kitchen scheme aimed at providing nutritious food to pregnant and lactating mothers, children, and the elderly had helped the cause.In 2013, as many as 299 tribal children in Attappady were found to have severe malnutrition. The number has reduced to 52 now. In 2013, the number of children with moderate acute malnutrition was 600. The figure is 296 now. Abortion cases came down to 34 in 2015 from 77 in 2013, he said.Newborns weightThe average weight of newborn babies rose from 1.5 kg to 2.5 kg in these years. Apart from short-term measures like community kitchen and free ration, initiatives aimed at restoring alienated tribal land and helping them in farming are on.We are focusing more on livelihood restoration. Water is another priority, said Seema Bhaskar of the National Rural Health Mission.Experts say the grim situation in Attappady is a combined effect of poverty, lack of employment, land alienation, and loss of traditional agriculture and indigenous food. Ottappalam sub-collector P.B. Nooh has initiated a project to restore landholdings of tribespeople.AlienationOver the years, fertile tribal lands got alienated and traditional cultivation came to a standstill. Now most tribes are living on barren hillslopes, points out tribal activist S. Palaniswamy of Attappady.Tribespeople who have land cultivate bananas, sugarcane, and other cash crops which they do not traditionally grow. The focus is now shifting to food crops, mainly millets and pulses, said tribal women leader Mohana. The tribes are forced to depend on the rice supplied by the public distribution system (PDS). There is a suggestion to supply millets through ration shops in lieu of rice."

Whenever non-vegetarian food is served in the hostel, they go out to the open field to eat.The cooks, who prepared chicken curry and rice for students, kept the containers outside the kitchen so that they can fill their plates and eat it sitting in the lawns or in the open field. This has been the practice followed or imposed on the non-vegetarians in the hostel. We dont know who started it. When we came here as students, our seniors went to the field whenever non-vegetarian food is served. We have been following this practice and never questioned it, said a student, who refused to be named.The hostel has a total strength of 250 students, and the number of students having non-vegetarian food is about 150. The mess facility is based on a dividing system, where the total cost incurred on food a month is divided equally among the students. We dont have a fixed day for non-veg in the kitchen. The mess committees considering the students opinion decides to make chicken twice a month. A committee of students representatives handle the mess, the student said. The hostel warden monitors the mess functioning.There is no restriction to cook chicken in the kitchen where vegetarian food is also prepared. However, it is not served in the dining hall. Maybe our seniors chose to eat it outside to avoid discomfort to our vegetarian friends. The issue has not been a dispute since I joined this institute, a student said.A few students find it strange and improper, but wish not to raise it. We feel insulted as we are not allowed to have our food in the dining hall. Non-vegetarian food is part of our food culture. But, like me, nobody wants to raise their voice against it as it is a tricky issue. We wish to complete our course without getting involved in such issues, opined another student.Kanthaiah, associate professor of bio-chemistry and warden of the hostel, told The Hindu , There is no restriction on having non-vegetarian food in the dining hall. Students go out to have it on their own. We have not issued such an instruction, he said."

As fishermen in the area are unable to venture out into the sea, womenfolk engaged in retail vending are forced to buy fish at high prices from Vizhinjam and Pettah. There has been a heavy dip in the availability of fish for the past 10 days, they say.There is hardly any money to meet our daily needs. Sometimes we earn zero profit even after an entire week of sales, says Bridget, a fish vendor on the popular beach. Many of them have taken loans. We are not left with any option other than borrowing money, she adds.The shortage in availability has pushed fish prices up. In spite of a rise in price, tuna and mackerel still dominate the market. The price of Threadfin bream (Killi meen) has shot up to Rs.30 per piece. The demand for seer fish has come down with a single fish costing around Rs.200.With fish prices rising, crab and mussels have become a favourite. Women on the shore sell fish drenched in rain. With a torn umbrella over her head, Elizabeth, another fish vendor, has finished her sales by 11 a.m. itself. In spite of repeated demands, the government has turned a deaf ear to our needs. All that we get even during trawl ban is 3 kg of rice and 1 kg oil.After staying in relief camps set up at schools and homes of relatives for almost three years, she has shifted to a house built for her by the government.With schools set to reopen in June, they are worried about buying uniforms and books for their children. Many are the sole breadwinners of their families. Men are least bothered about running the family and spend whatever they earn at toddy shops, says Florence.They now place hopes on the new government for an economic and social uplift."

Ramanath Rai said here on Tuesday that the State government will not drop the district office complex project proposed at Padil despite the opposition to it.Speaking at the Republic Day celebration at Nehru Maidan, Mr. Rai said that the five-storey complex will be built at an estimated cost of Rs. 41 crore. The Minister said that the process of selecting the contractor through tenders had been completed and the work would commence as planned. Some environmentalists had approached the tribunal objecting to the diversion of 5.89 acres of land belonging to the Karnataka State Forest Industries Corporation at Padil for constructing the district office complex.Though the government had transferred the ownership of the land to the Revenue Department, the petitioners said that the land was rich with 478 trees and has been a deemed forest. The deemed forest houses several species of animals and birds, they had contended. On the petition filed by Suma R. Nayak, the tribunal had passed an interim order restraining the district administration from axing the trees. According to the Additional Deputy Commissioner the final hearing of the case has been scheduled for January 27.Earlier, in this speech, Mr. Rai said the district has done well in implementing the Anna Bhagya scheme of providing rice at free of cost for below poverty line families.About 2 lakh beneficiaries are being covered under the scheme in the district. The State government was going to bear Rs. 36 crore of the cost. As many as 1.78 lakh children studying in government and aided schools in the district were getting milk for three days in a week under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme.Mr. Rai said that the tenders had been floated for the construction of a new international-level swimming pool in Yemmekere at a cost of Rs. 5 crore.He said process of construction of Ambedkar Bhavan in Urwa Store at a cost of Rs. 12 crore will start after getting administrative approval from Government."

Liquor shops were making several people alcohol addicts. Hence, it was the moral duty of all women to reach out to the public and make them realise the situation to ensure a massive victory for the DMK, which had promised to bring in total prohibition, if elected to power.Despite criticism from the AIADMK about the announcement on distribution of one kg rice for one rupee and loan waiver for agriculture farmers, DMK president M. Karunanidhi implemented the announcements during the previous DMK regime, she said.Ms. Kanmozhi said that since the State government ignored complaints of students of SVS College in Villupuram district about lack of basic infrastructure facilities and collection of excess fees, three students of the college were found dead under mysterious circumstances.Had the State government enquired into their complaints in time, the tragic death of three young students would not have occurred, she said. Terming the AIADMK rule anti-people, she said that the government had never bothered about the welfare of the people. In several villages, old age pension and assistance for destitute widows were stopped. On industrial development, Tamil Nadu was pushed down to the 18{+t}{+h}position from the top three slot and employment opportunities were plummeting, she charged."

Every morning, she cooks for her brother, Hari Krishna, and sister, Mamatha, and leaves for school at around 8 a.m. She is a class 6 student at the Government High School in Kagaz Maddur, and to reach there, she has to walk about four kilometres.Hari accompanies Ramadevi to school, but sometimes he has to miss classes so as to attend to some household chores, like collecting ration rice or gas cylinder. While Ramadevi cooks food, Hari takes over the responsibility of outside works. Since Mamatha is mentally-challenged, there isnt much that she can help out with.These three children became orphans when their mother, Yadamma, passed away in November last year. Their father, Srinivas, passed away six years ago, and they are living on the pension of Rs. 1,500 being extended by the government to Mamatha under the disabled category.Yadamma, a member of Mallikarjuna SHG group, took a loan of Rs. 30,000 from a bank before her death. Soon after her death, about Rs. 20,000 was repaid to the bank. To collect the remaining amount, the bank officials have been collecting a monthly amount of Rs. 1,000 from the stipend of Mamatha.Believe it or not, for the past three months these three children are living off Rs. 500 a month they get after the bank deducts Rs. 1,000 from the stipend of Mamatha.We have paid Rs. 2,000 so far and we have to pay another Rs. 8,000 for the loan.

They cant even cite pain as a reason to stop work as a person claiming to be a doctor residing permanently at the brick kiln would administer pain killers to keep them at it, with paltry wages.At least 548 migrant labourers, including women and children from various districts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, rescued on Wednesday by government officials, have been victims of oppression and exploitation from day one since they arrived here.Based on a tip-off from NGO International Justice Mission (IJM), a team of officials led by Revenue Divisional Officer of Ponneri M. Narayanan conducted a raid on Sri Lakshmi Ganapathi brick kiln at Ponthavakkam village here  the second such raid in the last four years.The documents, including the pay roll, shown by one of the supervisor does not add up to reflect the actual number of workers in the kiln. While the permission sought from the government shows a total of 455 workers in two units of the kiln, the pay rolls have only 324 of them.They pay Rs. 400 a family per week and we have to manage everything with that. Since Malik saab does not give us food, we fight it out in nearby ration shops to get rice at Rs. 5 a kilo, says Savitri, who was cleaning fish for lunch, which she had caught from the stream flowing nearby.The labourer from Samalpur village in Odisha, in his late 20s, who doesnt want to be identified, was apparently waiting for the right opportunity to expose the owner of the brick kiln. The owner even made a pregnant woman to work. You should catch hold of him, he says through a translator.After an enquiry with some of the labourers and supervisors, Mr. Narayanan accepts a case of bonded labour is made out.The workers have been forced to work for meagre pay. They have not been allowed to go home. Even if they were, only one in the family of four was allowed to go. In one case, when the husband died while on his trip to his native, the owner had not allowed wife to for his funeral.Six persons have been detained in connection with the case and the investigation is on."

Authorities are indifferent towards our plea for food, water, and shelter, say Rajappan, A.R. Gopalan, and Jisha of the Moonnam Mala tribal colony at Neelipilavu, near Chittar.To the 21 families of the Malavedar tribe at Moonnam Mala, the very mention of the term forest personnel is frightening. They came here the other day and vandalised our huts. They destroyed the food and provisions stocked in our homes and asked us to leave the forest that has been our home for years. Where shall we go with our children now? the tribespeople ask.The tribespeople have been residing at Moonnam Mala for several years. However, a good number of them left the place in search of jobs in the past 15 years. The migration began at the instance of certain rubber planters who took them to Pala, Kannur, and Kasaragod for latex tapping at their estates. Now, the crisis in the rubber plantation sector has rendered them jobless, prompting them to return to Moonnam Mala.With the return of these tribespeople, the number of Malavedar families at Moonnam Mala has gone up to 21 and they have started pitching huts in the forestland where they once stayed.The colony now houses 11 children and 22 women, besides the men. Our children do not go to schools and there are no jobs for us, says Jisha, a housewife.There were even attempts to portray the tribespeople who returned to the colony as Maoists, she alleged. We do not know politics. We want to live peacefully, without disturbing others, she said.Krishnankutty, a local leader of the Communist Party of India in Chittar, used to collect rice and provisions for these families. He said it was high time the District Collector intervened, bringing the colony under his tribal development programme.Meanwhile, Tribal Development Officer Raheem told The Hindu that the department has been unfailingly addressing the basic needs of all tribespeople in the district."

Special bus services were operated for the people who came from far-flung areas. Police and district authorities made elaborate arrangements to regulate the crowd and traffic.However traffic went out of gear as more and more vehicles brought devotees on the road to the Sabha even as steady stream of people were walking on both sides of the roads. The Jyothi Darshan is considered a special event by the followers of the Samarasa Sutha Sanmarga Sathya Sangam. The saint (Valallar) established the octagonal Hall of Knowledge (Sathiya Gnana Sabhai) to show people that God is in the form of Pure Grace and Light.He called the Sacred Hall of True Knowledge the manifestation of nature. What is to be experienced within ones self has been shown externally in the Hall of True Knowledge.According to him, the light of the soul is Gnana Sabhai and the ever shining light of the soul is God. He aimed at making people realise this truth by showing Jyothi Darshan. On this day, the seven different curtains in the Sabha would be removed one after another to reveal the holy lighted lamp kept in the sanctum sanctorum.Serving of free meal from the very kitchen where Vallalar lit the ever burning stove for preparing and serving food to the people who suffer due to hunger is a tradition.In places surrounding the Sabha, free meals were distributed to the steady stream of devotees by philanthropic organisations, commercial establishments and political parties.A large number of devotees were seen generously donating to Sathya Dharma Salai (The Shrine of Truth and Charity) in the form of money, grains, rice and vegetables. Members who are associated with various sabhas sang Thiru Arutpa, a collection of poems written by Vallalar."

There was good growth of paddy crops following rains.We visited a few affected fields after farmers started to approach us. The fungal attack has been occurring in the last two weeks.

A number of paddy fields in parts of Anaicut, Latheri and Virinjipuram were affected by blast disease.Day time temperature below 28 degree Celsius and cloudy weather, and night time temperature of 19 degree Celsius was conducive for the fungus growth, he said, adding, The present misty weather in the district is conducive for the fungus growth. One variety of rice  CO 51  has been found resistant to the disease attack, while it is sporadically seen in rice varieties such as ADT 36 and ADT 43.KVK has issued advisory to farmers to reduce or even stop use of urea as it will pave way to fast fungal growth. Spots in the shape of eyes on the crops are the symptoms of the disease. It will affect all parts of the crops leaving burnt-like symptoms. We are advising farmers on appropriate use of fungicide in proportion to their field area to control the fungal attack, he added.During the farmers grievance redressal day last week, the scientists advised farmers not to go by the suggestions of shop keepers for use of fungicide. Farmers were asked to bring samples of the affected crops to KVK and ARS for appropriate advice on control measures."

Supplyco has made arrangements to ensure smooth handling of the procurement process, according to officials.About 60 loads of paddy have been procured in the past few days and the quantity is bound to go up in the coming days, paddy marketing officer A.V. Suresh Kumar told The Hindu on Thursday.Though a sum of Rs.21.50 a kg is offered to the farmer as procurement price, only Rs.14.10 is given now. The procurement price has Central and State components and only the Central share is distributed now.The remaining Rs.7.40, being the State share, will be distributed as soon as the amount is released by the government.The procurement is done as per the registration made by farmers online. A permanent registration number is given to the registered farmer to facilitate online verification and quick disbursement of procurement price. The procured paddy is transported to mills.The government has made contract arrangements with 40 mills for processing the paddy. The mills have to return rice to the extent of 68 per cent of the weight of the paddy after processing.Over 200 machines are to be deployed for harvesting. The State government has 35 machines under its custody. Arrangements have been made to deploy adequate number of machines. The machines are brought from owners in the private sector in neighbouring States. The district administration has put a ceiling on the rates to be charged for the harvesting machine.The yield has been apparently less this time owing to various factors. Climate change is considered a major cause for reduced yield. Untimely rain has hit harvest in the past.The crop insurance comes to the help of farmers in case of such a calamity. Climate-based insurance scheme is applicable to paddy farming in Kuttanad and other areas."

The State has secured funding from the Union government for a project to revive 600 hectares of coastal wetlands for climate-resilient farming.The Rs.25-crore project seeks to restore and manage 300 hectares of Pokkali wetlands in Thrissur, Ernakulam, and Alappuzha districts and 300 hectares of Kaipad wetlands in Kannur for carbon sequestration and production of paddy and fish. The integrated farming practice will be promoted to build resilience to climate change and provide more income for farmers and local communities. The rotation of rice farming and fish aquaculture is also expected to improve land use efficiency and minimise land degradation.The project has been cleared for financial assistance from the National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change and will be implemented by the Agency for Development of Aquaculture, Kerala, (ADAK) over a period of four years.It involves the construction of earthen bunds along the margin of rivers and backwaters and along the periphery of paddy polders to withstand sea level rise, floods, and tidal surges triggered by global warming and climate change. Sluice gates would be provided to regulate the water level and facilitate fish farming. Suitable species of mangroves would be planted to protect the bunds from damage due to heavy rain and flooding.The revival of coastal wetland farming is also expected to generate employment opportunities for women, says U.S. Sajeev, Executive Director, ADAK.The project report estimates an annual production of 1,500 tonnes of paddy and 2,250 tonnes of fish from the 600 hectares of coastal intertidal wetlands, generating a total revenue of Rs.24.75 crore. It would also generate 1,08,000 man days of employment every year, of which 43,200 would be for women.The farmers will be supplied with tall, salt tolerant varieties of paddy and euryhaline fish that can adapt to a wide range of salinities.Currently, only 400 hectares of Kaipad wetlands in Kannur are under farming while the Pokkali paddy- shrimp cultivation is prevalent in 2,200 hectares in Ernakulam, Thrissur and Alappuzha districts. According to ADAK, a total of 1,100 hectares of Kaipad land and 5,765 hectares of Pokkali fields can be revived."

The Secunderabad Cantonment Board officials have already approached the Hyderabad Traffic Police seeking help in streamlining the traffic movement in this area and connected roads for the proposed construction of a new wider bridge.The narrow bridge - with wider road on both the ends - is a well-known traffic bottle-neck during peak hours. Some times, the vehicles back up right up to Tadbun crossroads to the bridge. As there are no alternative roads, traffic gets stuck choked.Widening the bridge was the only solution. After months of planning, the SCB authorities finally decided to build a new bridge.Closure of the Tadbun-Diamond Point stretch for general traffic has thus become necessary. Many commuters going from Tadbun to Suchitra, Medchal and beyond dont prefer to take the Bowenpally main road as it is always clogged.Instead, they take the Tadbun-Diamond Point stretch which too was getting choked due to massive volumes of traffic. Similarly, people coming to Secunderabad from Medchal, avoid Bowenpally road and reach Tadbun via the narrow bridge despite the traffic moving slow.This is because it takes longer time to cross Bowenpally police station junction, Chinna Thokatta bridge and Tadbun. That route is always crowded, says Paka Sravan living near Warangal Rice Depot. People living in colonies on either side of the bridge can drive vehicles up to the bridge and reach their homes through lanes and bylanes.But, other regular traffic would be diverted, says Traffic DCP-I L.S. Chauhan. Vehicles coming from Suchitra and Bapujinagar would be not allowed towards the bridge. They would be diverted to Bowenpally vegetable market via Diamond Point junction.Those heading to Diamond Point from Tadbun can move a few yards further and take Nicholson road to reach their destinations. Well post more traffic policemen, erect signage and suggest diversions once the civic authorities finalise the date to begin the work, Mr. Chauhan says."
