Edited excerpts:Can you comment on the intersection of the new and old in unpredictable ways in the India you mention?India is essentially like a palimpsest. Empires were built and torn away, cultures integrated with each other. Look at the rudaalis , for example. The ones I interviewed were Manganiyaars of Muslim origin, but worked as rudaalis or mourners for Hindu ceremonies. They live in an India which is still beyond the reach of the government and police, but mobile phones and television sets have established their presence. This hamlet where they live is among the seven or eight regions still under the fierce control of the kith and kin of the Rajputs. The presence of the State, if at all, is personified in the form of the upper-caste patriarchal head of the village, the thakur .Then there are the women grave diggers of Kerala. In a way, they are essentially doing a mans job but still discriminated against because of their lower caste.Whats your take on the loss of the ancient vocations, and the cultural diversities?Im saddened by their loss. Take the storytellers of Andhra for instance, the Burrakatha artists who memorised a number of epics such as the Mahabharata, Ramayana and Yellamma, composed songs, and witty, lyrical scripts, adapted them to deliver social messages and Government campaigns such as polio, AIDS and family planning. They still use ancient musical instruments such as the tambura, dimki and andelu. They survive on a diet of rice and rats. Discriminations on the basis of caste has kept them on the fringes of the society. Most of their children are rag-pickers or garbage-cleaners, a job they have resorted to now that Burrakatha renditions hardly have any takers. It is tragic to see this living history fizzle away.How did the book come about?As a child, I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. I remember them talking about their own childhood. They would tell me about the traditional midwives, rat catchers, the lamp-post lighters, and the drummers. There were numerous such professions, each with a social relevance that was more than just colourful tapestry in the fabric of our society. But as these things fade away, it becomes necessary to document what is destined to become history. That is when I started travelling to rural areas, documenting the lives of these professionals.My grandparents would tell me about midwives, rat catchers, the lamp-post lighters, and drummers"

Prasanna (32), who has bagged Tamil Nadu Chief Ministers Special Award this year for high yield of paddy by adopting System of Rice Intensification (SRI) technique, her interest towards farming never wanes though she is a busy woman juggling time between managing her family and being a teacher in a private school.Born in an agricultural family, I was considered lucky by my parents. Right from childhood till my college, I was chosen to perform the rituals during the sowing and harvest times every season. So, my bonding with farming is deep-rooted, Ms. Prasanna said.During cultivation season, I spend a couple of hours in the early morning and all my weekends in the field, she added.The TRY 3 variety of rice, Ms. Prasanna cultivated in February 2015 gave 3,223 kilograms of rice, which converts to 16,115 kilograms per hectare, the highest yield in Tamil Nadu in the SRI during 2014-2015. The special award she received from Chief Minister Jayalalithaa included a cash price of Rs. 5 lakh and a medal.Though it was Ms. Prasannas husband M. Padmanabhan who mainly looks after agriculture in their family-owned lands, it was Prasannas keen interest that made them participate in the yearly contest for which the land should be enrolled in advance by paying a fee of Rs. 150.All credit should go to her as she ensured that all the advice and guidelines by Agriculture Department officials were stringently followed, said Mr. Padmanabhan. Ms. Prasanna said that though SRI cultivation involved tedious labour for the cultivators, the yield quality and consequently the income was much higher.More importantly, only a bare minimum of chemical fertilizer was used, she said, adding that even water requirement was much lesser.S. Kanagaraj, Joint Director (Agriculture), Madurai, pointed out that since the announcement of the award by the present government, this was the second time a farmer from Madurai had won.There are many misconceptions about SRI cultivation among farmers, particularly about the yield, as they think that a lot of area gets wasted due to the spacing between the plants. But that is how the crop gets maximum amount of nutrients. Now, Prasannas success story can be used as an example for others, he added."

Though activists and farmers are happy about the increase in production, they say much more needs to be done to take them to a larger population.The M.S.Swaminathan Research Foundation has been working with the tribal people in Kolli Hills in the area of climate smart nutri-cereals. Millets are not only nutrition rich, but also climate resilient, M.S.Swaminathan.In the past, our food basket was very wide, consisting not only wheat or rice but also a wide variety of millets - what is normally described as coarse cereals. Later, public procurement and distribution tended to be confined to rice and wheat. Thenoon-meal programme in schools also did not include the nutri-millets, he said.I got millets included in the National Food Security Act of 2013, so that there will be both the minimum support price and public procurement. This will help to widen the food basket and insulate farmers from a failure of crops under conditions of low rainfall and moisture stress, Mr. Swaminathan said.With more and more people becoming health conscious, consumption of millets is on the rise. Compared to five years ago, consumption of cereals is far better despite the fact that millets are costly, says Ananthoo of the Safe Food Alliance that has been campaigning for organic foods.However, since the government is yet to implement any programme for propagation of millets, it is not reaching a larger section of the population. The neighbouring Karnataka government has introduced ragi and jowar through the public distribution system and Telengana and Orissa too have come out with plans, he points out.Supply through PDSMillet farmer and organics promoter Pamayan of Madurai suggested that the government consider supplying coarse cereals through the PDS in cities where awareness levels are higher.If more farmers have to take up coarse cereals, the government must extend the incentive of Rs. 2500 per acre to all districts. It should also ensure procurement from farmers at reasonable prices. Harvesting equipment is also needed for millets. Interesting recipes need to be developed to create a taste for such cereals, he said.The PDS focus in the State is on supply of rice, and the government is neither procuring nor supplying coarse cereals through the system. Official sources said that cooperative stores are already selling such cereals procured from tribal areas."

Resource mapping and carbon neutral models of development should be given thrust in the next campaign for development of the State.The natural resources had to be mapped and documented in such a way as to use it as a base for development planning.Peoples biodiversity registers should be enriched with data on traditional knowledge systems, which in turn would contribute to development planning, he said.Collective actionS. Gregory, Professor, Department of Anthropology, University of Kannur, said conservation of biological resources was part of our culture and value system.

However, the farmers have started using the light trap method to control insects. Many of cereal crops such as sorghum, rice and maize and vegetable crops such as tomato and brinjal attract insects and pests. Horticultural crops and pulse crops also attract insects.Agricultural officials and researchers say that one light trap was enough for controlling most of the insects that might attack the crop. It can be used from the stage of planting to harvest. As per the method, the traps should be placed at a centre of field for three hours between 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., as insects are active mainly during this period.J. Draviam, Senior Scientist and Head, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Karur, told The Hindu that light trap was a vital tool to trap both the sexes of insects. It could reduce the carryover pest population substantially. Many farmers in Karur district had started placing light traps to kill insects.P. Baskar, a farmer at Thammanaickenpatti, said that he had raised bitter guard, onion, brinjal and a few other horticultural crops in his field. He had brought his field under the light trap system. He could say that his field was almost insect-free thanks to the light trap.He said he had bought the light for Rs.1500. It was a cheap and effective method to control insects."

Hoping that her husband would return one day, she took up errands to sustain the family, which also included her aged parents and younger brother. Married to Rajashekhar, Shilpa did not show any interest in his business as it involved transporting iron ore from the Ballari region to Mangaluru. She is not aware of what happened to the fleet of trucks.After working in garment shops, fancy stores, etc., for a few years, she decided to go independent. Then came the idea of exploiting her cooking skills and she roped in younger brother Chiranjeevi. There was no moolah; nationalised banks with which her husband once dealt with in lakhs of rupees turned down her plea. She had to approach an NBFC and withdraw Rs. 1 lakh kept as fixed deposit in her sons name as the seed money to buy a mini goods vehicle for a mobile canteen.Halli Mane RottisOnce she got the vehicle for her dream project about 10 months ago, there has been no looking back, says Shilpa. She prepares the batter for rottis [rice, jowar and raagi] and curries at home and brings them on the mobile canteen to the upmarket residential area of Mannagudde every evening. On an average, she prepares 300 to 500 rottis, vegetable subjis, spicy chutney, along with Thatte idlis, a rice item, chicken Donne biriyani and chicken green masala.Initially, I was sceptical whether Mangalureans would accept the Hassan flavour; however, my doubts proved myth. The demand is ever growing, Shilpa says even as she thanks Mangalureans.

They also get boiled eggs and banana. But, senior jail officials, said the menu is served within the sanctioned budget of 600 gms of rice, 100 gms of dal, 250 gms of vegetables and 30 gms of oil per head per day.To adjust the cost, the jail authorities have restricted the free supply of 175 gms of mutton to one Sunday against two in the past. They are getting 175 gms of chicken for three Sundays. More ingredients like coriander, curry leaves, garlic and chatni were also added to the items in breakfast to make the food tasty.CouponsFor lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before. The same is served in packets of 600 gms for under trial prisoners and 700 gms for convicts the next day. While the under trial prisoners are issued coupons to an upper limit of Rs 3,000 per month, the limit for convicts is only Rs 1,500 a month because the money had to be spent out of the wages earned by them in works assigned while serving sentence.The convicts have to necessarily send 50 per cent of wages to their dependents. In the case of under trial prisoners, the limit is higher as they will be spending from their personal cash that they brought at the time of admission or when their relatives gave them during mulaqat.Small gestureThe Deputy Inspector General of prisons A. Narasimha said the changes in menu were brought about as part of jail reforms in a bid to remove the vengeance among the inmates on having landed behind the bars.He said it was a small gesture to make them at home as their freedom and liberty was already curtailed. The facility was already provided in Tihar jail.For lunch and dinner, the prisoners can order chicken fried rice, egg biryani, bajji, pakodi and other items on payment a day before"

Food crops in general showed an increasing trend in production with pulses and tapioca recording an increase of 13 and 18 per cent respectively while rice recorded a marginal increase. The area under pulses and tapioca cultivation showed an increase of 20 per cent and 11.6 per cent respectively.Among spices, pepper recorded a tremendous increase in production mainly due to higher productivity while ginger and turmeric showed a marginal increase. Production of coffee, tea and cardamom has gone up, while rubber production has declined. Fruits, banana and other plantains registered an increase in production whereas cashew registered a considerable decline in area, production and productivity. The decline in the area under paddy cultivation has been attributed to the low profitability as a result of the rising cost of human labour and seasonal shortage of manpower, as well as the relative price change in favour of competing crops. In the case of coconut, the prevalence of root wilt disease, poor management and senile palms are the reasons cited for falling productivity.Vegetable production is a silver lining in the agriculture sector, with a production of 13.55 lakh tonnes in 2014-15, registering a 64 per cent increase since 2011-12. The area under horticulture has gone up from 42,477 hectares in 2011-12 to 90,533 ha in 2014- 15.The use of pesticides in Kerala showed a decreasing trend during 2014- 15, indicating a shift towards organic farming. Kerala produced 3,520 tonnes of bio-fertilizers and 119 vermi compost units were established. An area of 2,000 ha was brought under organic certification.

The paddy is ready for harvesting and Mr. Chinnasamy is happy that more efficient rice tillers are available now.Water managementI experimented with drip irrigation, instead of the usual practice of water logging. This way only the root zones of the crop were watered. And the amount of water normally required to irrigate one acre of paddy now irrigated three acres, said Mr. Chinnasamy. Efficient seed management also added up to his net profit margins.Seeds were put directly in the field adopting a typical space pattern. Only two kilograms of seeds were used per acre instead of the 25 kilograms required in the traditional method of scattering the seeds , he pointed out.Assistant Director of Agriculture M. Mahalingam, who was all praise for the innovative practice tried out by Mr. Chinnasamy, said that the space provided between the plants allowed enough sunlight and ventilation and enabled the farmer to control pests more efficiently. Moreover, the drip irrigation providing alternate wetting and drying cycles is mainly responsible for the healthy grains that have come up, he said."

This move went a long way in empowering women.The Siddaramaiah government had completed half of its five-year term. The Congress workers should impress upon the voters to elect the party in the zilla and taluk panchayat elections. Having the same party in power at the State-level and in zilla and taluk panchayats would help in the implementation of development works.It was to help the poor that the Congress launched the Anna Bhagya scheme where rice was being provided for free to the poor. When the Anna Bhagya scheme was launched, there was a lot of criticism against it. Some people said that it would make poor people lazier. Others wondered how it could be implemented. But this scheme had been successfully implemented in the last two-and-a-half years.Unlike previous governments, the Siddaramaiah government had also shown its concern for the transgenders by launching various schemes for their welfare. The government had provided houses, jobs, and financial assistance to the transgenders for the first time, Ms. Jaimala said.Oscar Fernandes, MP, said that the State government had taken steps to strengthen the panchayati raj system by implementing the recommendations of the Ramesh Kumar committee.

Achuthan of the Congress, who was alleged to have torpedoed official efforts to extend the right bank canal of the Parambikulam Aliyar Project to the three grama panchayats.The religious and social groups which campaigned for NOTA in the Lok Sabha election are standing behind the LDF this time. On his part, Mr. Achuthan remains unruffled and the UDF, anyhow, has no other candidate to propose for the constituency.In the last local body poll, the LDF had floated a front involving the then NOTA campaigners, and wrested Kozhinjampara and Vadakarapathy constituencies.

For the DRI enforcers, his arrest was the culmination of a month-long tenacious intelligence operation targeted at a Gulf-based hawala network that profited from smuggling foreign exchange out of the country.Local agents of the network collected foreign currency from Gulf returnees by offering a higher exchange rate. The money was smuggled to Dubai where gold traders offered bullion at a lesser rate if they were paid in US Dollars or Dirham.The gold was then smuggled back into the country and sold to jewellers here.The DRI said Muhammad had attempted to smuggle the foreign currency to Dubai to purchase gold at the behest of some jeweller.A part of it was to be used to balance accounts of the Dubai-based hawala network. It is a classic case of reverse hawala operation, an investigator said.Muhammads arrest was just the tip of the ice-berg. Seizure of foreign currency smuggled out of the country was far and few. The failure-to-detect rate was unquantifiable. But it could be high.Notably, Muhammad had flown to Dubai from various airports in the country at least 14 times in the past 12 months. They said illegally earned money was routinely converted to foreign currency and smuggled abroad through similar routes to be secreted in foreign bank accounts or laundered and re-routed to the country.Muhammads arrest has greatly expanded the scope of the DRI operation.He was also under investigation for running an Internet-based illegal telephone exchange that enabled Gulf-based Indians to call home at less than legal rate. Smugglers and also radical forces were known to use similar voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) telephony to evade monitoring.The prohibitive import duty on gold, imposed to tackle the countrys yawning current account deficit, has caused its smuggling to increase exponentially.Customs enforcers said they anticipated a surge in gold smuggling in the run-up to the summer vacation, when Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) flying back home for holidays were likely to increase. A successful run could earn a smuggler a profit of more than Rs.1 lakh for a kg of contraband gold."

This clearly shows a supply deficit, but the larger picture indicates a drastic drop in per capita protein consumption and thus, a looming malnutrition issue.Not just for the year, the situation is alarming enough to keep the protein-rich food out of the reach of the poor and the lower middle class people, given the fall in acreage of pulses. Soybean is projected as an elixir in this context, offering solutions to the problems like protein deficiency. Therefore, bridging the demand-supply gap of pulses and thus stabilising prices and, finally, creating a healthier and tastier alternative to pulses are essential.Soybean has a role to play in addressing the issue of high prices and relative shortage of pulses. The innovative dal alternative based on soy flour, corn flour, wheat flour and turmeric powder is positioned as an affordable protein, says M.M. Krishna, Director of the India Soy Food Programme of the US Soybean Export Council (USSEC).The product was formally launched in Tirupati, targeting the hotels, restaurants and caterers (HoReCa) segment.At Rs. 90, a kilogram of soybean containing 300 grams of protein is the cheapest source, with 100 per cent digestibility similar to milk, which is much higher than toor dal, rice or wheat, says Awesh Jain, head of projects at Ruchi Soya Industries.The product is widely used under ISKCONs Annamrutha and Akshayapatra schemes targeting schoolchildren."

The concern translated into I4farmers, an organisation that is now providing a ray of hope for the families of farmers who committed suicide in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.Unlike many Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) they dont believe in handing over a cheque and forget, but spend a few weeks with farmers and infuse confidence that the society cares for them. We try to get to the root cause of a farmers death in each adopted family and give social security to the wife and children, says Srinivas Ranabothu, software professional in New Jersey and one of the founder-members of I4farmers.The five-member group consisting of Suresh Ediga, Laxmi, Srinivas Karturi and Srinivasa Sadhu apart from Srinivas Ranabothu started the organisation with an aim to stop at least five suicides. They made certain impact in several villages purely through their personal effort. These technocrats have taken a totally different approach in providing assistance.As a short-term measure, they are sponsoring the education of 34 children in Warangal, 64 in Mahabubnagar and 12 in Nalgonda. As a part of mid-term assistance they have adopted five villages in Talamadugu mandal in Adilabad district trying to make the tribal farmers adopt age-old farming practices. The root cause of suicides in these villages was the farmers moving to Bt Cotton and neglecting the food crops like rice and jowar. Cotton deprived them of their food stock for the entire year and also increased dependence on middlemen thus driving them to suicides, says Srinivas.So they now brought them back to food crops and are encouraging them to use non-BT seeds for commercial crops. We are training them in preparing manure and will ensure that the produce is procured with good market price, says Srinivas who hails from Mamillagudem in Mothe mandal of Nalgonda district.Among the long-term measures, they want to concentrate on introducing alternative livelihood as well and bring in best farming practices. Adoption of Cheryal mandal in Warangal and Gajwel in Medak represented by the Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is in the offing with the help of Raithu Swarajya Vedika.Support comes from NRI friends. NRIs donate for various social and cultural activities but they are socially distant from the farmers. We made them realise that donating to farmers was important. We motive them to spend some time with the distressed families during their annual visits to India. Participatory role will bring in and sustain the assistance, argues Srinivas, who along with his team spends at least 20 hours a week on their initiatives sacrificing their family time on week-ends and invites from friends. The team members reaffirm their commitment to educate farmers so that they come back to traditional methods and get better price for their produce."

P. Vijayan, who pointed out that it had extended loans to farmers for various activities such as dairying, poultry farming, fish culture and paddy cultivation.He said the initiatives taken by the bank had resulted in 45 acres being brought under vegetable and banana cultivation ahead of the Vishu festivities. Our aim is to create a self-reliant community, he said.Around 80 tonnes of vegetables were produced ahead of the last Onam festivities. It is expected that around 60 tonnes of vegetables would be produced by the farmers under the banks aegis for the Vishu festivities.The opening of Jaiva Kalavara, a permanent outlet for organic produce at Edappally, has provided a big marketing channel for the Palliakkal farmers, who get farming loans at 4 per cent interest. If the repayment is done without default, the interest is waived, said Mr. Vijayan, reiterating the banks commitment to encouraging farming.The bank also extends low-interest loans for dairying and poultry farming activities as well as fish culture. Paddy cultivators are given loans without any interest.The poultry farming efforts have borne fruit with around 2,000 eggs being collected from the farmers on a daily basis to be sold through the banks outlets, said Mr. Vijayan.The rise in egg production is the result of the bank taking an initiative to distribute 25 layer birds each to 160 farmers.There are also 25 self-help groups engaged in various activities, ranging from pokkali rice cultivation to aquaculture.Around 1,000 farmers are directly involved in various activities, Mr. Vijayan added."

For storage, the moisture content should not be more than 14 per cent, the official said.To overcome this problem, the government has installed dryers in many markets at a cost of Rs. 52.85 crore. Small dryers, costing Rs. 6 lakh each, are being given to village co-operative societies and individual farmers on a 50 per cent subsidy, subject to the maximum of Rs. 2.5 lakh."

As many as 20 farmers have committed suicide in the last 18 months in this backward district where farming remains the prime occupation.Agriculture Department officials say that Suryakanth Sidramappa Nalagave (44), who committed suicide in Bhatambra village in Bhalki taluk recently, can be considered as the 21st victim of the agrarian crisis.The ill-fated farmer had taken Rs. 3 lakh as loans from various sources and had suffered crop loss for four agriculture seasons. Nalagave was upset when the rabi crop was destroyed, Mahadev Belure, his friend and fellow farmer, said. Suryakanth was found hanging from a tree in his field three days ago.Basavaraj Shanumukhappa, octogenarian farmer from the village, said he had never seen such a severe drought. We have suffered water scarcity and erratic rainfall every 10 years or so. We thought the worst was in 1972. But this year seems to be worse than that, he said.The name of our village Bhatambra means rice and curry in Marathi. Such a prosperous village should not witness such tragic events. I dont know why the rain gods are so angry with us, he said.The situation is grim, say officials. The number of farm suicides will cross 70 if we count the incidents since 2013, when the drought started, a senior Agriculture Department official said.The three-year spell of drought is one of the reasons. Second is the dependence on water intensive crops such as sugarcane.Third is the lack of efforts to recharge the aquifer by planting trees, watershed development or rainwater harvesting. Remnant moisture is also sucked up as farmers dont follow practices like staggered cropping or crop rotation, another officer said."

Her husband Alex has been to the State a number of times earlier, four of the visits coming during Pongala which, he said, he enjoyed. The crowd does not matter. Pongala in Thiruvananthapuram is special. They planned to pray to the goddess later in the day when things were quieter. Though Alex, a Siva devotee, has had the Pongala offering before, he didnt quite remember the taste. He also expressed the desire to offer Pongala the next time for his wife.Debbie Ann Champion and Gareth Champion from Cornwall in the U.K. said this was their second time in Kerala but first experience of the Pongala. The Pongala, Gareth said, had been shown on television in the U.K. two or three years ago. When they decided to get away for two weeks and come here, and realised that the festival was taking place, they had to see it. Asked what she liked about the Pongala, Debbie said, All the houses are open, the women cooking rice on the road, and everyone giving space to women which is very rare in India.Back home, one wouldnt find people opening their doors, hearts to anyone and everyone, Debbie said. Asked if she planned to come back, Debbie said, We love Kerala. Well keep dropping in. Dianne E.

At 10 a.m., temple tantri Parameswaran Vasudevan Namboodiri handed over the sacred flames to melsanthi Arun Kumar Namboodiri to light the specially made pongala hearth near the sanctum sanctorum. Saha melsanthi P.V. Kesavan Namboodiri then passed on the flame to the pandara aduppu, in front of the temple, the flame of which wasimmediately passed on to thousands of pongala hearths set up across the city by the devotees.`The rituals came to an end at 1.30 p.m. with the serving of the pongala nivedyam, a sweet potion of rice and jaggery as primary ingredients prepared at the pandara aduppu, and considered an offering to propitiate the presiding deity of the ancient temple in Attukal.The festival, which began on February 15 and had religious rituals, ceremonies and cultural programmes every day, will end with the kuruthi tharpanam at 1 a.m. on Thursday.

Sathasivam. Ms. Sathasivam who is offering Pongala for the second year here said her prayer was for the well-being of family and countrymen. Though she offered Pongala in her village annually, the one at Attukal was the biggest congregation of women she had seen, Ms. Sathasivam who was preparing payasam said.Malini, wife of Additional Director General of Police (Intelligence) A. Hemachandran, said she had been coming to Attukal from childhood. The biggest advantage of offering Pongala at the temple was the darshan of the goddess. It is with Devis grace that we are here, and these days I just ask for peace of mind, Ms. Malini said as the rice for her Aravana payasam bubbled away.Actor Jalaja said for the past five-six years she had been coming regularly from Bahrain to offer Pongala. She had first offered Pongala once before getting married. Things had changed a lot over the years, the crowd had got bigger, yet women from afar, even across continents, came here year after year because of their staunch faith. I hope to come here in the coming years too. Actor Ineya was happy at getting a chance to offer Pongala near the temple for the first time. Usually, we offer Pongala at our house or the nearby temple at Karamana, the actor, part of a group of five, said. Back from Chennai only on Monday, she said it was a lucky break in a shooting that allowed her to reach in time for the fete. Next year, I hope to offer Pongala facing the goddess on the temple premises, Ineya who is currently shooting for the Tamil movie Pottu, said.Actor Chippi who is a regular at the Pongala this time was an expression of gratitude for the success of the movie Two Countries produced by her husband Ranjith. But she also missed the presence of actor Kalpana. It was a shock. Kalpana chechi had not offered Pongala here for the past two years, yet she was expected to be here. We never asked the other if you would come next year. It was a given."

I asked him why he didnt eat it, my friend Sudeshna Shome Ghosh wrote. His response was, How could I? I didnt know what it was. My friend rolled her eyes (you can now do that thanks to an updated emoticon app), I LOLd and that was the end of it.The conversation brought back dabba memories, of going to school and opening my stainless steel lunch box in the afternoon, hours after it was packed, wondering about its contents. With the mother being a fabulous cook, the dabba was usually crammed with theplas folded in half with a dibbi of mango pickle, jeera rice with caramelized onion and curd, or rotis that miraculously stayed soft so that they could be torn with two fingers and eaten with sabji . There was lunchbox envy, where I coveted my classmates tiffins because they brought food that wasnt familiar to me. I yearned for cucumber sandwiches, after re-reading Enid Blyton books, even though the white bread would be curling up at the edges by afternoon. I even wanted the dabba that held cold, clammy Maggi noodles, something that I now wouldnt touch with a barge pole. But at that time, it was as exciting as moringa leaves are now to chefs.Now there are plenty of cookery books, blogs and Instagram accounts with innovative lunch box ideas, all just a Google search away. Blogger and nutritionist Nandita Iyer, better known as Saffron Trail online, has simple, healthy ideas, which include vegetable peanut noodles, pita pocket pizza sandwiches, and puliyogare or tamarind rice. Lulu Loves Bombay blogs about travel, her children, and food. Her sweet potato discs sound like a lovely addition to the dabba , as do her methi thepla and mango chunda. Sanjeeta KKs blog, Lite Bite, has a Lunchbox Bites section with some handy tips and recipes such as for muthiyas and wholegrain chillas.On Instagram, Lunch Box Dad, Beau Coffrans mealtime hacks include rocket ships from bread and cheese, and Spider-Man lunches with berries; while bleary-eyed parents may not be keen to wake up and make food art, its a fun account to follow. Grace Halls Eats Amazing blog focuses on Bento-style lunches for her son and follows themes such as Halloween, rainbows, and gardens. Her #PackedLunchLove Project has creative boxes that, she promises, take just a few minutes to prepare and are a visual feast. A few years ago, graphic designer and illustrator David Laferrieres innovative sandwich bag art went viral. Hes made over 1,800 sandwich bag drawings with monsters and kites.And when in doubt, return to the library.Apart from the usual cluster of recipe books, check out Karen Le Billons French Kids Eat Everything , a charming account of a family, with two picky-eater children, that moves from the USA to France and discovers how the French government and the school system strengthen food education. Then theres Chris Butterworths Lunchbox: The Story of Your Food , illustrated by Lucia Gaggiotti. A picture book, it takes young readers on a journey from farm to fork, getting them to think: where did the food in my lunchbox come from? Its a lovely way of engaging children with farmers who grow our food and get them curious about what they are eating.Mommy Go Lightly, a.k.a. journalist and author Lalita Iyer, writes lovingly about dabbas on her blog, Food is intuitive, she writes about packing her son Res lunch box. At least thats how it should be. Try different things and figure out what works for your child. My tip is, make it visually exciting. Make it look good. All you need is colours. Pretty much all my mommy and daddy friends gave me tips like that when I talked to them about the art of dabba packing: fruits and dry fruits in small Tupperware boxes to snack on in the bus; use leftovers innovatively.Shinibali Mitra Saigal, who packs food for her nine-year-old daughter said, Mine doesnt like anything soggy, squidgy or leaky. My daughter claims that thanks to me, she had to eat pickled strawberries, which taste vile. When I asked her what she meant, she added, According to her, the pickle in an airtight container leaked and ran into the strawberry in a different compartment. So that makes it pickled strawberry and an excuse not to finish her lunch box.Ghosh wakes up ten minutes earlier in the morning to make extra sandwiches for her sons friends. According to my son, none of them want to share the fruits I pack, she said, with a sigh. But hes telling me that, and well, he hates fruits. SoLooking back, we can appreciate that one person who woke up at the crack of dawn to toil away in the kitchen to prepare fresh lunchboxes for the family. I regret the dabbas that I brought back home uneaten, even the alu methi, which really doesnt do itself any favours when cold. Okay, maybe not the alu methi.The author writes about education for sustainable development, conservation, and food security. Shes the former editor of Time Out Bengaluru."

Cycle Katta invites like-minded people to come together once every three months to swap stories, discuss issues, and plan fun activities. This weekend, the group celebrates its first anniversary.Ashish Agashe, a journalist who volunteers with the Youth Hostels Association of India, and co-founder of Cycle Katta, says, We chose the name Cycle Katta because we wanted it to be a place where people would gather based on a common interest, and not for a commercial purpose.  Katta , in Marathi, means a place to hang out. We started out with 50 people, and have grown beyond 85.Agashe used to cycle regularly until Class 10. When in college, he began to ride a motorbike. A few years later, it dawned on him that it did not make sense to use a motorised vehicle, since most of his travel was restricted to a 10-kilometre radius. A motorbike wasnt helping the environment. This realisation encouraged him and his friends to build a platform like Cycle Katta.Earlier, the group used to meet at a classroom in Parel. Now they have partnered with the Maharashtra Nature Park Society, which runs the Maharashtra Nature Park in Dharavi.Avinash Kubal, deputy director of Maharashtra Nature Park Society, says, Running programmes to educate people about nature conservation is the reason why we exist. And since cycling is an eco-friendly activity, we definitely want to promote it. We hope every citizen of Mumbai cycles to work at least once every week. This is worth trying out. Cycling, as a non-polluting mode of transport, can be a wonderful way to maintain the health of our city.Swetal Kanwalu, a town planner who works with CIDCO on the Navi Mumbai Airport Influence Notified Area project, and has spoken at a previous edition of Cycle Katta, says: Cyclists have to reclaim their right to cycle. Only then will the administration pay attention to their concerns and issues. There is no point making comparisons with Amsterdam and Copenhagen. India is a different ballgame. We are including cycling tracks in the planning process, but mindsets have to change. People owning cars bully people who use motorbikes, and they in turn bully people who use cycles. This looking down needs to change.Avanti Darade, a software developer, who has been part of Cycle Katta since its inception, says, What I love most about cycling is the experience of freedom it gives me. And, of course, it has tremendous health benefits as well. While she would be happy to cycle to work, it does not seem feasible because she lives in Thane, and her office is in Khar. The distance to cover is far too much. She prefers to go cycling on weekends, and explore new areas on her own.As a woman riding a bicycle, she says, you do hear comments from bus drivers and rickshaw-wallas at times, especially if you are out late at night or early in the morning. And this happens even in well-planned areas like Powai. Despite these experiences, her love of cycling has not diminished. In fact, she recently went on a cycling trip to Arunachal Pradesh with people she met at Cycle Katta.Stories of inspiration seem to be in abundant supply at Cycle Katta. At one of their sessions, they were joined by Sunita Kumbhakarna and Vandana Bhavsar, two friends from Panvel, who had cycled from Panaji to Kanyakumari over a period of 12 days in late 2014. Kumbhakarna says, I am 42, and Vandana is 46. That did not prevent us from going on a cycling trip. Our kids were incredibly supportive. My real inspiration came from a 28-year-old girl from England, who I met a few years ago.The young woman was travelling all over the world alone, dealing with unfamiliar weather conditions, and local languages.That really got me thinking about how I too could do it. And that my fears were all of my own making, says Kumbhakarna.Luckily, I had a friend to do this with. She runs a construction business, and I am a teacher. We met some amazing people, and being close to nature was the best part.This Sunday, at their fourth edition, Cycle Katta will host two guest speakers. One of them is Arun Wedhikar, a senior artist with an advertising agency in Prabhadevi, who will speak about a 21-day solo cycling trip he undertook from Mumbai to Srinagar three decades ago. His experiences have also been published in the form of a Marathi book titled Mumbai Te Kashmir: Cycle Safar.Wedhikar says, I was in my early twenties, a free bird. My friends thought I was crazy, so nobody joined me. But I had the most memorable time. It was an ordinary cycle, costing 300 rupees. Not like the expensive cycles of today. I made no travel bookings. I enjoyed nature on the way, played my mouth organ, stopped by to make sketches, slept under trees, and even swam in rivers.A rice plate used to cost only three rupees at that time. I went with 970 rupees in my pocket, and I still had 500 rupees with me when I reached Srinagar. I was so enchanted by the beauty of Kashmir that I took up a job, and stayed there for a year.In addition to Wedhikar, urban planner Kedar Ghorpade will speak at the upcoming session. Agashe says, Mr Ghorpade will share the architects perspective. We have decided to pursue the critical part of having bicycle parking facilities at railway stations more aggressively. The discussion with him will help us figure out the way ahead.Cycle Katta will meet on Sunday, March 20, at 9 am.

One observation is that the board which is left with just another month for the completion of its term was in no mood to earn any kind of disrepute and hence was reluctant to accept the recommendations.In his briefing to the media, TTD Chairman Ch. Krishna Murthy also said that the board has not taken any final call over the issue but at the same time emphatically ruled out any enhancement in the price of laddus. The board approved several engineering works and sanctioned various purchases including the laying of BT road on the second ghat road at a cost of Rs. 2.80 crore, reconstruction of Sri Padmavathi sametha Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple at Pithapuram (Rs. 2.55 crore), construction of pilgrims choultries at Devunikadapa (Rs. 3.35 crore) and Penchalakona (Rs.3.37 crore), purchase of 15.3 lakh kg of Sona Masuri rice (Rs.5.89 crore), 3.5 lakh kg of BG Dal (Rs. 4.53 crores), two lakh kg of dry grapes (Rs. 3.70 crore), 2.25 lakh kg of ghee (Rs.6.88 crore) besides corn grass fodder for the cattle at a cost of Rs. 2.43 crores.Land allocationOther major decisions include allocation of 2.74 acres of land for the extension of the Tirupati railway station on the southern side, introduction of new arjitha sevas like Astadala pada padmaradhana seva at appalayagunta and Sahasra Kalasabhishekam (on every Amavasya) at Kodandarama Swamy temple in Tirupati, take over of the Alagu Mallari Krishna Swamy temple in Sullurpeta besides inclusion of Kakarla multi speciality hospital in its approved list of hospitals for the benefit of its employees and retired staff.

Photo: Special ArrangementIn an encouraging sign of rise in pulses production, the country has seen a gradual rise in the growth rate of pulses output at 2.61 per cent during the last four decades, which has surpassed the growth rate of rice, wheat and all cereals together.Agriculture Ministry data shows that during the last four decades (1970-2010) the production of pulses in the country has witnessed a gradual upward trend and notably, it has more or less remained nearly 18 million tonnes since 2010. Earlier the production hovered around 14-15 million tonnes.In 2013-14, the production touched an all time high of 19.78 million tonnes. However, due to inclement weather in the current season, the pulses production in 2015-16 is likely to stay at 17.30 million tonnes.Figures suggest the growth rate in pulses production during this decade has been at 2.61 per cent, which has been higher than that of rice that stands at 1.59 per cent, wheat at 1.89 per cent and all cereals together at 1.88 per cent.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh in a statement said the development of transgenic pigeonpea and chickpea for resistance against gram pod borer is at an advanced stage at the Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR). Once achieved, this will help boost pulses output further and will go a long way to help the country achieve self sufficiency.IIPR is striving to intensify the breeding programme through both conventional and genomics-enabled crop improvement. It has exclusive focus on development of hybrids in pigeonpea, transgenics against pod borer in chickpea and pigeonpea, high yielding varieties with tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, he said.He said the institute is also working towards bio-intensification of pulse-based cropping systems and resource conservation, mechanisation and minimising post harvest yield loss.Climate risk management and efficient extension models for dissemination of pulse-based technologies for farmers to make the pulse cultivation in the country productive and remunerative are also being worked upon, he added."

At present, harvesting is in full swing in the Valley, especially in Chinnamanur, Uthamapalayam and Palanichettipatti.With no cash flow, procurement price of fine quality paddy has dwindled to Rs. 820 a bag (63 kg), which was Rs. 1,050 a bag during the first cropping season, said S. Azhagumalai of Chinnamanur. Farmers had got 40 bags an acre last year. Now they harvest 50 to 55 bags per acre, he added. In the absence of outstation traders, local traders, mostly middlemen, offer very low procurement price by forming a syndicate.It was a level playground last season as outstation traders competed with local buyers and procured paddy directly from farmers offering better price. Now, arrival of outstation traders has come down sharply as they could not carry large amounts in hand, said S. Pandia Raj of Chinnamanur. Moreover, the farmers expect cash immediately after sale  in the field itself. They neither believe outstation traders nor accept cheque or other mode of payment.We need hefty sum in hand to procure paddy every day. Earlier, I used to lease a rice mill in Theni to convert procured paddy into rice to transport directly to rice market. That too requires huge cash. Carrying huge amount is not advisable now. With no option, we depend on local traders for procurement, said N. Sivaraman, a trader from Thanjavur.A sizable amount seized during the previous election had not been fully refunded. We cannot take risk again, said another outstation trader.Capitalising on the situation, local traders exploit farmers. Ironically, EC norms help middlemen make better profit, leaving both outstation traders and farmers in the lurch.Harvesting is being done on 14,500 acres in Cumbum Valley spreading between Gudalur and Palanichettipatti, three km away from Theni."

Responding to a question on rising prices during the question hour, Mr. Rajender admitted that pulses and edible oils had become dearer. The price monitoring committee under the chairmanship of Chief Secretary has met 12 times during the year, to discuss the issue and decide upon the measures to curb price rise. The Marketing Department purchased 54,277 quintals of onion from within and outside the State and supplied to consumers at Rs. 20 per kg, while 1,831 quintals of red gram was sold through Rythu Bazars and special counters at Rs. 135 per kg.In the current year, over 7,000 raids were conducted and 2,501 cases were booked against black-marketers. A total of 1,250 cases were slapped against fair price shop dealers, and 115 were arrested. A total of 12,961 metric tonnes of paddy and 77,086 metric tonnes of PDS commodities were seized. Raids and arrests of this scale had never happened earlier, he pointed out.Efforts are on to make the State self-sufficient, by improving agriculture yield, the results of which would be out soon, Mr. Rajender said.Members T. Jeevan Reddy and Ajay Kumar Puvvada questioned the price list supplied by the Minister and said rice of super fine quality costs Rs. 46 per kg, as against Rs. 42 as mentioned by the Minister.Answering another question on civil supplies, Mr. Rajender said reforms in the civil supplies include digitisation of ration card data with Aadhaar seeding, generation of dynamic key register, online allocation of food grains, supply-chain management for monitoring the movement of stock, fair price shop automation with ePoS devices, and GPS in all the vehicles carrying the stocks.After successful implementation in Kandukur mandal of Ranga Reddy district, ePoS devices have been installed in fair price shops in the GHMC area, he said. Rationalisation of fair price shops is on the anvil. To another supplementary question, he said the beneficiaries under the Deepam scheme can get the gas filled at any outlet, with subsidy of Rs. 1,650 offered by the government.The connections would be sanctioned on saturation mode, he promised.Three adjournment motions pertaining to drought conditions, wages of workers in industries, and notifications for government jobs raised respectively by members R.

They held their breath for that benign moment that finally came.As the tribal priests descended on the Chilakalgutta hillocks carrying the deity, the Superintendent of Police, Ambar Kishor Jha fired several round from his AK47 into air heralding the arrival of the deity into the village.Carrying a vermilion casket and a bamboo pole wrapped in a red colour sari, considered the deity possessed with magic powers, the priests sprinted towards the altar. The devotees jostled and vied with one another to touch them. The tribal priests  Kokkari Narasimha, Siddaboina Laxman Rao, Siddaboina Munender, Empalli Mahesh and Chanda Babu Rao were the most sought after by the frenzied devotees. The police who had tough time protecting them escorted them to the altar safely.Devotees went into a trance, some hurled fowls into air offering as sacrifice to the deity while many stretched themselves on the muddy road and rolled up to the altar and the tribal priests had to walk over them to reach the alter. Some devotees sprinkled the blood of animals, that were given as sacrifice, on the racing tribal priests and those accompanying them in a show of their reverence.The roar of hundreds of buses carrying pilgrims into the forest was relentless. It was this hour, the devotees look forward when both Sammakka and Sarakka adorn the altar at Medaram village which is believed as most auspicious, hence the unending stream.All through the night, the devotees braving the chill inched forward in serpentine queues to reach the altar. Those who have been waiting for Sammakka too, to arrive have camped in surrounding rice fields and amidst bushes in the forest. Meanwhile, the pilgrims who had fulfilled their vows began to leave the village. The temporary APSRTC bus stand that had come up for the jatara was packed pilgrims on their return journey.The jatara comes to an end on Saturday when the deities will be taken back by the priests.The time when both Sammakka and Sarakka adorn the altar is considered most auspicious"

The experiment has been a success. Besides, vegetables aggregated from Kothamangalam have been a hit with customers at Cochin Shipyards consumer store in the city, he said.Around four to five tonnes of vegetables are sold in the city areas per week by the farmer producer company at present.

Vijayans magnum opus Khasakhinte Ithihasam (The Legend of Khasak), are being resurrected.They will soon adorn the archway leading to the Vijayan Memorial at Thasrak near here. A joint meeting of Vijayan Memorial Committee and the DTPC held here on Thursday evening has decided to install the statues at Thasrak itself. District Collector P. Marikutty presided over the meeting. A move by the DTPC to install them on the premises of Palakkad Fort to add attraction to the historic monument had invited mixed reactions. Vijayans admirers had demanded the installation at Thasrak itself as the agricultural village inspired Vijayan to write the novel. A multi-storeyed memorial building is coming up at Thasrak close to the Njattupura, the rustic building for keeping rice seeds and agricultural implements where the lead character in the novel, Ravi, taught children.The installations will definitely add charm to the village which has turned into a centre of literary pilgrimage in recent years. We are fulfilling a long-cherished dream of Vijayan readers, said K. Abdul Azeez, secretary of the memorial committee. The sculptures were done by eminent artists V.K. Rajan, Jones Mathew, Hochimin, Joseph M. Varghese and Venu in 2013.The memorial will house a literary museum apart from an auditorium and library. Local people say Thasrak formed the setting for Vijayans novel when he stayed there after his sister was appointed at the single-teacher school there in 1956. Unlike the enthusiastic pilgrims, the residents here have very little to say about the magical realism skilfully used by the writer in the novel.The memorial will house a literary museum, auditorium and library"

The government-run age old Anchorage Port and the private-run Deepwater Port being maintained by the Kakinada Seaports Limited (KSPL) have witnessed a plunge in the export activity this year, as compared to the past few years. Though there is no problem of non-availability of material or any technical snag, both the ports witnessed a slowdown in the exports owning to global reasons.The KSPL that registered total cargo handling to the tune of 17.9 million tonnes in the fiscal 2014-15 has slashed its expected cargo handling during the current fiscal to 15.5 metric tonnes. The port, however, is banking majorly on imports, as major chunk of the exports  the foodgrains  is being taken care of by the Anchorage port.Exports are not so encouraging this year. Though the local market is good, the international trade recession is taking its pie from the local exports, observes M. Jacob, general manager of the KSPL. Since rice formed a major part of the basket of commodities being exported from the city, the drop in exports has a cascading effect on the rice market and the farmers are unable to get a fetching price to their produce.The Anchorage Port that is solely dependent on exports with special reference to rice has been feeling the heat this year due to the sudden slowdown in the exports of foodgrains. For the last five years, the exports from this port have been above 30 lakh tonnes and a major chunk of its exports are the rice varieties.Most of the rice from here is being sent to African counties and exporters are getting a betting pricing for the produce in the international market.Now, many players entered the export market and the buyers got a chance to choose the exporter of their choice. Coupled with this trend, the slump in the global market too is contributing to the drop in exports in general and rice exports in particular this year, explains Dantu Surya Rao, chairman of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce."
58f9397ba3d24b0b70c3e1a8,Time for plan to roll out DBT for fertiliser subsidies,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/time-for-plan-to-roll-out-dbt-for-fertiliser-subsidies/article8277546.ece,2016-02-25,"An idle mind is a devils workshop and with our demographic profile of such a large young population, job creation to gainfully employ the youth has to be the most important focus. For that, economic growth is vital and job-intensive sectors need a fillip. This could range from apparel to horticulture.If public money is spent judiciously and creates infrastructure, theres no harm done even if we move beyond the fiscal deficit target. We need to move faster for the sake of those jobs. At the same time, revenue expenditure can be rationalised and I hope recommendations of the Expenditure Management Commission for more effective spending are incorporated in some form.The governments focus on ease of doing business is welcome and a lot has been done to improve business environment. This in turn will create jobs. There are of course bad sheep in every system but dont let one black sheep vitiate the system for everyone else. How to get that balance right is the key and the governments use of IT and digital technologies can help simplify the procedures while catching the black sheep.There is a need to get policy initiatives implemented at the state level not just because investments happen in the states but especially for agriculture. Fifty per cent of our people are dependent on the rural and farming sector. We need to ensure that our farmers feel confident that if they till their fields of two or five acres, they can earn adequate income on a sustainable basis. That is currently not happening. The crop insurance scheme announced recently by the Prime Minister is a good measure and should be rolled out extensively.Take the sugar industry. Because there is a direct organised linkage between farmers and industry, they are much better off and dont depend on the vagaries of the market. Its a separate issue that states use their own price that can be illogically high. The C. Rangarajan Committee had suggested a sensible approach to balance out everyones interests. Farmers may have delayed payments but they are still planting as they get a good return. We must have more agri-produce with processing linkages so that output gets purchased at a pre-determined price.FDI in multi-brand retail (MBR) would actually help rural India from two perspectives. One, we will get access to world-class technology and business practices for the entire supply chain. More importantly, today, the farmer gets 15 to 25 per cent of the retail final price. With FDI in MBR, you reduce the number of middlemen; the farmer should get between 30 to 40 per cent of the final price. So that could double his income. Farmers are intelligent, dont undermine their competence. Give them the money, they know which is the best product for their soil. Getting electricity and roads to villages are also critical for them to be able to move out their produce. Today, using a diesel genset is more expensive than paying the state Rs. 2-Rs.3 a unit.Subsidies are important for agriculture and it is time for a two-year plan to roll out direct benefit transfer (DBT) for all fertiliser subsidies for effective spending.Rural India and agriculture is critical for India. More minimum support price for producers should be considered. We have excess production of rice and wheat such that stocks are rotting in FCI godowns. And we are importing pulses. Now, theres talk of cartelization in Canada and Australia to jack up prices. When India goes to the world market, it buys lakhs of tonnes, so the world inflates prices. Why dont we pay the same thing to our farmer? The government had talked of farmer producer organizations. Its a good idea to bring farmers together so they get better negotiating power with input providers as well as buyers. The APMC Act and others have to be abolished. Some states are not acting on this. The roll out of the e-platform for the national agriculture market should be done quickly. Otherwise mandis will continue to charge 15 per cent of the revenue. Digital technology is helping farmers find better prices but because of these mandi rules and poor infrastructure, they cant move their produce around. The Centre has to push harder to get states to deliver.The author is Chairman, DCM Shriram Ltd."

Bertie Wooster is hitched,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/what-ho-bertie-wooster-is-hitched/article8278616.ece,2016-02-25,"All of us love a little twist in our favourite stories. And when it comes to Pradeep Swaminathans literary debut, Enter Mrs Bertie , a spin-off of PG Wodehouses characters, theres an epic twist indeed. The Director of Finance in BEML Ltd, Swaminathan is an ardent PGW fan who spent much of his childhood in the company of the hapless Bertie Wooster, his butler Jeeves and of course the Empress at Blandings. In his book, Swaminathan decides to get Bertie married off. Reading PGW as a youngster, I often looked up to Bertie as a role model, says Swaminathan. He was a rich guy. When you are young, you want to be rich, not do any work and enjoy the luxuries of life. Then when you grow up, you realise it is a fairytale. It is also boring if you have money but no livelihood. However, I felt bad that poor Bertie would never get married. So I decided Ill write a book where he gets married. It was an enjoyable experience.For non-PGW fans, the book makes an interesting read in first-person narrative, true to PGWs style. Its a fun and engaging attempt to rewrite Berties life with the introduction of Susan Lambert, who is later referred to as Lady Grace Douglas. The book, with classic illustrations and a smooth flow, explores true love while dealing with classic PGW issues.Swaminathan says he told his kids a lot of stories and his wife often asked him to write since he had a strong flair for the narrative. I had a moving incident in South Africa, he says. Johannesburg is known for its crime. We had a blowout on the highway during a trip there. Around eight people got out of a car behind us and I thought it was going to be a hijack or a robbery. But instead they changed the tires for us. So I wrote to Readers Digest and was happy they published it. It received appreciation. I also wrote a piece for The Hindu on a journey to my ancestral home after 50 years. All of this sparked off my interest to write a book. It was a dream I wanted to realise.He draws attention to the change in the narrative, If you notice traditional PGW books, Jeeves always has an upper hand. Bertie is always subservient to Jeeves. But in this book, it is a little different and Bertie has more initiative. The flow came naturally.On the character of Mrs Wooster, Swaminathan emphasises that she is perfect for Bertie. Shes extremely good looking, rich and highly competent and strong: the perfect wife. By the end of the story, Bertie is ready to give up everything to marry her. What is the best takeaway from the book? Pradeep points out that it has got a happy ending.The language and style are not far from PGW. He is an icon in world literature and Im not even a professional author. Im just a big fan. If people are able to see that Im able to come somewhere remotely close to the legend, then it is an achievement in itself.To anyone who is hesitant to take that first step and pen their thoughts, Swaminathan encourages them to just go ahead and write. Dont bother about style. Just write whatever is close to your heart and you feel strongly about, he says.Each of us is unique in our own way. If you are going to run after fame and money, you will be disappointed. But if you write for the love of writing and youre good, things will fall into place.Looking ahead, Swaminathan says this book will be the only PGW offering. There will be no more of PGW from me. Instead, Ive planned to write about a South Indian Brahmin detective. Devoted to curd rice and sambhar, he will be a typical hen-pecked husband but a good detective. Im planning to develop such a character. Lets see how it pans out, he signs off.To request a copy, mail entermrsbertie@gmail.comThere will be no more of PGW from me. Ive planned to write about a South Indian Brahmin detective."

According to latest reports, the male elephant had entered the Nadia district.We tried to tranquillise the tusker. It had strayed into muddy rice fields. Though we arranged for vehicles to bring the animal to the main road, it died after the tranquilisation, a senior forest official told The Hindu .A herd of elephants had strayed into Bardhaman from adjoining Bankura district on Saturday night. The tusker accompanied by another elephant started moving through the paddy fields of Bardhaman, considered the rice bowl of West Bengal.A 19-year-old boy was the first to be attacked by the pachyderm. He sustained major injuries and was being treated at a government hospital. The elephant then attacked and killed two persons, identified as Annakali Roy (62) and Narayan Majhi (69), in Bhatar. From there, the jumbos moved to Manteshwar, killing two more persons, Prakash Goria (45) and Suraj Seth (38).At the Denur village, forest officials attempted to tranquillise the animal. Locals said that after several hours, with the help of chains, vehicles and huge belts, the elephant was driven away from the paddy fields.

Gopalakrishnan said it was sad that the area under pokkali rice cultivation was declining even as Kerala was supporting organic farming. He was inaugurating the fish harvesting programme on Saturday. He said agricultural technologies should be market-oriented so that farmers would benefit.Michael Vedasiromani, managing director, Marketfed; Salini Babu, president of Kadamakkudy grama panchayat; and Sona Jayaraj, district panchayat member, were among those present."
