When the Congress was ruling the State, they only used to give upma' and coffeefor those who came to their party meetings. Till the 80s, parties never had a culture of giving food to its cadres. The party workers never really expected anything, he said.Previously, only booth agents were given food to ensure that the agent didnt leave his place. But now, every cadre is demanding it.When asked how parties manage to ensure food for such a large number of cadres while campaigning, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi general secretary Ravi Kumar said that when he fought for an MLA seat in 2006 elections, the cadres were given a packet of curd rice or sambhar rice. Meat is expensive. Smaller parties like us cannot afford it, he said.Explaining why biriyani has become so important these days, Mr. Ravi Kumar said cadres have to feel reinvigorated because campaigning is tough. Many party workers come from economically weaker sections, so meat is something they prefer, he said.A great comboBut why is meat biriyani such a hit with the cadres? Mariappan, who runs a biriyani shop near Egmore, says, Liquor doesnt go well with dosa or idli. Only biriyani and liquor make for a great combo.In Tamil Nadu, the dish has replaced upma as the flavour of the election season"

Ask anyone, they will say it is Rs.11.The reason is that the poorest people have to bear the cost of carrying the ration to the tribal hamlet on head from Pettimudy to Societykudy  a distance of 18 km on the forest path.Realising their plight, the government had decided to pay the price of carrying the ration rice so as to make it available at Re.1 a kg.However, since February 1, the tribespeople have been bearing the cost as the fund has not been allotted for a year.The Devikulam Girijan Service Society, through which ration rice is supplied, has to be paid over Rs.23 lakh if it is to be given at Re.1.No moneyEdamalakkudy grama panchayat president Govindaraj told The Hindu over phone that there was a famine-like situation in the settlements as the people had no money to purchase the ration rice. The only way of income in the settlements was the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).But, for the past three months, no wages have been given to them, Mr. Govindaraj said adding that the main works undertaken under the scheme were clearing agriculture fields and other farming works in addition to construction of roads. He said the tribespeople purchase only 1 or 2 kg of ration rice as they are penniless.Mr. Govindaraj said the society had informed the panchayat that for a year, the fund for carrying the ration rice had not been received and they were unable to supply rice at Re.1. Mr. Govindaraj said had the MGNREGS fund been allotted to the tribespeople, it would not have rendered them in a famine-like situation. In Edamalakkudy, the cultivation of food crops was stopped over a decade ago as wild animals constantly raided the crops."

Chinna Reddy, N.V.S.S. Prabhakar, A. Revanth Reddy, R. Ravindra Kumar, S. Rajaiah and others pointed out how irregularities and leakages in various schemes were draining the exchequer. They pointed out how the subsidised rice being supplied at Re.1 a kg on food security cards was being diverted and recycled as fine rice and explained how the commercial taxes revenue was being leaked due to corruption at the check-posts.Several Opposition members brought to the notice of the House that it was mostly the ruling party activists and leaders that were getting the implements under farm mechanisation scheme being given at 50 per cent subsidy. They were being sold away later to others. They suggested that the government bring down the subsidy so that only genuine farmers could avail themselves of the scheme.Mr. Chinna Reddy requested the government to allocate Rs.4,250 crore out of Rs.4,675 crore kept at the disposal of the Chief Minister as special development fund for implementing one-time-settlement of crop loan waiver scheme so that farmers could be relieved of debt burden. He suggested appointment of one agriculture extension officer per every 1,000 farmers as per Swaminathan Commission recommendations.Minister for Agriculture Pocharam Srinivas Reddy said it was in the Centres hand to change the crop insurance policy to make it suitable to farmers by taking farmer as a unit and fixing the minimum support price based on the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission to overcome the crisis in the agriculture sector since the State Government was taking up other programmes to help farmers such as soil testing, micro irrigation, and poly house cultivation.Later, the House passed the Demands with a voice vote after the Ministers concerned assured the members of clarifying their doubts, still if any, on meeting individually."

VedhanFarmer incomes were in focus on Saturday when National Commission on Farmers chairman M.S. Swaminathan reviewed the implementation of the recommendations that were submitted nearly 10 years ago.Prof. Swaminathan said technology could only increase yield; it takes public policy to take care of the economics of agriculture.If you want to make farming viable and retain young people, your first goal is to improve the economic viability of farming and substantially increase the net income for farmers, he said, recalling a central concern of the NCF as it went about its work during 2004-2006.His talk, delivered at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, was at an event that saw the launch of the website of the Foundation for Agrarian Studies, a Bangalore-based charitable trust.N. Ram, publisher of The Hindu , chaired the panel, which included Hannan Mollah, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha.Mr. Ram prefaced the session by saying, The NCF recommendations are perhaps the most important intervention in the thinking about Indian agriculture in several decades.In the light of Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys Budget promise to double farmers income in five years, the NCF proposal on fixing minimum support price (MSP) of a crop at the cost of production of that crop plus 50 percent came to be discussed the most.It can be done, but requires a lot of work and action, said Prof. Swaminathan on the possibility of doubling farmer incomes. On his Commissions MSP recommendation, he said, If this single step is accepted, it will make a lot of difference.Mr. Mollah was, however, sceptical of the success of the income objective. Prof. [Swaminathan] mentioned that income will be doubled. How we can we believe it? We have calculated it  for doubling farmer incomes in five years, 14 percent growth is required. With the (current) one-and-a-half percent growth, how will we do it, he asked at a presentation during which he said that it was pre-election propaganda that led to the last Budget adopting a pro-farmer tone.He also talked of how the MSP recommendations of the NCF had led to a nationwide demand by farmers for implementation of the report.He pointed out that there remained a yawning gap between what the NCF set out to achieve and the current status of agriculture in the country. [It] recommended (loans at) four per cent, but actual farmers are taking loans for between 30 and 120 per cent, he saidProf. Swaminathan said, The latest Budget takes some of our recommendations forward. For example, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare: we recommended that the name of the ministry should be changed; the Prime Minister announced this in his August 15 speech. The reason is, we should not focus on productivity alone, but the well-being of the farmer, he said.Prof. Swaminathan dwelt in detail on the pressures of land and income on agriculture. Punjab farmers, at the heartland of the Green Revolution, with an average farm size of 3.79 hectares, growing wheat and rice get an income which is less than the starting salary of a Class Four employee. That is the crisis in Indian agriculture, he added."

A bunch of firms are already setting up their industries in and around the port and the related announcements will be made soon, according to Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd (KPCL) Director and CEO Anil Yendluri.Speaking to The Hindu after flagging off MV Harbour-1 of Neepa Paribahan shipping firm from Bangladesh, the first direct container vessel from the port set to sail to Bangladesh, he said: Several companies are focused on setting up industries in and around the port. For instance, Pennar Industries has set up a plant within our port, using our by-product fly-ash from our power plant and it is all set to export up to two million tonnes of cement soon.A couple of other industries in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and other States are already gearing up to announce their projects, Mr. Anil said.The firms apparently can see huge savings on cost of processing, raw material procurement and export related logistics at Indias largest all-weather deep water port located at Nellore.Huge demand for cementHuge public infrastructure projects in India and neighbouring countries are expected to create huge demand for cement in near future and the industries plan to take opportunity.The A.P-based Vishnu Group is another entity which is moving fast in setting up its industry in close vicinity of Krishnapatnam port. We are setting up a ceramic tile making plant in association with a foreign entity. The investment could be close to Rs.300 crore. Well be announcing the project soon. The idea is to take leverage on logistics and industry environment in the region, said K.V. Vishnu Raju of the Vishnu Group.This apart, several processing industries related to chilly, cotton, rice and shrimp are expected to come up in close proximity to the Krishnapatnam port.

The ASHA workers are not being paid their remuneration regularly, notwithstanding the fact that they are offered peanuts on piecemeal basis.He said the mid-day meal workers, who not only procure rice and other material but also cook and serve them, had been deprived of the paltry monthly remuneration of Rs.1,000 for the past eight months.Ridiculing Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus off-repeated claim that he was implementing developmental agenda, he said in actual practice he was committed to implementing the corporate agenda by suppressing the voice of the working class.Wondering why Mr. Naidu was keeping mum on the plight of the working class and the unorganised sector, he said mostly unemployed youths were opting to take up petty jobs for their survival.Labour laws are not being implemented with the Labour Department declaring that they are there not to enforce enactments, he stated.Mr. Gafoor said there was an undeclared ban on strike by the working class and the unorganised sector, which employs over 1.5 crore people."

Farming was being taken up in the field after over two decades.Though there was pest attack, we managed to control it through traditional methods, without using chemicals, he said. Several valuable lessons learned would guide him in future attempts, he said.The farming was undertaken under a scheme floated by the Agency for Development of Aquaculture Kerala (ADAK). The scheme envisages taking up Pokkali farming and aquaculture successively on the same field.The government has been initiating several measures to promote farming but the relevant information is not getting disseminated to the beneficiaries, Mr.Tharakan said.He lauded the provisions for providing aid to strengthen bunds and other infrastructure to facilitate Pokkali farming. The environment-friendly agricultural practice could also benefit the farmer as Pokkali rice has received geographical indication tag.Mr.Tharakan underlined the need for more technological innovations to help the farmer. There is a need for transplanting and harvesting machines suitable for use in waterlogged areas, he said.Mr. Tharakan was born into a traditional agricultural family. He was one of the 12 children of Thekkanat Parayil Kochu Pappu Tharakan. He became Director General of Police of Kerala in 2003 and head of RAW in 2007."

It is looking to reduce its dependency on mixers and grinders with their revenue contribution coming down to 50 per cent.Preethi, a popular brand in the South Indian market, was acquired by Philips during 2011. Since then, it has had access to Philips know-how, its marketing muscle and its global reach satiating Preethis export appetite.Rupendra Yadav, Preethi Kitchen Appliances CEO said: Our revenues from mixers and grinders will continue to be strong, while we expand the share of the other products from 25 to 50 per cent of our revenues. Currently, we have 14 products in our basket and are exploring opportunities by bringing in variants of existing products. We will enter geographic areas that have a large South Indian population.Mr. Yadav said that going forward exports would be the area of focus. Currently, exports account for five to seven per cent of revenue and Preethis target is to more than double that revenue share.Preethi Kitchen Appliances exports its products to the Middle East, the U.S., Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Canada and Singapore. Plans are on to enter other South East Asian countries.The market size of kitchen appliances in the South is estimated to be Rs.2,700 crore and Rs.8,200 crore nationally. In Tamil Nadu, Preethi has a 23 per cent market share.During January-December 2015, we gained 1.2 per cent market share, 2 per cent in Southern market and 3.2 per cent in Tamil Nadu.

In recent weeks, the woodcutters were found to be carrying cash less than Rs.100 each.In the small hours of Friday, the Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (RSASTF) personnel nabbed two woodcutters - Chellappa and Kumar (both aged 40) of Krishnagiri District of Tamil Nadu - near Chandragiri railway station close to Seshachalam Hills, while eight others had fled.The party was on its way to the hills, carrying axes, machetes and provisions. After alighting from Katpadi-Tirupati passenger at Chandragiri railway station, the woodcutters collected rice and other provisions kept ready at a bushy location nearby, before being caught.For better educationSpeaking to The Hindu , Chellappa said that he was from Oominuru village of Krishnagiri District. ""I have a daughter doing Plus Two in a private college at Krishnagiri. I too want good English education for my daughter. Now, there is pressure from the college management to clear a fee of Rs. 30,000. I did a mistake by sending her to a private college. Where can I go? I was told I could clear it in just two trips (to Seshachalam). I also want to join my second child in a private school. Our children are forced to become dull students in government schools, particularly in remote areas,"" he said.Childrens wishAnother woodcutter Kumar of Kottavur village of the same district said that his children were not willing to go to government schools. ""Just like any other rich child, my kids want to study in a private school with good teaching in English. If I can't fulfil their genuine wish, I will be a failure as a father and I can't show my face to my wife.

Bali and Lombok are for those who like the idea of time as a flexible conceptPhotos: Special arrangement and Charukesi Ramadurairom where Im staying, at Nusa Dua, Ubud is a long way off. But, if a bestselling author could eat and pray her way all the way from America to Ubud, I can do this two-hour drive. So I am off to Ubud, the heart of Bali, which throbs with art and culture, and sometimes staggers under the weight of it as well.The green and striking rice terraces at Tegalalang are my first impression of Ubud. But these are nowhere close to the ones just outside town, which grace every other picture postcard sent out from Bali. I make do with this watered-down version, given my limited time.In a complex system of agriculture, much of the hillsides in Bali have been cut into elegant terraces to control water flow to the paddy fields through various canals and tunnels. And now, some of these terraces are Unesco-listed and tourist attractions in their own right.Ubud market, our next destination, is a riot of colours with the main street lined with posh boutiques, snooty art galleries and kitschy souvenir shops. Most shop-owners ignore me, recognising me for what I am: a browser, a window shopper, a sneerer. Not so at the crowded main market, where I go with the intention of buying gifts for people back home. This market is a warren of bargain-basement shops with shopkeepers falling over themselves to offer you the best prices, even if not always the best quality.I bargain with one of them for flamboyant batik shirts for the unsuspecting husband back home. How many you want? he asks. One husband, one shirt, I say. He laughs and gives me a hefty discount; he then invites other shopkeepers into the joke. This ready smile, easy demeanour is what I come to love about Bali. And it is everywhere on the island, not just along the beaches where the sun, sand and surf provide millions of visitors every year a multitude of reasons to smile.Bali is the only Hindu-majority region in Indonesia, a fact underlined by the profusion of statues on every street intersection, beginning right by the airport. Every character I remember from childhood stories seems to have been immortalised in stone: Garuda with Vishnu, Ghatotkacha battling Karna, Bhima and Arjuna, and even one of Vali (for that is where the islands name comes from), all imposing, white, and shining in the bright tropical sunshine.Then there are the temples in this Island of the Gods: from small ones in front of homes to fancy village temples meant for the entire community, to the more popular touristy ones like the one at Uluwatu.Everything is still at Pura Luhur Uluwatu temple when we get thereh: there is an evening ceremony going on, with locals in white silently circumambulating the sanctum sanctorum. Its location is dramatic  its perched on a cliff top  and so I wait patiently for photo-ops of the temple silhouetted against the molten gold of the sunset.I miss the Kecak dance at Uluwatu, but the next morning, at the Barong dance performance, I see an explosion of colourful masks and elaborate costumes. Tigers dance, monkeys prance, and mythical monsters exude meanness on stage, even as Kunti and Sahadeva battle against evil in their own way (this is the first time I have heard of this particular Pandava playing a lead role in a story).A different musicHaving avoided the beaches in Bali, I am determined to do the same later on the island of Lombok. In Lombok, the general trend has been for Gunung Rinjani, Indonesias second-highest volcano, to erupt once every 12 years, the latest as recent as October last year. However, no such eruptions have ever happened between the predominant Muslim community and the minority Balinese Hindus here. Lomboks Pura Lingsar temple, in fact, attracts followers of not just Hinduism but also of Wektu Telu, Lomboks unique take on Islam.Lombok certainly marches to a different music all of its own. Here, there are no complaints about traffic and pollution, and swimwear and sarongs dont pass for acceptable daywear, as in Bali. Also, there are no karaoke bars lining the streets, belting out loud music, or massage parlours offering relaxing Balinese massages.I enjoy the spectacular sunrises and sunsets on Kuta beach, a contrast to Balis overcrowded and tourist Kuta. This difference defines Lombok, at the cusp of overdevelopment, but determined not to become another Bali.In those few days, I try Indonesian food: gado-gado salad, along with apologetic vegetarian versions of their curries and soups. But I shy away from what my guide slyly calls Cat-Poo-Chino: kopi luwak, the most expensive coffee in the world. Although Ive heard paeans to its taste, I cannot bring myself to try something that has been through the digestive tract of a civet. Yet, it is considered a delicacy, a luxury. There is no accounting for tastes, I suppose.Talking of tastes, Bali and Lombok are definitely for those who like the idea of time as a flexible concept. I find that on these islands, an hour can easily stretch to a few, a drink to a bottle, a smile to a conversation. And what better way to live?On these islands, an hour can easily stretch to a few, a drink to a bottle, a smile to a conversation"

They brought to the notice of the Minister the assurance of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu at a public meeting at Sankaram at Mee Intiki Mee Bhoomi programme that all restrictions on transport of black jaggery would be lifted.Two major instancesof seizureThe Minister assured the MLAs that if proper bill, market committee cess receipt, buyers name and destination were carried transportation would be allowed.According to traders, during the last few months two major instances of seizure by Excise officials occurred. A vehicle carrying four to five tonnes of jaggery was seized near Yanam and an FIR was booked. Near Rajamahendravaram too, seven tonnes of jaggery was seized and a case was booked. At Ponnur in Guntur district, Excise officials asked traders to maintain a list of persons to whom the jaggery brought from the other districts was sold, take a photo of the vehicle which transported it etc and get the stock verified next day.Citing the problems, the Anakapalle Merchants Association now wants a GO to be issued. Let a GO be issued specifying the conditions. It was done earlier during the tenure of NTR and Mr. Chandrababu Naidu. Displaying the copies of the GO we will take up transportation so that no harassment is faced from the Excise officials, says association president Korukonda Venkata Sarat.It is estimated that black jaggery accounts for about 20 per cent of the stock, about 10,000 tonnes valued at Rs.20 crore, at the Anakapalle market yard.Trade circles also point out that to some extent the colour of jaggery depends on soil conditions and to improve the colour chemicals are used. Bleaching agent sodium hydrogen sulphide, popularly known as hydros, is used to improve the colour but sometimes beyond the limits.MLC from North Andhra Graduates Constituency M.V.S. Sarma says even fine jaggery or rice fermentation can be used for making illicit liquor.He represented the problems faced by farmers and traders to the Excise Minister after some farmers came to the Assembly.Excise officials cannot harass farmers or traders because jaggery is a raw material for illicit distillation. It can be obtained from anywhere. It is the task of food safety inspectors to test whether it is edible or not.The concentration of the Excise officials should be on those resorting to illicit distillation, Mr. Sarma says.Displaying the GO copies, we will take up transportation so that no harassment is faced from officialsKorukonda Venkata SaratPresident, Anakapalle Merchants Association"

Photo: AFPAt the top of Vietnams Fansipan Mountain, throngs of giddy tourists wielding selfie sticks jostle for a photograph on the once-remote peak in the Sapa region, famed for its breathtaking views across undulating rice terraces.Getting to the top traditionally takes a two-day trek but these days most visitors opt for a 20-minute ride by cable car instead  the latest flashy tourist attraction to heighten concerns over rapid development destroying Sapas natural beauty.Rapid developmentKnown by some as the Tonkinese Alps, the former French outpost has seen a tourism boom in recent years with a new highway from the capital and hotels popping up at breakneck pace.If more and more building (happens), then one day we will lose Sapa, we wont have any more mountain, said guide Giang Thi Lang, from the Black Hmong ethnic group.Vietnams tourism industry has taken off in recent years, especially among domestic visitors with growing appetites and budgets for travel.The country has also become a draw for foreign visitors turning their backs on better-known Southeast Asian destinations such as Thailands Chiang Mai, seeking instead a road less travelled.But some lament the commercialisation of Vietnamese treasures, with reports of locals complaining about multi-course meals served in Ha Long Bays famous caves, or trash-strewn beaches in the resort town of Phu Quoc.Visitor numbers have snowballed too, reaching around 700,000 last year, and revenues have more than tripled since 2010 to $50 million.Part of that growth is thanks to the cable car  the longest of its kind in the world according to operators which opened in February with the capacity to ferry 2,000 people to the top of the mountain daily.Its good for Sapa when they can attract more tourists... and we have a big number of the local people that can find jobs, said Nguyen Van Manh, deputy director of Sapas Tourist Information Centre, adding that the sector provided employment to thousands.But some locals tell a different story.Before the cable car, there were more porters from the village with regular work, said trekking guide Ma A Tro from Fansipans summit, where he had just led a two-day trip.Now with the cable car there, village residents no longer have jobs, mostly becoming freelance construction workers.Some tourists also say Sapa is losing its appeal, with Fansipans picturesque summit replaced by concrete steps, souvenir shops and still-under-construction temples.A tad artificial?I imagined I would come to the top and it would be really natural, but its developed here, so for me its a bit disappointing, said trekker Duong Hoang Minh, who hiked to the top of the 3,143-metre peak.Most tourism operators agree the boom has brought much-needed development  roads, schools and clinics, for example  to a region where the majority of the population belong to one of Vietnams 53 ethnic minorities, who have traditionally lagged behind the rest of the country.But without sustainable growth Sapa risks shooting itself in the foot, said Hubert de Murard, manager of the Topas Ecolodge about 18 kilometres from Sapa town.Mr. de Murard worries that some investments have been short-sighted, aimed at maximising the number of visitors.For a natural destination like here, with a preserved environment, this would not really be good, Mr. de Murard added.

A light diet, with plenty of seasonal fruits, would be best to combat heat exhaustion. The department has said that those who habitually work in the sun, like farm labourers or masons, should drink plenty of water even if they did not feel thirsty.

58f98c50a3d24b0b70c4077a,"Budget slashes social sector spends, say activists",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/budget-slashes-social-sector-spends-say-activists/article8387727.ece,2016-03-23,"The Movement of Right to Live, an advocacy group comprising grassroots activists working in the social sector, on Tuesday slammed state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwars budget for making inadequate investments in social services and security, and drastically cutting down the spends on the social sector in a state impacted by four consecutive droughts, and simultaneously making a substantial 43 per cent increase in the urban development sector.The activists said spending cuts on the social sector  ranging from 13 per cent on health to 62 per cent in nutrition  was a worrying trend, particularly in the light of the Centre devolving certain welfare responsibilities to states and giving them a larger share from its tax kitty, as per the 14{+t}{+h}Finance Commissions recommendations.Abhay Shukla of Jan Arogya Abhiyan said the fine print of the budget document showed that the share of social services in the revised budgetary estimates has been reduced from 4.85 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product in 201516 to 4.29 per cent in 201617. The provision for health has been cut by 13 per cent from 12,015 crore in revised estimates 2015-16, to Rs 10472 crore in 201617, which means a reduction by a whopping Rs 1543 crore. He said that the National Health Mission appeared to be impacted by the cuts, with its allocation reducing from Rs 3142 crore in 201416 to Rs 2067 crore and central assistance to critical national programmes like tuberculosis, vector-borne diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental health, blindness, and leprosy appear to be slashed from Rs 215 crore to Rs 93 crore.Mr Shukla said the crucial nutrition sector has received the unkindest cut, with the allocation for Women and Child Development slashed by 62 per cent in 201617 compared to the present year: Given the serious problem of malnutrition in Maharashtra and prevailing drought situation in many parts of the state, actually the state Government should have substantially increased the budget for Integrated Child Development Scheme in the coming year. However the opposite has been done.He said the ICDS budget has been slashed from Rs 3568 crore in 201516 revised estimates to Rs 1340 crore in 201617. Maharashtra has a total of over one lakh anganwadis , and such a reduction will virtually sound the deathknell for anganwadis. . Next years budget appears to be moving towards starvation of the nutrition programme! Activist Ulka Mahajan of Anna Adhikar Abhiyan said that the allocation for food security subsidy has been increased 18 per cent from Rs 1527 crores in 201516 to Rs 1806 crores, But the government had talked about universal public distribution and bringing Above Poverty Line beneficiaries under the ambit of Food Security Act (FSA) in 14 drought-affected districts. It is not clear if this amount would be adequate to support comprehensive implementation of the FSA in Maharashtra. (Chief Minister Fadnavis had promised rice at Rs 2 per kg and wheat at rs 3 per kg to stem the spiralling farmer suicides in August 2015.)Ravi Duggal of Jan Arogya Abhiyan and Amit Narkar of National Centre for Advocacy Studies pointed out that the data till March 17 this year indicated that there was critical under-spending in social sectors during the 201516 period. Duggal said, The spend on rural development is only 62 per cent, on healthcare it is 73%, and for education it is 83% of the amounts allocated. Swaccha Bharat Abhiyan might be the flagship programme of the government, but Maharashtra has spent only 44 per cent of the budget on water supply and sanitation. Mr Narkar added that the budget fine print also revealed that the government had a huge backlog of Rs 45000 crore in uncollected taxes, largely from the corporate sector, which could easily cover social sector requirements. The government said it allocated Rs 25,000 crore for agriculture. In reality the budgetary provision for agriculture and allied activities is reduced by Rs 1677 crore or nearly 10 per cent compared to last year."

They queued up and stepped out in the sun holding placards reflecting one message  save sparrows.The rally, organised by Ilampiraikal , a non-governmental organisation, highlighting the need to save the sparrow population on the occasion of World Sparrow Day, had students of Dhanalakshmi Higher Secondary School marching through the roads of Royapuram to spread the message.Twelve-year-old E. Arulmozhi, a class VII student of the school, said: When I visit my hometown Uthiramerur, I wake up to the sound of sparrows. Here in the city, I am woken up by the noise of cars and motorcycles. This should stop. Hence, we have come together to do our bit.Her friend, R. Mythili, said she keeps a bowl of water or wasted millets or rice on the terrace for sparrows. It is just an attempt. Invariably, it is the crows that come to eat the grains, she adds.Ameer Rahman of Ilampiraikal said it was high time steps were taken to improve the sparrow population in the city. They have started disappearing not only because of the radiation from the cell phone towers but also because of increased deforestation. Spreading the message among children is important because just reading about them will not be enough. They have to take some steps like keeping water or feeding them with millets or rice, he added."

Vizag, known as Andhras Tourism Capital, and hailed as India's second best beach destination next to Goa, lacks a direct train from Goa, says Rama Rao.There is only one train (18048/Amaravati Express), that too, four times a week with hardly any berth quota (as the train originates in Howrah). It is high time a direct Super Fast train is introduced between the two beautiful tourist cities.If that is not possible, then South Central Railway (SCR) should consider extending 17225 BZA - Hubli Amaravati Express till Vasco-Da-Gama on one side and Vizag on the other.Such a move will connect all the three regions North Andhra, Coastal AP and Rayalaseema to Goa, he says.I travelled by Yatragenie bus from Vizag to Hyderabad along with my wife and daughter, as we couldnt get reserved accommodation by train. The service on the multi-axle AC bus was good. The bus left Visakhapatnam at 6 p.m. and reached Himayat Nagar by 6 a.m. on the following day. It took another one-and-a-half hour to reach Ameerpet.The best part was that the bus stopped at a restaurant, about 20 km before Rajahmundry. We were served hygienic and piping hot food that was not a pinch on the pocket. A pack of fried rice for Rs. 130 was enough for two persons.Another passenger, who had travelled by an RTC Super Luxury bus from Vizag to Tirupati, on March 27, had a different experience.The bus journey was comfortable but the food at the RTC Complex at Vijayawada was very bad that night.The driver and conductor of the bus came and sat down at the table and ordered food and when there was no response from the counter clerk even after 10 minutes, the driver walked out of the complex had something at a hotel across the road.The passengers could not risk going out of the complex, lest they miss the bus. Seeing the attitude of the canteen staff, the passenger wanted to play safe and asked for curd rice.He was given a plate of curd rice. The curd rice was tasteless and was cold. The passenger reluctantly consumed the food otherwise he had to go hungry till the bus reached Tirupati the next morning.Reporting by B. Madhu Gopal"

Restaurants are changing rapidly. Judging by current trends, in a decade, the whole posh restaurant experience, complete with the snooty matre d', starched tablecloths and fastidious multi-course menus, may be irrelevant. Expect them to be replaced by a whole range of new dining options, helmed by edgy experimental spaces that put a contemporary, and responsible, spin on tradition.Kickstarter is an interesting space to watch this unfold. Right now, the website, which describes itself as a global community built around creativity, has about 434 live food projects. Looking through them throws up a definite trend: people are increasingly interested in creating and funding food that is good for you and the planet.From Pittsburgh, Harvest Delivery is a sustainably-driven local food distribution company. From Las Vegas, Bootleg Botanicals encourages people to handcraft their own organic, gluten-free, non-GMO, vegan-friendly ginger beer. And then, theres the PieLab, which in true hipster style describes itself as a (and I quote) Neutral Place + A Slice of Pie = Conversation = Ideas + Design = Positive Change.In an attempt to get some clarity on the trend, I chase down Ben Reade, a cheerful young Scottish chef I met a couple of years ago at a Slow Food Asia Pacific conference in South Korea, where he spoke about insects as a food source for a sustainable future. Then, at 27, Ben was the head of culinary research and development at Nomas test kitchen, the Nordic Food Lab. This made him one of the culinary stars of the event, not just because trendy Copenhagen-based Noma had been ranked as the worlds best restaurant for three years running by then, but also because its chef, Rene Redzepi, was changing the way people looked at food world-over with his single-minded focus on local, often foraged, ingredients.I manage to catch Ben on a crackly FaceTime call before dinner service, and post farm visits at his new restaurant in Scotland. Well, I use the word restaurant loosely, because its hard to define Ben and his partner Sashana Souza Zanellas Edinburgh Food Studio in one word. He describes it as a cutting-edge environment where the arts, the sciences, and food collide. A creative space for collaboration, experiments, and learning, he says. It is a restaurant on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, where we host guest chefs and primary producers. We have them collaborate with poets, philosophers, and other creative people. For the rest of the week, they have classes, tastings and lessons in specialist areas.People are bored with just going out for dinner to a restaurant, where they pick what they want off a menu. Theres no personality, no real interaction. Today, people want stories, they want background, they want to support something bigger and wider. His views are supported by the enthusiasm their Kickstarter project, launched in September 2015, generated. We asked for 10,000 (British) pounds and got it in three days. We have become a kind of textbook example of crowd-funding, not because of the amount of money, but the speed with which we raised it. They ended up with 17,000 pounds. The restaurant opened for bookings in November, less than two months later.The studios focus is to discover and record the best of Scottish food. People associate Scotland with black pudding, haggis and deep-fried Mars bars, but we actually have an incredible dairy history, with amazing milk-based desserts. Ben adds with a chuckle, We have found scarlet elf cup mushrooms, which have such psychedelic colours that people often think they are going to start hallucinating when they eat them.He adds, Now that spring is coming, we see wild edibles like yarrow, baby nettles and bitter cresses. Our meat is wild. Last weekend, we served wood pigeon, Scottish rabbits and venison. We also try and use rare breeds of animals, like Shetland mutton, which comes from a great old breed of sheep.Ben started out as a dishwasher, before going to culinary school in Ireland, after which he cooked his way through England, Scotland, Italy and France. Interestingly, his moms cooking was heavily influenced by India. My parents were vegetarian, and they spent a lot of time living in ashrams, so there was quite a profound Indian connection. Some of my earliest memories are of sitting on the floor at home on Indian night, eating rice and dal. When Ben and Sashana decided to begin the Edinburgh Food Studio, they confess they had no definite plan. Sashana says they cherry-picked ideas from all across the world to create a space that was fluid, yet welcoming. The four-course dinners are a real-time creative response to seasonal ingredients, so there is no set menu. Its about opening peoples eyes to how much there is around us. So much more than stereotypical potatoes, haggis and turnips.The response, to their surprise, has been overwhelmingly positive, says Ben. We werent sure if people were ready. We thought it may be a bit too avant-garde. Then said, Lets push it in their faces, and if they dont like it, we will turn it into a cafe  and serve coffee and pastry, he chuckles. Fortunately, customers today are more open-minded than ever before  and they seem to love the drama. Psychedelic elf cup mushroom served with marinated rabbit versus cappuccino and chocolate cookies: what would you choose?"

Photo: C. VenkatachalapathyA fast food outlet, a vegetable stall and salon that are part of Vellore Central Prison's Freedom Bazaar have been shut since March 26 amid allegations that jail staff colluded with inmates to swindle some of the receipts.The Prison Bazaar, located opposite the prison campus at Thorapadi, was an initiative meant to help reform and rehabilitate prisoners.With affordable rates, the bazaar's units were a big draw among locals in and around Thorapadi.The food outlet, which offered noodles, fried rice and other fast food and functioned during the evening hours, had had a good flow of customers.The lure of a quick buck at the cash based outlets is believed to have led to some prison staff fudging accounts and swindling money, according to prison sources.It was a seizure of cash during a vigilance raid that blew the lid off the malpractice. In the month of November last year, the vigilance wing of the Prison Department conducted a raid and seized cash of about Rs. 30,000 kept hidden in the bazaar's ironing and tailoring units. Prison sources said that an inquiry revealed that there was a nexus between prison staff and inmates working at the bazaar.There was a practice of under billing, a prison official, who did not wish to be identified said.So, instead of maintaining account for 100 tokens, they showed sales for 50 tokens to misappropriate the money, the official said.A senior official of the Prison Department, Vellore range, however, said the units at the bazaar had been closed for a revamp.We have temporarily closed the bazaar to take up renovation work, he said, without elaborating. Prison sources said the facilities housing the units were relatively new and not in immediate need of any renovation. Except for the tailoring and clothes ironing unit, all other outlets have been shut. Even the tailoring unit will function until all pending orders are completed, prison officials said. Boards have been put up at the bazaar saying that the saloon and restaurant have been temporarily closed for maintenance work.The bazaar was conceptualized to provide an opportunity for the reformation and rehabilitation of prisoners. A part of the money earned went as wages for the prisoners and was deposited in a bank account, while the rest was utilised for the development of prison industries.Prison department sources said that the units have been closed to prevent any kind of corrupt activities in the future.Prison sources said an inquiry revealed there was a nexus between prison staff and inmates"

The study was undertaken on the basis of reports on the positive effect of unripe jackfruit for diabetes and it was carried out under an initiative funded by the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation to commercially exploit freeze-dried unripe jackfruit.Some of the patients who used unripe jackfruit daily were able to reverse the situation to pre-diabetes condition, said James Joseph, an entrepreneur promoting the use of freeze-dried raw jackfruit.The patients who used up to 30 grams of freeze dried unripe jackfruit daily were able to eliminate wheat and rice from their daily diet and also overcome weight gain problems.According to the study, 30 grams of dehydrated unripe jackfruit replaced a cup of cooked rice or two wheat chapatis and also offered much higher level of being satiated or the feeling of being full, eliminating the need for snacks. The study showed that glycemic load (glucose level) in unripe jackfruit is almost half that of rice or wheat. This is the reason why unripe jackfruit helps reverse the diabetic condition.Sydney Universitys Glycemic Index Research Service is considered one of the best in the world for Glycemic Index (GI) studies recommended by the Glycemic Index Foundation.The Centre has tested sugar value of more than 3,500 foods. The study on unripe jackfruit was conducted between January and February 2016 as per the internationally recognised GI methodology approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of University of Sydney."

The entire rice is purchased by the wardens without calling for a tender, said a Student JAC leader.The rice is reportedly procured from the Visakhapatnam Cooperative Central Stores in supermarket at different prices. While the rice is procured at the rate of Rs. 28 per kg for the Arts and Commerce (boys) and Science hostel for boys, it is procured at Rs. 36 per kg for the remaining three hostels.The student JAC members allege that a survey done by them in the rice market has suggested that the market price of the Rs. 28 variety is Rs. 25 and for the Rs. 36 variety it is Rs. 32. They allege that the rice is procured from the open market and fictitious bills of the supermarket are produced.However, supermarket officials confirmed to The Hindu that they do not have any variety in the range of Rs.28 and Rs. 36. All our varieties range between Rs. 45 and Rs. 55, said an official.This aspect needs to be investigated and moreover, the mess bill for boys Arts and Commerce and Science hostels was pegged at Rs. 2,400 per month and we are fed the Rs.28 variety, while for the other three hostels the rice rate is Rs.36 per kg, when the mess bill comes to about Rs.1,900 per month. The question is of discrimination, said a student.When this was brought to the notice of Registrar V. Umamaheswara Rao by a section of the media, he agreed to the lack of a tendering system and the sub-standard rice being fed and assured to look into the matter.What the warden has to say:According to Chief Warden Prof. Viswanadham, there has been no tendering system since last 25 years and the rice is being procured from the supermarket, since then. We have negotiated with the supermarket to keep the rice pegged at Rs. 28 per kg since last five years, he said.According to Prof. Viswanadham, the university had tried e-tendering in 2015, but it failed as the rates quoted were higher.We have to balance between the funds available and the scholarships of the students. The Arts students get Rs. 672 per month, whereas the research scholars get Rs. 25,000 per month. And that is why the Arts and Science students are fed Rs. 28 variety and the research scholars are fed Rs.46 per kg variety, he said."

This is considered a bumper harvest, considering the fact that just 12 lakh tonnes was produced in the district last year.Till a week ago, paddy farmers had no complaints as they were getting a reasonably good price for their produce in the market.But as the prices dropped all of a sudden, farmer leaders and associations started demanding market intervention by government agencies to enable purchase of paddy at minimum support price (MSP).Traders and millers were blamed for the sudden drop in the market price, considering the fact that the crisis cropped up only after huge quantities of harvested paddy began arriving in the last few days. We are expecting nearly 15 lakh tonnes of paddy harvest in April alone. Farmers will be saved if a minimum of 6 lakh tonnes is purchased at MSP, said Ch. Koti Reddy, president of the Nellore District Farmers Association.The farmers are now a worried lot as the market price has come down, and has been ranging between Rs. 2,500 and Rs. 4,500 per tonne since the past one week for different varieties of paddy.In view of this, they have stopped selling their produce in the open market and prefer to wait for some more time.Considering the widening demand-supply gap and falling prices, the district administration has opened paddy purchase centres at nearly 81 centres all over the district to offer MSP to the farmers.The farmer leaders say that purchases began at just four to five centres and other centres are yet to become active due to various technical reasons. There is a demand for opening nearly 160 paddy purchase centres so that it would meet the requirements of the farmers this season.The farmer leaders and peoples organisations are demanding that the government remove inter-State and intra-State restrictions for movement of paddy to enable farmers get a better price in the market. Also, the problem of tenant farmers should be addressed effectively to ensure a fair deal.General secretary of BJP State unit S. Suresh Reddy demanded that free movement of paddy be made effective immediately to solve the problems of the farmers. He also wanted the district officials to make sure that the farmers were supplied enough bags. The tenant farmers should also not face any problem from village-level officials in getting certificates to bring their produce to the purchase centres, he said.Mr. Suresh Reddy alleged that rice millers formed a syndicate and colluded with the officials to deny a good price to the farmers this season."

The accused were identified as Pabbila Malesh, Palle Narasimha, Kuthuru Sudhakar Reddy and a former employee Kompelli Shankar and another accomplice. Dandempally Lakshman hatched the conspiracy to loot the house of the mill owner Julakanti Indra Reddy.In their confessional statement, the accused told the police they had made a futile attempt to burgle the house on March 26. Since the employees were closely observing the financial transactions of the mill owner, they came to know that a huge amount of cash was kept at the home of Mr.Indra Reddy.While Mallesh and Narasimha remained outside the house, Sudhakar Reddy and Lakshman entered the house of Mr. Indra Reddy wearing masks in the wee hours of Friday.Threatening to kill, Sukanya, wife of Mr.Indra Reddy, the accused decamped with the cash. The accused kept the stolen amount at Danepally Lakshmans house located at Kathalguda near Nalgonda. All the five accused were produced before the media."

File Photo: K.R. DeepakThe funds allocated for mid-day meal scheme, a Centrally-sponsored programme, to provide nutritional support to poor children attending school have not been fully utilised.The Comptroller and Auditor General, in its report for the year ended March 2015, said the performance audit of the implementation of the scheme in the State covering the period 2010-15 (four years in combined State and one year in AP) said there was no proper approach to assess the actual ground level requirement.It noted that the unutilised funds ranged from Rs.239.83 crore in 2012-13 to Rs.402.32 crore in 2013-14. Unutilised funds under the various components of the scheme ranged from 13-73 per cent.The government declared 123 mandals as drought-hit in 2013-14 and 460 mandals in 2011-12. One of the key objectives of the scheme is to provide nutritional support to children in drought-affected areas during summer vacation.The CAG report said that a test-check revealed that mid-day meal was not provided to children during summer vacation in the drought-affected areas. With no reliable data, the State government obtained financial assistance for construction of over 31,000 schools while the actual requirement is in 29,276 schools under Phase I itself. The government obtained sanction for another 13,103 schools under Phase II, it said.The average number of students who availed themselves of mid-day meal was also excessively projected and this resulted in excess allotment of 3,825 tonnes of rice at a cost of Rs.2.18 crore during 2010-15 in the four districts that were checked.The School Education Department paid Rs.57 crore during 2010-14 towards cost of food grains to the FCI but these quantities were not received by the department, exposing absence of control mechanism.

The report covered the five-year from 2010 to 2015.As against the requirement of Rs. 1,209.86 crore for preparation and serving of meals projected as serviced from 2010-15, an expenditure of Rs. 940.14 crore was incurred by the State towards cost of food grains and cooking. Inflated figures on children availing the scheme has led to excess requisition of 9,247 MT of rice and its subsequent allocation by the Government of India in three test checked districts  Adilabad, Nalgonda and Warangal alone.Meals were being prepared in open spaces or dilapidated rooms in the sampled schools, it said, adding that 21 to 81 per cent schools in the test checked districts had no water facility while 66 to 90 per cent had no kitchen-cum-stores. As against the envisaged construction of 30,014 kitchens in two phases, only 5,592 units were completed.The CAG report also said that no proper mechanism was in place to maintain vital data like the number of children availing the scheme despite the fact that the numbers assume significance in terms of assessment of funds required for food grains, cooking gas among others.The report said 83 to 94 per cent of children were covered between 2010-15, but the scheme has not shown any positive impact on education indicators with the enrolment in those schools registering a decreasing trend. Dropout rate of students at the elementary level was above 26 per cent during 2010-14. There was also no assessment of improvement of nutritional status of children except conducting general health check-ups."

PHOTO: AFPAs leaders from more than 50 countries are set to discuss measures to prevent nuclear terrorism, the U.S. said the battlefield deployment of nuclear weapons by Pakistan was an enhanced threat though it has taken several other measures to prevent nuclear material from falling into the hands of terrorists.Senior U.S. officials, briefing journalists on the agenda and expected outcomes of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit, however, said the risks of nuclear terrorism have been substantially reduced over recent years, thanks to measures taken by various governments and agencies, including Pakistan.Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be leading the Indian delegation to the summit. Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif cancelled his trip to the U.S. capital following the terrorist attack in Lahore on Easter Sunday.Deeper cooperationLaura Holgate, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director at the National Security Council, said the U.S. was looking at Mr. Modis presence as a chance to highlight steps that India has taken in its own nuclear security to go beyond, perhaps, some of the activities that it has done before.We really would like to see an even deeper bilateral cooperation with India proceed going forward out of the summit, she said.Rose Gottemoeller, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, said forward deployment of nuclear weapons enhances the risks.Our concerns regarding the continuing deployment of battlefield nuclear weapons by Pakistan relate to a reality of the situation: When battlefield nuclear weapons are deployed forward, they can represent an enhanced nuclear security threat, she said.We found this lesson ourselves out in Europe during the years of the Cold War. And so I do think that that is a reality of the situation. Its not related particularly to any one country. Wherever battlefield nuclear weapons exist, they represent particular nuclear security problems, the Under Secretary said.Pakistan continues to reject repeated U.S. calls to hold back its deployment of tactical nuclear weapons.Ms Gottemoeller, however, added that the U.S. has a very solid cooperation with Pakistan on nuclear security. They have developed their own Nuclear Security Center of Excellence in recent years. It has quite a mature capability now. We continue to work with them on the nuclear security front, she said.The U.S. officials did not elaborate the nature of the deeper bilateral relations that it sought with India and the further measures it expected India to take. Ill let India speak for itself on those points. Were eager to work with any country who wishes to work with us to improve nuclear security, Ms. Holgate said.Doval meets RiceMeanwhile, Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval met U.S. National Security Advisor Susan E. Rice on Tuesday.Ambassador Rice and NSA Doval exchanged views on the terrorist threat posed by ISIL [Islamic State] in the region and the importance of combating the ideology that fuels such groups, a White House statement said."

Some of their co-accused are local men with suspected Maoist links and, hence, it is imperative that the State police go there and question them urgently, says DIG, Intelligence, P. Vijayan, who heads the Kerala Police Anti-Narcotic Team.A team led by SP, Palakkad, Debesh Kumar Behera and Dy.SP M. P. Mohanachandran is scheduled to visit the prisons. Their main job will be to cultivate local sources, collect information on smuggling routes, methods, couriers, and cultivators, their financial and political backers, if any.Mr. Behera says the detainees hailed mainly from the Rajakkad, Muneera, Panickankudy, Rajakumari areas in Idukki district. It is also possible that they had given false addresses to the authorities there.There had been a surge in smuggling of marijuana into Kerala last year. The smugglers commonly sourced the drug from Rayagada, Mohana, and Gajapati districts in Odisha, Karimnagar and Warangal in Telangana, and Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, all so-called Maoist-affected regions.The evident pattern has given credence to the police theory that armed Left-wing extremist groups could be profiting hugely from the street sale of the drug in Kerala.Narcotic enforcers say that ganja bought for Rs.1, 500 a kg accrues many times its value when retailed in the State.The profit margin was high and a whole network, from cultivators to smugglers to street-level peddlers stood to gain hugely.The police are also focused on Anakapalle, a town known for its sugarcane industry in Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh.Officials said wholesale peddlers from Kerala routinely camped in the town and bought the drug through the agents.They concealed it in jute sacks and couriered it to Kerala. They often declared the content as jaggery, tamarind husks or rice bran for which the region was famous.Satellite surveillance, reduction of forest cover, spread of mobile phones, increased vigilance and social awareness had helped reduce large scale cultivation of marijuana in Kerala to a great extent. However, its inflow from other regions continued to be a problem for the police."

Photo: Ajaj ShaikhThe Bharatiya Janata Party supported a separate Vidarbha but not Marathwada, Maharashtra BJP president Raosabheb Danve said on Saturday.BJP has been demanding a separate Vidarbha for the past many years, but is opposed to a separate Marathwada, Mr Danve told reporters here.The party supports creation of small states. During the regime of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the party had formed Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand, carved out of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, respectively, he said.Mr Danve said the erstwhile UPA government formed a separate Telangana state (out of Andhra Pradesh) due to political views of the Congress. A row was sparked after Maharashtra Advocate-General Shreehari Aney called for statehood for Vidarbha and Marathwada regions in the state.He later resigned over the row but ruled out any apology asserting that he stood by his view.Central assistanceThe Centre has so far provided aid for drought and the Maharashtra government has also undertaken various solutions to tackle the situation, Mr Danve said.The meeting of the Maharashtra BJP unit started here wherein a host of issues such as the drought situation in the state would be discussed.Mr Danve said the party had also given the responsibility of drought-affected tehsils to its 122 MLAs and 23 MPs and all of them were monitoring the situation.He said BJP workers would spread the message about the works done by the government in villages across the state. On suicides by farmers, Mr Danve said during the UPA regime, the then Union Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar had waived loans of farmers but their suicides could not be reduced.Our government has offered farmers wheat at Rs 2 a kg, rice at Re 1 a kg, electricity connections and agriculture ponds to the needy but it was very shameful that farmers are still committing suicide, Mr Danve said. He claimed the government had provided more financial aid to farmers than the earlier (Congress-NCP) government in the state. Asked about the Shiv Senas opposition to the BJP in Nashik, he said the BJP and the Sena were different parties.  PTI"

Twenty-three years in the Congress, Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogois de facto second-in-command and the architect of the partys three back-to-back victories since 2001, Himanta Biswa Sarma suddenly finds himself on the other side, playing undercard to Sarbananda Sonowal, the man the Bharatiya Janata Party has chosen as its chief ministerial face as it seeks to win Assam for the first time.Mr. Sarma joined the BJP in August 2015, followed by nine Congress MLAs, and was made the campaign committee convener in November. Four months down the line, with Mr. Sonowal having to devote part of his energies to his constituency, Majuli, which goes to the polls in the first phase, its Mr. Sarma that the BJPs central leadership and candidates are turning to for crisis management, feedback and ear-to-the-ground counsel. He is touring first-phase constituencies extensively on a four-seat helicopter exclusively assigned to him, mostly canvassing in Upper Assam but making a few sorties into the Barak Valley as well.Even before we take off from the Khanapara Veterinary Ground, Mr. Sarma is attending a flurry of calls at his Zoo Road residence while letting youngsters who have gathered around take selfies with him. Those are doubtful constituencies, he answers a call from Delhi. On the road after a short-haul flight, in hops Rupak Sharma, the candidate from the Nagaon constituency. He wants a grand rally with BJPs central leaders, including Smriti Irani, to give his campaign a boost. Grand rallies are fine, Mr. Sarma tells him, but they do not fetch you votes; many turn up merely to see the star campaigners. Focus on the booths, hit the road, connect with as many voters as you can, he adds. You dont need to worry about Majuli [constituency], Sarba da , he tells Mr. Sonowal over the phone after the Nagaon candidate got off en route another chopper ride that will take us to Dhemaji, the site of Mr. Sarmas first rally.Contours of a speechA modest crowd  including men in dhotis or gamochas, women in mekhela-chador, and even schoolgirls in uniform  has gathered in the middle of a field as the chopper lands in an adjoining makeshift helipad. Its a sunny morning, bordering on hot, but the crowd gets animated as Mr. Sarma steps out and is escorted to the stage.This election is an election like no other. There is a man called Badruddin Ajmal [All India United Democratic Front chief] who wants to be CM. In Lower Assam, there are areas whose face has changed in the past 25 years. Borduwa, in Nagaon, is the birthplace of [Assamese Vaishnavite saint-reformer] Srimanta Sankardeva. There was a time when an aspiring MLA would go to Batadrava satra [in Nagaon] to seek blessings before launching ones campaign. Now, whoever want to be MLA, they have to ask for dua [prayers] from Ajmal. This election, we have to stop Badruddin Ajmal. We wont let him enter Dispur [the States administrative capital, in Guwahati]. It is a fight for our jati , mati , bheti [identity, land and base], he says. He ridicules the State governments electoral ploy of distributing xuta-kombol (thread for weaving and blankets), saying it only has sops to offer common people while the Congress leaders turn the party into a fief of families.Its time for competitive promises. The BJP would also offer the people xuta-kombol , he says, but of a different kind. It would offer jobs to the unemployed youth so that they can buy their parents thread and blankets. If the Gogoi government is offering rice at Rs. 3 a kg, the BJP government would bring rice to the doorstep at Rs. 2 a kg; if the Congress gives college-going girls bicycles, the BJP would take a leaf out of Gujarat and offer them Scootys (motorised, un-geared two-wheelers); if the womens self-help groups are getting Rs. 5,000, they would under BJP rule have a seed capital of Rs. 5 lakh. The government would offer up to Rs. 2 lakh as medical assistance and Rs. 1.5 lakh towards building pucca houses, and free education for the girl child from college through university.Invoking Lachit Borphukan, the Ahom general who defeated the advancing Mughal Army on the Brahmaputra at Saraighat in AD 1671, he says this election is the last battle of Saraighat, with the BJP, the AGP and the Bodoland Peoples Front standing for jati , mati , bheti on one side and the forces of Chief Minister Gogoi, flanked on either side by Mr. Ajmal and Rockybul Hussain (the Minister for Agriculture), on the other.CustomisationThe Dhemaji speech schema is revisited in subsequent rallies through the course of the day at Dhakuakhana in Lakhimpur district and Behali, Biswanath Chariali, Rangapara and Borsola in Sonitpur district, with on-the-spot improvisations and local customisation.Between rallies, and from one chopper and car ride to another, I ask Mr. Sarma about his transition into the BJP (I havent had time to think, it was get-go with the elections from Day One); about if the Congress knows its long-time strategists moves inside out (The Congress is itself deviating from its winning strategy, which is that the campaign must have a positive message); about how he sees the BJP alliances prospects (This is my fifth election; I can sense a wave when I see one  and this is); about the BJPs campaign message (Identity and aspiration [for development]); about his equation with Mr. Sonowal, originally from the AGP (We go back a long way, I was general secretary of the Guwahati chapter when he was AASU [All Assam Students Union] president); and about why the BJP is targeting Mr. Ajmal (He represents a threat to our indigenous culture with his communal politics).abdus.salam@thehindu.co.in"

They had to run from one office to another and after much trouble would get one or two cards. This had been the condition for long.One of the main obstacles was that the members of their community could not furnish proof, not even letter from house owners because of the fear that if such a letter was given, the transgenders would not vacate the house, said D. Shilpa, a transgender.There was not other document they could furnish.But things changed sometime in December 2015 in Coimbatore. The district administration led by Collector Archana Patnaik and District Revenue Officer T. Christuraj called them for a camp in October 2015 to give voter identity card and ration card, the transgender said.Based on letter from the Coimbatore Mavatta Thirunangaigal Nala Sangam (Coimbatore district transgenders welfare association), the district administration enrolled them in the voters list and provided the electoral photo identity card to around 100 transgenders.Based on the voter identity card and identity card from the social welfare board for transgenders, around 150 members of the community had obtained public distribution system (ration) cards, she added.The voter identity card would help them vote but they had started enjoying other benefits as well. Without any help from friends, the transgenders had booked e-ticket for their train travel and furnished the card as proof, she pointed out.The ratio had helped them save up to Rs. 2,000 a month on pulses. Plus they were getting rice for free and kerosene as well, said M.Nethra, another transgender.They had also opened bank accounts using the voter identity card as proof, she added.District Revenue Officer Mr. Christuraj said that the members of the community were so overjoyed that they were now leading the voter awareness campaign in the district."

The authors say in their preface that there is no attempt to catalogue but to recount and relate the past with the present. To bridge the now with the then; to look back with a sense of satisfaction over the roads travelled and goals conquered.Of struggles, choicesIt succeeds in evoking a feel of the struggles that the team of officials and managers went through to realise Indias first airport in public-private-partnership. From political decisions to choices in engineering design, the book provides a ringside view of the formation of the airport.Personalities such as former chief ministers K. Karunakaran, A. K. Antony and E. K. Nayanar are celebrated along with V.J. Kurien, the first managing director of the company that blazed a trail in establishing the airport.The book also contains photographs that paint a picture of the beginnings and take the readers close to the realities of the times when the project was conceived. Muddy fields, banana orchards, winding village roads and large swathes of rice paddies bring to mind the sacrifices the people of Nedumbassery made in realising the project.The latter parts of the coffee table book deals with the CIAL project taking wings and branching out into different areas of commercial activity. The CIAL Trade Fair Centre and Cochin Duty Free are just a few of them.The book also dedicates substantial space to the uniqueness of the airport as the first in the world to fully run on solar power."

The organisers have not applied for permissions. Even if they do apply, the department will deny permission as such programmes will disrupt communal harmony and peace in the society, a senior police officer said.Speaking to The Hindu , the officer warned of stern action against the sene if they violate the law.Mandya tahsildar Maruti Prasanna said he would issue a show-cause notice to those who staged protests against the proposed marriage.

However, much of the area has been lying under water though generally the District Collector issues an order to start drying the fields by April 15.Francis Kalathungal of Pokkali Samrakshana Samithy said that usually the Collectors order was not heeded to by fish farmers, who continued with their activities throughout the year without following the fish and rice cycle followed in pokkali fields. He also said that collecting enough seeds itself would be a big issue as the Agriculture Department had seeds only to sow around 140 acres.A statement issued by the Public Relations Department recently said that Vyttila6 was the seed variety that was most popular with farmers. Vyttila3 and Vyttila4 too were widely used, said the statement.Pokkali cutltivation takes place in the coastal areas of Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur districts. The variety of rice is unique because of its resistance to salinity. The method of cultivation is totally organic too."

Looking at the success of the Aahar centres launched last year at five urban areas, the Government has decided to extend the scheme to other urban pockets of the State, Mr. Patnaik said hoping that those visiting the urban areas will be immensely benefitted by it.The scheme, which was running in only five districts, has now covered all the 30 districts of the State with opening of 79 more centres on Thursday, said Siba Shankar Sahoo, the nodal officer of the State Aahar Samiti. The funds for each centre in a district are now being arranged by the District Collectors, who are designated as chairpersons of their respective District Aahar Samiti, Mr. Sahoo added saying that each centre will distribute at least 500 or 1,000 meals every day between 12 noon to 3 pm looking at the local demands.Terming the scheme as politically motivated, the Opposition BJP has criticised the ruling party for playing to the gallery keeping an eye on the forthcoming urban local body elections. Instead of wasting time and money in the Aahar scheme, the government should work sincerely towards distributing ration cards under the National Food Security Act to all needy people, said State BJP spokesman Sajjan Sharma.The Opposition, Congress, too has criticised the ruling BJD saying the party is now making the Aahar a political tool because the NFSA scheme has actually punctured the Re.1-a-kg rice gimmick on which Naveen Patnaik was winning the elections till date. When the urban people are suffering due to lack of potable water, the ruling party is harping on the Aahar scheme to divert attention and woo the people for the upcoming ULB elections, said the State Congress spokesperson Ms. Sulochana Das.PTI adds:The scheme is being sponsored by the Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC) in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, the Orissa Power Generation Corporation in Rourkela and the Orissa Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation in Sambalpur. Tata Steel has been supporting the scheme in Berhampur while Adani in Bhadrak."

And yet, none of these promises have been fulfilled.As a result of this, the Irular Association passed a resolution in a meeting recently to boycott the Assembly elections altogether. As a mark of protest, Irulas have raised black flags on their houses (huts).Tiruvallur is said to have around 80,000 Irula voters. Our children study with candle lights and under street lights. We live in thatched huts with no facilities and there is no safety for us from natural calamities. All these years, we have received only promises, said R. Prabhu, founder, Tiruvallur District Irular Development Association.Irulas from different parts of Tiruvallur district organised a series of protest meetings near the Tiruvallur Collectorate for the past few months to draw the district administrations attention to these grievances.The protest meetings were preceded by signature campaigns and street corner meetings at Irula settlements in the district.Also, for over two years, community elders had given several petitions to the district administration at public grievances meetings.The Tiruvallur district administration ignored our plight. We decided to boycott this assembly election as voting all these years have not improved our lives, said R. Saravanan, an Irula in Sripathy Nagar of Pakkam village, near Avadi.According to sociologists, Irulas migrated to the city outskirts especially Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts in the early decades of the 20th century.With traditional occupations of snake trapping and wood cutting having been banned, Irulas are now mostly employed as agriculture workers in flower cultivation and loadsmen in rice mills.Most Irulas in the Chennai outskirts migrated from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and worked at brick chambers and rice mills, S.T.

Mr. Aditya also pointed out that the formula for calculation of tariff was faulty, and not as per the latest National Tariff Policy. If streamlined, it could further reduce the cross-subsidisation. Bhushan Rastogi appearing for the Federation of Telangana and AP Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTAPCCI), pointed out that the norms of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, revised and tightened from time to time, were not being updated by the State commission while determining the tariff.He listed norms such as Plant Load Factor, Gross Station Heat Rate, and secondary fuel oil consumption among others.He also raised objections about power purchase costs being very high for market procurements, and hydel tariff from APGenco being unreasonably high.Anil Reddy, also representing FTAPCCI, sought separate category for MSMEs, and lowering of tariff for Ferro Alloys and Steel manufacturers. He also requested the mandatory minimum time before applying for de-rationing (reduction in contracted maximum demand) be reduced to one year from the existing two years, and deemed consumption charges be waived.There have been petitions from Rice Millers Association of Telangana, Telangana State Off-set Printers Association, Telangana Spinning and Textile Mills Association and water treatment plants, requesting either category change, or waiver of minimum charges."

The British food blogger turned author was there to promote the publication of her second book, Deliciously Ella Everyday , in the United States, and she had caught a cold on the flight across the Atlantic. Her hotel was close to a juice store, though normally she prefers putting ginger through her own juicer and adding a squeeze of lemon.Its sharp and tart, but effective, she said. Ms. Woodward is a food celebrity in Britain, where her first cookbook, Deliciously Ella , named after her website, has had record sales since early 2015. It helps that even while sick, she has the look of someone who just came in from a brisk walk outdoors, with glowing skin, rosy cheeks and hair that falls in waves.She is one of a group of fashionable young women in Britain who are making a career of promoting healthy eating, including Jasmine and Melissa Hemsley, Amelia Freer, Anna Jones and Natasha Corrett. The Guardian has called them the queens of greens; The Telegraph named them the superfoodies. One could also think of them as the Daughters of Nigella, the logical successors to Nigella Lawson, the food personality known for her lush desserts, sensuous presentation and high-profile split from art dealer Charles Saatchi.Ms. Woodward grew up in London, the daughter of supermarket heiress Camilla Sainsbury and politician Shaun Woodward.She used to eat lots of junk food but turned to a plant-based diet after she was found to have postural tachycardia syndrome in 2011. At first I had a lot of brown rice pasta with vegetables mushed with tomato, she said, but then she learned to cook.Her sweet potato brownies made with sweet potatoes, ground almonds, buckwheat, dates, raw cacao, maple syrup and salt are both popular and controversial, with online reviews calling them, alternately, divine, horrible and you will be disappointed.Chef sistersJasmine and Melissa Hemsley, aged 36 and 30 respectively, grew up eating food that was influenced by our mum from the Philippines fused with Grannys cooking. Jasmine Hemsley, a former model, said We ate a lot of old-school soups and stews, in no way fancy and without romanticism.Were big on bone broth soups, cooked vegetables and natural fats that come with meats, Melissa Hemsley said. Their signature dish is cauliflower crust pizza with Parma ham, arugula and Parmesan shavings.Vegetarian cravings36-year-old Anna Jones became a vegetarian at 25. She has written a A Modern Way to Eat: 200+ Satisfying Vegetarian Recipes . Taking something away opened up this whole way of cooking that hadnt existed for me before, she said.I love my salad with kale and coconut and miso and roasted tomatoes, but most popular with my readers are the recipes that are the simplest, the twists on classics, like my veggie burger, she said.Celebrity dieticianAmelia Freer, 40, grew up in England near the Scottish border, and was formerly an assistant to the Prince of Wales. Coming from a small town to London, to have a shop where you could buy lattes, croissants, ready-made sandwiches, I was like Woo hoo and would buy breakfast on the way to work and my evening meal on the way home, she said.A doctor suggested she change her diet, and she eventually went to school for nutritional therapy and has since attracted a clientele of mostly actors and musicians, including Sam Smith, who credits her with his recent weight loss. Working with the prince taught me to be discreet and not be fazed by anyone, she said.Natash Corret, 32, had a father who owned Le Boudin Blanc, a French restaurant in London. His side of the family is a long line of restaurateurs where you try everything and food is delicious and feeds your soul, she said. My mother, on the other hand, has celiac disease and is also very allergic to dairy, so I knew about gluten-free cooking and nut milk long before it was fashionable.I cant just eat what I want, unfortunately; I yo-yo dieted my entire life, she said. It was hard to find a balance. The thing is, it was a blessing in disguise. When I found the alkaline way of eating, it changed my life, and I created a career trying to show how great it is. (Alkaline eating aims for a certain acidity or pH in foods: corn, dairy, meat and wheat are all frowned upon.)Im a sweet-tooth person, she said. My sticky toffee pudding is insane.

Farmers have been at the receiving end for long, but their plight has failed to get due attention from authorities.Lack of coordination among departments has been a stumbling block to realisation of farm welfare programmes, says Father Thomas Peelianikkal, executive director, Kuttanad Vikasana Samithi.Establishment of a single government agency for coordination with various offices functioning under different Ministries has been a long-pending demand of farmers. Several schemes in the farm sector require approval from departments such as Revenue, Irrigation, Electricity and Civil Supplies, apart from Agriculture. None of the political entities have been able to guarantee such a step, he says.Procurement price of paddy is not being distributed on time and the government has not been able to pay the entire amount to farmers at the time of procurement.While the Centres component of Rs.14 a kg was disbursed, the States share of Rs.7 per kg could not be paid as the amount was not released. Farmers have been demanding that a lottery scheme be devoted to them, akin to the one in place to help patients. The revenue from the lottery should be set apart for the welfare of farmers, Fr. Peelianikkal said.Pokkali prospectsPokkali farming is being revived in certain districts such as Alappuzha and Ernakulam by farmers. The pesticide-free Pokkali rice has good demand in the market. The government has to support the groups engaged in Pokkali farming, says Francis Kalathungal, coordinator of a consortium of Pokkali farmers.Several districts such as Alappuzha and Wayanad have a big scope for presenting agriculture as a product to attract tourism, says K.G. Padmakumar, agricultural scientist. Kuttanad farmers, engaged in below-sea-level farming, could be a focus of tourism packages. Again, the concept needs the coordination of the Tourism and Agriculture departments.The LDF and the UDF had vowed to protect the interests of farmers in the recently held local body elections. They would be hoping that the promises would be met at least after the Assembly elections.Procurement price of paddy not distributed on timeFarming can be made a crucial ingredient of tourism packages"

The millers have been asked to cooperate and criminal action would be taken against those found creating problems for farmers.Ms. Janaki said that only 30 millers had given their bank guarantee certificates, which was made mandatory this time. Stating that rice worth Rs. 13 crore was stuck at the millers-level last year, Ms. Janaki said the bank guarantee would ensure strict compliance on the part of the millers.So far, 81 purchase centres have been opened and instructions given to ensure minimum support price to farmers.

With powdered sugar or jaggery and dry fruits stuffed between two ultra thin, edible films made of rice, its a unique sweet and a favourite of crores of people.Behind the roll of sweet melting in the mouth once a bite is taken is a lengthy process that requires days of preparation and back-breaking labour before a hot pot. To make the pot suitable for making the edible films, a hole is made in it and it is alternately heated and wiped with a cloth dipped in oil for three days to smoothen the surface. To make the films, coarse rice is ground for nearly two hours and made into batter. It is diluted and a thin cloth dipped in the solution and put on the inverted pot with flame under it. Film forms on the pot in a jiffy in what appears to be sheer magic to the naked eye.The making of edible films and the sweet is a cottage industry confined to a few villages in East Godavari district, says P.V.K. Jagannadha Rao, Principal Scientist, All India Coordinated Research Project on Post Harvest Engineering and Technology (AICRP-PHET of ICAR), Regional Agricultural Research Station, Anakapalle, affiliated to Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University.Since it is a traditional sweet that is hugely popular and locally made it is eminently suitable for obtaining Geographical Indication-based patent on the lines of Tirupati laddu and Pochampally sari, he says. The making of putarekulu has the potential to provide livelihood to a large number of people with very little investment.RARS has studied the economic conditions and the making of the sweet at Atreyapuram, famed for its putarekulu and also at Vasprapuri near Rajam of Srikakulam district and collected the data. It is estimated a family making 200 putarekulu earns more than Rs.2,000 a day after counting out all expenses.The making of the edible films is carried out in the open in hot conditions. The study revealed that before the film is made the temperature is between 150 and 160 degree Celsius and after the film is taken it is 120 degrees.Provisional patentTo improve working conditions and to refine the process, the Anakapalle RARS has designed an electrically-operated machine to make the edible films under the technology programme of AICRP-PHET. We had taken the machine to Atreyapuarm and tried it out with T. Venkata Srirama Murthy and family for making the edible films. They have suggested a few modifications, including a little slant to the machine, regulating the temperature and Teflon coating to the top sheet rather than a Teflon sheet itself to reduce stickiness, Dr. Jagannadha Rao said. RARS has also applied for provisional patent with the Patent Office at Chennai.Regional agri research station has developed an electrically-operated machine"

I request the authorities to do the needful at the earliest.M.SethuramanKumbakonam.Remove barricadesThough the Mahamaham festival is over, devotees feel hurt to perform pooja in Aadhikumbeswarar temple in Kumbakonam. Regular abishekam was stopped from February 5 when the authorities established barricades inside the praharam. Since then no abishekam was performed. Archakars who used to perform regular pooja say that they could not pour water on parivara murthikal without removing the barricades. The authorities should initiate steps to remove the barricades to continue regular abishekam and pooja in parivara murthikal sannathi.M.Baluswamy,Kumbakonam.Non-functional ATMsThe working of ATMs in the Kumbakonam Bazaar Branch is far from satisfactory. Out of the two ATMs, only one is functioning and that too becomes dysfunctional on many days. The passbook printing machine in the e-kiosk is not working right from the day of installation causing lot of inconvenience to customers. Will the authorities do the needful at the earliest?M.Sethuraman,Kumbakonam.Supply dhal every monthAll valid ration card holders have a right to buy all essential commodities through public distribution system. But authorities distribute items like dhal once in three months and card holders can get dhal only as per the whims of authorities who restrict supply of dhal. The authorities should ensure that not only free rice but all items including dhal are distributed to all the card holders on monthly basis.K. Venkatesan,Tiruchi.Restore train serviceThe Tiruchi-Chennai fast passenger was running via main line before the commencement of gauge conversion two decades ago. This train used to leave Tiruchi Junction at 4.30 p.m. and reach Chennai at 4.00 a.m. next day. It was very useful to those who could not get tickets in express trains. Even at the last minute, passengers could travel in the fast passenger train as accommodation was always available. During the gauge conversion process, the services of this train and Tiruchi-Tirupathi Express were stopped and have not been restored even after completion of the gauge conversion. The authorities should reintroduce these trains.H. Ghouse Baig,Tiruchi.Deposit in post officesI went to various Post Offices in Tiruchi. Most of the staff did not know the rules governing deposits. Besides for the past two to three days the computer system available with them did not work properly. I could not deposit my money due to these problems. I request the authorities to educate and training their staff regarding the terms and conditions of accepting deposits for various schemes.A.Ethiraju,Tiruchi.Stop toll collectionIt is learnt that the government has collected a huge sum by way of motor vehicle tax. It has also collected revenue for maintenance of roads. So, where is the need to collect tolls again by erecting check posts all along the national highways? There is no transparency in tolls. I request the government to stop collection of toll.V.SundararajuTiruchi."

Even as a major chunk of the produce is being procured by rice millers every season, the government, on its part, is opening paddy procurement centres all over the district to ensure that the farmers get minimum support price. The MSP is Rs. 1,450 a quintal for the Grade-A variety and Rs. 1,410 for the common variety.The centres are aimed at providing MSP to farmers. We are opening 279 paddy procurement centres and will provide transportation charges to farmers, besides making online payment within 48 hours of purchase, says S. Satyanarayana, Joint Collector.The procurement centres will function from Tuesday under the aegis of the DRDA/Velugu, Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies and the District Cooperative Marketing Society.According to government guidelines, farmers should first bring their samples to the nearby procurement centre for formal approval, which will be given after testing the quality and moisture. Once the approval is given, the produce can be transported to the centre.Traders still rule the roostThe ground realities, however, are quite contrary to the plans chalked out by the officials. Over 80 per cent of the cultivators are tenant farmers, for whom arranging finances is a major challenge. In the absence of tenant farmer identity cards, they are obtaining loans from paddy traders towards the input costs by mortgaging the standing crops. They are left with no option but to sell the produce to the trader at the price fixed by him. So far, the government issued identity cards to 1.25 lakh tenant farmers, of which hardly 50 per cent are able to avail themselves of farm loans from banks. Unless we get finance from the banks to meet the input costs, we cant sell our produce independently, says Jalligampala Rambabu, a tenant farmer from Kapavaram, near Samalkot."

State Food and Supplies Minister Imran Hussain has claimed of having repeatedly pursued the matter of extending the limit by about 10 per cent with the Department of Food and Public Distribution at the Centre, but to no avail.Speaking to The Hindu , Mr Hussain said, Delhis limit of distributing food security cards got over by September last year itself. We have demanded that the Centre increase Delhis quota to 80 lakh from the existing 72,77,995 beneficiaries. This limit has remained unchanged for the past 12 years.Distribution of fresh ration cards or even accepting applications for the same was ceased by the Food and Supplies Department in November.The minister further said that he had written to Union Minister for Food and Public Distribution Ram Vilas Paswan twice on the matter. The first letter I wrote was in December last year. The latest one was written over a week ago, in which I sought time for a meeting with Mr. Paswan. Extending the cap is necessary in view of the increasing population of the city, he added.The Union minister had replied to Mr. Hussains first letter wherein he had denied making room for any such provision, but had given an offer of providing wheat and rice at controlled rates. The State minister, however, denied the offer saying that the prices being offered were too high as compared to Delhis ration rate of Rs. 2 per kg for wheat and Rs. 3 per kg for rice.FSOs on strict vigilIn another development, Mr. Hussain has directed Food Security Officers (FSOs) to keep strict vigil on the citys fair price shops (FPSs). In a meeting convened on Wednesday, the food and supplies minister warned the citys FSOs against action if irregularities are observed in FPSs falling under their jurisdiction.With one FSO in each assembly constituency, Delhi has 70 FSOs. From now onwards, if any corruption is found or even if boards mentioning rates of grains are found missing from FPSs, then not only the owner but also the FSO concerned will be pulled up, said Mr. Hussain. A total of 2,530 FPSs are currently operational in the Capital.Distribution of fresh ration cards to beneficiaries was ceased by the Food and Supplies Department in November"

While over a decade ago, orders used to be placed almost for 1,000 people, there has been a precipitous fall in demand. About 50-100 packets are ordered now.The reason?There isnt a clear answer. Some say it is because the party representatives in charge of campaigning in each locality distribute the cadre tokens that can be used at select hotels, while some say the parties find buying food packets from nearby eateries more feasible. Very few go for cooking on a large scale anymore.The volume and variety of food also varies depending on the political party and the candidate in question.Changing preferencesIn the 1950s, parties used to serve upma and coffee.

His announcement of providing rice at Rs.2 per kg sent the Opposition scurrying, and AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa announced a counter offer of 10 kg free rice while the then new comer DMDKs Vijayakant promised 15 kgs.Two years later, the DMK brought down its offer to Rs.1 per kg. In 2011, it followed it up with a promise to provide either a free mixer or a grinder. Ms. Jayalalithaa further offered free mixer, grinder and fan for all the households. It is not either/or; a beneficiary will get all the three, she said. She also promised free laptops to students, four grams of gold, in addition to Rs. 25,000 as marriage assistance for women in low income households. The DMK too had promised to provide free laptops to college students. In 2011, Ms. Jayalalithaa promised the roll out of Arasu Cable, and interestingly, free cable connection for the public.The free television scheme cost the exchequer over Rs. 4,000 crore while Ms. Jayalalithaas free grinders, mixies and fans cost Rs.7,755 crores, while the free laptop scheme set the States finances further back by Rs.4,300 crore.Free electricity for farmers and weavers, bus passes for senior citizens, housing subsidy, free drinking water were among the list of promises made by both the parties in the past elections.The Supreme Court in 2013, while directing the Election Commission to frame guidelines to bring election manifestos under the Model Code of Conduct said that the law is obvious that the promises in the election manifesto cannot be construed as corrupt practice under Section 123 of RP Act, the reality cannot be ruled out that distribution of freebies of any kind, undoubtedly, influences all people. It shakes the root of free and fair elections to a large degree.A former State Chief Electoral Officer said while distribution of money was prevalent in Karnataka and Kerala too, it was rampant here in Tamil Nadu."

But their goal is the same - to feed the hungry. In addition to food served free of cost at places of worship and the public who donate food to organisations and homes, there are a few organisations in the city that are striving hard to prepare and organise food for the needy almost every day. While some are able to do so, others are doing so regularly, say once a week or so.Serving the patientsOutside Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, there is a long queue near a blue coloured autorickshaw. Patients and attendants wait to get rice, rasam and, cooked vegetables served by Pasiyaara Soru . Run by M. Rajasethumurali, the organisation prepares and serves food to not less than 130 persons a day.In the morning, patients call him asking if he would bring food that afternoon. It costs Rs. 3,000 a day and we feed them at least on 15 days a month, for the last three years. The public either prepare food and give us or donate money and ask us to prepare food, he says. On Sunday, M. Sathish sponsored the food, in memory of his wife who passed away last December. Mr. Rajasethumurali has five siblings and lost his father at an early age. I am trying to stop starvation of others, he said. At times, people handover leftover food at functions. On such days, they feed up to 1,500 persons.It is one nutritious breakfast Nizhal Maiyam has been serving orphanages and old-age homes in and around the city from 1999 on Sundays. Forty-one year old B. Murugan, who heads the organisation, started serving sambar rice to 25 persons by taking it to homes on a two-wheeler. Now he serves it to 993 persons in 17 old-age homes and orphanages. Preparing food begins at 2 a.m. and goes on till 6 a.m. Accompanied by his wife and friend, Murugan prepares rice and sambar with ghee and vegetables and a team of 50 volunteers distribute the food. It takes Rs. 10,500 to prepare sambar rice a day. Our needs are met by members and we dont ask money from others, unless someone sponsored, he said. On reason why he is doing it, he said I was on the platform and know what starvation is.Value of foodPadmanaban Gopalan, 23-year-old social entrepreneur, is from a farmers family and knows value of hard work needed for production of food. By wasting food we not only waste money but also the hard work of farmers. On the other hand there are many deserving people. We are trying to bridge the gap, he said. His organisation, No Food Waste group, started collecting leftover food in January 2014, and managed to feed 200 persons a month. Now, we are feeding 300 to 500 slum dwellers and rag pickers a day, he added. Their No Food Waste mobile app helps persons with surplus food to directly identify and deliver food to the hunger spots.Now, we are feeding 300 to 500 slum dwellers and rag pickers a day"

Police officials had reportedly told them that the case could be registered only after a consultation on the relevant Sections with legal experts.Police sources said there were complications involved in registering a case since the upper caste members cannot be intimidated into providing employment to Dalits in their fields.According to a police official, the cordiality in the relations between the two communities was being vitiated by some organisations claiming to champion the cause of Dalits.Ever since a face-off erupted between the Dalits belonging to Arundathiyar sect and upper caste members a month back after the death under suspicious circumstances of a 55-year-old Dalit worker Chinnasamy, there has been an uneasy calm in Nallampatti.A week back, the affected Dalits had submitted a petition to the district administration pleading for intervention for their economic sustenance, citing a resolution adopted by upper caste members not to engage for farm work any Dalit worker from the Rice Mill Pudur locality. They had asked for interest-free loans with subsidy component as a remedy.Earlier this month, a team from the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) visited the Rice Mill Pudur locality and held inquiries.The Dalit residents had complained to the team that Chinnasamy was murdered by an upper caste group over his strident stand on a PCR (Protection of Civil Rights) case registered in Thingalur police station. The Dalit residents had also expressed unhappiness over the Police Departments handling of the case."

The day will mark a partial fulfilment of the longstanding demand of the families  concerning the ownership of the area that the IDPs have been occupying.Uthayakumar (26), a worker in a rice mill in Vavuniya, and Devika are among those who have been staying in the camp for years. The former says he came there when he was three. Devika came to along with her two daughters 13 years ago, after she was deserted by her husband. They are both happy that IDPs like them will get land ownershipn.Though the condition of the camp will not impress any outsider, Devika says the IDPs have got used to living there and that everything is available in the neighbourhood to take care of day to day needs. The thought of leaving the place doesnt strike us, she says. Temporary land permits will be issued to the families on Tuesday. This will provide them with some degree of economic empowerment, says K. Uthayaraj, local Divisional Secretary in the Northern Provincial Council (NPC), adding that some of the IDPs have nearly spent 30 years in Chithambarapuram.By a draw of lots, the sites have been allotted to the families. Each family will get 60 perches of land (equivalent to 16,500 sq. ft.).The families, displaced from various parts of the Province during the civil war, do not own lands in their places of origin. This is why they have decided to stay in the camp, even though several other hundreds of families, which were once accommodated there, moved out after the return of normality.It will be for the first time in Sri Lanka that land rights will be provided to the IDPs for the sites that they have been using, says the official.The NPC administration has released Rs.13.5 million to the divisional secretariat to take care of immediate requirements, says S. Thiruvakaran, Secretary in charge of Health and Rehabilitation departments. When pointed out that some of the allottees have complained about access to their new sites, officials express hope that these issues will be addressed in due course. As for the issue of permanent housing, officials are confident that all the families can be accommodated in the Central governments new programme of 65,000 houses.Meanwhile, a release issued by the Rehabilitation Ministry of the Central government on Sunday stated that so far, over 32,000 persons from the Jaffna district and 8,500 from Vavuniya applied for the proposed housing scheme."

Photo: A. ShaikmohideenIt is a typical rough-hewn terrain at the Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, situated in the hills of the Western Ghats that slice through Tirunelveli district. But P. Veluchamy prefers to walk barefoot.If he had worn slippers, the soles of his feet would have turned soft, making it harder to climb the hillside trees for honey. And he needs that honey. Without it, he will be left with just one source of income  the tapioca crop he cultivates on a three-acre plot in the village of Periyamayilar  and the rain gods have not been kind this year.Veluchamy has come down to the village of Chinnamayilar, which is also home to the Kanis, along with Servalar, Thiruvattamparai and Injikuzhi. The winding, uphill road to Chinnamayilar begins at the edge of Papanasam, which lies 60 km from Tirunelveli, and it stops at Karaiyar.To get to Chinnamayilar from there, you have to cross a wooden bridge across a small stream that flows behind the small shop that sells chips, biscuits and candy for just a little more than what they cost at the bottom of the hill.The Kanis built this bridge themselves because theyre seen as squatters and the government cannot build bridges for squatters. Thats why the Kanis are looking forward to the elections. They want a new government in place so they can get the patta , the title deed, for their land. Despite the Forest Rights Act of 2006  in other States, its implementation has benefited tribal people  cases filed by environmentalists and conservationists have prevented the Kanis from owning land.If not for the elections, they would have got their pattas already. The land they have lived on for generations would have finally become theirs and it would have helped them take loans. But now they will have to wait till June.What will the Kanis do with loans? They certainly wont buy household appliances. Those, they already have. A few months back, Amma gave us mixers, grinders and fans, says M. Ganesamoorthy. And a few years ago, Thatha [Karunanidhi[ gave us TV sets.The Kanis paid Rs. 600 for a round trip in an auto to the nearest town, Vikramasingapuram, to pick these up.They werent bothered by the fact that there is no power supply in Chinnamayilar, Periyamayilar and Injikuzhi to run these appliances. Ganesamoorthy shrugs. People like freebies, he says.But a loan will come in useful to buy, say, a solar-power unit. After all, it will take a while for the new government to give the Kanis what many of us take for granted as markers of modern life: roads, electricity, health centres and drinking-water facilities. A handful of them have already taken refuge in solar power.* * *Slowly, people begin to gather and talk about the elections. P. Arumugam Kani, an elder in these parts and the head of the Society for the Development of Podhigai Malai Adivasis, says that the Kanis have been voting since 1952.He looks like a politician in his spotless white shirt and dhoti, and also has a politicians tact. When asked who he thinks will win, he smiles and says:  Yaaru vandhalum sandhosham [Whoever wins, Im happy].A few hours later, possibly emboldened by the confessions of other Kanis, he says that his vote will go to the DMK, who helped the community get the certificate that granted them Scheduled Tribe status.R. Mani, a CPI(M) man and a treasurer of the Society, says: Tamil Nadu needs an alternative from Amma and Thatha , he says. They only serve themselves or their family. We need someone who will serve the people.It is Manis job to collect money from all the households  there are about 60 families in these parts  for initiatives that help everyone.They pooled in money to buy a jeep that they use to travel the 6.25 km between Chinnamayilar and Periyamayilar, the road strewn with pink and blue candy wrappers bought in the store in Karaiyar. The vehicle cost Rs. 1.2 lakh. Each family contributed Rs. 1,000, and the remainder came from the sale of an older jeep.* * *It is a bumpy ride to Periyamayilar. The first stop is at the home of Srirangan Kani, a wiry man of 65 wearing a small red towel He recalls that there were rains when the DMK was in power. The irony of the calendar above his head, with a beaming Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, completely escapes him.When asked who he was going to vote for, Srirangan was unsure. Maybe the Communist party or Vijayakant, he says. I know they wont win, but I still want to vote for them. Ganesamoorthy laughs and asks him if he knows about the NOTA option on the ballot. Srirangan shakes his head.Talking about successful States, Srirangan gives the example of Kerala. They keep alternating between two national-level parties: the Communists and the Congress. We only have these two State-level parties.By now, it has become a bit of an adda . Veluchamy speaks of a road through the forest that will reduce the distance to Kerala. The people of the tribe want easy access to markets there because they get more money there  Rs. 23 more per kg for tapioca and Rs. 150 more per kg for pepper. But because this is protected wildlife area, these projects never take off. The Kanis laugh when asked about tigers. Srirangan grins and says that the only tigers around are the ones painted on the signs all around.After leaving Srirangan, it is a small ten-minute trek to the house of Kaaliyan Kani. Kaaliyan is an AIADMK loyalist.I get free rice. I can eat and sleep in peace. Rice didnt cost much more when the DMK was in power. It was Re. 1 per kilo. But Kaaliyan says the free rice tastes better and his dog likes it too. Her name is Kingini, and she lies sprawled in the centre of the hut, suckling a month-old pup. The women of the house  57-year-old Ritamma, 48-year-old Valsala  too say that they are voting for Amma. She is doing things for people. She gave us a mixie, a grinder, says Valsala. These appliances lie untouched in a corner, awaiting electricity. But Kaaliyan isnt concerned. He spends most of his time in the clearing outside, where he is building a second house.* * *During the walk back to the Jeep, Veluchamy turns into a tour guide. He holds out what looks like a small red berry. Its a chilly, he says, and issues a rather unnecessary warning about popping it into the mouth.The Kanis, he says, use it in their dishes, and thats why they have such low incidences of cancer and diabetes. One of the dishes its used in, ground with coconut, is chammandhi curry, a kind of cure-all. New mothers have this to alleviate post-partum pain.Mani is disapproving of these digressions and steers the topic back to elections.No one comes to these parts to canvas. It isnt hard to see why. Going to each house is a bit of an adventure sport. So the candidates come to Chinnamayilar, with its jackfruit trees and Ilayaraja songs playing on radios. They ask the Kanis to assemble, ask them about their problems and say theyll take care of it all. Then they leave.Of late, they have begun to offer money. And a quarter bottle of liquor. As a result, the Kanis do not have the moral high ground when, after the election, they want to complain about unfulfilled promises. The men here, Mani says, they know that whoever wins, theres not going to be much change. So they might as well make some money from all parties, get some free booze. Ippo ulla ulagame quarter ulagam [This is a quarter world].Mani laughs when asked about parties promising to implement prohibition. Some of our youths are ganja addicts. When something like that is so freely available, how can prohibition stop them from drinking?The Kani men expect money this year too. But they wont use it to buy chicken and mutton for a meal, or a sari for the wife, or toys for the kids. Theyll buy alcohol and drink the money away.

Yet, we are supplying it at Rs.3 per kg. However, looking into the plight of farmers, the government can consider supplying it at Re.1 per kg, the Minister said.Mr. Gowda was on a tour of select villages in Chikkodi and parts of Athani and Raibag taluks to understand the problems faced by farmers. He heads a Cabinet sub-committee that looks into the drought relief work taken up by the government. He was later joined by Minister for Industries R.V. Deshpande. The interaction programme was attended by 139 beneficiaries of the Krishi Bhagya scheme.At Jodarahatti, the Ministers visited the field of Pavadi Bheemappa Patil where Jalamruta scheme has been implemented under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. The team also visited a goshala in Shirur village of Athani taluk."

The flying squad personnel led by Mayilsamy, Block Development Officer, Magudanchavadi, rushed to the village.During inquiry, they came to know that they were taken for a ride. Mr. Mayilsamy has preferred a complaint with the police against Prakash.The presence of a large number of people in front of a rice mill in Sinna Veeranam village on April 19 kept the officials of the flying squad on their toes for a couple of hours. Some local residents informed the flying squad that rice is being distributed free of cost to the voters to lure them.Inquiries with the mill owner revealed that following a fall in the price of rice, many people have turned up to collect rice.To control and regulate the crowd, tokens were issued to them.T.M. Kaliyannan (96), a Congress veteran of many electoral battles in the past, could not hide his frustration at the increased use of money in the elections, particularly in Tamil Nadu.He had contested in five Assembly elections and one Lok Sabha election from 1952 to 1980 and he emerged victorious thrice, all in the Assembly polls.Money was not at all a matter for both the party cadre and the voters then. The candidates used to spend only for the propaganda materials, flags and for engaging vehicles for transporting the voters to the polling booths on the polling day.The party worked with total commitment on their own irrespective of the choice of the candidates, he says adding that in his whole political career spanning over many decades, he never heard of luring the voters with money.Distribution of money to win votes is a big disappointment, and news to me. What is more shocking is that Tamil Nadu is the leading state in the country in using money power to win votes, he says with anxiety writ large on his face.(Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem)"

Its where he joins a team of people who have developmental disabilities like he does, and cooks a meal with them for this unique tiffin service.At Arpans kitchen in Juhu, an eight-member workforce manages every aspect of the dabba business, including shopping, cleaning, peeling, chopping, cooking, billing, delivery of the tiffins, and receiving payments. As many are afraid of fire, they have been provided induction cookers and rice cookers.The dabba service, the only one in the city that runs on the efforts of individuals with developmental disabilities, completed a year on April 20, will celebrate on Saturday.On average, Arpan delivers 25 tiffins, but as its popularity soared so did its demand, with the service now delivering 45 tiffins.Arpan dabba service has tried to come out of the exclusionary model of sheltered workshops and is an endeavour to create an inclusionary model of supported employment for adults with developmental disabilities, said Dr Sushama Nagarkar, a psychologist and the managing trustee of Yash Charitable Trust.Dr Nagarkars daughter, Aarti (29), has autism and is part of the vibrant workforce. Her reason to cook: I like to eat dal chawal because I can cook dal chawal. And the high point of working here, she said, is that everyone is good here. No one scolds me.Interaction, participationThe thought behind Arpan is that supported employment is a viable option for people with such disabilities as they are not just employable but also capable of effective execution of any routine-oriented task. This model helps generate employment while ensuring team work, social interaction, and community participation.Each member of the Arpan workforce is assigned a bunch of tasks.Nazneen Kagalwala (37) said, I go to the market, buy groceries, chop vegetables and pack dabbas. I even cook at times. Nazneen is a cinema buff, loves chicken, paneer and pav bhaji, and is efficient at cross-stitching. I love to feed myself and others. Chetan Jawale (22), the youngest member at Arpan, has Down Syndrome, and he spreads cheer among his co-workers. I love Shah Rukh Khan. Maggi, ice creams and holidays excite him. Wearing the grey Arpan apron, his job is to chop vegetables and provide deliveries.Though Arpan Tiffins is still not financially viable, it makes sure that all the members get a stipend.The talent of the workforce here isnt limited to cooking skills. Aarti is all set to dance at the anniversary celebrations on Saturday. Pratibha is an accomplished sitarist and dancer. Nazneen does embroidery. Chetan and Bunny can dance up a storm. Anand plays the tabla.We only take in adults with developmental disabilities because they are the hardest to place in competitive employments. People are not willing to risk an investment and establish support systems for such individuals. A few have been placed in competitive employment, but the number is minuscule, said Dr Nagarkar. And those who join, never really wish to leave. Mr Aman joined Arpan recently, but feels at home here and plans to work with them forever.The writer is an intern with The Hindu"

Not anymore. As he runs from the sets of one film to another, often in the same day, he confesses instances where scripts overlap in his head. It is in between shots that he grants us a phone interview. Excerpts:It seems as though youre on a signing spree. After a great start, isnt it time to take things slow?Earlier, it was a question of getting noticed; now, its a phase of survival. I realised that anyone with a certain amount of luck can get a couple of chances to act, but you need talent to survive here.Last year, I completed eight films in eight months, and my health took a beating in the process. I now plan to cut it down to just two or three films a year. But honestly, these are roles I wouldnt want to be taken away from me even if it means having to work 24/7.Have you finally reached a point where youre working only on films that excite you?Yes! The directors come to me now. But Im quite clear about roles I want to be doing. Ive learnt to reject scripts, and more importantly, Ive learnt to say no without hurting anyone. The industry has a habit of offering you the same role once they realise youre good at it. I dont want to be identified with any one image; thats why Im working on so many different movies. I even joke that I havent had time to get married. [laughs]Hopefully, my other long-time dream  building a house  should come true soon.Getting back to movies, youre playing the lead in Ko 2 . Do you remember watching the first part?I watched it in Sangam theatre and I absolutely loved it. I loved the way KV (Anand) sir handled the script. At that time, I remember watching Ajmals role and wondering how I would have played it. I never imagined I would play the lead in its sequel.How much has life changed after Neram, Soodhu Kavvum and Jigarthanda ?My loans are not as scary (laughs ) .Professionally, I feel a lot has changed. People now call me sir. There were directors who dismissed me saying  Thambi, moonjiye paaru  (boy, look at your face) when I approached them for roles. Now, some of those directors have become my friends. As a person though, Ive tried to remain the same. My favourite thing in the world is still my moms paruppu rice with avakka urga.Was winning a National Award ever part of your dreams?Namma idhuku worth ille (Im not worth it), I used to say to myself whenever the National Awards were announced. But it happened and I thank Karthik Subbaraj. I decided to pursue acting full-time when I was 23, and Im 32 now. During this period, I was lucky enough to mingle with a lot of good people who were happy to help a nobody like me. I was focussed during this period, and I acted in 25 short films.This removed my fear of the camera and my training in Koothu-p-Pattarai taught me how to become a character from an actor. Not every aspiring actor gets these kinds of opportunities. Of course, one needs to be focussed and humble.When I was an extra for atmosphere shots in films, my friends said they would give me a treat if I was able to get a one-minute role in a movie. My dream was just to be seen on 70 mm then.What about your dreams outside of cinema?As a kid, I was crazy about the Mitsubishi Lancer. Im glad I got to buy one. I even tried to buy the red Mercedes from Jigarthanda and I told the producer I would pay him more but he sold it off to someone else. [laughs]Ive heard you do a lot of acting exercises every day.Yeah, some of the acting exercises have become a part of my daily routine now. The first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is a set of mirror exercises.I just stare at myself in the mirror and light a cigarette. At times, I even smoke three cigarettes as I stare at the mirror."
58fa6554a3d24b44f321cb91,‘Progressive’ farmer shows the way to success in parched Bundelkhand,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/progressive-farmer-shows-the-way-to-success-in-parched-bundelkhand/article8525449.ece,2016-04-27,"In the parched, brown landscape of Uttar Pradeshs Bundelkhand region, where hundreds of distressed farmers have taken their lives in the past few decades or have been forced to migrate, Prem Singhs farm is an exception.In the fabulous green farm, there is plenty for everyone: abundance of water-bodies for animals to drink from, many fruit-bearing trees, a steady produce of organic products, healthy cattle, well-nourished soil and natural fertilizers and, importantly, a steady flow of income. The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"

In addition to food served free of cost at places of worship and the public who donate food to organisations and homes, there are a few organisations in the city that are striving hard to prepare and organise food for the needy almost every day. While some are able to do so, others are doing so regularly, say once a week or so.Serving the patientsOutside Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, there is a long queue near a blue coloured autorickshaw. Patients and attendants wait to get rice, rasam and, cooked vegetables served by Pasiyaara Soru . Run by M. Rajasethumurali, the organisation prepares and serves food to not less than 130 persons a day.In the morning, patients call him asking if he would bring food that afternoon. It costs Rs. 3,000 a day and we feed them at least on 15 days a month, for the last three years. The public either prepare food and give us or donate money and ask us to prepare food, he says. On Sunday, M. Sathish sponsored the food, in memory of his wife who passed away last December. Mr. Rajasethumurali has five siblings and lost his father at an early age. I am trying to stop starvation of others, he said. At times, people handover leftover food at functions. On such days, they feed up to 1,500 persons.It is one nutritious breakfast Nizhal Maiyam has been serving orphanages and old-age homes in and around the city from 1999 on Sundays. Forty-one year old B. Murugan, who heads the organisation, started serving sambar rice to 25 persons by taking it to homes on a two-wheeler. Now he serves it to 993 persons in 17 old-age homes and orphanages. Preparing food begins at 2 a.m. and goes on till 6 a.m. Accompanied by his wife and friend, Murugan prepares rice and sambar with ghee and vegetables and a team of 50 volunteers distribute the food. It takes Rs. 10,500 to prepare sambar rice a day. Our needs are met by members and we dont ask money from others, unless someone sponsored, he said.

Srinivas Yadav told a press conference on Monday.He said the collection of Rs. 32,492 crore against a target of Rs 33,965 crore (96 per cent) was possible, among others, due to amendments to law that provided tax deduction at source (TDS) for rice sold by the Food Corporation of India to the Civil Supplies Corporation.Amendments to law that envisaged TDS on sale of empty bottles by vendors to bottling companies, lease transactions and business of insurance agents also perked up collections.The collection of luxury tax from corporate hospitals for renting out rooms to patients and imposition of restrictions on claiming input tax credit boosted the revenue, Mr. Yadav said.He also said that the strengthening of enforcement wing of the department with the deployment of an Additional Superintendent of Police and 138 home guards played a crucial role in stepping up collections.The leakages in tax collections, particularly in iron and steel, rice, plywood and tiles businesses, were plugged by enhancing the reward for informants from Rs 10,000 to 50,000.As many as 25 Innova cars were purchased at a cost of Rs. 3 crore for field visits of officers.The enforcement officials detected concealment of turnover by traders to the tune of Rs. 1,657 crore last year and tax default of Rs. 115 crore, of which Rs. 51 crore was recovered. The Minister said the government had set a target of collecting Rs. 43,115 crore from commercial taxes in 2016-17.It was proposed to extend discount on advance payment of deferment tax and make amendments to law governing taxes on horse racing and betting.A centralised billing system in hotels and other business establishments was proposed for online tracking of billing by them through a centralised server.Integrated checkpostsThe government had in principle decided to convert all checkposts in Telangana into integrated checkposts.A committee with higher officials of commercial taxes, transport, agriculture, mines, civil supplies and excise departments was constituted to frame guidelines for the setting up of integrated checkposts.The department will be headed by Deputy Commissioners in all districts."

Renowned agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan on Friday said that organic agriculture could help us move from green revolution to ever-green revolution.He delivered the UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Madanjeet Singh Memorial Lecture on the topic Achieving the zero hunger challenge on Friday at the Pondicherry Central University. The founder of M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation said that the land for agriculture was shrinking with the infrastructure development.The world would require 50 per cent more rice in 2030 than what was in 2004, with approximately 30 per cent less arable land of today. Hence, the need for a sustainable development goal set towards providing food security and nutrition, he said.In his lecture, he emphasised that mainstreaming ecology in technology development and dissemination was the road to sustainable agriculture. He added that information technology is a transformational technology and it has to be used towards sustainable development.Mr. Swaminathan was instrumental in bringing Green Revolution in India. Noted as the Father of Economics Ecology, Mr. Swaminathan has held various research and administrative positions. He has served as an independent Chairman of the FAO Council, president of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Chairman of the National Commission on Farmers and held many more posts over two decades.Stating that green revolution focussed on high-yield, he said that the need was for an ever green revolution that could be achieved by organic agriculture. Explaining that though there has been an extraordinary economic growth in South Asia, Mr. Swaminathan said that the population in this region has been largely dependent on agriculture. Yet, two out of five children are stunted. Women and children from this region suffer more from under and malnutrition, he said.Considered to be one of the 20 most influential Asians of the 20{+t}{+h}century, Mr. Swaminathan stressed for legislation on the lines of Norwegian model of national biosafety authority. He stated: At least 97 per cent of worlds water resource is sea water. We should think of sea water farming. Adding that with genetic modification, rice could be cultivated that has the ability to elongate with the rise of water levels where it could be carefully harvested.He called upon the younger generation to get into farming. There is also a need to ensure that youth get excited about agriculture. Now, even agriculture has seen several developments in technology and youth can take part in food production and agriculture, he said. The welcome address was given by Dr. A.

As politicians canvass this election season, they need to factor in these aspects as well as the caste tensions that escalate every now and then in a couple of districts.The poorly developed districts of Cuddalore, Villupuram, Tiruvannamalai, Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvallur, with 59 Assembly constituencies among them, perhaps hold the key for the resurgence of the DMK, provided it can brave the threat posed by the third front and that of the PMK. The floods have dented the image of the ruling AIADMK in this region, with people recounting inefficient relief and rehabilitation measures and alleged partisan behaviour of party men and officials in post-flood response.In Cuddalore, the worst hit by the floods, complaints of relief money not reaching peoples bank accounts echo from different parts. They [officials] came and surveyed the damage. But we are yet to get the relief money. We have no hopes either, says Balu of Poondiankuppam in Kurinjipadi.Farmers in Villupuram, Cuddalore and Tiruvannamalai criticise the government for fixing an unreasonably low compensation for the crop damage. The Rs. 13,500 per hectare would not cover the cost of production for even an acre. I had sugarcane and groundnut on my six acres. I have met the officials several times but I am yet to get the compensation. I had to take loans for new crop, says A. Ramasamy of Devanur in Tiruvannamalai.The abysmally low rainfall for straight four years since 2011 created a drought-like situation in Tiruvannamalai and the water table went down drastically. This pulled down agricultural production. Coupled with drought, lack of fair pricing for paddy, sugar mills audacity not to give State-advised price for cane and the systematically dwindling groundnut area have crippled the agricultural economy.Though Tiruvannamalai used to be one of the leading paddy producing districts in the State, its farmers failed to get drought relief while their politically influential brethren in the delta managed to squeeze some relief. After the rains are bountiful in 2015, people expected good turn in the paddy yield, but the brown plant hopper diseases hit the crops in epidemic proportion and affected both the productivity and pricing.Accusation of ruling party members intervening with officials and recommending relief for their own supporters was something heard across districts.In Vellore, the delay in executing the Thenpennai-Palar River linking project has turned into a huge disappointment. Farmers for long have been urging the government to declare this district drought-prone and take remedial measures. Due to acute water scarcity, coconut cultivation has been severely hit in the last several years. Cultivators also blame the tanneries for the continuing pollution of water bodies.In many parts of Villupuram, lack of employment opportunities dominates the woes of the voters. With inadequate irrigation facilities, farming is confined to a few months in places like Kurinjipadi and Ulundurpet. It is in such areas that schemes like 20 kg free rice and goats and cow distribution have become a huge hit.As one moves to Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, unequal development stares one in the face.

Poverty is rampant in most border villages, with a substantial population belonging to the Backward Classes. Round the year, the people crisscross the two States in search of a livelihood, depending on agriculture work. The Tamil Nadu Assembly elections this year is a bonanza for about 7,000 people, that too with drought conditions set to slowly return to Kuppam, followed by dampening summer heat and not much work in the fields.Interestingly, a majority of them have relatives in villages of Vellore and Krishnagiri districts. Apart from using share-autos for commuting distances over three km, several of them find it convenient to just walk for five or 10 minutes to reach their destinations on the other side of the border.During the last one week, several villagers have been leaving their houses in the early hours to reach the nearest locations in Vaniyambadi and Krishnagiri constituencies. Carrying party flags and distributing pamphlets and raising slogans there during door-to-door campaign, they would return home by sundown. The middlemen who collect the people from Kuppam villages pay Rs. 500 each to the campaigner, in addition to biryani packets and liquor. The women, in turn, get extra amount selling the liquor bottles at cheaper rates to their own colleagues in the campaign. A striking feature is that all the people of these villages are Tamil-speaking, and cherish strong affinity with villages in Tami Nadu, having family bonds since decades. Some families stay at their relatives houses, instead of travelling daily.Some of the hamlets in Kuppam contributing to the campaigning in Tamilnadu elections are: Arimanupenta in Ramakuppam mandal; Gundlamadugu, Motlachenu, Mallanur, Nadumuru, Peddavanka, Nayanur, Brahmadevara Chenlu, Devarajapuram and Adavibooduguru in Kuppam mandal; and O.N. Kottur in Gudupalle mandal.Interestingly, several people of these villages, apart from being on the electoral rolls in Andhra Pradesh, are also voters in Vaniyambadi, Bargur, Thalli, Uthangarai, Veppanahalli, Krishnagiri and Hosur in Krishnagiri district; and Vellore, K.V. Kuppam, Ambur, Anaikattu, Vaniyambadi, Gudiyattam in Vellore district.The politics and social life of Tamil Nadu has come to influence the border villages in many ways. For instance, the ration rice from Tamil Nadu finds its way into all households all round the year, in addition to Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaas gesture of fan and laptop.Dhanaraj, a middleman from Krishnagiri, who musters campaigners from Kuppam, says: There is nothing wrong in campaigning in Tamil Nadu. The borders are only physical, and our people are Tamils and spread in both States. In this summer, they can earn something for their families without hard work.Many of them go to Krishnagiri and Vellore to take part in campaigning"

That is the strange reality as the Stanley reservoir provides water for irrigation and drinking in the delta region but the local people face water scarcity. Efforts to draw the attention of authorities to their plight have proved futile so far.In the upcoming Assembly elections, the key candidates fielded in the Mettur constituency  S. Semmalai (AIADMK), G.K. Mani (PMK), S.R. Parthiban (Makkal DMDK) and Bhupathi (DMDK)  will have to walk the extra mile to convince people on implementing projects for sharing the surplus water of Mettur dam for irrigation in Salem and neighbouring districts and also implementing special scheme for the supply of protected drinking water to villages.Mettur has become a key constituency with Mr. Semmalai, a former Minister, and Mr. Mani, PMK president, in the fray. Both are three-time MLAs (Mr. Mani has won twice from Pennagaram). The incumbent MLA, Mr. Parthiban, as a candidate of the DMK-led alliance has made the contest an absorbing one.The constituency is also an industrial belt with the presence of a few major industrial houses while a large number of local people are fishermen.All the four leading candidates belong to the dominant Vanniyar community.A section of the local population is upset over the governments failure in constructing a spacious bus stand and also in promoting tourism. The demand for implementing the Thonimadavu water scheme and the Mettur surplus water scheme and a bridge across the Cauvery connecting Kottaiyur to Ottanur has been pending for long. Another unfulfilled demand is the provision of cold storage facility for tomato farmers of Mecheri and a factory for manufacturing value- added products.But the AIADMK cadre are hoping that the achievements of the government including the execution of the underground drainage works, construction of high-level bridge, commissioning of electric crematorium, funds for solid waste management project and for widening the road from Mettur Camp to Thottilpatti would see Mr Semmalai through."

Not a day passes without scrambling for a pot of water, said Itta Francis of Kottappuram.Water scarcity has been a perennial issue for the residents at Vizhinjam, as successive governments failed to find a lasting solution to the problem.This is despite health authorities making repeated pitch for supply of potable water to the area following outbreak of vector-borne diseases in the past.Assurances apart, residents fail to get clean water during most part of the year and the ordeal gets severe during summer.Residents in Thulavila, Karimpalikkara, Maria Nagar, Osavila, Charuvila, Kadakkulam and Kottappuram areas at Vizhinjam faced the worst-ever crisis during past few days in getting water.

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."

These are initial arrests in Ganjam district and Odisha in relation to allegations that several well-to-do persons had procured ration cards under the Food Security Act through deceit and suppression of information about their economic status.Golap and Tuni were arrested by Bhanjanagar police station. Both of them have been sent to jail as their bail plea was rejected.Block Development Officer of Jagannathprasad, Kailash Chandra Murmu had filed an FIR against these two women.Enquiry by officials of civil supplies department had revealed that both these women were economically better off and even owned two-storeyed buildings at Lunijhola village.

Parthasarathi. Whatever production of rice which is a water intensive crop was mainly due to bore wells but they too could not deliver in later stage due to deepening of groundwater table, he added.The situation was expected as kharif, the first crop, was not good on account of poor inflows in projects. However, the government waited till October because there were heavy rains around that time in the past which resulted in projects getting water. But, even that did not take place. In the face of a continuous dry spell, the government had come to a conclusion about a bad year for agriculture, Mr. Parthasarathi added.The rice production was a mere 22.13 lakh tonnes in kharif and an estimated 7.21 lakh tonnes in rabi this year. The area of cultivation was 7.49 lakh hectares and 2.52 lakh hectares respectively. It was 28.55 lakh tonnes in kharif and 16.90 lakh tonnes in rabi, making up to 45.55 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. The area of cultivation last year was 9.20 lakh hectares and 4.95 lakh hectares respectively. Surprisingly, the directorate has estimated that the production of cotton will be more this year at 35.98 lakh tonnes against 35.83 lakh tonnes last year. Similarly, chilli production was estimated at 2.04 lakh tonnes against 2.53 lakh tonnes last year. However, the directorate has estimated nil production in recent rabi in red gram, castor, soya bean, palm oil, mesta, sugarcane and turmeric. Red gram was grown over 247 hectares in kharif but it was only one hectare in rabi. There was no area at all for soyabean and turmeric in rabi."

RNR 15048 has gained ready acceptance after its release last year because of its unique grain size, short slender shape, high grain yield potential, high head rice recovery, good cooking quality and above all robust blast resistance characteristics.One of the striking qualities of this paddy variety is that it can be raised in both kharif and rabi seasons in a short duration of about 125 days.Hyderabad-based professor of Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) has developed the new rice variety two years ago to enable the farmers overcome recurring problems associated with delay in monsoon and deficiency in rainfall, besides reaping good harvest with low investment, sources said. Its low Glycemic Index (GI) of 51.5 percentage compared to the popular BPT 5204 rice variety (GI of 56.5) has made it a preferred choice for health conscious consumers, particularly diabetic patients. Many farmers in Nelakondapalli, Chintakani, Mudigonda and several other mandals in the district have raised Telangana Sona (RNR 15048) in over 1,500 acres in the rabi season, says Dr. J. Hemantha Kumar, Programme Coordinator, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Wyra.Prompted by their success in cultivation of the new rice variety, more farmers are showing interest to take up cultivation of Telangana Sona.We are recommending Telangana Sona in place of BPT 5204 due to its suitability for late planting conditions in kharif and potential to reap good yield with low expenditure in both crop seasons, he notes.I have raised Telangana Sona in 6.5 acres in rabi season, which gave a good yield of nearly 250 bags of fine quality of short slender grain, says M. Venkateswara Rao, a paddy grower of Chennaram in Nelakondapalli mandal.It is highly palatable and suits health conscious consumers, he remarks, adding that the new variety has proved its efficacy in harsh weather conditions, he emphasises.The government should supply seed of Telangana Sona to the small and marginal farmers, especially in tribal areas, and encourage them to cultivate the high yielding and blast resistance new rice variety and overcome agrarian crisis, suggests Balram, a tribal farmer of Chandrugonda."

The manifesto seeks to take forward the UDFs Development and Care slogan of 2011 by promising jobs to 15-lakh young men and women in the next five years by implementing various development projects. With the State going through a very dry spell at present, the manifesto promises to provide drinking water to all families in urban and rural areas. The focus will be on the production side with hefty doses of subsidy being promised for various segments dependent on agriculture and allied sectors such as animal husbandry.The manifesto has 32 subtitles covering infrastructure development, traditional industry, social welfare, energy, housing, coastal development, hill development, education, ST & SC development, backward and forward classes development, women empowerment, environment protection, and sanitation, to name some. The manifesto proposes the expeditious completion of several projects currently being implemented. The manifesto reiterates the UDFs goal of total prohibition within 10 years and the steps it would take to achieve this, if it returns to power. In the education sector, it promises special package to raise the standard of school education and curriculum improvement, but the best part is the promise that the government will bear half of the interest burden as subsidy. The government will also bear the interest burden on education loans of students with top marks in Plus Two in case they get admission to government and aided professional colleges."

KrishnaswamyA 34-year-old woman and her 64-year-old mother were murdered at their home in Erandamkattalai, near Kundrathur, a western suburb, on Monday night.The assailants made an attempt on the life of one of the two daughters of the younger woman, Thenmozhi; the seven-year-old girl had a miraculous escape, police said.Three persons, including two women, have been arrested in connection with the murders. The incident came to light when neighbours noticed Subhashree (7) and her younger sister, eight-month-old Gunasree, stepping out of their home.Thenmozhi was a school teacher and her husband Ramaswamy was working in Yemen. The family has been living here on a ground-floor flat for the past four years.According to Chennai City police officials, the three suspects  Sathya of Nagalkeni, Chromepet; Dowlath Begum and Jayakumar  had visited the house of Thenmozhi and her mother Vasantha in Pesil Nagar on Monday night.

They also attacked Subhasree, who fell down and lost consciousness.On Tuesday morning, she was woken up by the cries of her younger sister and ran out of the house carrying her, around 6 a.m. She had sustained an injury on her throat and was bleeding, sources said. The flat is located on the rear side of the complex and that made it easy for the assailants to flee without being noticed by anybody.The bodies of the victims were sent to Tambaram Taluk Government Hospital in Chromepet for a post-mortem examination.Kundrathur police, who are investigating, were able to trace the suspects by Tuesday evening.Cook murderedIn Triplicane, a 57-year-old cook was murdered by his colleague on Monday night.City Police sources said Arumugam, a head cook in a restaurant on Akbar Sahib Street, used to quarrel frequently with Muruganandham (40).

Agriculture is no longer prospective and people have migrated to places such as Coimbatore, Tirupur and Chennai in search of employment, says S. Arumugam, a farmer.The RS Mangalam tank is so big that even a naarai (stork) would struggle to fly past the waterbody but it presents a picture of neglect, he says.Thanks to a long coastline from SP Pattinam to Devipattinam, a large number of people are engaged in traditional fishing in the coastal hamlets but they are under the clutches of money lenders. A sizeable section of fishermen regularly visits Saudi Arabia to take up contract fishing.Uppur power plantThe rural constituency is all set to emerge as a major power producing centre and attract industrial investments as Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) is establishing a 1,600 MW thermal power plant at Uppur and the Centre has come forward to set up National Investment and Manufacturing Zone.A Congress citadel, the constituency was represented by Congress leader KR. Ramasamy for five successive terms since 1989 before former DMK Minister Suba. Thangavelan wrested it in the last Assembly election. Now, the DMK has replaced him with his son Suba. Tha. Diwakaran, while Mr. Ramasamy has moved to Karaikudi.The AIADMK, which has won only once from the Mukkulathor-dominated constituency in 1980, has allotted the seat to actor S. Karunas of Mukkulathor Pulipadai. Both hail from the dominant community which constitutes 32 per cent of the total electorate. The electors are set to be polarised in the multi-cornered contest as Dalit leader and Tamizhaga Munnetra Kazhagam leader John Pandian has entered into the fray and the Bharatiya Janata Party has fielded T.

Photo: By Special ArrangementCustomary rituals must bend to the vagaries of nature. The famous Kukke Subrahmanya temple, in Dakshina Kannada district, is facing water shortage, with the water-level at the tirtha Baavi (well) inside the temple having dropped so much that the administration has been forced to temporarily suspend supply and sale of tirtha (holy water) bottles to devotees.On an average, 2,000 tirtha bottles of 200 ml are sold every day at Rs. 6 a bottle, and the numbers go up to 3,000 on special occasions.C.U. Poovappa, executive officer of the temple, said only a small amount of water is available in the well, enough to perform the daily rituals. Though water rises in the mornings, using it to fill tirtha bottles is not advisable.The Kumaradhara river is the water source for Kukke Subrahmanya and surrounding regions. The temple utilises the water for mass cooking, cleaning, and in guesthouses. The temple witnesses around 10,000 footfalls every day, which goes up to 15,000 on special days. Almost all the devotees have anna prasada at the temple, with the kitchen producing nearly 12 quintals of rice every day, Mr. Poovappa said.The temple is the richest among Muzrai temples in Karnataka, with annual earnings of Rs. 88.84 crore in 2015-16.

Parasara Bhattar was explaining this verse in the Srirangam temple when sweet porridge, which is offered as prasada in the temple, was brought to him. What greater endorsement of his discourse could there be than the prasada that came from the Lord Himself?There is a Ramayana verse that has been given interesting interpretations by Vaishnava Acharyas, said Akkarakkani Srinidhi in a discourse. Sumantra has come to take Rama to Dasaratha. Rama knows it is to tell Him about His coronation. He takes leave of Sita, who walks up to the entrance of their palace, to see Him off. Valmiki uses the phrase patisammaanitaa here. Kooratazhvan and Parasara Bhattar have interpreted this phrase ingeniously. Kooratazhvan says that Rama gave Sita His garland as a gift before leaving. Parasara Bhattar goes one step further. He says that Rama sat down and pressed Seetas feet, because He felt Her feet might hurt from the long walk from the inner chambers of the palace to the entrance. After He had given Her feet a gentle massage, He also gave Her His garland. What great gifts these were to Sita!An incident in the life of Kooratazhvan shows a great gift he received. Kooratazhvan would only eat rice received as bhiksha. One day, it rained so heavily that he was unable to go out, and so he slept without food. His wife Andal asked Lord Ranganatha if this was fair  here was her husband with no food, while the Lord feasted on sweet porridge. The Lord immediately sent His prasada to Kooratazhvan. Kooratazhvan and Andal ate the prasada and were blessed with two scholarly sons  Parasara Bhattar and Veda Vyasa Bhattar."

Karunas, founder leader of Mukkulathur Pulipadai, an ally of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, seeking election in Tiruvadanai Assembly constituency, has said that his party was not a casteist outfit and he would work for the welfare of all sections of society.Talking to reporters here on Friday, the actor-politician rejected a suggestion that he had floated the party to protect the interest of a particular community and clarified that it had not involved in any communal disturbance.He had included Pulipadai in the party name as tiger was the symbol of valour of the Tamil, and it could not be given a communal colour.The party had been helping poor students to pursue higher education right from its inception, and would continue to focus on helping the poor.Stating that he was handpicked by Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to contest from Tiruvadanai when he called on her to offer his support, Mr. Karunas said that if he was elected, he would work for the overall development of the constituency and make the constituency, famous for paddy cultivation, the rice bowl of Ramanathapuram after protecting the waterbodies.Creation and development of infrastructure facilities in schools would be his immediate priority as education alone would help society develop, he said. He would strive to establish at least two industries in the constituency to address unemployment problem, he said.Propagating the achievements and welfare schemes of the AIADMK government would be enough for him to win the election by a huge margin.As he had begun his career from the scratch from a tender age of 12, he was aware of the problems of the poor people, he said.He was probably the only candidate among those contesting in the 234 Assembly constituencies in the State who did not own a house or a car, he said, adding he believed in people remembering him for his good work after his death.Acting was just his profession and he would be easily accessible to people of all walks of life, he said."
