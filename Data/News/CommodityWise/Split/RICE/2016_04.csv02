But what do you do when you have no Parsi friends to invite you to their homes and weddings where you can sample any of these delicious-sounding treats?Chef Perzen Patel is your best bet. The founder of Bawi Bride Kitchen, a city-based Parsi catering and food delivery service, believes in sharing the best her cuisine has to offer.The whole thing started with Patels blog of the same name. She was in the hospitality industry and lived in New Zealand for nine years, and moved back to India to get married.A little while later, in 2013, she started the blog. It was an attempt to chronicle my amusing attempts at learning to cook Parsi food, she says. And as I started documenting recipes, my readers started asking where they could find this food, as its not very accessible. So, I originally started this as a weekend catering service.Last January, she took up Bawi Bride full-time. While there are several Parsi caterers in the city and food festivals do feature the cuisine, there is a dearth of restaurants where one can get a regular fix of delicacies like dar ni pori (sweetened lentils stuffed in pastry). In recent times, there has been a lot of interest around Parsi food, but it still continues to be available in only a few places in certain cities, Patel says. Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansak. Her recipes are from all over: her family, friends, their families, old recipe books. One of the favourites is a cheese-and-egg cutlet recipe that a friend of mine shared. Her grandmother used to make it for her during the summer holidays.Patel says, I have done pop-ups regularly in Mumbai, and an 11-day food festival with JW Marriott. She is looking forward to doing more events outside the city, especially those that dont have a huge Parsi presence.When it comes to the actual dishes, a hallmark of Parsi food is that it is khatta-meeta (sweet and sour), she says. For that, we use a very special kind of vinegar that comes from Navsari in Gujarat. Then there are the traditional masalas for dhansak and sambhar.As for vegetarians, while there isnt much available, she makes do by keeping the base flavours authentic and swapping the meat-based protein with vegetables or paneer. Caterers usually get scared when they hear the word vegetarian, and more so if it is to be eggless. Thats a double whammy! However, I try to keep the essential flavours the same. So, we have a wedding-style stew with root vegetables and a lot of cashews, dates and raisins; its called lagan sara istoo . We also make kaju paneer, adapted from kaju chicken, and vegetable pulao.At some point, Patel wants to open a restaurant serving Parsi food. Yet, she still keeps her blog active. Parsi food is spoken about with reverence, but she intends to make it accessible, and let people know that they too can cook it.Not many caterers will share their recipes, she laughs. But its not like they are a big secret. I shared the recipe for curry rice  thats on our menu  and someone from the US tried it and wrote to me saying it reminded them of their grandmother. Its a real feel-good factor when someone can relive memories through food.Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansakThe Wedding FeastThe guests are seated on long tables and the food is served on banana leaves.The chicken, mutton, and fish course are served at the same time, with rice.Dishes like patra ni machhi (steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf) are easy to make, but cooked only on celebratory occasions.The menu rarely changes; it has seven to eight dishes that are always present.Vegetarian dishes are few and far between."

Its upsetting to leave the old and children in the villages and head for a place that were unfamiliar with. But its a question of our survival, says Ambriya, a 40-year-old resident of Chandrayapalli village, who had migrated to Mumbai a couple of years ago.He returned to the village with his wife and three children five months ago to try his luck in agriculture in his two acres of land. I spent over Rs. 30,000 drilling a bore-well for over 300 feet. I became bankrupt in the process as it failed to yield water and hence leaving for Mumbai to work there as a labourer again, he says.Going back to Mumbai is not easy for them. The Telangana State Road Transport Corporations Tandur depot operates an express bus every day from Nancherla to Mumbai. As the number of people migrating to Mumbai shot up with summer reaching its peak, the demand for seats in the bus is high.Till a few months ago, the occupancy rate was around 60 per cent on an average. Each trip used to yield Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 38,000.In the past one-and-a-half-months, it rose to nearly 100 per cent bringing in Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 55,000 a trip on an average, says Tandur depot manager K. Krishnamurthy.Its over 15-hours journey, but five or six persons travel by standing in each trip, the manager explains.Meanwhile, with the condition of some of the migrating families being worse, they cannot travel to Mumbai together. For each adult, the ticket costs nearly Rs. 600. Since Ambriya couldnt spend Rs. 1,800 for three of his family members, he sent his son to Mumbai alone."

Srinivas Prasad in Nanjangud shows that his fighting the byelection on the plank of Dalit pride cut no ice with Dalit voters.Mr. Prasad, who quit the Congress on being dropped from the Cabinet and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), necessitating the byelection, played the victim card to the hilt during the campaign and projected his omission as a slight to the entire Dalit community.In the run-up to the polls, he held a series of Swabhimani Samavesha to highlight the insult meted out to him by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. But in Nanjangud rural, this failed to convince the voters, who perceived it as a self-serving move born out of politics of vendetta rather than a public interest move with focus on development.The voters analysis that the region had witnessed more development in the past nine months than in the past nine years was as much a censure of Mr. Prasad as it was an appreciation of the Congress governance of the past four years. (Incidentally, the Congress had ploughed in more than Rs. 600 crore to the Nanjangud-Gundlupet belt ever since Mr. Prasad quit the party.)Meanwhile, the Congress, which was sensitive to the issue raised by Mr. Prasad, deftly avoided any reference to or direct criticism of Mr. Prasad in its campaign and was content projecting the BJP as anti-Dalit, anti-women and anti-minorities.Besides, the partys leaders campaigned focussing on development issues and highlighted its pro-poor welfare programmes such as introduction of rice at Rs. 2 a kg and the spending of over Rs. 27,000 crore for the welfare of Dalits and minorities.Handicapped by imageAs the scale of the defeat began to sink in, a few BJP functionaries got introspective and said the party had been handicapped by the negative image of Mr. Prasad among a section of voters. They said he was perceived to be out of bounds and not having worked enough to develop the constituency.On this front, the Congress benefited from the presence of Chamarajanagar MP R. Dhruvanarayan (Nanjangud Assembly segment is part of Chamarajanagar Parliamentary constituency). Mr. Dhruvanarayan has a positive image among workers, is seen as being pro-development, and is credited with providing drinking water and road connectivity in villages. In contrast, Mr. Prasad was perceived to have ignored the constituency in pursuit of caste calculations."

Among the cultural programmes held included these performances  Madira, Kangilu Nrityaand Bedara Nritya.But the mouth-watering dishes of Tulunadu, served for lunch, were a major draw. The dishes were prepared by the members of the various Mahila Mandals.The dishes included: kudutsar, patrode, chilimbi adye, pelkayida gatatai, manjold irrita gatti, timerida chutney, neeruppadada kukuda chutney, kese chutney, pelkayida mulka, pundi gasi, mude gasi, uppad pachchir palla, tevu, padde, toute, ambade kodel, tojank palya, saarnadye, uppad, pejakayi, toute, padangi gasi, tarayida chutney, pelkayi pachchir, and kanile gasi. Along with these items, neerdose, rice and buttermilk were served.Sheela K. Shetty, president of the Udupi Taluk Mahila Mandaligala Okkota, said that the months of Aashada and Sravana used to be regarded as tough in Tulunadu a few decades ago. Yet people used to collect nutritious vegetables found during that period, cook dishes from them and keep themselves healthy.But things had since improved and now these months were not regarded as tough.The intention is to make the younger generation be aware of these dishes as they are slowly getting enamoured of pizza and burger. The cultural programmes comprising folk songs and dances too are being held for the same purpose, she said.Earlier, inaugurating the programme, Meenakshi Bannanje, president of the Udupi City Municipal Council (CMC), said that besides different types of dishes prepared during Aati, indoor games such as Chennamane were played. The younger generation should be made aware of it as they are mostly immersed in watching television serials or hooked onto their mobile telephones.Jayakar Shetty Indrali, president of Tulukoota, lauded the fact that over 30 Mahila Mandals had come forward to conduct the Aatidonji Dina programme.This programme was being held continuously for the last 17 years, Mr. Indrali said.Nirupama Prasad Shetty, Lioness District Convener, Girija Tallur and Sarala Kanchan, and others were present."

Mr. Chandy said this while addressing a gathering after inaugurating a meeting here on Sunday evening to commemorate the 37th death anniversary of the Congress and INTUC leader P.A. Azeez.Mr. Chandy alleged that the LDF government was at the same time not taking any of these shameful incidents seriously.It was the apathetic approach of the government to such issues that was making people wary about the LDF government, he said.On the other side of the fence, the prices of essential commodities continued to soar.Price of riceThough the price of rice had hit the skies, the government was extending a blind eye to the situation.After the LDF came to power, the politics of murder and the lottery mafia has became active again. Mr. Chandy was also critical about the National Democratic Alliance government at the Centre.He said to cover up the miserable failure of the NDA government when it came to fulfilling the election promises made to the people, the BJP has started raking up the uniform civil code issue to keep the people of the country divided and make political capital out of it.At the function, DCC president Kodikunnil Suresh distributed the P.A.

The Forest Department has also initiated measures for their protection. Speaking to The Hindu , Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Ashis Behera confirmed that Olive Ridleys are being sighted in sea near the rookery coast.According to the DFO, a special squad comprising of officials of Forest and Marine Fishery departments has started patrolling the sea with two speed boats of the Forest department, one trawler of Fisheries department and another trawler provided by Gopalpur port. Nine on-shore camps have been set up by the Forest department where the turtles usually come to nest. Beach cleaning process would be started soon in region.But traditional marine fishermen of villages near the rookery, who for generations have revered and protected the Olive Ridleys because of traditional belief, have started to lose income because of the fishing ban. According to sources, through the State Fisheries department these affected fisherman families get subsidised rice from the government.During the time of fishing ban, only boats less than 15m in length that use small motors are allowed to fish in sea near the coast. These traditional boats cannot go too far into sea, which affects fish catch, said Ch. Babaji of Podampeta village, a marine fisherman and leader of Rushikulya Sea Turtle Conservation and Eco-tourism Club.According to him during the fishing ban, a large variety of fish are caught from the sea. But fishermen of the Rushikulya rookery coastline fail to avail this opportunity. Added to it the small traditional boats allowed to fish in sea are not capable of reaching far inside the sea to get prawn catch, which provides good income.M.Panda, a social activist working with marine fishermen, says that marine fishermen start migrating from this region to outside Odisha during this ban period.This year also the migration has started, he added. Reduced catch also affects production of dry fish and other value-added products of Samudram, a community-based producer company of marine fisher women of Odisha.As fish catch is low for local fishermen due to the ban, Samudram faces raw material scarcity during these months."

Late at night, when his parents are asleep, as an adolescent boy admires a picture of Misty Mountains, Los Angeless former favourite porn star, lasciviously posing in a car, a real car comes crashing down the terrace of the house. The boy goes outside to find the other casualty of the accident: a car that looks similar to the one in the picture. And in it, lies Misty Mountains, dead and naked. He takes off his jacket to cover the body of the same woman he has been fantasising about a few minutes ago.The scene harks back to several Hollywood noir classics set in LA. The deceitful world hiding government corruption with a private eye in hot pursuit as in Chinatown , the mysterious disappearance of Hollywood-hopeful starlet from Mulholland Drive , the inner circles of the porn industry as in Boogie Nights . Deliberately or not, it also has two important cast members from LA Confidential that was based on the citys dark underbelly in Russell Crowe and Kim Bassinger.The Nice Guys is a comedy but not a dark one. For one, it doesnt take itself too seriously. The film by Shane Black is completely comfortable in being a light, fun film. Even though the humour is silly, there is drollness in it. And with a handful of characters solidly etched, we also have decent drama. Holland (Ryan Gosling) has been hired to investigate the dead porn star. It leads him to encounter Jackson (Russell Crowe), another private eye on the case, but with less reputable credentials. They dont really get along very well. They are never on the same page. Yet, there is a brotherhood, an understanding that they need to watch each others back. Meanwhile, Jackson also develops a fondness for Hollands daughter and vice versa. Together, their quest to find the truth about the murder becomes an LA adventure through private poolside parties, hotels and hilly driveways. The film is set in late 70s and the period gives the film a warm, retro, fluid texture.But more than anything else, The Nice Guys works because the chemistry between its actors is crackling. Gosling shows great comic timing as the low on confidence single father. Crowes perfect as the ageing officer who has his own way of doing things. Angouri Rice as Goslings good-hearted and courageous daughter adds to the buddy-movie fun. The familiarity of where the story is heading stops it from being a piece of its kind. None of the twists really have the shock but the action has a whimsical quality about it.The Nice Guys is a nice-ish film that doesnt try too hard. And that is a relief.The Nice GuysDirector: Shane BlackStarring: Russell Crowe, Ryan Gosling, Angourie Rice, Kim BassingerRuntime: 116 mins"

The timely detection of the mischief by a teacher of the school prevented a major tragedy.Drug peddlerThe police said that Sathyan was a known drug peddler of the area. As per preliminary investigations by the police, Sathyan allegedly poisoned the food to avenge a grama sabha meeting held at the school last week calling for strong action against him for peddling narcotic substances in the vicinity of the school. Chembanaruvi is a remote area of Kollam district bordered by forests.The teacher, Sajimol, who went to the kitchen and drank water felt uneasy. She complained about distaste in the water and soon experienced food poisoning symptoms. When she alerted others, they found the same distaste in the rice that was cooked. It was then that another teacher said that she had noticed Sathyan rushing out of the kitchen in the morning.Samples collectedFollowing the development, the local member of the panchayat committee and other residents of the area joined hands and launched a search for Sathyan.

Rajarajeswari, an SHG member.Earlier, the workers employed by the contractor were demanding money from the devotees. But, now we hear that they do not accept even the money offered by the devotees, says the temple official.Ms. Rajarajeswari and K. Nagalakshmi, who were involved in tailoring, grabbed the present work when it was offered. It is because we get better remuneration of Rs. 249 a day here. Besides, its gives us the satisfaction of serving the famous temple, says Ms. Nagalakshmi.Twenty four women, sporting uniform and gloves, work in two shifts in the morning and afternoon. Male members of the families of the SHGs members take up the work during night hours.The genesisHowever, the genesis of SHG members getting a recognition from the government was in 2003, when the then Collector B. Chandramohan invited Bharati Magalir Sangam, an SHG, to set up a canteen on the Collectorate campus.The SHG was just two years old then. It was involved only in collecting monthly subscription of Rs. 100 and lending it at a nominal interest to its members.Some of our members discouraged us from taking up the new venture. They warned that it was not easy to run the canteen where a lot of men come, says T. Saroja (51), who heads the canteen. However, nine of them mustered courage and came forward to set up the Aavin milk booth.The group was initially allowed to sell milk, coffee and tea. Subsequently, they were permitted to sell vada and rice varieties. Since then, the women never looked back.The administration wanted them to give home-made food without any artificial colours or any adulteration.Till now, we maintain the quality and hygiene in the food items were serve, she says.Different women don different roles. Some make tea and coffee, and others take care of cooking.Some of them deliver beverages, vada and meals in every office at the Collectorate, Old Ramanathapuram Collectorate building and post-office. The women also supply food items for all official meetings at the Collectorate.Most of the women, who were housewives, have learnt the tricks of the trade in the last 14 years. They work for at least 12 hours a day for around 20 days a month.They get a minimum monthly salary. The profit is shared thrice a year  in January, during Deepavali and when schools reopen.Contribute to family incomeAll these women have contributed to their family income and given good education to their children. Many children have completed college studies. Almost all of us have married off our girl children with our income, said Ms. Saroja.B. Kamalam (70), the senior most among the members of the group, had been the only earning member of her family when her husband fell sick some five years back.Even after his death, the woman helps her married daughter and three sons, who she says, have a hand-to-mouth existence. I take pleasure in spending for my grandchildren now and then, the elderly woman says.The women have learnt to iron out their differences and run the canteen smoothly. We all benefit out of our unity and hard work, Ms. Kamalam says.Though they serve food to a large number of customers, the women bring their lunch from home.For they have brought in a discipline that they should pay for everything they take at the canteen except for a cup of tea each in the morning and evening.Only the leftover items are shared by us at the end of the day. This is because we know that many ventures started by other SHGs after us could not function due to lack of discipline, Ms. Saroja says.The canteen has taught them about the world outside the four walls at home, and the women personify confidence.Many people who made fun of them when they started the canteen are now awe-struck at their success.Now they know that we have our job in the seat of power. We have successfully run the show without any complaints so far, Ms. Saroja says with pride.The three-fold increase in the monthly subscription in the group activity to Rs. 300 now only speaks of their economic development.We have learnt to iron out our differences and run the canteen smoothly.

The road leading to the Sengazhuneer Amman temple was dotted with shops selling sweets, dolls and vessels. Flaunting their silk sarees and with utensils in hand, women geared themselves to cook fish and rice on mud stoves. Once the delicacy was ready, the families gathered around a small brick smeared with turmeric and vermilion (deity) to offer the cooked fish curry and rice on a plantain leaf. We come here every year on this day. This is the festival of our family deity. My mother came here when she was a child, I continue the tradition and so will our children,  says Adilakshmi, a resident of Muthialpet.Popularly called Veerampattinam Car Festival, it falls on the fifth Friday of Aadi month in Tamil calendar (July to August). The government declares a local holiday for this festival.Story behind festivalLegend has it that more than 450 years ago, a fisherman Veera Raghava found a log while fishing in the Sengazhuneer canal. He kept that log in the backyard of his house. When his wife tried to chop it, blood oozed out of it. The couple were shocked and performed a pooja to the log. Shortly, Goddess Ambica appeared in Veera Raghavas dream and said that the log indicated her arrival. The myth goes that the goddess asked him to place an idol of her on the log and begin worship, says Shanmugam, a local political leader in Veerampattinam.National Fishermens Forum Chairperson M. Ilango says that the Veeerampattinam car festival is the only one where the head of the state pulls the temple car. Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy held the rope of the temple car before it was taken out for a procession. There is a historical significance attached to this custom. During the French colonial period, when the British were trying to invade this coastal village, it is said that the fishermen here supported the French to drive them away. When the French government asked what they could do to return the favour, the fishermen requested the Governor to inaugurate the temple car festival every year. After the French left, the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry continued the tradition, said 90-year old Manjini of Veerampattinam.Hundreds of devotees participated pulled the temple car. All the visitors were given free food and butter milk that were served in shelters set up along the road from Mudaliarpet to Veerampattinam. This small folk deity in the nondescript village remains an element of continuity in the history of Puducherry, bringing together people across entire Puducherry. On the instructions of Collector Satyendra Singh Dursawat, a host of departments collaborated to ensure smooth conduct of the festival."

She has denied wrongdoing.A special court ruled in December that Lagarde should stand trial, but she appealed. France's Court of Cassation on Friday rejected the appeal.Lagarde lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve expressed disappointment at the decision, but told The Associated Press that he expects the trial to show that the IMF chief did nothing wrong.The unusually generous 2008 arbitration deal, paid from public funds, prompted years of legal disputes that remain unresolved.The investigation began in 2011, soon before Lagarde was named to head the IMF in the wake of sexual assault allegations against her predecessor, French economist Dominique Strauss-Kahn.IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said Friday that the Executive Board ""continues to express its confidence in the Managing Director's ability to effectively carry out her duties.""The decision last year to send her to trial had come as a surprise because a prosecutor had earlier argued that the case against her should be dropped.""Negligence"" by a person invested with public authority carries a risk of up to a year in prison and a 15,000 euro ($16,500) fine.She will be tried at the Court of Justice of the Republic, a special body that tries government ministers for alleged wrongdoing while in office. A date has not been set for the trial.The case is part of a larger legal saga centering on Tapie, a flamboyant magnate and TV star who had sued French bank Credit Lyonnais for its handling of the sale of his majority stake in sportswear company Adidas in the mid-1990s. With Lagarde's approval, a private arbitration panel ruled that he should get 400 million euros in compensation, including interest.The deal was seen by critics as a sign of a too-close relationship between magnates and the French political elite. Tapie was close to then-President Nicolas Sarkozy, Lagarde's boss.In a separate part of the case, Tapie has been ordered to pay back the entire 400 million euros. An appeals decision is pending. He could also face a criminal trial on fraud charges, which would be separate from the Lagarde trial."

These farmers sow the cane even as its outsized water demands relative to other crops threaten to plunge this traditionally arid region back into a drought.""It is the only reliable crop. Earlier this year I cultivated onions and incurred a 50,000 rupees loss as prices crashed,"" said Wagh, who plants 1.5 acres (0.6 hectares) of sugar cane.Four months ago Maharashtra, the biggest sugar producing region in India, suffered the worst drought in four decades that ravaged crops, killed livestock, depleted reservoirs and slowed down hydroelectric power output.Environmental activists and the government blamed the rapid expansion of sugar cane growing for creating the water scarcity. Cane consumes about 22.5 million litres of water per hectare during its 14-month long growing cycle compared to just 4 million litres over four months for chickpeas, a pulse, commonly grown in India and called gram locally.Without government intervention to reset the revenue balance in favour of other crops, experts warn the sustained production of sugar cane will further deplete scarce water resources and leave the region prone to droughts. This could create social unrest stemming from the widening income gap between cane growers and other farmers.""The government asks farmers to shift to less water consuming crops, but it does little to support those crops. It failed to solve the problems of oilseed and pulses growers,"" said Pradeep Purandare, a former professor at Maharashtra Water and Land Management Institute based in Aurangabad.Erratic prices for vegetables, oilseeds and pulses limit the incentive for farmers to plant them.In contrast, the government requires sugar mills to buy cane at a set ""fair and remunerative price"" (FRP). The government also buys wheat and rice at what is called the minimum support price (MSP).""Returns from other crops are unpredictable. This year I allowed 5 tonnes of onions to rot. Prices were so low that my losses would have increased by transporting onions to the market,"" said Suresh Kothawale, another Aurangabad farmer.India's government hopes higher subsidies for pulses and oilseeds will change farming patterns.""We are creating oilseeds and pulses as an alternative for sugar cane by raising their minimum support prices,"" said a senior official at India's Agriculture Ministry who declined to be named.But industry critics said the pulse and oilseed MSP only exists on paper as the government never procures them aggressively like wheat or rice.""Green gram prices were trading below support prices due to higher production. This makes the support price irrelevant for farmers,"" said Nitin Kalantri, a pulses miller based at Latur in Maharashtra.HARDY CROP, POLITICAL CLOUTThe sugar mill buildup in Marathwada was initially pushed by politicians in the region trying to replicate the prosperity of mills in other areas of Maharashtra state and was focused on areas with plentiful water, said Jaidev Dole, a political analyst in Aurangabad.""But later politicians opened mills everywhere, even in areas where drinking water is not available, to build a constituency rather than making farmers rich,"" he said.Farmers sell cane directly to sugar mills, effectively getting 100 percent remuneration, but other crops pass through middlemen, ensuring farmers get half the price consumers pay, said Sanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Co-operative Sugar Factories Federation.Sugar cane's sturdiness also attracts farmers because of limited access to insurance that protects against crop failures.Mature cane withstands heavy rainfall or dry spells and is also less vulnerable to pest and diseases compared to other crops, said farmer Sharad Mate, who has lost pulse crops due to droughts and un-seasonal rainfall.""I had taken crop insurance for pulses last year, but didn't get compensation despite losing an entire crop,"" said Mate, a farmer from Sillod, northeast of Aurangabad."

They said the deaths of Kuppu Devaraj and Ajitha would not weaken them and that they would retaliate with weapons.The Maoist team revealed that no one was injured in the police attack, and sought the support of the tribesmen to begin an armed revolution against the government, the police said.The gang spent about two hours in the area before returning to the woods with rice and other essential commodities from the tribal area.

The same pattern is visible in the case of anomalies in the new ration cards, borne from the callousness of the State Government, he said.Demonetisation woes Inaugurating the state-level peoples conclave in front of local bodies offices across the state, in the second phase of the protest launched by the Congress against the anti-people policies of the state and Central governments, Sudheeran said that there is no doubt that the flow of black money in the country should be curbed. The Congress is fully supporting it. But should the people be thrown into dire straits with little alternative arrangements during the transition.Should it be turned this much complex? he said, hoping that the situation would be normalised through apt measures at the earliest. Rationing troubles On the issues prevailing in the ration system, Sudheeran was critical of the LDF Government for not yet coming up with foolproof and time-bound steps to rectify the anomalies in the priority list and ensuring supply of rice to the needy sections in the society, including the BPL category.Ration shops in the Malabar region are lying closed for weeks together. Issues in the priority list for ration cards also persist. The Food and Civil Supplies Minister only wants to deflect public attention by politicising the matter, even when the number of complaints related to ration cards has gone up from 7 lakhs to 13 lakhs now, he said.Dont play politics on the rice issue, Sudheeran told the Minister, also reminding the LDF Government of the experience of revoking the registration and stamp duty hike for family partition deeds announced in the revised annual budget after the new government took over. The Congress- led agitations and resultant public pressure have forced the government to roll back the move, he said. Sudheeran said that neither the Chief Minister nor the Food Minister had approached the Union Government to restore the allocation of rice to 16.25 lakh tonnes, after it was slashed to 14.25 lakh tonnes recently.During the tenure of the former UDF Government, the then Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and Food Minister Anoop Jacob consistently took up the matter with the Centre and the results were visible. They were able to convince the Union Government to grant more time to frame an error- free priority list and get an extension for implementing the National Food Security Act in the state, he said. The LDF Government should think about sending an all-party delegation to the Centre at least now and ensure sufficient allocation of rice and kerosene to the state, said Sudheeran. Former minister V S Sivakumar, DCC president Karakulam Krishna Pillai, KPCC general secretaries Thampanoor Ravi and T Saratchandra Prasad also addressed the protest meet.

Coping with stinky toilets with fused bulbs or broken washroom door bolts, stuffy rooms, one spoon full of vegetable curry to go with too much rice as your meal, rush to catch that bus to reach classes on time and yet you have to be back to avoid standing in queue for the next inadequate meal, thats what life in Osmania University womens hostel is like.Lavatory of Osmania University campus hostel in a pathetic conditionThere are only four toilets on each floor of the hostel building and generally two of them are found damaged with either hanging or detached doors. Also, the washrooms have fused bulbs. Imagine our plight when we have to use the lavatories and washrooms with broken doors in the dark. We frequently develop Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). The workers definitely clean the washrooms but they are not provided the basic cleaning equipment, even cleaning gloves.The toilets stink as we do not have adequate water facility. When we cant even avail basic sanitary facilities, flushes and arrangements to dispose sanitary napkins will be a luxury, said Satya, Telangana vice-president, PDSU.Unhygenic condition of the hostel mess where food forstudents is preparedThere are three blocks in the ladies hostel. In the old hostel, the living conditions are nasty. Only 10 workers are appointed for 800 girls. The canteen workers service is so poor that we have to wait in queues for over an hour for our turn. Due to this, we are unable to reach classes on time and sometimes miss them too. It takes us an hour to reach our classes. The university administration is not even hiring more workers, says Manasa, MCA final year student.Some girl students complained about lack of water facility in the hostels.The water we use for all purposes is directly supplied by GHMC water tankers. The administration had promised us 42 water tankers. However, only 12 tankers are provided for 3,000 students, said Kaveri, a PDSU leader.The girls living in these hostels frequently suffer from malnutrition and fever in lack of quality food. However, they are not provided proper medical facility on campus.Broken doors of the lavatoryTheres only one lady doctor who visits the hostel but we are not aware when she visits. She is least interested in helping us, she wont even be ready to touch our hand. We frequently fall ill due to lack of sanitation, said Kaveri.The hostellers are provided unfiltered water for drinking which adds to their misery.Asked about the security arrangements, the students said there are four guards deployed at the hostel main gate but they are very old.Kaveri narrated an incident when a boy from outside had entered the girls hostel and she had to chase him out with the help of the guards.The girls also complained that no patrolling facility outside the hostels back gate and lack of street lamps on campus could be reasons putting their safety at risk. Some students complained that on Sundays the sanitation workers are absent and the toilets stink so bad that it is tough to even enter them.Disparity between facilities provided to boys and girls, allege girlsIn ladies hostel, the food provided is limited. We will be served only two chapatis. Its not the same in the case of boys. Yet the canteen charges for us are equal as for them and sometimes even higher, said Santosha, PDSU OU leader. Boys can have any quantity of food at any point of time. If we get late for our meals even by 15 minutes, we will have to go without food. By the time we return to hostel, the warden would have left, said Sana, third block hostel co-conveynor, OU and an SFI leader.When asked about their condition, PhD student and Telangana Student Joint Action Committee Chairman Mandala Bhaskar said the sanitation facilities in boys hostel are poor, however they have no restriction on the timings for meals. We cant complain about the quantity of the food but the quality is really bad here, he said. When the director for OU Campus Hostels for Women, B Shailaja was asked about why she hasnt responded to the students complaints about the poor hostel condition, she shifted the blame on the contractor who manages the workers and said she will put pressure on them. When the varisty vice-chancellor S Ramachandram was asked for his response on the issue, he said the situation hasnt been brought to his notice yet"

(Are you from the PK team?) Thats the question on the lips of most farmers turning up for the roadshows as the Rahul Gandhi caravan rolled into Jaunpur, at the end of the first leg of his yatra that started from Gorakhpur and covered 100 Assembly constituencies in eastern-central Uttar Pradesh, straddling Awadh and Poorvanchal.The Congress party has only one MLA from these 100 seats at present  this is Samajwadi Party turf mostly, accounting for Muslim-heavy areas like Azamgarh.An answer in the negative to that question sees the farmer losing interest and turning away in quest of someone from the PK team.The reference is to Congress strategist Prashant Kishor, and this parallel buzz shows how the Congress party is building up some momentum in its bid to revive itself in this huge swathe of Uttar Pradesh.Prashant Kishor is moving around with a team of partymen who are armed with forms, where the most relevant entries relate to the loan/debt owed by the farmers. Locals are zeroing in on the team in the belief that this is a quasi-official exercise that will ultimately lead to a loan waiver, as Rahul has been promising in his speeches.Theres something markedly different here from the last Assembly poll campaign. There too, Rahul had campaigned but Akhilesh Yadav ended up getting the votes. But it was an optics-heavy approach last time  Rahul would walk through the rice fields, occasionally picking up a poor child on his shoulders. This time, he has focused more tightly on farmers issues. The tactics are more process-oriented.A well-mounted PK style campaign, it is aimed at gathering steam on the way, which it is doing.And its running on the shoulders of local leaders  they are gathering people, also providing funds for local coordination. Unlike the impression people in Delhi may have of a dormant party structure, Youth Congress and NSUI cadre are visible on the roads. Rahul, when hes travelling within a town, uses an open-top SUV. Bottles of water are kept at the ready (so that no repeat of Sonias Varanasi fiasco happens).On the highways, he shifts to a huge bus  done up with slogans in Hindi on loan waiver, cut in bijli (power) price and hikes in MSP. The faces of a lot of local leaders adorn the sides of the bus too, along with that of Rahul and Sonia Gandhi.Saturday afternoon, ahead of a two-day break for Eid, Rahul stops for lunch at a madrassa in Jaunpur. The bawarchi (cook) is from Lucknow, says an insider.Thats typical. A common touch, along with food fit for the nawabs.Heavy SPG deployment is of course part of the bargain. They are constantly sanitising the route.During a roadshow at the Malipur chauraha, an SPG man was seen sanitising the fat marigold garland that is to be put around Rahul over and over again. In his speech, he picks up one Guptaji for cross-questioning on the petrol price, job creation and topics like that.Janta trast, Modi mast (people in distress, Modi in delight) is a favourite one-liner for Rahul.After the Eid break, the caravan will resume its journey into central and south UP from Allahabad, K Raju, Rahuls close aide, tells Express. Just a two-day break, then we are back on the road. Less khat Sabha (cot conference) more roadshows."

Although the state accounts for only 1.5 percent of Indias geographical area, over the past two decades it has contributed 35 percent of the nations rice production and 60 cent of its wheat.LOW RAINFALLAccording to Sunil Jain, regional director of the Central Ground Water Board for northwest India, groundwater started dropping in 1985 in Punjab, and has sunk to alarming levels in recent years.Thirty years ago farmers in most parts of the state could draw water at a depth of 10 metres (32 ft), but by 2015 this was 20 metres, while farmers in some central parts of the state are unable to find water even at 30 metres or deeper, he said.There has been a substantial rise in groundwater utilisation, which has mainly happened because of the fact that Punjab gets less rainfall. Since paddy (rice) requires a lot of water, the farmers resort to heavy usage of groundwater for irrigating the paddy fields, he said.Jain added that Punjab gets less than 700mm of rainfall annually. This compares to a national average of 1,083mm, according to the World Bank.Amit Kar, an economist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, attributed the groundwater shortage to government policies such as free electricity for irrigation, credit facilities and subsidies for digging wells and buying pumping equipment, as well as heavily subsidised diesel fuel for pumps.The PAU report said annual demand for irrigation in Punjab is 4.76 million hectare metres (mhm) against a total annual supply of 3.48 mhm from canal and groundwater resources.The deficit is met by overexploitation of deeper groundwater by farmers using nearly 1.4 million tube wells, which exacerbates the loss of more accessible groundwater.According to the PAU report, 3.5 million of Punjabs 9.1 million workers make a living from agriculture or associated activities.Jain said the statistics suggest Punjabs agricultural success may not be sustainable.Punjabs exports of rice and wheat to other regions literally mean the export of its groundwater to those regions, he said.Amitabh Kant, chief executive officer of the government's National Institution for Transforming India (NITI Aayog), predicted the present rate of withdrawal will lead to complete exhaustion of groundwater within a decade in the region.Kant said India, already water-stressed, is rapidly moving towards becoming water-scarce.TIME TO SWITCH?Switching to new crops is one way to ease the problem in Punjab, said PAU's Aggarwal. Rice requires about four times as much water as maize, pulses or oilseeds, for instance.Vinod Kumar Singh, a scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, said Punjab must make the shift at any cost.The government has to make some policy decisions like assuring the farmers it will procure their produce other than paddy (rice) and wheat. Only then will they be convinced to switch over to these crops, he said.Under Indias state-sponsored Public Distribution System, the national government buys staple foods like rice, wheat and sugar from farmers and sells them to citizens at fair or cheaper prices. Commodities worth $2.25 billion, including rice and wheat, are sold annually to about 160 million families.Jasbir Singh Bains, Punjab's director of agriculture, said that system makes farmers reluctant to cultivate other crops.We have started making efforts to popularise the cultivation of pulses, maize, vegetables and oilseeds, Bains said. For example, we have appealed to the central government to increase the procurement of pulses and are urging the farmers to grow vegetables, which also have a good market.Farmers like Shamsher Singh, in NokdarJalandhar, said they would switch to less thirsty crops with government help.We are ready for this, but the government should give the guarantee that it will procure our products like it is doing in the case of wheat and rice, he said."

Balram criticised the Minister for harping on NFSA whenever the shortcomings in the PDS were pointed out. Ration shops are lying closed in the districts of Kasargod, Kannur, Wayanad and Kozhikode, and in the rest of the districts, the quantum of rice distributed under various schemes has been slashed, he alleged.Ministers defenceFood and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman maintained that distribution of rice through the PDS is not disrupted anywhere in the state as is being made out by the Opposition. He also said that the charge was intended to hide the shame of being unable to implement the NFSA in the state though the UDF was in power for three years after the Act was passed. The former government and the then Food and Civil Supplies minister Anoop Jacob were only keen to urge the Centre for an extension of time for NFSA implementation. Even a final undertaking given to make it effective in the state from April 1 last was not met. To the contrary, the LDF Government had sought only six months. The scheme will be implemented from November 14, he said.Antony criticisedThilothamans remarks blaming A K Antony for destroying the statutory ration system in the state by opting for targeted distribution system in 1996 when he was Union Food Minister infuriated the Opposition ranks. His criticism that K V Thomas also took the same steps, resulting in slashing the quota of rice for the state from an eligible 16.01 lakh MT to 14.25 lakh MT made matters worse. Opposition members were on their feet questioning the Minister, only to be countered by ruling front members. When Thilothaman was in no mood to stop blaming the former UDF Government, Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the former was only making political speeches without getting into the core of the issue - non-distribution and anomalies in cards - concerning thousands of people. A walkout by the UDF members followed, to the accompaniment of slogan shouting.UDF Govt to blameThe Civil Supplies minister continued his speech, asserting that strong pressure will be mounted on the Centre to make judicious allocations of rice and kerosene for 2.76 lakh card holders. He placed the entire blame on the former UDF Government for all the issues prevailing in the PDS and anomalies in new ration cards. The UDF Government has to take the blame for the states priority list shrinking to 46 per cent of card holders, when all other states have 67 per cent. Ad hoc allocation from the Centre will become a thing of the past once NFSA is implemented, he said. Kerosene quota was cut and the prices were jacked up, but the UDF failed to persuade the Centre to restore it. He also said that the state needs special consideration as there is a big strain on the PDS through the presence of around 40 lakh migrant labourers in the state. The Onam-Bakrid season was devoid of any price rise of essential commodities mainly due to the effective market intervention of the LDF Government by sanctioning Rs 150 crore, he said. After the walkout, Chennithala said the minister was running away from addressing issues. Without doing anything to ensure more allocation of rice for the state, he is blaming NFSA for it, he said.Antony criticisedThilothamans remarks blaming A K Antony for destroying the statutory ration system in the state by opting for targeted distribution system in 1996 when he was Union Food Minister infuriated the Opposition ranks. His criticism that K V Thomas also took the same steps, resulting in slashing the quota of rice for the state from an eligible 16.01 lakh MT to 14.25 lakh MT made matters worse. Opposition members were on their feet questioning the Minister, only to be countered by ruling front members. When Thilothaman was in no mood to stop blaming the former UDF Government, Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala said that the former was only making political speeches without getting into the core of the issue - non-distribution and anomalies in cards - concerning thousands of people. A walkout by the UDF members followed, to the accompaniment of slogan shouting."

Hence, we give the call of Modi hatao desh bachao to the people of India.She also claimed that several lakhs of skilled and unskilled Bengali labourers have been rendered jobless and forced to return home due to demonetisation.Diamond artisans from Midnapore, zari (embroidery) artisans from Murshidabad and construction labourers from Coochbehar and Hooghly have returned in lakhs from places such as Mumbai, Delhi and the south. Demonetisation was responsible for unemployment of so many people. We will send an unemployment list due to demonetisation to President Pranab Mukherjee soon, she said.Mamata Banerjee also claimed that demonetisation has brought back barter system on a massive scale throughout the state.When I was young and went to my village, I saw people exchanging rice for salt, fish for onions. Modis policies have brought that once again as over 700 gram panchayats in the state are not connected with the banking system, she said, adding that prices of potato, paddy, pulses and basic consumption needs will be skyrocketed as farming has been affected by demonetisation.For the real black money holders, Modi is like a god but for the remaining 94%, he has caused a nightmare, she said."

Now, recent reports of nepotism and corruption in coconut procurement through KERAFED under the directorate of agriculture (DoA) and subsequent vigilance report indicting its senior officials have virtually turned out to be a double whammy for coconut farmers, who were already living a hand-to-mouth existence.The farmers collectives said fraud and misappropriation of public funds by KERAFED had forced millions of coconut farmers to sell their produces at throwaway prices, a move that spells disaster for Keralas economy and for the lives of cultivators. Consequently, the coconut farmers were pushed towards crops like banana and rubber, in a bid to escape escalating cultivation costs and shortage of farm hands. K R Madhavan, an 81-year-old veteran coconut cultivator from Thrissur, who had approached the High Court, chief secretary and Agriculture Department secretary seeking a CBI inquiry into misappropriation of funds by KERAFED, told Express that there had been only a marginal increase in coconut oil and copra prices between 1991 and 2016, while cost of agriculture inputs and prices of all other essential and necessary commodities skyrocketed.If coconut oil was priced Rs 12 per kg in 1980, it now costs around Rs 92, marking a 500 per cent jump. While it may sound too high, it really is meager, when you consider the jump in prices of rice and rubber.Today, both the commodities cost Rs 32 and Rs 150, respectively, as compared to their respective prices of Rs 1 and Rs 12 in 1980, marking an approximate hike of 3000 and 1100 per cent, respectively, he said. Madhavan had filed a petition in HC accusing the state government and its agencies like KERAFED and DoA of dumping rotten and useless coconuts, copra and coconut oil from neighbouring states, which depressed coconut prices further in Kerala and enabled industrial giants to forklift best quality of the goods from the state at measly prices.It also said that the vigilance inquiry and loss recovery were limited in calculating losses.The vigilance report indicted KERAFED senior officials saying they caused a monetary loss of over Rs 35 crore through procurement of raw coconut, purchase of driers and machinery, setting up of sheds and through transportation. However, the loss sustained by 3.5 million cultivators in the state is beyond the ambit of vigilance and CBI inquiries, he added."

Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had made this clear during a visit to Thiruvananthapuram in December 2014 when the UDF was in power in the state.In all, 1.54 crore people in Kerala will benefit from NFSA; 1.7 crore people will be out. Under the NFSA, the beneficiaries (BPL/AAY beneficiaries who will become the priority category under NFSA) will get wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg. If the government wants to give rice at Rs 1 or 2 per kg, the burden will be on the state government, Paswan had said. Parliament had passed the NFSA in 2013, but Kerala has been putting off its implementation. After multiple tweaks of deadlines, Kerala has now agreed to enforce the Act from November 1, with the Centre standing firm on the demand and stopping APL grain supply.Even in 2014 the then UDF government and the Left Opposition also were well aware of the consequences - several months before Paswans visit, reveal Assembly documents. To a question from CPMs S Rajendran MLA in the Assembly, the then Food and Civil Supplies Minister Anoop Jacob had replied that of the 3.34 crore people, 1.54 crore would be eligible to be listed in the priority category which, under NFSA, would replace BPL/AAY cards. 53.64 per cent of the total population will not fall within the ambit of the Act. They can be given eight kg of food grain per card in place of the 10 kg being supplied now. This is because the allotment will not be adequate, Anoop had said in a written reply on February 4, 2014. In September this year, giving an ultimatum to Kerala and Tamil Nadu - the only two states left to roll out NFSA - Paswan had said in New Delhi how a developed state like Kerala could claim that it lacked the resources to enforce NFSA."

However, he emphasised that supply side needs to be strengthened, otherwise it would be difficult to enforce.Mother Dairy is fortifying its token milk. They are the first to use logo. While Cargill will launch its fortified edible oil, Tata Beverages has shown interest in fortified tea, he said.Having said that several states are at advanced stages of adopting fortified foods in government programmes, Agarwal said that the Future group will soon set up a food park near Bengaluru city and is also very keen on fortification."

They will march out at 8:30 am today to plant 2,000 saplings of over 50 varieties near KR Puram Railway Station.The trees will grow 10 times faster and density will be 30 times thicker, according to SayTrees, an NGO that believes in planting trees for better living. The objective is to grow a 100-year-old forest in 10 years.How will this happen? Durgesh Agrahari, head of partnerships and projects at SayTrees Environmental Trust, says, We are going to implement Miyawaki method of planting trees. It was introduced in Japan and it became super popular, but it did not catch on in India. This method of growing forest is going to be tried for the first time in the city, Durgesh said.The method was introduced by Akira Miyawaki, a Japanese botanist, by planting deciduous trees close to each other in a small pit. Akira Miyawaki, now 88-years-old, also plants trees in coastal areas in Japan to combat tsunamis.In 2014, an NGO in Coimbatore, Siruthuli, had tried this in a small way. They had covered 2,000 sqft but in Bengaluru, it will be an acre. The Bangaloreans will also further the project by keeping in mind the evaporation process of the soil.The idea originated while brainstorming and the NGO sought permission from the railway authorities for afforestation of a barricaded land near the KR Puram Railway Station. They got the permission and added facilities such irrigation.""We are encouraging NGOs and alters to plant as many trees as possible for a greener Bengaluru. In fact various organisation and even our department have planted over 80,000 trees in last two months. We plan to plant that amount in next one month,"" said Sanjiv Agarwal, Division Railway Manager of Bangalore.The land was de-weeded ten days ago and the soil is dug three and a half feet deep to insert the saplings.The dug-out soil is mixed with rice shaft, cow dung and dry coconut powder in the right proportion which will make the soil nutritious and porous, says Durgesh. The saplings will be planted strategically.Regular watering will be needed and rice straws will be scattered over the ground to avoid evaporation.The saplings have been procured from villages in and around Hyderabad and contains varieties such as banyan, guava, peepal, tamarind and Indian almond.Since regular de-weeding will be necessary, the NGO has employed 15 people to look after the forest and two workers will be permanently employed, says Durgesh.The urgency to grow a forest comes from a fear that we are running out of time. It is said the World War III will be for survival and the time is now to save what we have in the planet. People are buying oxygen bottles now and we believe natural resources should be free of cost. Responsibilities to preserve resources should be now before we run out of time, said Durgesh.The Miyawaki initiative is a CSR project of Mercedes-Benz in collaboration with SayTrees. Personalities such as violinist Aneesh Vidyashankar and actor Vasishta Simha are expected to be there but confirmation is pending.The event was originally planned to be held on September 17 but the Cauvery issue postponed it to today"

It would also be the first review under the new RBI Governor Urjit Patel, who assumed charge on September 4, after the end of Raghuram Rajan's three-year tenure.Rajan had faced criticism for his reluctance to cut rates, though he always maintained that the rates were lowered at every given opportunity.According to DBS, there is a likelihood that the wholesale price index might outpace retail inflation over the next few months, akin to the trend in 2011, before evening out.Moreover, replenishment of reservoir levels has been encouraging, which in turn is positive for availability of ground water and farm output, it said.Besides, sowing activity has gained traction, with the total area sown up 4 per cent from the same period last year, led by a sharp increase in pulses (36 per cent year-on-year), rice (14 per cent), cereals and oilseeds.""These trends are relevant in light of the recent pick-up in CPI inflation (primarily food inflation) and expectations of better agricultural production lifting GDP growth this year,"" DBS said."

However the offcials have gone on the record stating that it will be well-nigh possible for the state to harvest paddy for consumption during the entire year since domestic production accounted for just a quarter for the states overall demand.Agriculture Minister V S Sunilkumar told Express the state government has recently issued an order to celebrate the Malayalam calender year as Year of Paddy, and under the project the government has taken steps to cultivate rice in around 2,567.82 hectare of fallow land in 11 districts in the state including in Rani, Chithira and Methran kayal and Aranmula paddy fields. Besides, the government has plans to raise the area under acreage of paddy from the current 1.94 lakh hectare to 3 lakhs hectare, apart from the upland paddy cultivation to one lakh hectare in the next five years, he said.At present, a mere 20 percent of the states requirement of rice is locally produced and the department is making efforts to gradually raise the states share. The department will provide a subsidy of Rs 1,500 per hectare to a total 1.8 lakhs hectare of paddy, for which a sum of Rs 27 crores has been earmarked under the Sustainable Paddy farming project. Along with reclaiming or making arable vast swathes of fallow land, the government should also take steps to improve the productivity of the rice varieties by ensuring reasonable cost of production and promoting scientific management of crops, said P Indira Devi, Head of Centre of Excellence in Environmental Economics, Kerala Agriculture University."

In truth it not being hides at all but sarees put aside for that time of the month! To make a success of his trade, Amasa had learned his numbers up to a hundred, using them like astrologers would, to say with some certainty, in which village, in which house, and on what date who was going through a menstrual cycle. All said, even if the almanac from Vontikoppal that the maharajah relied on at times proved wrong, Amasas almanac would perhaps err by a day (nature being at fault), for all else it told the truth.Holding on to this truth and at the hour when sleep made people drowsy, Amasa would sneak in at the place needed and lift the sarees tucked under the eaves. Blessed in this manner with a fortune in sarees, he would then vanish, leaving the women of the upper-caste colony obsessed with ritual, clueless!This piece of work Amasa carried out with honest effort. The self same day, disguised as a washerman, hed reach the Nanjangud lake, wash and clean the goods so as to resell it afresh (as agreed on) to the Muslim who paid him an advance.In the end, this line of work turned out to be less of a gamble and more profitable than wage labour, and in the event of losses (with the end of a menstrual cycle), it was most often made good with new entrants nature brought in. All said and done, it amply provided for his food, clothing, bidi, and cinema expenses  his bicycle hire too; and with the remainder, it provided rice gruel for Kuriyaiah  who lay glued to the Mari temple floor, his hungry mouth open and trustful.Amasa zigzagging along on the bicycle, now whose eye should he catch but the eye of the one who raked in heaps of money playing cards. Knowing all too well the fickle ways of Lakshmi, the Goddess of Prosperity, looking for ways to call off the game  his eyes aflame  this one over here ground his teeth.Look at him. Look! Nothing to cheer the belly, but the arrogance of that Untouchable! All this so well notice him. Swaying and dancing like a snake, he is! Cut those hands off and throw them one on this side and one on the other side of the muth, and the rascal wont hold those handlebars ever again !The game is all!Hearing him the one next to him said, When you get to cut those hands of his and adorn the temple doors with one on either side, Ill be there. Go on, now show me a good card.This one over here now covered those gnashing teeth with his lips; and pasting a smile over them, said, Ill give you the card you want, blighter, but face down! signalling the game was over.(Excerpted from Kusumbaleby Devanoora Mahadeva; Translated from Kannada by Susan Daniel; Published in Kusumabale)"

The picture of the former leader of the state leans on the makeshift stand she built early this morning; a Terracotta Diya lit at the bottom, garlands adorning the front and a hood to protect it from rain.Hearing impaired and mute since birth, Rajeswari has been a supporter of AIADMK since MGR's time. She points to the road with tears welled up in her eyes, ""I lived in the same spot on the road. Now I live in a house in KK Nagar that Amma gave to me.""She says illness should not have befallen a dynamic woman like Jayalalithaa.There won't be any other lady like her : S PushpaAIADMK supporter S Pushpa | Express Photo ServiceS Pushpa, 60, who works as a sweeper in government service, is an admirer of J Jayalalitha, whom she sees as an image of a caring mother who provides everyone with everything. From her childhood till her death, she has helped people in every way, says Pushpa of her beloved Amma.Critical of Jayalalithaa's close friend and aide Sasikala, the ardent Amma fan says, ""She should have avoided the friendship with Sasikala. Because all good things she got from other people, but not Sasikala.""Speaking of being the beneficiary of the benevolence of the late chief minister, she said, ""She gave cows and cattle and we got Amma home, Amma water, and Amma canteen.We got so many things,"" she said.Praising the acting prowess of the star Jayalalithaa, she says she was a good actress and a great entertainer. ""She is a born artist and born beauty, and there is no chance of anyone surpassing her grace and poise. She is a talented dancer, singer, and actor. These are the qualities I love about her,"" she said.Appreciating Jayalalithaa for continuing the schemes that MGR began, Pushpa said, ""There won't be any other lady like her who had to fight all the challenges that she faced (first as a young woman actress and then as a young politician who lost her mentor). After assuming office as Chief Minister, she gave provided gold for the wedding thali (mangalsutra), provided financial aid to pregnant women, pension for widows and so on. More funds were given to women, and she ensured women had safety.""Speaking of how personally connected to her leaders she felt, she said, ""If she gets injured, I never consume food.

Her brother is a daily wage labourer and both of them had been fans of Jayalalithaa from an early age. ""I admire her for many reasons, especially the schemes for students,"" Babu said. ""We admired her as an actress and all the other qualities, including her talent as a dancer. I loved the movie 'Kudi Irunda Kovil',"" said Mariah. All her schemes have benefited people like us.I'm forever indebted: M RanjithamAIADMK supporter M Ranjitham | Express Photo ServiceI sell vegetables at the Koyambedu market. Four years ago, after my daughter threw me out of the house, I had to sell vegetables by day and sleep on the pavement at night. Then I was told about Amma hostel. I'm still staying there. The facilities there I could not have imagined - soap, oil, comb, hot food, tiled floors.Jayalalithaa has kept me alive these four years. Every time I think about her, my eyes well up with tears. I came here this morning hoping to catch one last glimpse. But, couldn't see her face. I could only see the flag they had wrapped the body in. Back in the day, I would have pushed my way through. Today, if I collapse there's nobody even to carry me to the hospital. So, I backed away, just keeping to watching whatever little I could. I'm sitting here at Rajaji Hall wondering if I can go to the beach where maybe I would be lucky enough to see her for the last time.If I had met her when she was alive, I would have held her hand and cried. I'm forever indebted to Amma.Amma's administrative skills increased my love for politics: P ShankarAIADMK supporter P Shankar | Express Photo ServiceI was fifteen years old when I first saw MGR on screen. The ticket cost me 50 paise then. My father was a diehard fan of him, so I was brought up listening to his stories. Eventually, I also became a fan. Since then, I have been an AIADMK supporter and have been voting for that party. Staying in Madurai, I would never miss a chance to visit the venue where MGR would come for election campaigning. Later, when 'Amma' came into politics, my love for the party increased when I watched her administrative skills.I have attended her campaign rallies twice in Salem. The party has been very dear and close to every person in the state. However, the death of Jayalalithaa is a big shock for the entire state. Now, I stay in an old age home and wasn't able to attend the funeral. But I have been watching the live coverage from yesterday.Grew up watching her movies: Mary AmmaAIADMK supporter Mary Amma | Express Photo ServiceFor Mary Amma (78), Jayalalithaa has been a role model who had fought odds to support herself and the people who believed in her.""I have been following Jayalalithaa's movies since she was a young actress and my respect for her has increased every day. Even recently she has raised the pension for senior citizens from 1,000 to 1,500 which only shows she is concerned about people. All the freebies introduced by her have been helpful for the people.""We at the old age home kept praying for her speedy recovery but it was a shock when I heard the news last night,"" said Mary Amma.Amma canteen staffers remember their beloved motherRenuka Reddy (48) and Regina Mary (35), workers at an Amma canteen in Nungambakkam, turned up for work while the entire city shut down. After setting up a picture of their beloved Amma and mourning with the workers for a while, they went ahead with their cooking.Regina MaryAmma has taught me a lot. In some ways, I think I learned more from her two-month stay in the hospital than her governance. I learned that one should never give up, fight till the very end, till the very last breath! She has been an inspiration for so long but most of all she has done so much for us. I have worked at the canteen for four years now. We had no means of income before this, but she gave us jobs at this canteen where we derived absolute joy; she did not discriminate.But the only thing I'm sad about is that we couldn't get a chance to see her. The hospital and the media made it seem like she would be okay. So I prayed for her recovery and I was not at all expecting news of her death. It came as a complete shock. I wish we had been able to see her face at least one last time.Renuka ReddyFrom opposition parties to people in her own party, so many people have given her trouble. Even that one time when opposition members tried to take disrobe her, she continued to face them with unshakeable courage. A woman like that will never take birth again, but we as women will strive to be like her. She had no family but she gave so much love to others,I also aspire to be like that both in my profession as well as my family. She has proved that she is equal to any man, so that gives us confidence too that we can face anything life throws at us. That's why instead of mourning at home, we decided to come to work and do what she expected us to do.I voted for Jayalalithaa, not AIADMK: V MunirathnamAIADMK supporter V Munirathnam | Express Photo ServiceV Munirathnam, a small-time trader, of Sathuvachari near Vellore said Jayalalithaa's death came as a shock to him. Though not a great admirer of the deceased leader initially, he voted for her party in the last election after he realised the value of her populist schemes after his grandmother underwent a complex surgery at a private hospital under the Chief Ministers insurance scheme. ""I am feeling sympathetic to her as she died without any relatives and family members in her last days,"" he said. Since early morning I am saddened as if a death took place in my family. ""I voted for Jayalalithaa, not AIADMK."" he added. The new chief minister should be elected by the people and not MLAs, says Muniratnam.Madurai Woman who admired JayaShyamala Mani | Express Photo ServiceShyamala Mani has been a fan of Jayalalithaa ever since she witnessed AIADMK founder M G Ramachandran introduce her as the party's campaigner amid a huge crowd in West Masi street of Madurai.Expressing her sadness, the 62-year-old who runs a canteen in a private firm, said the news of the demise of her admired leader has vexed her totally.""I had been following Jayalalithaa's career right from she began to act in films and essayed many 'woman-centric' roles on screen. I have taken to them personally and applied it in my life,"" said Shyamala. I couldn't come to terms with the fact that she got arrested last year, she added. A powerful administrator, many of Jayalalithaa's schemes were designed with the common man in mind. ""I got loans through Self Help Group for my business and am also availing old age pension of Rs 1000.Jayalalithaa was the only leader in Tamil Nadu: S Murali KumarAIADMK supporter S Murali Kumar | Express Photo ServiceS Murali Kumar, Automobile industry (dealer), Vellore said, ""It would be hard to imagine anyone else in her place. Jayalalithaa was the only leader in Tamil Nadu. In fact, in the whole country, no leader has taken action against her own party members when allegations rose against them.""No Minister was arrested and remanded in the history of Tamil Nadu whatsoever be the crime he/she committed. Its only Amma who was daring enough to jail her own minister."" he said. Officials will always have a sense of fear of committing mistakes while implementing important schemes.Hereafter, there will be no fear among officers for the Chief Minister.

The octogenarian survives on the Rs 1,000 old-age pension and subsidised food served at Amma canteens. ""I wonder if these welfare schemes would continue under the new leadership,"" she said. Age coupled with poor eyesight and health issues means that Mariamma is able to sell flowers only for a few hours in a day. The little money she earns, she says, is enough to buy food from Amma canteen and the enhanced Rs 1000 old-age pension that she has been availing since 2011 takes care of her medical needs.""I also get free rice with the ration card, again courtesy Amma.

As a widow, Mariamma battled all odds and got her children settled well, but today she stands helpless with her children going their own way. I still dont want to depend on my children,"" she insists. Calling Jayalalithaa a driving force who fought her way to become what she was till yesterday, Mariamma felt bad that she couldn't pay homage to her beloved leader. ""I wanted to go and pay homage to her, but am partially visually impaired and cant wade through the crowds, she grieves.Mariamma has lived through the rule of political stalwarts like K Kamaraj, C N Annadurai, and M G Ramachandran, serving as Chief Ministers of the State. But, she believes that Jayalalithaa stands apart because of her charisma and empathy for masses.For their Amma, one last timeThe sole bus plying from CMBT to Rajaji Hall, where former Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa lies wrapped in the tricolour bore no ominous disquietude. Some stared blankly outside the window, some seemingly asleep or so one might think, until the bus passes by a cut-out of Amma, mounted on the roadside by supporters.The four ladies in the first two rows, all workers at the Koyambedu bus stand, collectively raised their hands in worship chanting 'Amma' multiple times.Kanaga, 41, let go of the pole she was holding onto for support to join her hands together in prayer. ""We don't know if we'll be able to see her. We hope we would be lucky,"" she said, as she resumed her position in the moving bus.Geetha | Express Photo ServiceThe bus ran full capacity, with some men even having to travel on the footboard.Meanwhile, Geetha (name changed) wiped a tear with her pallu. The photo had overwhelmed her. ""She has done so much for us, especially poor women like us, "" she said, of Jayalalithaa.For them, Amma was one among them though they had never met her during her lifetime. So, there was very little that could stop them from letting go of their last chance of seeing her.Even as the bus passed right by them, groups of fives and tens were already walking all the way to pay homage to their late leader. ""Had we known the route, we too would have walked,"" said Kanaga, looking down at her bus ticket that cost Rs. 10Meanwhile, Ramaraj's granddaughter looked on incredulously as the 70-year-old boarded the bus near Thousand Lights. She went back as the bus took off, her lips still curled into a smile and shaking her head in disbelief.Ramaraj | Express Photo Service""I came when Anna died, I came when MGR died.

Her demise is a personnel loss for people like me, she explains, sitting in her outlet selling flowers to supporters who were putting up the late leaders portrait.A native of Palayamkottai in Tirunelveli, Mariamma migrated to Chennai about 40 years back with her five children after her husband expired. Mariamma battled all odds, but today she stands helpless with her children going their own ways.I dont want to depend on my children, she insists. Calling Jayalalithaa a driving force who fought her way and became what she was, Mariamma felt bad that she couldnt pay homage to her beloved leader. I wanted to go and pay homage, but am partially visually impaired and cant wade through the crowd, she says. Mariamma had lived through the rules of stalwarts like Kamaraj, Annadurai and MGR. She believes that Jayalalithaa stands apart because of her charisma and empathy for the masses."

Tomorrow being a holiday, the bench will sit only to hear the matter.Karnataka's decision to move the Supreme Court comes ahead of the Cauvery Supervisory Committee's meeting here tomorrow to decide on the quantum of the river's water to be released to Tamil Nadu and other states.The application has sought that instead of 10 days, the apex court should restrict the release of water to only 6 as the state itself was facing a distress situation due to a massive agitation which was causing a loss of Rs 500 crore per day to Karnataka.In the plea, Karnataka has said there was ""huge public pressure"" and the state police, with great difficulty, have been able to prevent attempts to damage public property.""Even the minimum arrangement mentioned by your lordships has caused distress and havoc in the entire southern part of Karnataka, paralysing civil life. The agitation of farmers has been that their dry crop is equalled with that of the farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu's need for the rice crop consumes more than twice the water which is needed for light crops in Karnataka,"" the application said. The application says that people, particularly farmers in the districts of Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya and Bengaluru, have been squatting on the roads and streets, affecting the IT industry in the state capital which earns huge revenue by way of income tax, service tax, and foreign exchange of USD 60 billion for the country.The application also referred to inputs from security agencies that said if the flow of water is allowed to continue further, the situation ""may go out of hand"".In an interim order on September 5, the court had directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day to Tamil Nadu for the next 10 days to ameliorate the plight of the farmers there.The apex court had also directed Tamil Nadu to approach Supervisory Committee, set up to implement the award of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, within three days for release of water as per the final order of the CWDT."
58fd43da7be9e06c937184b9,Travels inspire a ‘convertible’,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2016/nov/18/travels-inspire-a-convertible-1540091.html,2016-11-18,"BENGALURU: Growing up in the city, Amit Gowda, saw many of his favourite restaurants shut down because they were operating from basements. City byelaws made this use of space illegal. But with that, according to Amit, the city lost half of its charm.A food enthusiast and an ardent traveller, he decided to open a multi-cuisine restaurant much in line with Tycoon restaurant that once was his go-to place in the city. It took him two years and travels to 15 countries to finally open his ideal restaurant.The Druid Garden was opened yesterday in Sahakarnagar.The 32,000-sqft restaurant is on the third and fourth floor of a building that houses a fitness gym and grocery stores. But pass the first two floors and you enter a world starkly different with its striped Aztec black and white marble floor.The entrance is dimly lit and, almost all of a sudden, the restaurant turns bright and open. There are different seating arrangements -- German communal tables and elevated corners to VIP sections and closer-to-the-DJ rooms.Our idea was to have an outdoor space and yet a controlled one, says Amit. What if it rains? An open space will not be fun, he says. I look around to see the open space and see the glass roof above my head starting to slide. The retractable glass roof gives way to open skies and a cool breeze.There are planted gardens all around, to remind you of this garden city. In the nights, with fairy lights, the restaurants wears a warm yellow tone.I seat myself in an elevated area, to the right of the entrance. Seated in a handcrafted Italian oak chair, I get an open view of an Italian kitchen. The kitchen boasts of a wood-fire grill and imported teak, oak, rosewood and hickory are used to smoke meat in the grill.The kitchen occupies 20,000 sq ft area and is driven by 60 chefs. You can take a tour of it on request. The store rooms and the refrigerators are stuffed with imported products from all over the world, such as chocolates from Belgium, salmon from Venenzula and cheese from Italy. While the organic vegetables are brought in from Talakadu and Chikballapura, the lamb is from Banur. Majority of the basic ingredients such as garam masalas, breads and ice-cream are made in-house. All ingredients are sealed with a sticker that carries the name of the chef who prepared it, the date on which it was prepared and Best Before date.Adjacent to the kitchen is a brewery with 36 tanks imported from Czech Republic. The beer is made exclusively by a master brewer Ladislav, who is from Czech Republic.The 140 dishes on the menu were carefully picked from 400 dishes. It was tough to narrow them down, says Niharika Raval, general manager of the restaurant.The dishes are from all 15 countries Amit travelled to: Italy, Spain, Czech Republic, United Kingdom, Portugal, Vietnam, Thailand, South America, Honduras, Peru, Columbia, Venezuela, Mexico, Japan, China and India. The menu was curated, over eight months, after tasting food from streets and from fine-dining restaurants.I cant try all, so I pick 10 dishes.First, I am served Vietnamese Summer Roll with Peanut Sauce. Fresh lettuce, glass noodles, red cabbage and herbs were assembled together and wrapped in a feather-light rice paper. Maybe because Vietnamese is my favourite cuisine, I find this roll to be the best I have ever had. It has unobtrusive flavours and crunchy, raw textures that are not too loud to chew on. Moist glass noodles adds a smoothness to it too.Hoisin Duck Taco is a surpise. The taco is small, round and soft. Shredded duck is layered with crispier pieces. The duck is prepared in confit, which means it is cooked slowly over a long time in its own fat. The process takes a whole day. The skin of the duck is crispy fried and topped on the taco along with cucumber, spring onions and chayote. The tanginess of the ketchup contrasts well with the sweetness of the duck.Campagna Burrata is sheer delight for cheese lovers. A solid mozzarella holds a refined silky mozzarella and fresh cream.Danish dish Smorrebrod with Anchovy Paste, an open-faced sandwich, has toasted bread drizzled with fresh lettuce. It is divine with the tangy flavour of marinated tomatoes and savoury anchovies. I can taste a hint of basil, roasted pepper and olive oil.Asian cuisine is served with dips that have soy sauce and garlic and Mediterranean dishes have creamy cheesy dips.For the dessert, I am served Orchard Fresh Sorbet that excels in presentation. There are fruit jellies and roll ups. You can pick from three kinds of sorbet -- the brown one that is Chocolate-Chilli flavored, white is Kaffir Lime and Coconut flavoured, and red is Mixed Berry. I try Chocolate Chilli sorbet first, out of curiosity. It tastes first of chocolate then the hotness of the chilli shoots in. The chilli is an after-taste. The Kaffir Lime-Coconut is tangy and creamy. The Mixed Berry sorbet tastes like something you can layer on a bread, instead of jam.Approximate cost for two: `1,400 without alcohol."
58fd441d7be9e06c93718510,The powerful speeches of late AIADMK supremo Jayalalithaa,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/dec/05/the-powerful-speeches-of-late-aiadmk-supremo-jayalalithaa-1545887.html,2016-12-05,"In her more than three-decade career in politics, Jayalalithaa did not confine herself to Tamil Nadu, but also spoke forcefully in Parliament. During her stint as Rajya Sabha MP in 1984-1989, her speecheson a variety of topics, including women empowerment, education and dowry system, impressed none other than Indira Gandhi and MGR himself.These speeches also reflected her strong character. Express chronicles some of her speeches during a stellar tenure in the Upper House.On the honour of being a Rajya Sabha MPI deem it a great honour to stand here and speak on the floor of the very same Rajya Sabha where 22 years ago, in 1962 our great departed leader Anna rose to make his forceful maiden speech which electrified the entire nation. While Anna electrified the whole country with his maiden speech, the theme of my maiden speech today is going to be dedicated mainly to the subject of electricity.My leader, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. M.G.R., the founder leader of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to which I have the honour to belong, has sent me here, together with my colleagues in the party, to echo the voice of the people of Tamil Nadu in this national forum. In particular, I have come here as the representative of the weaker sections of our society, the toiling masses, the crores of humble workers, farmers, poor agricultural labourers and women, to give oral manifestation to their feelings, aspirations and legitimate desires and make them known to the rest of the country.There are many senior Members here, who are far more knowledgeable than I am, and vastly richer in experience. Some of them may disagree with some of the views I put forth. They may dispute a certain point I make, and by virtue of their debating skills they may even win the argument. But such a victory will be only a victory of words, and not triumph over truth.I wish to emphasize the fact that the fundamental purpose of my speaking here in the Rajya Sabha is not to engage in wordy duels with other Members, but to state positive truths to the best of my knowledge and to draw the attention of the nation to certain crucial issues.-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas maiden speech in the Rajya Sabha, April 23, 1984Read AIADMK chief's speeches in RS here:On States contribution to the Centres financesSir, we speak of the Consolidated Fund of India. How is this Fund formed in the first place? What constitutes its reserves? Is it not the revenue contributed in several ways by all the States of India that constitutes the Consolidated Fund of India? Through innumerable taxes the States regularly part with massive sums of money -- like sacrificial oblations at the altar of the Central Government -- and it is the States which keep replenishing the reserves of the Consolidated Fund of India.Sir, we understand very well the necessity for such a Fund. But the rates of taxation are so high and the range of taxation is so all-encompassing that the Centre practically appropriates all the money that is available and the State Governments are left with little or no funds to administer the States they are responsible for.Even the water we drink is taxed. The only item -- if I may so refer to it -- that is left untaxed is the air we breathe, and even that air is not free -- I mean, it is not free from pollution. It is contaminated with smog and harmful oxides and poisonous fumes. As such, is it not natural for the States to expect sufficient Central investment in each State in direct proportion to the contribution the State makes to the gross national revenue?-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas intervention during discussion on the Appropriation Bill, 25.4.1984Why should the southern states be punished?Where the northern States of India are concerned, whichever political party has been the ruling party in power at the Centre has also been the ruling party in those States all along. If no industries have been started in those northern States all these years, certainly Tamil Nadu or any of the other southern States cannot be blamed for this deplorable state of affairs.If no industries have been developed in so many districts of the northern States, that is entirely due to the gross inefficiency and glaring acts of omission of the governments of those States. Why should Tamil Nadu have to pay the penalty for this gross negligence and maladministration on the part of those north Indian State Governments? Indeed, why should all the four southern States be penalised for no fault of theirs?-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas intervention during discussion on the Appropriation Bill, 25.4.1984On the distance between justice and the southThe distance between Madras and Delhi is 2,540 kilometres. The distance between Tirunelveli and Delhi is 3,000 kilometres. I beseech the Government of India to think of the plight of a poor man in TamilNadu who is compelled to seek justice in a court of law. Even if the need arises, can a poor man from the South even dream of travelling all the way to New Delhi to seek recourse in the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court? Even if he somehow manages to reach Delhi, still there is the language problem. To travel to New Delhi to seek justice in the Supreme Court is not within the reach of the average middle class citizen of India either, not if he happened to live in the South. It is, therefore, essential to establish a Bench of the Supreme Court in Madras to put justice within the reach of the common man in South India.-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas intervention during discussion on the Appropriation Bill, 25.4.1984On Tamils claim to classical language statusThe Government of India recognises Sanskrit as an ancient classical language and spends vast sums of money for research and development in the interest of preserving our ancient cultural and literary heritage.Tamil is also a very ancient language. In fact Tamil is not only the oldest language but the oldest living ancient classical language in the world today.The Government of India has formulated a yardstick - a list of conditions which form the criteria for recognising a language as a classical language.According to the Government of India, the characteristics of a classical language are 7 in number. The first condition is: (1) It should contain a body of literature and grammar which is ancient.Tamil has a body of literature called the Sangam Anthologies and the grammar called Tolkappiyam, which are assigned to the first few centuries before the birth of Christ even by the most sceptical historians of literature. It is doubtful whether any other language can match Tamil in this regard. Probably only the antiquity of Greek can be compared with the ancientness of Tamil.Out of the 7 conditions set down by the Government of India for a language to be officially recognised as a classical language, Tamil fulfils 6 of the conditions. But the 7th condition is not applicable to Tamil.What is the 7th condition? ""That the language is rarely spoken and its text is understood with the help of dictionaries or specialists."" Is it only a language which has been totally forgotten by the people that can be accepted as a classical language? Is it only a language which survives with the aid of a few pandits that should be recognised as a classical language? How can this be considered fair or just? What justice is there in this sort of a stricture?Classical languages which satisfy all 7 conditions, including the want of speakers in modern times are Latin and Sanskrit. Whereas Greek, Arabic and Tamil continue to be spoken by millions today. Classical Greek or Arabic or Tamil is different from the modern dialect of Greek or Arabic or Tamil. Hence classical languages are divided into those with continuity and those without continuity. Sanskrit, Latin etc. belong to the second category i.e., - without continuity. Greek, Arabic and Tamil belong to the 1st category i.e. with continuity.Since the discovery and publication of the Tamil Sangam Classics were late, there was an early erroneous impression that the Dravidian literature is a derivate of Sanskrit. This impression was dispelled as soon as the Tamil Sangam classics were published. The fact that this independent and secular body of literature and grammar had influenced all the Southern Languages and even the Vedic and Classical Sanskrit was established by eminent research Scholars like Gundert, Caldwell, Kitel, Burrow etc. and the influence of the ancient Tamil Sangam literature on Sanskrit has now been argued cogently by George Hart.Recognition of Tamil as a classical language by the Government of India is long overdue. Just as the Government of India has accorded Sanskrit recognition as a classical language it should also accord the same to Tamil. Such recognition will enable this country and the world to appreciate the antiquity of the Tamil language and the great diversity of its literature and add glory to the cultural heritage of the country.The great Tamil poet Bharatidasan has magnificently described the genesis of Tamil in the following exquisite words. Bharatidasan says:When the moon first began its orbitwhen the sun first shone forth in all its brilliancewhen the skies were first createdwhen the radiant stars were first born in the skieswhen the first cloud formations began to gatherwhen the waves in the ocean first began to surge forththat was when our great Tamil language was also born in all its resplendence.We, the Tamilians, were born along with that age-old Tamil language. I have the honour to come from and represent that glorious land of the Tamils, Tamil Nadu.-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas speech during the debate on the working of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Social Welfare on 5 May, 1984Sir, why is Hindi cricket commentary in English?Now, Sir, take for instance the cricket test commentary which is given in the country through AIR and Doordarshan. I am only pointing out that the Hindi language does not have the required vocabulary; it does not contain enough words in the lexicon. Now the Government of India has made it compulsory that the cricket commentary should be broadcast in Hindi as well as in English.Now, Sir, if you listen to the Hindi commentary on a cricket test just for five minutes, and people all over the country follow the international test cricket match commentary with great interest, you will find that 99 per cent of the commentary is in English. They simply have not been able to coin words in Hindi for the usual terms used in cricketing jargon.Now, if you listen to the commentary, you will find that except for the most mundane phrases such as Wo dowdkar aaya, woh balle baazi kar rahe hai..., Aur unhone gend phenk di ... other than that 99% of the commentary is in English. To describe field placements such as slip, gully, mid-off, mid-on or technical terms such as wicket, batting average, or bowling average or maiden over there are simply no words in Hindi for these terms. Who is benefiting by this? Is this not an enormous waste of time and money? It may as well be that the whole commentary is done in English. The one thing that the listeners are interested in is the score. And that is the one thing they invariably give in shudh Hindi. It makes the listeners want to cry, to tear their hair in frustration.-- Excerpt from Jayalalithaas speech during the debate on the working of the Ministry of Education, Culture and Social Welfare on 5 May, 1984The case of Cuckoo, the film star who was reduced to penuryWhere cinema artistes are concerned, how many people care to analyse the fact or realise the truth that their earning span is limited to only a few years? So much adverse damaging publicity is given to film stars, so many myths are built around them that the harsh realities of their existence are clouded over by deliberately nurtured wrong impressions.Is there any guaranteed income for a cinema artiste? None at all. There are no rules or regulations that guarantee a steady income in the cinema industry. There is not even the assurance of a minimum wage.In Government service, if a person qualifies as an IAS Officer, he is assured of a steady job and a regular salary, and he has the security of assured employment until the age of retirement after which he is entitled to receive a pension and provident fund upon retirement. He has something to fall back upon.In the cinema industry there are no guarantees or safeguards for anything.Out of the thousands of eager aspirants to stardom, how many are really successful? How many reach the top income bracket? Only a handful. And even in these cases there is no guarantee as to how long the period of success will last. Everything depends on that most elusive and unreliable factor called luck.A very few persons may continue to earn for a long period, but in many cases the earning span of a film artiste may be limited to just two years or three years. Their income depends on their popularity with the masses, and popularity is a very ephemeral, transient thing. It is here today, gone tomorrow. No one can predict how or when this may happen.There have been several cases of cinema stars who faded out after just one or two years of success. It should be borne in mind that the income such a person manages to earn within the short span of those two years, has to last him or her for the rest of his or her lifetime. Most of these persons are not qualified to enter any other kind of service. They have no other means of earning a livelihood. When cinema artistes lose their popularity and grow old, nobody comes forward to support them. The Government of India which squeezes the life-blood out of such artistes in their heyday, does not come to their rescue in their old age, or when they fall upon hard times, after their earning span is over.Many of the senior Members in this House who have seen Hindi films in their youth, will certainly remember the famous dancer Cuckoo, who was a rage in the early days of the Indian talkies. Cuckoo was the highest paid actress of her time. In those days, when even the topmost actress was paid Rs. 2,500 for playing the female lead in an entire film, Cuckoo was paid Rs. 10,000 just for a single dance sequence in a film.But all too soon her glory faded. Audience tastes changed. Fresh new faces arrived on the scene, and inevitably, after a brief spell of dizzy success, Cuckoo was consigned to oblivion.Her last years were truly miserable. She lived in a dismal one-room apartment, which was really only a shed, a hovel, in one of the slum areas of Bombay. She was reduced to absolute penury. She literally had to starve. In addition to all this suffering, she was stricken by cancer.Her sufferings exceeded all descriptions. In her last days, it was Mr. Sunil Dutt and the late Mrs Nargis Dutt, who was an Hon'ble Member of this House, who discovered Cuckoo's pathetic condition. The Dutts had her admitted in the hospital and paid for her medical treatment, but it was too late. Just a few years ago, Cuckoo died, lonely, forgotten, unwept, unhonoured and unsung. There was no one to even claim the body or arrange for the funeral.I can give you many more such examples, some of which I have seen with my own eyes... I myself, during my tenure in films saw the sudden rise and fall of many such personalities. I also saw how they were hounded and harassed by the Income-Tax authorities during their all too brief spell of success, and even long after they had ceased to earn any income.But I do not want to take the valuable time of the House by narrating any more such details. I think the example of Cuckoo will suffice to make my point.It is a myth that blackmoney is hoarded only by those in the cinema industry. BIack money is generated and circulated not by a handful of actors or actresses but by wealthy capitalists and smugglers. Many well-known, notorious smugglers openly declare how much money they have given to which political parties and which politicians. There are politicians who, in public, touch the feet of smugglers and pay obeisance to them. Why do they do it? Because they need money for elections. Smugglers have the money, and they are willing to donate liberally to politicians in exchange for favours. The money provided by smugglers to finance elections is black money.Therefore if the evil of black money is to be rooted out, one of the important steps towards the achievement of this goal is to enact the necessary legislation whereby the entire election expenses will be borne by the Government through the Election Commission.-- Debate on taxation law, Rajya Sabha, 27 August, 1984Through you Sir, I wish to draw the attention of the Government of India, in particular the Ministry of Social and Women's Welfare, to a news item entitled Sorry Plight of Women's Home in The Indian Express dated 19th August 1985.It graphically describes the inhuman, barbaric and horrifying conditions in which the women inmates of a Women's Protection Home are forcibly kept, in the Mahila Ashrya Garh in Bharatpur, Rajastan, which is run by the Government.The women inmates are treated worse than animals. They are not provided with even the basic, elementary necessities for human existence. They are tortured and beaten by male and female chowkidars even during pregnancy. They are not even provided with soap to clean themselves. They are given only one saree to wear, and when that single saree is washed and dried, they have nothing with which to cover themselves while that one saree is drying in the sunlight.In short, this co-called ""Mahila Ashram"" is worse than a medieval jail where the women inmates have to starve for everything including water, food, proper clothes and sanitation. They are kept as bonded labourers and tortured and beaten at the slightest pretext.The deplorable horrific conditions in this Women's Home are nothing new. Though it is shocking to hear about them, we are inured to such shocks as such instances are common place in our country. Probably we would be really shocked if we came across a Women's Home which is genuinely well run and where the inmates are decently treated for a change.--Special mention in the Rajya Sabha, 20 August, 1985When something has suffered, it becomes more beautifulThis place offers hope, and hope brings about healing. When the Japanese mend broken objects, they aggrandize the damage, by filling the cracks with gold. They believe that, when something has suffered damage, and has a history, it becomes more beautiful. This indeed is true, for the millions of cancer survivors, who have come out stronger, and more beautiful than before.-- Speech at the diamond jubilee celebrations of the Cancer Institute, June 12, 2013The Central Government has been completely ineffective in playing its constitutional role in ensuring that the final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal is duly notified so that it can be implemented and the rights of Tamil Nadu as a lower riparian State are protected. The Central Government has also failed in protecting the citizens of the country  the fishermen belonging to Tamil Nadu  from attacks across the maritime boundary.-- Speech to the National Development Council, Oct.27, 2012The only state to provide free riceTamil Nadu is the only State in the country, which provides rice free of cost to the people under thePublic Distribution System. There is therefore a temptation to smuggle out rice meant for the Public Distribution System. It must be remembered that the State spends nearly 3,300 crore rupees on providing free rice to its citizens. Therefore there is a great responsibility cast upon the district administration to ensure that the illegal transportation of rice is not permitted across the State borders.-- Speech to district collectors, 27 Dec 2012The Centre remains disdainfully aloof from the peoples real needsWe have assembled yet again for what are turning out to be purely periodic rituals  this time the 57th National Development Council meeting. To be honest, the purpose and intention of such meetings completely eludes me. We are already nearly three-quarters of the way into the first year of the Twelfth Plan. I wonder whether it would be useful to comment on the contents of the 12th Five-Year Plan for which this National development Council meeting has been convened.We get the impression that the Government at the Centre is indifferent about reducing poverty. Large scale poverty and inequality persists and even widens with every Plan. The Union Government, far from serving the common man/woman, is conspiring against him/her by hiking the prices of essential commodities and inputs and appears more focused on facilitating the interests of foreign investors. The regime at the Centre, caught up in the daily squabbles of its constituents, in merely trying to survive from day to day, has neither the time nor the inclination to pay attention to the problems of the people of this country.When we assembled last in this forum more than a year ago, many of the Honble Chief Ministers present here and I had made several valuable and useful suggestions on the Approach to the Twelfth Plan. Given that it took nearly 14 months for the final draft of the Twelfth Plan to be prepared, I had a fond hope that at least some of the suggestions made in the last NDC meeting would find their way into the final Plan Document. Unfortunately, when I read the draft Plan Document, I found that no reasonable and legitimate suggestion from the States has been accepted and the big brotherly and undemocratic approach of superimposing on elected State Governments the dubious policies, priorities and programmes of a minority ruling coterie in Delhi has prevailed.The Central Government has miserably failed in effective economic management of the country and is now forcing the resultant hardship on the people at large. We in Tamil Nadu have been particularly hard hit by the attitude of the Government of India. Every single legitimate request of our State has been turned down or ignored and every initiative stymied. We have repeatedly demanded action on critical issues affecting our State but the Centre has failed to take cognizance. I made a request for a package of assistance from the Central Government as soon as I assumed office last year, but till date and even after repeated reminders, the Centre is insensitive to the request made and demands raised.The Central Government has been completely ineffective in playing its constitutional role in ensuring that the Final award of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal is duly notified so that it can be implemented and the rights of Tamil Nadu as a lower riparian State are protected. The Central Government has also failed in protecting the citizens of the country  the fishermen belonging to Tamil Nadu - from attacks across the maritime boundary. This vindictive and discriminative act of the Government of India is highly condemnable and is yet another example of subverting the interest of the common people and the ruling dispensations perpetual pandering to allies to ensure the survival of the Central Government.As the Central Government remains aloof and disdainfully distant from the peoples real needs, there have been efforts to arrogate greater powers by the Central Government for itself, by reducing the role of States which can only jeopardize the peoples welfare. As the elected head of the Government of Tamil Nadu, while I shall continue to demand for the State what should rightfully belong to it, I cannot let down the people by merely waiting for the Central Government to act on various development initiatives. The State aims to forge ahead and we are embarking on many path-breaking initiatives. In the Twelfth Plan, our State is poised to reach a higher growth trajectory.-- Speech to the National Development Council, New Delhi, Dec. 27, 2012"

With hardly anything left of the rice the farm worker had borrowed from her neighbour, and no money for vegetables, pulses or milk formula for her three-month-old baby, she has pinned her hopes on her husband Babu returning with money from the bank 10 km away. This was his third trip to the bank to exchange their only Rs. 1000 note.Babu and others from Kannankottai, a remote agricultural village 70 km from Chennai near Gummidipoondi in Thiruvallur district, waited in the queue outside Canara Bank at Madharpakkam to get a token to enter the premises the next day.Demonetisation has been a double-blow to the people of Kannankottai, who were still recovering from the drought this year. The economy has almost come to a standstill since demonetisation and the streets are deserted. Kirana stores have started to shut and people hardly step out.Villagers from Kannankottai | D Sampath KumarHowever, the barter system has given some respite to Kannankottai, even if temporary. While caste Hindus in the village share milk from the cows in their backyards, Dalits in the Adi Dravidar Colony have to struggle to buy milk packets for their children. Some are at the mercy of hotels in the highway for rice as PDS outlets have not reached out to them since September. One woman, S Malliamma (54), legs swollen due to a ligament tear, said she sat outside a motel in Kemalur village since early morning for a half-cup of rice which the owner had promised to lend her.With poor bus connectivity and very few two-wheelers, Kannankottai depends heavily on share autos. Rubbing salt into their wounds, one of the two share autos connecting the village to the main road sprang a tyre, and its owner doesnt have new currency notes to replace it. So, villagers walk all the way to Madharpakkam or even Kavaraipettai town located 18 km away to catch a bus. And the buses do not accept demonetised notes. The small amount of gold and silver some of the villagers have has been of much use. The only pawn shop in the panchayat shut down a few days ago.With none of the landowners here taking up cultivation and the MGNREGA scheme coming to a halt, people have started taking up odd jobs in neighbouring towns for survival. But things got gloomier still after Nov. 8 as their new employers ran short of cash to pay them.We did not get our wages (Rs. 120/day) for five days. After repeated requests, the middlemen paid the wages of five people from our street (Rs. 3,000) on Tuesday, said J Munirathnam. The daily-wage labourer was made to walk all the way to the bank to get new notes and he returned empty-handed because of the queue there.Unlike cities, we prefer to have cash in hand to meet unexpected expenses, said E Govindasamy. For instance, if there is a disease outbreak, farmers have to buy pesticides, pay workers and get things done in a short span. You cant expect them to go to a bank or ATM located miles away then, he says.Expecting rains in November, many land owners had borrowed money to the tune of a few lakhs to invest in the new crop. But the monsoons has failed and local banks are not accepting demonetised notes. Though banks in the towns do accept them, many villagers have no knowledge of PAN cards or even have bank accounts. And those who do have accounts are being asked to furnish their source of income.Narrating an incident, D Dayalan, a villager, said a 17-year-old girl studying engineering approached a bank in the district to deposit Rs. 25,000 that her father had saved for her marriage over four years. Suspecting a sudden jump in income, the bank manager threatened to scrap her educational loan-cum-scholarship.Some who had taken crop loans are unable to repay them because agriculture cooperative societies were closed, What does the government expect us to do with these notes? asks Dayalan."

Many of them have been emulated by other states and they also attracted the attention of some foreign countries. Mostly poor and downtrodden women, girls and farmers were the beneficiaries of Jayalalithaas welfare policy.It would not be an exaggeration to say that Tamil Nadu became the fountainhead of welfare schemes whenever Jayalalithaa was in power. Jayalalithaas first tenure as Chief Minister during 1991-96 was marked by many new schemes like the revolutionary Cradle Baby Scheme aimed at eliminating the practice of female infanticide  which was prevalent in many parts of the State  and starting of All Women Police Stations, etc. Her second tenure as Chief Minister too had many innovative schemes.The Farmers Security Scheme, one of her more important schemes, ensured the welfare of farmers and their family members from womb to tomb. The Rainwater Harvesting Scheme was meant to ensure the availability of drinking water to all people. Then there was the Integrated Women Sanitary Complexes in all 12,796 village panchayats, besides the distribution of bicycles to SC/ST students of Class 11 and Class 12 courses, aimed at controlling the school drop-out rate. Jayalalithaas final stints as Chief Minister during 2011-15 and 2015-16 saw the distribution of 20kg rice free of cost to 1.83 crore family card-holders and 35 kg rice free of cost to the Antyodaya Anna Yojana card-holders (poorest of the poor) through the Public Distribution System, gold for making Thaali (thirumangalyam) Scheme for girls hailing from poor families. Setting up of over 1,000 Amma Canteens across the State, launching of several Amma-brand schemes  Amma Pharmacy, Amma Drinking Water, Amma Cement, Amma Salt, Amma Special Master Health Check-up Scheme for Women, Amma Mobile Phone Scheme for SHGs, distribution of fans, mixies and grinders to 1.83 families, distribution of 60,000 milch cows, four goats each for seven lakh families, distribution of free laptops to Class 11 and 12 students (it has been extended to other students as well), providing sanitary napkins free of cost to adolescent girls, new mothers, women in prisons, etc.After assuming charge as the Chief Minister on May 25, this term, she rolled out many Ammabrand schemes  Amma Marriage Halls, 500 Amma Parks with several facilities in rural areas, 500 Amma Gymnasiums to help rural youth keep fit.Cradle Baby SchemeTo curb the social menace of female infanticide in Tamil Nadu and protect children, the government headed by Jayalalithaa launched the Cradle Baby Scheme in Salem district in 1992. She also launched a secondary scheme  Girl Child Protection Scheme  to go hand-in-hand with the Cradle Baby Scheme to ensure elimination of female infanticide. Under the scheme, children abandoned by parents are cared for, received in hospitals, primary health centres, childrens homes and protective homes. The Cradle Baby Scheme is active in Salem, Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Dharmapuri, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Villupuram and Tiruvannamalai districts. With the child sex ratio, a critical indicator of gender inequality, which has declined in 27 States and Union Territories, including Delhi, in the 2011 census, there has seen an upward trend in Tamil Nadu due to the Cradle Baby Scheme.Farmers Security SchemeThe scheme takes care of all small/marginal farmers who own less than 2.5 acres of wetlands or five acres of dry lands and are directly involved in agricultural operations, cultivating tenants, and agricultural labourers in the age group of 18-65 years, who are doing work related to agriculture. These people are eligible for registration as members under the Farmers Security Scheme, which also offers assistance to farmers and their dependants.Integrated sanitarycomplexes for women in all village panchayatsResponding to the sanitation needs of women, the State government decided in 2001 to build Integrated Sanitary Complexes for Women in all the then existing 12,618 village panchayats of the state, on an approximate area of 750 sq.ft. each. Each complex had 14 water closets, two bathrooms, one pump room with pump set, one water tub and stonepaved washing facilities. Adequate water supply for washing and bathing was also provided. The village panchayats provided electricity connections for water supply and lighting, and the allotted families maintained the upkeep of the complex. The complexes are provided with incinerators for disposal of sanitary napkins.Amma canteens for one & allPerhaps one of the most enterprising and popular schemes, Amma canteens found resonance among the masses. Amma canteens sell food items at highly-subsidised rates. Launched in Chennai, these canteens are a boon for daily wage workers, slumdwellers, as well as those from low-income sections. The scheme was launched by J Jayalalithaa on February 19, 2013 and since then, the number of these canteens has gone up. The scheme has been extended to other corporations and municipalities. Totally, there are over 650 Amma Canteens across the state.Rain Water Harvesting SchemeJayalalithaa launched the historical Rain Water Harvesting movement in the State in 2001. Legislative measures were taken to make installation of Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) structures mandatory in all buildings. Till June 2016, of 42.55 lakh buildings in corporations (except Chennai) and municipalities, 35.09 lakh buildings (25,650 government buildings and 34.84 lakh private buildings) were provided with RWH structures. Rain Water Harvesting in urban local bodies has also been given a major thrust. Out of 1,482 ponds and temple tanks, 716 have been provided with RWH structures. With this drive, 82 per cent of buildings and 48.31 per cent of ponds and tanks have been covered up to June 2016. Last year, Jayalalithaa announced the Sustainable Water Security Mission which aims at campus rainwater harvesting, stormwater harvesting, renovation of waterbodies with community involvement and recycling and reusing greywater.FREE BUS PASS MINERAL WATER SCHEME AMMA SEEDS AMMA MASTER HEALTH CHECK-UP ALL WOMEN POLICE STATIONS AMMA HEALTH PLAN FARMERS SECURITY SCHEME FARM FRESH CONSUMER OUTLETS HEALTH INSURANCE FOR SRI LANKAN TAMIL REFUGEES AMMA CANTEENS FREE MIXIES, GRINDERS AND FANS CRADLE BABY SCHEME MONTHLY PENSION FOR TRANSGENDERS MINERAL WATER SCHEME AMMA SEEDS AMMA MASTER HEALTH CHECK-UP ALL WOMEN POLICE STATIONS AMMA HEALTH PLAN FARMERS SECURITY SCHEME FARM FRESH CONSUMER OUTLETS HEALTH INSURANCE FOR SRI LANKAN REFUGEES CRADLE BABY SCHEME MONTHLY PENSION FOR TRANSGENDERS AMMA CANTEENS FREE MIXIES, GRINDERS AND FANS"

Some hotels had to turn away customers as the outlets did not have change to return.Business was not as usual at the Ambur Rawther Biriyani Centre, near the Koyambedu flyover, a small shop which caters to poor sections of society. We used to sell biriyani as well as white rice by 2 pm. Now, we hardly have customers and the entire food is getting wasted, rued the owner.Many of them came with Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currencies. We turned them away, she said. Usually, we make around Rs 2,000 a day by selling Biriyani. Today, we could barely touch Rs 1,000, she said.The story was similar in most of the small and medium hotels as they saw poor patronage on Wednesday. With people hardly having any cash due to closure of ATMs, many were struggling to get food.Workers in Sivasakthi fish stall who usually eat at Krishna Bhavan Hotel near Kilpauk had to go on empty stomach as the hotel was shut. Reason, it did not have change to pay back its customers. I did not have change to buy even a cup of tea. I had only Rs 500. So, I avoided it, said Kannan.Hotels like Karthick Tiffin Centre which is usually crowded in the mornings as well as for lunch was hit as the number of customers came down to less than 50 per cent. While our breakfast sales came down from Rs 15,000 a day to Rs 9,000, our lunch sales dropped from Rs 40,000 a day to less than Rs 20,000. Nearly, 50 kg of rice went waste, said a worker in the tiffin outlet.It was a day of dull sales for mutton, chicken and fish stalls too. The fish stall had to down the shutters early as it hardly had any customer. Our losses for today was around Rs 50,000, said the owner."

Its study said stormy rains could increase alarmingly  by about a fifth in the Cauvery delta region, coupled with a spike in temperature by as much as 1.5 degree Celsius. Add to these, the never-ending dispute over water-sharing.It is clear that the need of the hour is a long-lasting, two-prong strategy that involves climate change resistant crops and overhauling of the irrigation system for optimum use of available water.Rice, the most common produce from the region, is a water-intensive crop. Experts say about 3,000 to 5,000 litres of water is needed to produce a kg of rice. This is something huge to ask of a State that has about 41 per cent less per capital availability of water when compared to the national average - 900 cubic metres per annum as against the national average of 1,545 cubic metres. This has created an almost absolute dependency on the Cauvery.Though traditional paddy breeds are more resilient to the vagaries of climate, their yield is low when compared to the better breeds. Unfortunately, the better breeds are not resilient to climate change. This, however, cannot be a reason to abandon paddy crop. As rice is the staple food in Tamil Nadu, any sudden shift to alternative crops would affect food security, say agriculture experts. Paddy is the suitable crop for delta districts, where the soil will not permit any other alternative cropping practice. To sustain agriculture in the face of multiple challenges, we have to develop high yield paddy breed that also defies climate change, and also promote micro irrigation system, Dr P Pandiarajan, dean of Anbil Dharmalingam Agriculture College and Research Institute near here, tells Express.Following micro irrigation techniques can help avoid complete reliance on canal irrigation - drip irrigation, for instance, can reduce water consumption by half, experts say. When we randomly wet the crop, chances are equally high for the weeds to grow between the main crop. Since drip irrigation is based on the water requirement of the crop, as much as 50 per cent of water can be saved, Pandiarajan adds.Molecular breedingBoth traditional and modern (post-Green Revolution) paddy breeds have their advantages and disadvantages. The former is more resistant to the changes in weather, but the latter gives more yield.Through molecular breeding, we can combine the resistance and low maintenance qualities of the traditional breeds and the high yield potential of the modern breeds to produce a new breed, said agronomy assistant professor Dr T Ramesh.Experts suggest that this new breed can be planted during the Kuruvai (short-term) season for which water availability is less. It will also ensure that the Samba (long-term) crop can be left untouched till the results are clear. It is not just the agriculture research institutes here that are involved in these efforts. Even the International Rice Research Institute has been working at producing multi stress tolerant paddy breed. We cannot keep on growing the same paddy breeds, we also need to promote alternative crop. Governments should support that type of cultivation, for which we need to change our food consumption style, said Mahadhanapuram Rajaram, president of Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association."

They also warned an indefinite hunger strike, if no action was taken within a month.Around 60 kilometres from Villupuram headquarters, in Veeranamur village, located south of Gingee Taluk, is a settlement of Irulas, housing more than 100 members on a poramboke land. They have been been living here for more than 100 years, since the time of their grandparents.Driven by poverty, they were lured by middlemen and were engaged in bonded labour in brick kilns, blue metal crushing yard and rice mills in Kancheepuram, Thiruvalluvar, Poonnamalle and Gingee for several decades, till their rescue in 2009 by police and revenue officials, based on information provided by International Justice Mission (IJM), an NGO that works for rehabilitation of bonded labourers.They then returned to their village and began working as daily wage labourers. In July this year, Public Works Department (PWD) officials came to their settlement with earthmovers and asked them to evict immediately, claiming that they have encroached water catchment area, said Chinnasamy (35), a resident.The officials left with a warning to vacate the land within three months. Though the members were issued release certificates after they were rescued, the families were yet to get community certificates and land pattas. With no place to go, the members have threatened to resort to indefinite hunger strike in front of the Collectorate. Recalling their harrowing experience as bonded labourers, Chinnasamy (35), who had been working in a brick kiln chamber in Poonnamalle since the age of 10, said,It all started during my grandfathers time. A huge drought had hit our village and we were struggling to even have one square meal a day. Some persons from our community, working in Chennai, lured us, including my grandfather, promising work with a decent salary and food, and sold us to brick kiln and rice mills owners. However, we received meagre wages and no food.We took Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 as loan from our owners, whenever we needed to visit our village. Unable to repay debts with the meagre salary, we had to continue working till the intervention of IJM in 2009, he added. Kathavarayan (61), another Irula, said, After we were rescued, the officials gave us free farming tools. We returned to our village and started working as farm hands. We were living peacefully until the PWD officials threatened to evict us.Professor Prabha Kalvimani, founder and organizer Pazhangudi Irular Pathukappu Sangam (PIPS), said, Though members belonging to various communities are hired as daily wage workers in brick kilns and rice mills, its only the Irulas who face exploitation and get treated as bonded labourers, as the owners are well aware that they are a marginalised section,he added.The Pazhangudi Irular Pathukappu Sangam found that about 152 members belonging to Irula community from Gingee, Tindivanam and Marakkanam did not have land patta. The NGO sent a petition to various authorities, requesting land pattas.Though PIPS received an acknowledgment, which stated that the petition had been forwarded to Villupuram SC/ST Welfare Department, no further action was taken. Special tahsildar of Tindivanam/Gingee Pushpavathi said she received the notification from the office of Chief Secretary of Tribal Welfare department, asking to furnish the details of Irula community members of Tindivanam, Marakkanam and Gingee, only last week. The report will be forwarded to the higher-ups at the earliest."

Farmers protest have finally paid off, said Somu Ilango, an organic farmer from tail-end part of the delta.It was renowned organic farming expert and activist Nammalvar who spearheaded the protest against the project across delta districts, particularly in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts, in early 2013. He brought the farmers together and even managed to mobilise support from those outside the farming community. In fact, on December 30 that year, the day he died, the activist was on the way to take part in a protest against the project.Many from the region including those from villages including Mathirimangalam and Adiyamangalam in Nagapattinam district were booked for staging protests and allegedly damaging property during their agitations. Now that the project has been given up for good, farmers urged the authorities to withdraw the pending police cases. They have also seeking financial support to restore their lands, which were affected by the preliminary work on exploration, to the original state.Meanwhile, leaders including MDMK general secretary Vaiko, BJP State president Tamilisai Soundararajan, Poovulagin Nanbargal, an NGO that opposed the project, and many farmers associations received the news with enthusiasm.Methane extraction project was to be implemented in 691 sq.km involving 50 villages in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts.

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

More importantly, the order came from an ayurveda hospital, which showed the growing demand for Keralas ethnic rice varieties for their medicinal properties.Johnson, 52, had switched to organic farming only after he migrated from Angamaly in Ernakulam in 2006. His decision to cultivate ethnic rice varieties - some varieties are claimed to be 2,500 years old - is clearly bearing fruit. Authorities of the ayurveda hospital at Koilandy asked me to supply as much as I could, and I supplied them 550 kg, almost the entire stock I had, says Johnson.There are about 250 ethnic rice varieties in Kerala, and the efforts to popularise them has witnessed the revival of 50 such rice variants.Johnson is among the new-generation farmers who are leading the mini red revolution (a large number of ethnic rice varieties are russet or copper-red in colour) in the State, reviving many of the lost or diminishing indigenous rice varieties.Rajesh Nair is another new-generation paddy farmer in the area who quit working for the Green Peace in order to plunge full-time into organic cultivation of ethnic rice varieties. He reckons that there is a strong and clear shift towards ethnic rice farming, and the trend is fast gathering momentum. The seed festivals (vithulsavam) conducted from Thirssur to Kasargod saw 2,500-3,000 farmers gathering to collect seeds of traditional paddy varieties, clearly indicating which way the wind is blowing, explains Rajesh, who has been cultivating the Wayanadan thondi variety that is known for its taste and large grains, in seven-and-half acres.Kochi-based Harinath D Bharatiyan is perhaps the most active among the new breed of farmers who promote traditional rice varieties. He has been cultivating nine ethnic rice varieties, including gandhakasala and mullankaima in a large field taken on lease in Wayanad. The young farmer recently launched Organic Kochi, an online store for traditional products including various organic rice varieties.Harinath feels that the best way to preserve the States ethnic rice is to encourage people to grow them. There is no point in storing the seeds, if we do not intend to grow them. The farmers would cultivate ethnic rice varieties only if they are assured a good price, and that is what we are doing, says Harinath.Linesh K, programme officer at Thiruvananthapuram-based NGO Thanal that has been spearheading the efforts to preserve highly nutritious ethnic rice varieties, says around 50 rice varieties were being revived, albeit moderately in terms of the quantities produced. Clearly, there has been an increase in awareness about the ethnic rice varieties, and the appetite for the same is growing among consumers, he says.Awareness about the nutritional, aromatic and medicinal properties of ethnic rice varieties is growing even among the common man Most of the customers are now asking for the ethnic varieties by their names, which is a big positive, points out Harinath.The next sowing season for ethnic rice varieties begins in December in Wayanad."

The initiate requires several reformations so as to reduce discrepancies and curb involvement of middle-men in ration supplies. As part of reforming the public distribution system, we will computerise the 14,300-odd ration outlets in the state. We are planning to introduce door-to-door delivery and to supply food grains directly from warehouses of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) to ration outlets and other government-run outlets. The initiative is expected to eliminate middlemen completely, and ensure effective distribution, he said.Another challenge faced by the Department is issuance of rations cards, which is expected to be completed by March 1, 2017. The previous government had prepared a taluk-wise list of priority and non-priority beneficiaries in the State for implementing the NFSA. However, there was a deluge of complaints with regard to the rankings. Considering such issues, the new government has revised the rankings - the draft of which is expected to be published very soon.The beneficiaries will be offered an opportunity to incorporate corrections at the panchayat level, and the district level later. New ration cards will be issued on the basis of the final list to be prepared by the district-level committee headed by the District Collector, he said. The minister saidthe Civil Supplies Department was planning to procure food grains and other commodities directly from farmers and local mills to reduce the prices. He claimed that local suppliers, especially rice suppliers from Andhra Pradesh, were asked to take part in the tendering process directly."

Along with buses, cars, two-wheelers and autorickshaws were also allowed inside, which added to the chaos in the parking lot.The situation at the dining hall wasnt good either. The dining hall (for non-VIPs), which can accommodate at least 3,500 people at once, wasnt properly managed. Meals were served from 10.30 am for the guests.

The police had a close shave on Monday when a seven-member strong, armed-Naxal gang organising a campaign at Mundamkadavu in Karulayi opened fire at the search team. A bullet fired at the anti-insurgency squad had left hole on police vehicle.Reports suggested the Maoist teams had organised various events in connection the 12th anniversary fest of the party. The group had reportedly collected rice and other essential commodities from the tribals in return for money, police said. A press release, which was allegedly sent by CPI(Maoist) Nadukani area committee, stated the party has celebrated its anniversary on the Kerala-Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border. The release said People Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA) began the programmes with a march past. It further stated that the party urged people to unite and fight for a cause. Earlier too, the insurgents had held meetings at the Pattakarimbu tribal colonies falling within the Nilambur South Forest Division. The meet, which was held in March this year, had urged the tribal people to boycott the parliament election. The police had identified CPI (Maoists) leaders Soman, Sreemathi, Asha and Sundari who were among the gang.

Around 8 pm on Thursday, the inflow was recorded as 14,000 cusecs. This will now have to travel about 50 km to Mettur dam  situated 250 km away from Thanjavur, the rice bowl of the State that lies in the heart of the delta.Instead of waiting for the storage level to reach 60 TMC, the authorities should release water once the storage touches 50 TMC itself. The dam should be opened by September 15 so that we can start cultivation, said Sami Natarajan, a farmer of Thennamanadu, who is also the Thanjavur district secretary of the farmers association.It is sheer desperation that drives the farmers to make such demands, as the depletion of the groundwater level has hit them hard.With the groundwater table going down substantially, even those farmers with borewells are waiting for water release from Mettur to take up cultivation, said Rahul Gandhi, a tenant farmer from the Orathanadu area in Thanjavur.Farmers in the Delta region are hoping against hope.P Sukumaran, a farmer from Tiruvaiyaru, pointed out that those who had cultivated short-term Kuruvai paddy that could be harvested in another 20 days are also not raising nursery for Samba crop, as the groundwater has gone down and there is no indication of guaranteed water release from Karnataka.Adding to their despair, there has not been any indication that the coming North East monsoon will be beneficial or that the South West monsoon will be active by the end of the month, added said P S Masilamani, a farmer from Mangudi near Tiruvarur and the district secretary of farmers association. Even in areas where the farmers have resorted to direct sowing instead of raising nurseries, they are waiting for increased water flow or showers in the coming days, he added.Farmers will get some confidence if we receive a guarantee that 25,000 cusecs will be released for 10 days, he said.While there are countless farmers demanding that the shutters should be opened, there are many who caution against releasing water from Mettur now.The period for direct sowing is up to September last. The dam should not be opened before that as the farmers will start raising nursery which would require more water, reasoned P Kalaivanan, president, Thanjavur unit of TN Senior Agro Technologists Forum.Mettur could be opened only during the first week of October, by which time the prospects of the coming monsoon will be clear. Though the situation is difficult now, it should also be noted that 55 TMC water is essential for the period of December 15 to January end, when the crop would be in a critical stage, Kalaivanan stressed.Water has not reached Mettur dam till Thursday evening, said officials in Salem. The quantum of 15,000 cusecs that the apex court directed Karnataka to release would come up to about 1.25 TMC per day, or just about 12-13 TMC in the 10-day period that the State has to release as per the court direction. Added to the present storage of 38 TMC, the total storage would only be around 50 TMC."

Since it was a huge quantity, the civil supplies officials of Tamil Nadu arrived here on the directions of the Coimbatore Collector and certified that it was indeed PDS rice. Rajapandian, the agent from Tamil Nadu who had been running the operations from his rented premises at Chittur here, was jailed under the Goonda Act.Walayar and Kanjikode have also emerged as the hub of this illegal trade, which ironically flourished following the commissioning of the Palakkad-Pollachi railway line nine months ago, enabling the fly-by-night operators to ferry the consignment on board the Railways.According to civil supplies officials, the suspected involvement of travel ticket examiners(TTE) on passenger trains also needs to be probed. Besides, TVS mopeds, interstate buses, motorbikes and small vehicles are used to run the illegal trade, with women being roped into hoodwink the authorities.Meanwhile, the Civil Supplies Department has submitted its report to the Collector and on her directions, the transporters andmill owners from where rice had been seized were booked under the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Essential Commodities Act 1980 for engaging in unethical trade practices.There is a silver lining to this murky business, though, since Kerala seems to benefit as the smuggled rice from Tamil Nadu seized from various places is sold to eligible card holders via the PDS outlets here."

Now, the state government and agriculture experts are keeping their fingers crossed over the impact the deficit will have on crops.The absence of a revival that was expected at the fag end of south-west monsoon has heightened possibilities of drought in the state, where paddy cultivation is at various stages. Fears of power deficit and increased pest and disease attacks on crops are also forming among all.Speaking to Express, S Sudevan, Director of India Meteorological Department, Thiruvanthapuram, said, Monsoon deficit in the state, when the south-west monsoon drew to a close on Friday, was about 33.7 per cent. Chances of any major rain spells are bleak at best for the next two weeks.He, however, said the north-east monsoon, which constitutes around 30 per cent of total annual rainfall of Kerala, was expected to be normal (90% -100% of the long period average, or LPA).IMD data said that while monsoon deficit was about 34 per cent at present, some critical areas in the state were already facing drought-like situations. As per the data, Wayanad was reeling under a 59 per cent monsoon deficit, while Thrissur was facing nearly 45 per cent deficit. The fact that half the states districts are reeling under almost 33-40 per cent monsoon deficit has further aggravated the agrarian sector. However, coming to their rescue is the Kerala Agriculture University (KAU), which is expected to come up with remedial measures on October 7 to tackle the impending drought-like situation in the state, in case another dry spell is experienced during north-east monsoon period. KAU had previously held a pre-rabi interface with researchers and extension experts to formulate steps to solve issues that may affect crops and plants in view of the anticipated water scarcity and rise in temperature. Said KAU Vice-chancellor Dr P Rajendran, A 35-40 per cent rain deficit may cause several issues of plant health management and crop production. However, farmers can withstand these adverse effects by ensuring crop rotation and adopting shorter-duration crop varieties and drought, pest and disease-resistant varieties during the season.Besides, farmers, agriculture scientists and government officials should be pro-active in tackling the situation, he added.Experts say the water scarcity may lead to metal toxicity, soil acidity, nutrient deficiencies, severe weed infestation and infestation from pests like rice bug, blue beetle and rice case worm, besides other diseases. For coconut farmers, who are already under great pressure following infestation of Red palm weevil and Richnocerous beetle that reduced the yield significantly, deficit rains would cause soil-related problems and deficiency of nutrients as well as white fly attack, they said, adding,"

Parting with them, even for a short period of time, is painful. There may be occasions when you want to go for a long vacation, but hold back thinking of your pets. If you are in Kochi then there is an option-pet boarding. At these facilities air conditioned rooms are available for pets. Last year during Onam season around 100 pets were lodged at major boarding centres in the city. These boarding centers are expecting brisk business this year too.Long term boarding facilities are also provided at these centres. Take the case of a Labrador which has been lodging with a boarding centre in the city since 2012 as its owner has gone to UK. There are many similar cases. Their masters call up every day to know how their pets are doing. Sometimes we take photos and videos of their pets and send it to them, said John Glenn Luiz, manager of a pet boarding centre in Kochi.During Onam season, there are owners who leave their dogs at these boarding centres for a week or more while they travel. The centres charge fees based on the facilities available there. Every owner wants the best for their dogs whom they look after like their own kids.Glen said that they charge fees based on the weight of the breed. The fee is Rs 200 per day for breeds up to 15 kg which includes spitz breed, Rs 300 for 15 to 30 kg and Rs 400 for 30 to 45 kg. The charge is be Rs 500 per day those animals that weigh more than 45 kg, including giant dogs. The daily rent for an A/C room is Rs 1,500.Experienced teams provide the best personal care for pets at these centres. Besides, spacious resting space and beds, high quality food and treatments are on the menu. Usually we provide rice either with chicken or beef. The quantity depends on the breed. But if a specific diet is required, we ask the masters to bring it along with the pets, Glen said.Some pet boarding centres or resorts in the city provide medicinal baths and grooming too."

After a dark Dasara, merchants are hoping that things pick up at least before Diwali.Movement of goods between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is taking place smoothly now but with a 25-35 per cent increase in freight charges.Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Association president Ramesh Chandra Lahoti says truckloads of pulses, Sona Masuri rice, steam rice and onions are among the items sent to Tamil Nadu daily. Apart from the regular rates of `22,500 for a truckload of goods, an additional `15,000 was paid to transport goods last month. There were literally no Dasara celebrations for traders due to the additional costs incurred, he said.Trucks parked at Yeshwanthpur yard in Bengaluru | Pushkar VThe cost of transporting 1kg of any item shot up from `1.50 to `2.50 last month. Things normalised a week ago, but the previously prevalent rates are not being charged. The cost of transporting a kg is now `2, which is nearly a 35 per cent increase over previous rates, Lahoti pointed out. Traders are forced to pass on the burden to consumers, he added.Bharat Shah, a consultant to many foodgrain and pulses merchants in the city, says the increase in charges applies to both exports and imports between the two states and the end result is that the consumer has paid more for commodities exchanged between both states (see box). Dasara sales have definitely slumped for all the traders here, he adds.Vastupal Sanghvi, proprietor of Sree Mookambika Trading Company at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, imports truckloads of pulses daily from Chennai. I used to pay `120 for transporting one quintal (100 kg) of either urad dal, tur dal or moong dal by truck. It shot up to `170 a quintal for a fortnight when the agitation was at its peak. The transportation cost has reduced to `150 now but it is still 25 per cent more than what I used to pay earlier,  he says.When asked about why they are made to pay increased freight charges, he says that some truckers still stop their vehicles at the border between the states around 6.30-7 pm. They halt there for a few hours and enter only under the cover of darkness. Hence, the additional charges are levied, he says.Things will be okay after Nov 5Yeshwantpur APMC Local Lorry Owners Association president G Kumar conceded that the transportation charges were on the higher side now.Some top exporters have declared a one-week to 10-day closure of shops for Diwali. This has forced lorry owners to reduce the number of trucks on the roads. Due to the reduced number of vehicles plying, the rates have gone up, he said.He assured that rates would stabilise and go back to the days before the Cauvery protests, by November 5. When asked if the hikes during festive season was an annual occurrence, Kumar said, No. Those plying lorries last month had to undertake much risk when crossing the Hosur border. Hence, transportation charges were jacked up. It has continued after that."

An office-bearer of the Mill Owners Association, Pushpangadhan, told Express that though an agreement was reached with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday over the hike in the handling charges from Rs 1.38 per kg to Rs 1.90 per kg, the cementing of the agreement got postponed following a tiff with Supplyco over the gunny bag issue.The Supplyco officials had insisted that the rice be supplied in gunny bags weighing 650 grams each, but the mill owners persisted that it can only be supplied in gunny bags weighing 300 to 400 grams.The 650-gram gunny bag is used by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which is heavier.Pushpangadhan said that this was not acceptable to the mill owners since the cost of an FCI gunny bag is Rs 62 per bag while the normal bag is pegged at Rs 45. With consensus eluding, the mill owners walked out of the meeting without signing an agreement on Tuesday.Subsequently, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman intervened and directed the Supplyco to continue with the current practice of using the 300-400 gram sacks. Supplyco paddy marketing officer Armugha Prasad said the mills will begin procurement from Thursday. He said that 11 of the 54 mills procuring paddy in the state were from Palakkad. With the private mill staying away, only Paddico of Elapully in Palakkad and Paddimark of Thrissur had begun procurement from October 1. The farmers stated that the loading charges set by Supplyco was Rs 12 per quintal but usually the workers demanded more and the farmers had to bear the extra cost. As per the agreement with the Supplyco, the mill owners will be paid processing cost for procuring paddy. The mill owners on the other hand will have to return 68 per cent of every one kg procured back to Supplyco, which will be disbursed through the public distribution system.The procurement rate of Rs 21.50 per kg has not been raised by the state government this time. The farmers had expected a hike since the Central Government had raised the support price from Rs 14.10 to Rs 14.70 per kg. The government has constituted a committee to study and present a report within three months on the problems faced during the procurement process. The members of the committee include officials of Food and Civil Supplies, Agriculture, Finance, Weights and Measures, Police and Labour departments and representatives of the mill owners."

They dictate the terms, said A Veerappan, retired Special Chief Engineer of the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department.He alleged that largescale sugarcane and tobacco producers, who do not want to give water to Tamil Nadu, instigated the poor farmers to take to the streets.Echoing the views of Veerappan, Farmers Federation of India organiser and noted farmers leader C Nallusamy said water-intensive sugarcane is grown in large swathes of land in Mandya district, where the Krishna Raja Sagar (KRS) reservoir is located.They divert large volumes of water from the KRS to cater to the irrigation requirements of sugarcane fields in Mandya, Nallusamy claimed. He said rice production activities were believably taken up in June in several places in Karnataka and now the crop has matured for harvest, in contrast with Tamil Nadu, where Delta farmers were struggling to raise Samba crop.Veerappan, also the general secretary of Tamil Nadu PWD Senior Engineers Association, raised doubts over whether Karnataka will comply with the SC order.Meanwhile in Salem, the inflow into Mettur dam that averaged 7,000 to 8,000 cusecs a day for over a month dropped to 4,676 cusecs on Monday and further to 3,935 cusecs on Tuesday. Officials sources said rains in the upper catchments in Karnataka had receded. The source of the current inflow is run-offs into the river downstream of Karnataka reservoirs."

Even more so, the national tourism award that came knocking at her doorsteps recently for her article on Kerala, titled Green heaven, an Indian Oasis.The contributing editor to Outside magazine and other publications including the National Geographic and Oprah Magazine says that the award has come as a pleasant surprise.When I came to India first, there were stories of rape circulating on the news. However, relatively, Kerala is unique, because of its progressive social policies, its natural beauty, and safety, compared to other parts of India, she says.Stephanie, who has lived most of her life in Mexico and the United States, says that the integration between the natural world and humanity in Kerala is different than it is in the United States. Despite the dense population of Kerala, it is incredible that the natural world is as well maintained as it is, in many places. I know there are garbage and pollution issues and many other problems, but, hopefully, with awareness and education, those problems can be mitigated, says Stephanie.She also applauds Keralites on their attempts to uphold human rights, education, and conservation. Again, I realise, the system is not perfect, but, at least, there is an awareness of womens rights and other issues. And, finally, life never stops in India. The country always seems to be alive, she states.In love with KochiStephanie grew up in an industrial port city, in the United States, so she was fascinated to see the massive container ships alongside fishing boats in the Kochi harbour. I also found the history and modern-day politics of Kochi to be fascinating and met a cartoonist who was creating interesting political commentary in the form of comic-book strips, she says. One of my favorite spots is the Paradesi Synagogue in the old town.Stephanie, who travelled the length and breadth of the state, along with guide Rajesh Iyer and New-York based photographer Chiara Goia, has described, in breathtaking details, the Aranmula Boat Race, the Western Ghats and the rice bowls of Kerala.In her report, she describes Allapuzha as thus: The backwaters are one of the only places in the world, outside of Holland, where land is cultivated below sea level. Small villages line the canals and are surrounded by a chlorophyll heaven of rice paddies, banana leaves, and gardens of spinach, long beans, and curry."

The closest thing to a paddy field here is a barren wasteland, where once stood large clumps of green rice straws, many years ago.But venture out into Thodayam, a tiny hamlet known largely as a drought zone in Thiruvali panchayat, about 10 kms from Wandoor town, you would find small ponds, paddy fields, tractors as well as schoolchildren transplanting rice seedling on the one-and-a-half-acre plot.These uniform-clad children, numbering nearly 250, are certainly novice to the paddy cultivation, but they are surely not showing it as they took clumps of rice seedlings in hand and planted them like seasoned farmers.It is a wonderful feeling to be on this slushy field and become a part of rice cultivation. We had never taken part in farming before. With this venture, we can learn how rice is cultivated, says Nima Ali, a plus-one student of the Government Girls Vocational Higher Secondary School, Wandoor.Nima is part of a noble programme introduced by Krishibhavan, Wandoor, to save vanishing paddy fields and spread the word of rice farming. Nelpolika, as the effort was named, is designed to inculcate a culture of farming in youngster. Paddy cultivation is fast fading into oblivion. Many farmers have converted their paddy lands into housing plots. Some have started planting tapioca and rubber in its place. We must bring rice back to the field, says Meharunneesa P M, the agriculture officer who is overseeing the project.Students from Otten English School, Wandoor, are also part of this agriculture programme, the harvest of which would be conducted with help of real time farmers. Meharunneesa hopes that this effort would set a stage for children to learn about other living organisms on the paddy fields, too.Majitha Thasni, a student engaged in farming, says her respect for farmers grew when she attempted farming. She could not contain her happiness as she says the experience is enriching. This is the best way to make people aware of the struggles farmers face during paddy cultivation,she said. Unlike many other places in Malappuram, Thodayam has not been blessed with any kind of running water resources, and the only way to conserve water is to dig ponds. And for the farmers in Wandoor, this is an added expense.But, fortunately for the student farmers, a nearby temple authority provided the water required. Meharunneesa says the project still cost them about `40,000 and hopes a good return once the harvest is over.We would like to continue this effort in coming years, too. After the harvest the rice will be sold and the profit will be used for next years cultivation. This team would also walk to various houses and spread awareness on this, she says. Apart from farming, the students would learn how to take care of the environment and what needs to be done to keep the ecosystem functioning."

It will be a fun, humourous and interactive play, he added.The play, which will be staged by six PhD students and researchers, is an adaptation of a satire written by Harishankar Parsai.The thirty-minute act explains the reason for Sudamas refusal. In Parsais version, Sudamas diary is unearthed and the poor friend talks of Krishnas corrupt regime!It was on Sudamas visit to Dwarka that Sudama discovers the corrupt rule of Krishna and his administrators. He is not portrayed as an antagonist, just a victim of circumstances. To hush up the matter, Krishna had offered the two Lokas and Sudama had refused.The play is a satire to reflect the present system of governance all around the world, said Amit.Harishankar Parsai, was a Hindi writer and a noted satirist, who won a Sahitya Akademi Award in 1982. The entire play is of one hour thirty minutes and is titled Parsai ki Parchai (Parsais shadow), which will present three of Parsais satirical work.Along with Sudama ke Chawal, the other two plays are Asehmat, which deals with the disagreement of two souls and alter-egos, and the third one is Parsais tribute to Ghalib, a Persian poet. All three plays will be performed in Hindi.It is the first time that both the drama groups are to perform outside their institutions. Parsais work was considered because what he wrote then is still relevant today, according to the organisers.They address important social issues that still plague us to this day. Satire and sarcasm arent just tools in a writers repertoire, they are tools with which we lighten up and see the world for what it really is, said Abhinav Yadav, a PhD student from NCBS."

Shrapnel flew in from all directions, damaging property, killing cattle and injuring some people.One such shell landed on the terrace of Girdharilal's house but did not explode. It has remained like that for the last 15 days. And now Girdharilal lives in dread: it can explode any moment, destory his house and kill his family.""We informed the tehsildar, the police and the Army. They promised that the bomb disposal team would come. But 15 days have passed by and there is no sign of anyone coming. There have been instances of shells exploding a month or two later, says Raghubeer Singh, sarpanch of the nearby Changia village as Girdharilal and his family nod in agreement.Girdharilal says his biggest worry are the children. ""We have to keep a watch on the kids. The shell can explode if anyone touches it, he says.When no help came from the authorities, the family decided to do something about the shell on their terrace. Girdharilal and his wife put sandbags around the shell and built a small gate at one end of the staircase to stop children from going up to the terrace.""But we are scared,"" says Girdharilal. ""If it goes off, it can do terrible damage. The house can collapse, says his wife.Girdharilal is not alone in his predicament. Other villagers subjected to Pakistan's frequent shelling share it. Not far from Gardharilal's house, a shells landed in the house of farmer Bhim Singh and burying itself in the earth. It did not explode and remains that way. ""What can I do? For the last 15 days, all of us have been living with this live shell in our midst. It cannot get worse than this. We are used to shelling and firing by Pakistan but this is torture, says Bheem Singh.Take the case of another farmer, Rajesh Kumar. One shell pierced through the terrace and landed in a room where he stocks his harvest. ""I have locked that room. The feeling of living with a live shell is terrible. The kind of damage shrapnel can do is mind-boggling. The splinters can pierce through iron gates and walls, he says.Though Pakistan shelled several villages on the Jammu frontier on November 1, the Arnia sector witnessed maximum shelling. Other border villages in places like Ramgarh, Poonch and Rajauri too were pounded and there were casualties, but no where did live shells create such a fear as in Arnia.Sarpanch Raghubeer Singh says he has acquaintances in the police and Army but none bothered to come to the rescue of the villagers. There are live shells lying in many farms in the area and farmers are afraid of going to their lands. As a result, production of basmati rice in RS Pura is getting badly affected.""There is nothing anyone can do,"" says Jindo Devi, whose house was damaged when a shell exploded right in front of it, with splinters piercing through the iron gates and doors and smashing window panes. ""We cannot abandon our houses and our cattle, she says, showing the splinters.A police official in Arnia police station, requesting anonymity said a bomd disposal teams would defuse the shells soon though he did not specify how soon."

58fd4c747be9e06c9371908e,What a shame! How callous have we become?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/aug/29/What-a-shame-How-callous-have-we-become-1513875.html,2016-08-29,"The haunting image of a tribal man with the lifeless body of his wife on shoulder and an inconsolable daughter in tow has brought back the dark memories of Kalahandi that once epitomised Odishas impoverishment and collective callousness. It seems to have come full circle. And this time, Dana Majhi mirrors all that is wrong, not just with the administration but with society as a whole. The Melghar natives 10 km journey on foot from the District Headquarters Hospital at Bhawanipatna to Shagada where he hoped to find a transport for his dead spouse has shaken the conscience of a nation which has a short memory.The shocking pictures of a grief-stricken Majhi and his innocent minor daughter have exemplified the sheer apathy and indifference of people who watched the father-daughter duo take a long heartbreaking walk but did not come forward to help. Exhausted by the physical and emotional stress, the two would stop by once in a while to catch a breath but it stirred no chord in any bystanders heart. The insensitivity of people is what must shame all. After all, it took a reporter of a local TV channel, Ajit Singh, to make the first call of assistance for an ambulance to the district collector and the health authorities but till that happened, everyone watched the whole proceedings with utter inhumanity. Sadly, Singh is now being accused of capitalising on Majhis misery. His ethics as a journalist is being questioned. Hardly anyone acknowledges his effort to organise an ambulance for the hapless. What a shame! How cynical have we become?The less said about the pathetic administrative system the better. The first reaction of Kalahandi district authorities was to wash their hands of the matter that originated in the District Headquarters Hospital at Bhawanipatna. Within a day of the first inquiry, the local administration gave itself a clean chit and blamed Majhi for running away with his wifes body as if he was a criminal.>> Kalahandi shame moves Bahrain PM, extends monetary help to man who carried wife's corpseOnly a growing outpouring of shock nationally and internationally could bring the Naveen Patnaik administration to own up to its failure and seek a second probe. Worst of all, the district administration, in its bid to save its skin, picked up Majhi from his home as he was busy with the rituals for his dead wife and was probed for killing his wife who died of tuberculosis.That brings us to the pitiable healthcare delivery system in the state which has historically been found wanting. Majhi was just another victim. The insensitivity of doctors and paramedic staff in peripheral government centres is common knowledge as the plight of the poor and downtrodden does not move them. Only money matters. There are incidents galore where the underprivileged have been left to fend for themselves.Majhi may be a defining image of a malaise that afflicts Odisha. Two decades ago, when a hungry Phanus Punji sold off her minor sister-in-law Banita for a measly sum of Rs 40 to bring food to her plate, Kalahandi, known to be the rice bowl of Odisha, shot to headlines.A few years later, starvation deaths prompted then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to announce the launch of a special Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput (KBK) scheme. It seems nothing has changed despite thousands of crores of rupees pumped in to revitalise the region. The Naveen Patnaik government, which has been in power for 16 years, has doled out freebies for the poor one after the other but the fact remains that its populist womb-to-tomb schemes have failed to deliver in the absence of proper monitoring and implementation at the grassroots.Its indifferent and an utterly inept bureaucracy and an insensitive local administration have ensured that most welfare programmes exist only on paper. Not long ago, the death of 19 malnourished children in Jajpurs Nagada had blown the lid off the shambolic administrative efficiency. Charting out a path of growth through industrialisation and urbanisation will not just work unless Naveen gets out of his ivory tower and sets his administration in order.The proposed Rs 90,000 crore investment that his government claimed to have garnered at the Bengaluru investors meet will mean nothing if Kalahandi continues to wallow in backwardness and Dana Majhis make international headlines.Srimoy KarResident Editor, OdishaEmail: srimoy@newindianexpress.com"

58fd4e7c7be9e06c93719347,Cashless or clueless?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2016/dec/11/cashless-or-clueless-1547828.html,2016-12-11,"About 16 km from Coimbatore, in a fast developing and predominantly agricultural locality called Thondamuthur, Anandi gets her two children ready for school  a routine unchanged for the last seven years. But in the last week of November 2016, there is one change.Anandi needs to get the children out of the house by 7 am, an hour earlier than usual, because she needs to go stand in the line outside her bank before it opens for the day. The small stash of hundreds she had withdrawn last week is running out. Anandi is a domestic servant, agricultural worker, and an occasional flower vendor. She is among the 26 per cent of Indians policymakers call illiterate. Her family does not own a smart phone.A woman buying rice from ration shop with herdebit card at Ibrahimpur village, Siddipet Mandal, in HyderabadAnandis situation stands in stark contrast to the Narendra Modi governments rhetoric over the last few weeks that India is poised for a leap into a cashless economy, a leap that no developing nation has dreamed of trying. She personifies the barriers that a nation of 1.3 billion needs to cross before reaching that brave new world: illiteracy, inadequate smart phone penetration, absence of a pan-India, seamless high-speed data network and millions of unbanked people.How will Anandi make that leap?Hows it even Possible?In the days following the Nov 8 demonetisation of `500 and `1,000 notes, newspapers were plastered with full page ads by online financial technology firms which wanted to cash in on the sudden withdrawal of 86 per cent of the currency in circulation.The weeks subsequently saw the same firms announce immense jumps in their subscriptions and transactions. But the geographical spread of these was not disclosed.In response to an email query from New Indian Express, Paytm, Indias market leader in the mobile transaction space, claimed that nearly 50 per cent of its transactions now were coming from smaller cities and towns. Thousands of kirana store owners, vegetable and fruit vendors, food stalls, pharmacies and many more merchants across Indias semi-urban and rural areas now accept Paytm. and after introducing the Paytm android app in 10 regional languages, we are expecting that share to grow to around 70 per cent, said the companys spokesperson.But cities and towns, however small, only account for a little over a quarter of the Indian population. According to the 2011 census, 72.2 per cent of Indians still live in villages, none of which is covered by online grocery firms.Big Basket is Indias largest online supermarket, but according to its CEO Hari Menon, the company does not have any presence in rural areas. We do not operate there. In our urban markets, however, we have seen a 50 per cent jump in sales after November 8, he said.The story was the same for other online retailers. Transactions jumped, but the large majority of the Indian population does not have the option to turn online, even if they wanted to.But where are the banks in villages?But the most immediate hurdle, an operational one, that needs to be acknowledged is the fact that banking infrastructure on the ground is currently incapable of handling a cashless economy. According to the latest RBI data on cards and point of sale terminals (for August 2016), there are a total of 26.37 million credit cards and 712.46 million debit cards in use. However, the overwhelming majority of debit card transactions (85.2 per cent) were done at ATMs to withdraw cash and not at point of sale terminals.The current split between PoS terminal and ATM transactions are incongruous with the vision of a cashless India, admitted a board member of a leading private sector bank.To turn potential customers like Anandi towards using plastic money for their day-to-day use, the number of PoS terminals and card swipe machines must first reach levels that Indias peer countries have reached. Currently, RBI data records just 1.46 million PoS machines across the entire country  less than 86 per one lakh Indians. Brazil, in comparison, has 3,299.And while the RBI does not provide data on the split between urban and rural regions for PoS machines, bankers say they are predominantly urban. The government has tried to implement measures to correct this shortfall. On Dec 8, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stated that the government would provide two PoS terminals to every village with a population of less than 10,000. But an idea of the explosion necessary in PoS machine distribution can be ascertained by RBIs estimation, as long ago as last December, that India required at least 20 million  a 13.6 fold increase. This was before the governments policy turn toward making India cashless.What if I made wrong entry?If the lack of physical infrastructure is a gaping gap in the Prime Ministers cashless policy, the consequences of the lack of operational framework to address problems arising from hundreds of millions transacting online everyday is frightening. The problem of transaction costs, surcharges and service taxes on digital transactions continues to exist, despite the government removing or relaxing several of these on Dec 8.Ideally, the government should re-route gains made from the cash management costs and others to banks so that they can provide transactions at zero charge, says agriculture economist Vijay Sardana. Banks just do not have the means to provide zero-cost transactions the way balance sheets look now, added the private sector banker. But these are the easy problems. What are the redressal mechanisms in case of mistaken entries? How long will it take to refund such an error? And most importantly, where does the liability lie in case of errors? These are all incredibly simple but absolutely essential questions that need to be asked before considering such a move, pointed out Sardana.The beauty of having cash in hand is that if you or I accidently pay a couple of hundred extra, we can immediately rectify it. How will a mistake of one extra zero accidentally added be resolved when you transact online? How long will it take? Such a system needs to come with strong liability clauses, he said. Security is also an issue. Cyber crimes and frauds have risen, with hackers proving difficult to track down after heists. Just a few months ago, the Indian banking system admitted to a data breach that saw nearly 3.29 million debit and credit cards compromised.But, 83% Indians have no smart phone?Indispensable to any shift to a tech-enabled transaction system is literacy, generic as well as digital. And in the current technological environment, a working knowledge of English. There was an implicit acknowledgement of this very real barrier in the slew ofannouncements the government made on December 8; one of them was that a web portal and a TV channel, Digishala, would be launched to increase awareness on transacting digitally.But the task is monumental. Reports peg Indians with such knowledge of English at just 10% of the population.Digital literacy and access to the internet is even worse. According to a report from NASSCOM, India had approximately 330 million internet users as of 2015 and even the best estimates put the number of internet users by 2020 at only around 730 million  56% of the current population. Data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) put the number of internet subscribers in India at 342 million as of March 2016 -- a penetration rate of 27%.More than 912 million Indians do not have internet. Of those who do, only 13 per cent live in rural areas.Even the penetration of smart phones is insufficient to support a cashless economy. A survey by Pew Research released in February put the rate of smart phone ownership among adults at just 17% , of which only 7% come from low income households.Internet speeds are also far behind global standards. TRAI says that only 15% of 1.02 billion mobile subscribers have broadband level connections."
58fd4f2b7be9e06c93719429,Samba hopes wither even before sowing,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/aug/14/Samba-hopes-wither-even-before-sowing-1509098.html,2016-08-14,"THANJAVUR:The life story of every farmer is an epic tale of battle against the elements. Each season they till their land in hope, watch the skies with trepidation and await the results of their toil with fingers crossed. The sons of earth gamble their everything each season, sometimes hitting the jackpot and sometimes nought. With the long-term Samba crop season looming close, the farmers in the Delta districts of the State are readying themselves for yet another round of gambling. However, even before the plough has sunk into the rice bowl, the farmers believe the odds are heavily stacked against them.After missing out on the money spinner Kuruvai cultivation, the farmers were relying on Cauvery water from Mettur for a bumper Samba harvest. However, the uncertainty over release of water this year has left them apprehensive about their future. Though the customary date of dam opening (June 12) is long past, what casts a shadow of gloom in the delta is low level of storage in the dam, which stood at 94.43 feet last year when the gates were opened on August 9, as against the present level of 62.38 feet as on Friday.Lack of official word on the release is only adding to the pressure, feel the farmers. P Sukumaran, a farmer from Tirupoonthurthi, says, The farmers are confused. The water was not released for Kuruvai crop and the government is silent about the preparations for the long-term Samba. This confusion has resulted in the dwindling of acreage this year. Last season, the Thanjavur farmers brought around 45,000 hectares under Kuruvai cultivation, this year the acreage was a paltry 35,000 hectares. The reason: non-availability of Cauvery water. This despite proactive steps by the administration to incentivise farmers using borewells.If the government announces a tentative date for the release, it will go a long way in soothing the frayed nerves, as the farmers could get some time to plan their move, says Sukumaran. If a date is given, farmers can raise saplings for long-duration CR1009 variety in nurseries using borewells. This would help them share the saplings with those dependent on river water, he adds.The government decision to make available black gram seeds at depots has sent the rumour mills into an overdrive in the delta, with a section in the area believing this to be a subtle way of pushing the farmers to skip Samba. Alternative crops like lentils cannot be cultivated in the Delta beyond June-July, as these crops cannot withstand even occasional heavy rains, points out Arupathy P Kalyanam, general secretary of the Federation of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association. The way out lies in pressuring Karnataka to release Tamil Nadus due share, Kalyanam says.Water in the four Cauvery reservoirs in Karnataka is over 56 per cent of their storage capacity. In this scenario, the onus lies on the Union government to direct Karnataka to release water for Tamil Nadu, he adds.If farmers managed to salvage some pride by using borewells during the Kuruvai season, they cannot be expected to replicate their earlier exploits for the long-term crop, as Samba is completely dependent on Cauvery for survival. While Kuruvai is regarded as a money spinner, Samba is the staple for the delta farmers, as with increased acreage and prospective yield, the margin of profit is enough to wipe off big debts. But only if the Cauvery trickles down. On an average, 1.06 lakh hectares are brought under Samba crops, while the acreage stands at 27,000 hectares for Thaladi paddy (cultivated after harvest of Kuruvai) in Thanjavur district.Even if the water is released by August 15-20, the possibility of farmers managing to salvage Samba is very much alive, feels Kalyanam, as they could sow long-term varieties like CR1009. It generally takes 15 days for water from Mettur to reach the tail-end delta, as the channels and canals are heavy on silt due to officials neglect. There was a time when water would trickle down in seven days, he recalls. Pegging the annual loss of the farming community at `1,000 crore due to erratic release of water, Kalyanam said that if there was any further delay, the future looked bleak as the harvest season would coincide with the north-east monsoon.There are many permutations and combinations the farmers need to try before deciding on the crops. One factor that has much bearing on the prospects is the monsoon. With a weak south-west monsoon failing to quench the thirst of parched catchments in Karnataka and Wayanad, the farmers there are not cosily placed either, say agro-technologists.P Kalaivanan, president of Thanjavur unit of the Tamil Nadu senior Agro-technologists Forum, seconds Ranganathans surmise. He says the Meteorological Department had predicted 113 per cent above normal rainfall during June-July in the southern peninsula, while it was to be deficient in eastern India. However the reverse is happening now, he says, adding that things have come to such a pass this season that even if farmers resorted to direct sowing to save water.The long-term varieties should be planted by first week of September. In the case of short-term varieties, they ought to be transplanted before October 15, since the north-east monsoon starts by that time. To save the crop till the onset of north-east monsoon, we need at least 200 TMC and releasing water before that level is reached could prove to be detrimental, he points out."

In the initial phase the practice will be introduced in 2,560 hectares of land scattered in six districts. High yielding varieties of seeds, identified at the regional level, will be sowed in these fields. The seeds will be distributed through Kerala State Seed Development Authority, National Seeds Corporation, Kerala Agricultural University and other agencies. The nodal agency for the project will be Krishi Bhavans in the respective districts. The project will be extended across the state, based on the results of the pilot project, said an official with the Agriculture Directorate.According to officials, the farmers involved in upland paddy cultivation will be provided technical advice through Krishi Bhavans. The department has set aside Rs 3.48 crore for the project. Farmers would be encouraged to embrace mechanised farming to reduce input cost and make paddy cultivation profitable. Agro Service Centres or Karshaka Karma Sena would provide the machinery for farming.Under the Nellu Varsham project, each district will undertake 100 field activities to boost paddy cultivation. The activities will be taken up by schools, youth clubs, panchayats, resident associations, women groups and NGOs.While lauding the efforts of the State government, K N Harilal of Centre for Developmental Studies, who had done extensive research in paddy cultivation, has cautioned that care is needed to make the efforts sustainable, profitable and a means of livelihood. In the present budget Rs 385 crore has been set aside for paddy procurement while Rs 50 crore is allotted for paddy cultivation initiatives."

It is the venue of the annual boat race named after India's first Prime Minsiter that is now a major event on the tourist calendar of the state.Baburaj has started practising, aiming to be in perfect shape for the arduous task. His mentor, B. Padmakumar, a leading physician, is monitoring his fitness regime regularly.On D-day, Baburaj will begin at 6 am and hopes to touch the finishing line around noon. His practice regime currently involves swimming ""for a few hours in the morning from 6 am and also a few hours in the evening"".Last year he swam 10 km at the widest part of the Vembanad lake. Baburaj's swimming feat has earned him recognition from the Universal Record Forum Asian Records which is recognised globally. Baburaj swam for three hours and set a record in the ""disabled"" category.Also in the past year, Baburaj had qualified for the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS) World Games that was held in Sochi, Russia. However, he could not raise enough funds -- he needed Rs 3 lakh -- and failed to attend the sporting event.Baburaj began swimming when he was a school student. But then at the age of 12, he met with an accident that lost strength in his left hand. But even then he contested in several national and international events. As per medical records, he has contested in the ""disabled"" category with 40 per cent disability."

The Haritha Keralam project conceived on the occasion of the the LDF Government completing 100 days in office will be launched with a proper action plan. We can achieve further progress in the field of organic farming. However, a collective effort is needed for that, and we should have the will to take up farming in a more effective way, he said.The Organic Vegetable Fair will have stalls dedicated for sale of vegetables, rice and organic products from the green initiative of the CPM. The rice varieties made available for sale include Syama, Thena, Njavara, Gandhakasala, Jeerakasala and Mullankaima. Separate stalls will be set up at the fair for organic vegetables, nendran banana, jackfruit, pokkali rice, organic fruits and various tuber crops. A total of 257 vegetable outlets will be opened in the Onam-Bakrid season this year. The Fair will conclude on September 13.As part of observing 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, a special screening on the health benefits and farming methods of pulses will be organised at the fair by the Organic Kerala Charitable Trust.

But what we saw in those 75 days was her soft, caring side, says CV Sheela, one of the 16 nurses who cared for the late Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa at Apollo Hospitals.She loved upma; upma, pongal, curd rice and potato curry were her favourite dishes. With each spoon of food, she would say I will eat this morsel for Sheela, this one for Saamu, and each subsequent spoonful for yet another nurse in the room. She motivated herself and us with simple words like these.Among the nurses, Jayalalithaa lovingly referred to her favourite three  CV Sheela, MV Renuka and Samundeeshwari  as the King Kongs.After being shifted to the general ward, she would watch TV for an hour every day and listen to old Tamil songs with us. She was moved when she saw on TV that thousands of people were praying for her, says Renuka.Whenever someone entered her room, she would smile and ask, What can I do for you? chief nursing superintendent Suneetha R recalls, adding that the nurses were moved by Jayalalithaas trust in them. She would throw balls and play with us, in accordance with the physiotherapists instructions.She never refused our suggestions. Even when she wasnt fond of her exercises, she wouldnt refuse them, but say, Im tired, can we do this later?"

On Christmas, every Christian household has a huge spread for lunch and this wine serves as an accompaniment. City Express spoke to a few Chennaiites who began the process of wine making at home a few months ago.Juhina Sabrina Samuel, moved to Chennai from Kolkata a couple of months ago. She brought along, her family recipe of making wine. I have been making wine for the past 15 years and I specialise in organic wine, she says. She sees to it that there is a variety in flavour when it comes to making wine. This year I have made ginger-mint wine, rice wine, blackcurrant wine and the usual grape wine, she adds.Sunish P Surendran & RomaniAgarwal/MallikaIt is customary to have a glass of wine on Christmas, Mallika Angela Chaudhuri says it is to celebrate the birth of Christ. Homemade wine is non-alcoholic.We drink not to get high because of alcohol, but the sugar in the wine gives us the sugar high which also secretes the happy hormones. The homemade wine is sweeter and not as strong as those in stores.Everyone has a different style of preparing the wine. While Juhina began the process of fermentation six month ago, Smitha Kuttayya Boppanda made it three months back. The fruits are boiled in water along with sugar and yeast is added to it. You need to wait till all the yeast dies.You will know it when you see it. That means the fermentation process is done. After that begins the actual work. You have to strain it 20-25 times, she shares.Smitha has made grape, pineapple, green apple, mango and mixed fruit wine this season. People in Chennai appreciate homemade wine. Sugar acts as a preservative in this wine and we can store it, As long as you store, the stronger it gets, she adds.At Mallikas house, her aunt and uncle make the wine. My Aunt Coleen has a special recipe. We make two varieties of wine- Strawberry-grape and Champagne-grape. The latter is my aunts recipe for which she sources yeast from Australia. It is a hit among our customers, she says.They sell the wine at their takeway restaurant Anglo Auntys Takeaway. Our customers liked it so much so that we have the wine throughout the year, she quips. At their house, the distillation process is different. We ferment the wine for three to four weeks. If we start distilling the third week, the wine is stronger and if it is in the fourth it is softer, she explains.Smitha and Juhina experiment with various flavours. Born and brought up in Coorg, Smitha was always surrounded by fruits and every fruit became wine. I have made guava, ginger and rose petal flavoured wines. But the most unique ones were paan and banana.Last year I made paan flavoured wine and it was the easiest. I just used the betel leaves and the wine was hit-the-roof strong, she smiles. With Chennai being hot throughout the year, one needs to be very careful about storing it in the right temperature. I choose the coolest room in my house to keep it going. Sometimes the weather here is damp and the chances of the wine to spoil are high, she adds.While Juhinas favourite is rice wine, Smitha picks rose. Rice wine seems very bland but as you drink it gives a burning sensation. I also like blackcurrant as I add some cinnamon to give it a rich taste, says Juhina. Mallika chooses her wine, based on the food. Wine basically cleanses your palette. I would choose the champagne to go with thick meaty food and strawberry-grape to go with red meat,she says."

The shifting of families  from the banks of the Cooum at Aminjikarai to the rehabilitation settlements of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at Perumbakkam  was marked by an air of resignedness.Asked whether she will shift to another school nearby, Revathi R, a Standard XII student in a private school at Aminjikarai, shrugged. We have not decided what to do yet, she said.Her parents were at a loss. Both of them had reared cows all their lives back at Aminjikarai and now they have to sell them off in a hurry and start all over again.Many residents of Aminjikarai were not against the shifting, but they just did not want it to be Perumbakkam. Santhi R, who used to work as a domestic help, said they wanted to move to Ambattur, if at all they had to. And all they got was Perumbakkam.In fact, confident that this day would never come though she had received allotment sometime last year, Santhi had pledged her daughters necklace to build a new roof for her house in Aminjikarai only a few days ago.I have lived there since I was 10. Now it is all gone, said the 52-year-old.Most of their belongings  wodden boxes, foldable cots, old shopping bags among others  had to be taken by the elevator because the staircases were too narrow that even two medium-built persons cannot walk side-by-side. Though there were two elevators in every block, one was non-functional in most of the blocks.Chandra S, who got her new home in L block, arrived at Perumbakkam on Wednesday. She has not had a bath ever since!There has been no water supply for the past three days. For drinking water, we buy cans priced at `25 each, she said.Most houses in the L block and some houses in the K block did not have water supply, complained residents. Some houses such as 142,143 and 144 in the K block did not have power either, according to the occupants.We have been sleeping without a fan. No action has been taken on our complaints so far, says Lakshmi S, who had to use her neighbours toilet because her toilet drain was filled with cement.She had cataract surgery on both eyes recently at the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, Now, the hospital is 24 km away.When contacted, the TNSCB officials said the issues related to power and water supply would be immediately looked into and all inconveniences sorted out at the earliest.Residents agreed that the officials had helped them move without a hitch and had even thoughtfully provided them sambar rice for lunch.But Banu had a lot more running on her mind than sambar rice. She lived with her mother and uncle, both blind.My mother sells ration card covers in the Tambaram Railway Station. This place is entirely new to her. So she would need my assistance until she gets familiar with this place and the bus route, she said.The children in the area make the most of the place even though their school is a housing tenement that has been turned into classrooms  drab and dark like the others.According to Vanessa Peter, an activist and policy researcher who has been extensively involved in rehabilitation issues, the children were to be shifted to the new school building. But it has already been nine months since they moved in.The flawsThough the residents have taken most of the issues in their stride, considering it as a price to be paid for not having to live in fear of waking up to floods or fire, Perumbakkam hides a few darker stories. The flawed building design had resulted in the fall of two girls. While one of them died, the other received severe leg injuries.A small plate of rice and a glass of water on the seventh floor marks the spot from where 15 year-old Nathiya fell to her death. Her mother Jaya leaves it in the open-to-sky (OTS) area on their floor for her every day, knowing fully well she wont be coming home for lunch.On October 27, Nathiya came home from her school located near Nandanam around 8.30 pm, the usual time she reached home after travelling almost 25 km in the evening traffic. She went outside to pick up her clothes that were put for drying there, but tripped and fell seven floors down.I was sitting right here in the hall and all I could do was to watch her fall, said Jaya, who works as a housekeeper in an apartment not far away.The OTS space model in the building blocks at Perumbakkam was introduced after the board came under severe criticism for the almost absolute lack of skylight in their earlier tenements. These spaces were introduced to bring in skylight from the highest floor right down to the first floor.Not only do they not light up the narrow corridors of the first three floors, they present dangers for children as in the case of Nathiya. A month after her death, the space still remains unprotected and clothes are still dried there by the H residents where Nathiya lived.Before her, 12-year-old Sruthi (name changed) had fallen from the sixth floor of the AE block where the OTS model is different from the one in H block. Here, there are grilled spaces on the walls opposite to the entrances of the houses on the floor, which are intended to cover the OTS space in the corridor wall. This parapet wall overlooks another wall with toilet plumbing running over it while allowing sunlight into the floor.We dont think it brings any light, but it certainly brings in stench from the leaky toilet plumbing from the opposite side of the wall, said Loganathan T, who operates the lift in the block and also lives there.More importantly, the grills have a door that can be easily opened and remains so in most of the houses most of the times.Selvaraj remembers the date  May 10  well as it was his birthday. It was summer vacation and Sruthi, a resident of Ice House, had come to visit his uncle Manigandan who lived next door to Selvaraj. I invited her and five or six other children in the neighbourhood for lunch as it was my birthday, said Selvaraj.As they were waiting for the lunch, the kids went out to play. That was when Sruthi caught the clothesline over the OTS grill and jumped onto the parapet wall, causing her weight to push the grill open, leaving her to plummet six floors, said neighbours.The bend on the grill door on the first floor was from that fateful day, said Nallathambi, head of the residents association, who lives on the first floor. The grill door on our floor stopped her fall and she survived, he said.But, it was on Saturday, that Sruthi took her first steps after the fall. She has not been able to go to school. Though her school is very understanding when it comes to the fees, she will have to study in Class VI again next year, said her mother, who sells plastic items from door-to-door with her husband.But Sruthi, determined to go to school as soon as possible, has followed her physiotherapy regimen strictly. It hurts a little when I walk now, but I am sure it will get better as I start walking more often, she said. When contacted, a senior TNSCB official said the doors on the grills were to carry out plumbing and maintenance activities in the pipes that ran across the walls opposite to the grills.But now, we have planned to provide locks to the doors and hand over the keys to the maintenance workers. We will take every precautionary measure possible, he added. But activists said it took much more than a temporary fix.Imagine the kind of steps that would have been taken if it had been a housing society for other income groups, she added.According to Vanessa, as early as 2011, the Tamil Nadu government had recognised the need for rehabilitation and resettlement and housing policies. But till date, no such policy has been evolved.There has been denial of rights, especially as there is no access to social infrastructure facility, she said."

In a significant decision, the Cabinet on Thursday decided to issue new ration cards - which will see BPL/AAY cards replaced with priority category cards - by December.The Cabinet also cleared a proposal to rank ration card-holders at the state level to determine the priority category.Earlier, the plan was to have a taluk-level ranking. The decision to have state-level ranking was taken in the wake of complaints that the taluk-based ranking system would leave many deserving families out of the priority category.Under NFSA, 1,54,80,040 people in the state would be covered by the priority category. Of this, 52.63 per cent should be from the rural areas and 39.5 per cent from the urban locales. Although the previous Oommen Chandy Government had prepared a draft taluk-level ranking list, many eligible families were left out as the percentage of beneficiaries - irrespective of whether they are poor or wealthy - to be included from each taluk remains the same.The state-level ranking, according to government, would ensure a more equitable distribution of PDS food grain. Kerala had missed several deadlines for enforcing NFSA and recently the Centre had threatened to cut off ad hoc rice allocation blaming the state for its lackadaisical attitude.No more AWDsThe Cabinet has decided to phase out Authorised Wholesale Dealers (AWD) from the PDS system in the state. Their role will be played by the State Civil Supplies Corporation in a phased manner. To ensure enough stock rooms for food grains, the government will open two government-run godowns each at the block level.The government also plans to use godowns owned by other Central and state government agencies. Private godowns will be phased out once enough government godowns are available.Supplyco will be entrusted with the job of carting the food grain from the Food Corporation of India godowns to ration shops."

According to data provided by the Agriculture Department at least 1,380 hectares of paddy fields have been filled in the state between 2011 and 2016.This includes 488.07 hectares in Thiruvananthapuram and 190.23 hectares in Ernakulam districts.According to officials, most of the paddy fields have been filled for construction purposes. These fields were filled during the tenure of the previous government. This present government is currently in the process of reviewing various decisions taken during the last five years. If anyone is found to have violated the Kerala Conservation of Paddy Land and Wetland Act, 2008, stringent action will be taken against them, said an official with the Agriculture Department.Law stipulates that 10 cent of paddy field in panchayats and five cents in Municipality or Corporation limits can be filled for the construction of residential building but the clause is being misused blatantly.Not all paddy field fillings were illegal. But chances are high that vast areas of agriculture land may have been filled after procuring permission by highlighting the purpose as residential one. We will only get a clear picture after scrutinising the clearances granted by the previous government, official added.Meanwhile Paristhithi Samrakshana Samithi has urged the government to take the matter seriously and initiate action against the violators.Rice is our staple food and filling paddy fields for other purposes will directly impact our food security. This is a serious issue. Today we are relying on other states to meet our food requirements. If we are committed to attaining self sufficiency in rice production, the government should not overlook these kind of illegal activities. We need to preserve our paddy fields along with promoting cultivation of rice on a large scale, said A Sreevalsan, chairman, Paristhithi Samrakshana Samithi."

I just six! It wasnt official learning, but just a drive to learn how ingredients are put together and to also know how the end product is so delicious (smiles). As a person who loved to eat good food, I knew that I had to learn the techniques to make it myself. The first dish I made was along with my mother; the traditional fried rice with chicken, egg and shrimp.Chef Teuku, executive chef, Park HyattHailing from Indonesia, the food culture has always intrigued me. Every island has its own food culture. For example, the food in Sumatra is different from the cuisine in Java. In eastern Java, the food is made sweet and in several other islands, the food has a little bit of influence of south Indian cooking. The use of curry leaves, mustard seeds, and coconut milk can be seen in a few places, but, surprisingly, there are islands where rice isnt used at all! They use corn and cassava as their main staple as opposed to rice.I love to cook with khafir lime leaf and lemon grass as they induce a different texture and flavour. But, unlike a few chefs, I make sure that I remove it after adding the flavour to the dish. I also love cooking with chilli, but I use very little of it as I have a sweet tooth and cant take too much spice! (laughs)Since I am from Indonesia, its natural for me to have an inclinational towards Asian flavours and food. But I like Peruvian cuisine and someday want to visit Peru to see the place where the cuisine originated and get some inspiration. People in India are yet to open up to this cuisine as most dont have a palette for those kind of dishes. For example, raw Ceviche (a popular seafood dish from Latin America)I dont think a lot of people would relate to those flavours here.But when it comes to Indian flavours, I have seen a major shift in the cuisine that I prefer. I used to eat a lot of north Indian and Tandoori when I worked in Dubai, but now, I vouch for south Indian cuisine. Chettinad Chicken tempered in curry leaves and spices, anyday! Since I have a sweet tooth, the Wattalappam dish from Kerala  a caramel pudding with coconut milk, jaggery and served with coconut ice cream  is a recent favourite.Though I love experimenting with new ingredients and flavours, Im not a fan of the fusion confusion (laughs). The best ingredients can be used to bring out different flavours in a dish, but mixing two different cuisines makes them lose their identity  thats my opinion.My journey has been interesting since I worked in the same company for 20 years, but in different places. Meeting new people and exploring different cuisines has kept my pulse beating. My advice while cooking is: experiment, do your best with passion, serve good food, make others happy and be happy!"

Primary among these was the impact it would have on the universal PDS system.Amit BandreHowever, as the government order issued in this regard on Thursday explained, if the NFSA is not implemented, the State will have to incur an additional annual expenditure of `2,730.95 crore due to revision of rate for rice by the Centre from November 1. That, over and above the present expenditure of `2,393.30 crore.Faced with a situation where it had to choose between two difficult options, the State decided to implement the Act, but without passing on the burden to the millions who are dependent on the Universal Public Distribution System. So the UPDS will continue, which means the offtake could go up.The State government has also decided to constitute a State Food Commission for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of NFSA. As stipulated in the Act, the list of priority households will be uploaded in the website. The supply of foodgrains will be uniform both for priority and non-priority households under the Universal PDS.By choosing this option of implementing the Act with modifications, the State has to bear an additional expenditure of `1,193.30 crore per year.Rice will continue to be supplied free of cost to all ration cardholders. In case of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), the existing scale of supply of 35 kg of rice per card per month will continue to be supplied free of cost, the GO added.The present monthly offtake of rice under the PDS, including AAY, is about 2.23 lakh MT, while the monthly allotment by the Centre is 2.96 lakh MT. The additional requirement of rice, over and above AAY, BPL and APL allocation, was being met through additional allocation of 27,969 MT of rice per month at BPL rate (`5.65 per kg) by the Centre. That additional allocation happened only up to June last. The window was shut in July.The State has been getting 15.15 lakh MT annually under APL category, but was informed that no further additional allocation of foodgrain would be made to Tamil Nadu under APL and BPL category since it was yet to implement NFSA.The order pointed out that the Centre had increased the minimum support price (MSP) rate for rice for APL families from `8.30 per kg to `22.54 per kg, which substantially raised the money required.The revised scale of supply will be implemented in the State from November 1 except in Aravakurichi, Thanjavur and Thirupparankundram Assembly constituencies due to model code of conduct in force for elections scheduled for November 19."

Conducting tests free of cost, the event was all about spreading awareness on beating diabetes. Doctors on duty had their kit ready as they conducted a variety of tests such as foot test, thyroid screening, lipid profile, bone mineral test, Hb1Ac test, cholesterol check, and body fat composition test,among others.These tests are more extensive than the regular tests for diabetes because theyll tell the person if he/she is diabetic or not today itself, said Bijo Joseph, marketing head, Apollo. The fest also had interactive sessions with dietitians and endocrinologists, along with a zumba and yoga session for all. The idea behind the fest was to promote the notion that diabetes can be controlled if one keeps their food intake and lifestyle in check.Chief guest of the fest, Prof Dr Shantaram, senior consultant diabetologist, Apollo Sugar, emphasised on inculcating precaution from the primary stages, especially among children, which is the need of the hour. Diabetes is prevalent mostly in the Southern states due to the high intake of rice and carbohydrates. The eating pattern is a lot different from that of the Northern states. Moreover, when you look at it now, children seldom have their PT hours in school and choose to stay indoors and use computers. Pesticides and other synthetic products are used to grow plants. So parents need to identify this first, eliminate sedentary lifestyle and make children exercise to become active, he said.The fest also saw the launch of Apollo Sugars new recipe book D for Delicious, a compilation of around 20 vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes for diabetic patients, penned by dietitians from Apollo Clinics all over India.

However, over the years several hectare of paddy fields gave way to construction activities which not only took a toll on the states rice production but also affected its ecological balance.Now, in a bid to reclaim the lost glory in rice production the state government is coming out with an ambitious programme where the aim is to make the state self-sufficient in rice production by 2017. The project called Rice Year, is expected to be formally announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the first day of the Malayalam month of Chingam (that falls on August 17), which is being observed in the state as Farmers Day.It will be a year-long programme. Starting from Chingam 1 to 2017 Chingam 1,it aims to make the state self-sufficient in rice production. The objective will be to produce sufficient rice so as to meet the needs of the state by 2017. As part of the project each district will undertake 100 activities in the field of paddy cultivation. The activities will be carried out through school and youth clubs, panchayats, resident associations, woman groups, non-governmental organisations and others. The motto of this programme will be Our Food, Our Rice, said V S Sunil Kumar, Agriculture Minister.Meanwhile, K N Harilal of Centre for Developmental Studies told Express that even though increasing paddy cultivation was the need of the hour for the state, it should be ensured that the efforts undertaken in this regard were sustainable, and profitable which provided an assured livelihood.The need to increase paddy cultivation should not be limited to increasing rice productivity. The importance of it in preserving the distinctive ecological system of the state has to be stressed. In addition to that policy makers should have to make paddy cultivation a profitable one. For that, changes are needed in marketing, procurement, insurance schemes, laws and others. Also, the government might have to actively think about enacting the leasing legislation where land owners owning enough land will be required to lease out the land for paddy farmers, said K N Harilal.When asked about this Agriculture Minister V S Sunil Kumar, said subtle changes would be made in the way rice varieties were being marketed in the state.The problem with paddy cultivation in the state is the absence of an organised market. It will be ensured. Besides, it has been found that the state has over 200 varieties of rice and some of them have medicinal qualities. The government plan is to officially promote some of the traditional as well as commercial varieties of rice, he said.Meanwhile, it has been pointed out by critics that even though public money worth several crore is being pumped in to increase paddy cultivation, majority of them miss the target by a mile due to poor implementation and short-sightedness. The Revised Budget presented by Finance Minister Thomas Isaac had earmarked `385 crore for paddy procurement, besides `50 crore for paddy cultivation initiatives."

Currently, we are importing vegetables and rice from the other states to meet our demand, at a time when at least one lakh hectares of agricultural land is lying barren here. The government has decided to utilise the land and promote agriculture in a big way, with the aim of attaining self-sufficiency in vegetable and rice production. As part of the initiative, in the current fiscal year, we will take up upland paddy farming in around 2,500 hectares, said an Agriculture Department official.Upland paddy farming will be carried out with the help of self-help groups, Kudumbashree units and unemployed persons. It will be done on land available at schools, police stations and jails etc. The government will provide subsidy to farmers.The government is also planning to extend organic vegetable farming to 50,000 hectares in the coming years."

We applied kumkum on his forehead. He was a birthday gift to my mother.This 'monster' entered our home as a cute little 26-day-old puppy. Why do I call him a monster? Because we share a sibling rivalry and siblings cant stand each other. But we love each other more than we hate. And its a pleasure to see your younger sibling win.Being our first ever pet dog, he has taught us empathy towards animals. Once upon a time, I remember, I would pelt stones at dogs. But now I can't tolerate any violence towards any animal. I and my family now feed dogs whenever we step out.My love towards them also encouraged me to write about issues concerning them in the newspapers I worked for. This made me more aware of how badly they are treated and how people misuse them for their own benefit. At the same time, I also got to meet animal activists who selflessly work for their welfare. Though I dont involve myself in many rescue operations, I do my bit by avoiding animal products. I think about the pain Prince undergoes when he is hurt. I think about how animals whose leather or wool we are using, go through similar pain but are left unattended. Many also die due to the torture they have to undergo from their owners. I wont call myself a vegan as its tough to be one. I, however, try to avoid causing harm to any animals.When my ex-boss Manju Latha Kalanidhi, who is credited for starting the concept of the 'Rice Bucket Challenge', encouraged me to donate rice to the poor, I thought everyone is helping humans. No one is, however, thinking about animals. I fed the rice to dogs as part of the challenge.Prince made me confident. Taking responsibility for a life is tough. For a period of 15 days in the absence of my family, I somehow managed to take care of this pampered fussy eater while also going about my usual work. This experience gave me the confidence to take up any challenge gracefully.Come Brother's Day, I would miss having a brother on whom I could tie a rakhi. Prince became my first brother and he helped me fulfil this wish. He is now accustomed to a 'thread like thing' being tied on one of his limbs on the day. After that, he awaits his treat."

At 97, Namboodirippad, is all set to travel to the Himalayas on October 3. This will be his 26th consecutive expedition to religious places such as Kedarnath and Badrinath Vaishno Devi Temple in the Himalayan ranges.He has been visiting the region since 1992; in 2006, he visited the Himalayas twice.Born in an aristocratic Namboodiri illam, Pakaravur Mana, Mookkuthala, Malappuram, on January 20, 1920, Namboodiripad was attracted to Communism while doing his Intermediate course from the St Thomas College, Thrissur. Prominent Communist thinker and leader K Damoradan baptised him to Communism.Though Namboodiripad is still a Communist, it was after his sons death due to a heart ailment at the age of 27, that he became inclined towards spirituality.It is this pull that leads him to the Himalayas. However, he is not a hardcore believer of god or any ascetic. He visits a temple near his home in Thrissur once a month.I observe every ascetic with scepticism. But if they are genuine, I believe them, he clears his stand on the ascetics he met during his Himalayan journeys.His first attempt to travel to Kedarnath and Badrinath in 1982 was stalled at Rudraprayag as the friend he was travelling with, contracted food poisoning. His later attempt in 1986 was successful. At that time, travelling was difficult and we had to walk through forests to reach there. I walked nearly 50 km, he says about his first journey. The upcoming expedition will be his 27th one, he says.Ask him what the secret of his health at this age is, and he attributes it to being a vegetarian. He eats a lot of fruits and vegetables, does yoga for 20 minutes and walks half an hour daily. His diet includes three idlis or dosas in the morning and two spoons of rice in the afternoon and night.He rekindled his love for the mountains in 1992 and went on the expedition with his family thrice. In 1992, he experienced some breathing problem because of the low oxygen level at above 11,000 feet from sea level. As his wife suffers from health problems, he now continues his travels with his friends.The former additional director of Kerala Education Department started a school in 1947 after completing his MA from Pachayappa College in Chennai in the 1940s. The school in Mookkuthala for financially and socially backward students was handed over to the government in 1957, for which he accepted `1. The school was later named after him -- a rare occurrence as only in unique circumstances is a school named after a living person."

They have a new menu to celebrate their fifth anniversary in India.Walking into the dimly lit restaurant on the fourth floor of a mall, I am surprised by the burst of colours on the table. Two sets of bamboo baskets come to my table for starters and they open to reveal purple-glazed dim sums and bright orange dim sums adorned with caviar. The purple dim sums has chicken, coriander and chestnut fillings. The layer made of potato starch and wheat starch gets that tinge of purple from the red cabbage. The orange dim sum called Spicy Har Gau has prawns and bamboo shoots in it. The meatiness of the prawn with a faint hint of sour bamboo makes for a melt-in-the mouth dish. The purple one is a harmonious blend of Asian spices.The restaurant that believes in modification of authentic cuisines has modified quite a few. The Crispy Prawn Cheung Fun was one such and it is now the restaurants specialty. Cheung Fun or the Cantonese Rice Roll is traditionally served steamed but the twist here is the crispy layer of fried tempura batter that drapes around succulent prawns and black fungus. Warm soya is poured on top of the silky texture that gives the taste buds a sweet, sour delight.For the main course, we are served Pork and Shrimp Fried Rice and Roasted Duck Udon Noodles. The fried rice is the kind that you would have in a good Chinese restaurant, not much of a surprise, but then I am told the basmati rice has been soaked in Jasmine water. After that I get the taste of jasmine, stir-fried with pork, shrimp and prawns. The chewy Udon Noodles is rich in taste of duck and seasonings.It is a delightful and heavy lunch and they serve Jasmine Tea, to help us with digestion. It is a good idea.Then comes the desserts, the restaurants USP. What I always tell the guests, who are not up for a heavy meal, is this have the dim sums, skip the main course and go straight for the dessert, says Ajay, one of the staff. We are served Citrus Tart and Blueberry Pistachio Bar with Lemon Yoghurt Sorbet and Grapefruit Sorbet respectively.The desserts look delightful with an emphasis on the presentation. The yellow, round Citrus Tart and the Brown Pistachio Bar both are signature dishes. The Pistachio Bar has tiny macaroons, the kind of cakes Yauatcha is known to make it in-house. The Pistachio Bar has four layers -- the base is with grinded almond base, topped with a layers of chocolate, pistachio, blueberry mousse and blueberry glaze. The layers are firm and the sweet taste of creamy pistachio balances out the slightly sour blueberry. . The tangy Citrus Tart is a play of bitter, sweet and sour.The sorbet is a bonus show stealer. It is subtle, rich and creamy. The Lemon Sorbet tasted of lemon, minus the excess sourness that causes us to cringe, and replaces it with the taste of rich cream and yogurt. Same with the Grapefruit Sorbet. I must mention the Hot Toddy mocktail. If you have a bad throat, like I do, then this is what you should opt for. A good mixture of orange juice, pineapple juice and masalas. Youll need to hold the wine glass with a napkin but once you sip on it, the flavours seem to dance.(Approximate cost for twopeople `2,100.

Today this graduate in archeology and meteorology is the keeper of hundreds of traditional varieties of rice.The collection runs into 800, according to Ghani, and he wants to start a rice museum with these in Mandya. He plans to turn his biodiverse farm - also with 120 varieties of mangoes and 75 varieties of vegetables - into a privately held repository of traditional rice seeds. He comes from a family that won a royal honour, of Bada Bhag, from Tipu Sultan.He holds classes for other farmers and even takes twenty students every year to his farm, so that they appreciate where their food comes from. Ghani was on a crowdfunding platform Milaap to raise `10 lakh for this, but managed to get only `18,850.The campaign drew only six suporters, but Ghani knows his mission is important. With traditional seeds farmers are less dependent on multinational companies, he says. The yield per crop is less but it has more nutritional value and the crops require less maintenance.Farmers depend on two kinds of seeds -- landraces that are local varieties grown and shared by farmers over the years and released varieties that are sent out from companies or research institutions.Agriculturists have been moving towards released varieties because of significantly higher yields. Local varieties give 15 to 20 quintals yield but high breeds give up to 400 quintals, says Ghani. But the company-released seeds need more water and chemical fertilisers and pesticides. With local seeds, well be saving the soil for our next generation.The company-released seeds cannot be saved for next years harvesting. So farmers are dependent on seeds with wildly fluctuating prices, says Ghani. But landraces are handed down for generations because they can last for 15 to 20 years.Ghani shares seeds with farmers. Weve given seeds to more than 5,000 in the last twenty years, he says, adding that he has even helped out the agricultural university a few years ago.Dr P Mahadevu, senior scientist at the zonal agricultural research station, had sourced 130 varieties of seeds from Ghani four years ago for the university.Mahadevu agrees that Ghanis is a rich collection. Seventy to eighty per cent of the seeds that are with him are landraces, he says.Mahadevu says that Ghanis effort with the rice museum should be encouraged. Genetic diversity is necessary. If there is a climate change and the temperature rises by a few degrees, then we need a variety that will survive it, he says. The better would be if these are available in the public domain, he says.With so many people living in poverty, access to food should not be determined by profit.Ghanis is a private enterprise but it is a small farmers initiative, and therefore supported by Mahadevu. While government bodies such as National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources do keep a bank of germplasm, Mahadevu says that diversity has a better chance with hundreds of hands working to save it. These farmers may not have the technical knowhow to maintain a germplasm or isolate strains, but their efforts would be cheaper and were likely to get a larger variety of germplasm. If Ghani is even partly successful, it is a good thing, says Mahadev."

Referring to the 1982 Government Order. M.S no 2273 of the Department of Social Welfare, Government of Tamil Nadu, he said rehabilitation consisted of two types  land based and skill based. Agriculture land of 2 acres and 3 cents for housing, under various schemes, must be provided. Also they are entitled for skill development with access to subsidised loan for self employment opportunities, he said, adding that the findings proved rescued labourers were not properly rehabilitated.Indeed, the study found that only 42 per cent were provided housing with 32 per cent receiving house patta. A mere six per cent received agricultural land. More than 90 per cent of those surveyed conveyed that they had not received any skill development training whatsoever.With no viable and sustainable earning opportunities, as much as 46 per cent reported about having outstanding debts and 79 per cent with absolutely no savings at all. All this leads to a scenario wherein the rescued labourers remain vulnerable waiting to be enticed by the promise of advances given by owners of either brick kilns or rice mills, said G Gladstone Xavier, Head of the Department of Social Work at Loyola College, pressing for a more comprehensive package."

So, I rescued 37 dogs from one of the shelters and got them here, he adds.The number of dogs has increased to over 80 as there is no ABC programme in the village and people from the city also rescue dogs and drop them at the shelter. Surya says, It is difficult to manage. I keep posting updates on Facebook. I spend about `70,000 to `80,000 a month. We feed them milk, bread and biscuits in the morning and rice, vegetable or chicken around 5.30 pm.He encourages people to care for dogs and says, People consider street dogs a menace and beat them up.

We suspect that to run the Red war machine, new notes were delivered to the well-designed hierarchical system of Maoists, travelling from the bottom of zonal committees to reach top command levels.Naxals undergoing trainingGrassroots inputs must be integrated into our anti-black money strategy by focusing on the big fish without any delay to prevent Maoists from obtaining fresh funds, sources said.In areas under their control, Naxals levy taxes on small enterprises such as mills, transporters, beedi units, rice and flour mills, grocery stores, private hospitals and liquor shops.According to sources, after the demonetisation announcement, the ultras have struck deals with mine owners, industrialists operating in Naxal-affected areas, smugglers and liquor and timber contractors to obtain newly minted money. A source pointed out the cost of Naxalite terror ops is relatively low compared to the damage they inflict, and the opportune moment to cut off their revenue streams has arrived.No one generally realises that just `125-130 crore is enough to run insurgency in 10 states, though it is not necessarily the authentic figure. Although we have tasked a unit in the intelligence apparatus to look into the flow of money, post-demonetisation, the inputs are sketchy, said a senior official.Catching Naxal sympathisers, front organisations and overground workers before they legitimise funds presents unique challenges, said a senior security official, claiming the government is taking steps to target individuals and groups, suspected of being involved in Maoist terror financing by using Standard Operating Procedures (SoPs). For example, they plan ruthless crackdowns on the mining and public works sectors, which involve private contractors who provide huge sums as protection money. The SoPs seek close monitoring of known sources of finances, including big industries and registering criminal cases against sources of finance. The directive reviewed by Express clearly suggests penalising government servants and businessmen, irrespective of their economic standing, for paying extortion money."

Well, most of them are a dud, right? Rajith Nair did the same and realised some places were a waste of time. A heritage lover, he opened a special interest travel firm, Travelling Gecko, that identifes lesser-known stories in destinations.After he quit his job in a digital advertising research company in 2012, he and his wife shifted to Kochi to explore with their savings. Two years of exploration and research brought fascinating stories. I stumbled across a royal family, who set the laws and welcomed the Europeans to their land. They lived in residential quarters, with a beautiful home around 200-years-old built by the Dutch. I got in touch with them, told them what I wanted to do. Organise a trip, talk about their history, contributions, take them inside the palace and interact. They were happy and eager, smiles Rajith who also spoke to them about preserving what little is left of their heritage structure.P JawaharAnother example would be Allepey. When you go there during the holiday season and stand by the shore, all you can see are house boats standing in a line almost like a train. Not very scenic. I met a gentleman who organizes boat rides in a traditional country boat that was used to transfer rice and fish. He set up cushioned benches in it. Narrow streams where house boats cant enter, he had easier access. You can see children playing, women working, men on their boats, and even a toddy tapper with his bottle. Now thats a true backwater experience! he explains.Rajith tied up with him. Part of the funds that Travelling Gecko receives go to him, a part to the toddy tapper who would give toddy to taste and part to a family living on an island who prepares a meal for you. Many local people benefit through your holiday.In 2014, Rajith packed his bags and came to namma ooru. The timing couldnt have been better. Madras Week celebrations were going on. The different walks and talks were the perfect introduction to the city. I met Chitra Madhavan, Sriram, Muthiah sir and so many others who helped me learn more. Of course, the books in Madras Literary Society were another source of inspiration.We asked him to share something not many Chennaiites would know. He smiles, The Arms and Weapons Gallery in Egmore museum. You may be familiar with the gallery at Fort Museum but is was another and we got a history lesson that left us overwhelmed.There are two large Chinese bells that carried a story in its inscriptions. People in the gallery didnt know the history; so I hit the books and was amazed. They probably came from the summer palace in China during the Opium War in the mid 19th Century. The British provided high quality opium to the Chinese, who paid them in silver, which was then traded with Indians for tea. In the late 1700s, the Chinese emperor banned opium but private peddlars continued work. He then sent an army to seize all opium from the British and burn themRajith continued to talk about free trade, war and treaties. It was fascinating and for a minute, the museum almost came alive! Rajith has organized 60 trips. If youre looking for an experience, first Travelling Gecko would want you to fill a form about your interests and other details. Rajith spends few days, setting destinations, linking stories and making an itinerary.Chennai has a lot of stories and many have been explored by other history enthusiasts like Rajith. What needs more exploration is George Town and Triplicane. The history, the communities, food storiesthere is so much! I believe in living in the city before I organise trips and tell stories.After Tamil Nadu, he hopes to move to other parts of the country. The Durga Pooja in Kolkata, Ram Leela in Varnasi, Nawabs in Lucknow are some of the stories Im keen on exploring. And the history buffs I meet, inspire me with their stories and experiences, he grins.For details, visit www.travellinggecko.com"

Often found outside the front door of a house, the kolam, known by different names in other parts of the country, has always been a part of our tradition. City Express chats with Shakuntala Ramani, chairperson, craft education and research center, Kalakshetra Foundation, about her recently-released book, Kolam and other ritual arts of India.Growing up in a conservative Hindu household that embraced every tradition and ritual, Shakuntala says that there was no specific point where she learnt the art of kolam. It was a part of our daily routine and I didnt have to learn it. It was something that was innate, she recalls.Of course, seeing the art disappear in urban settings and sticker kolams taking their place in high-rise apartments shook her up. I used to live in North India and whenever we came down South, I used to stay at my grandfathers house at Kumbakonam, where kolams and rituals were part of the lives of people here, she narrates. Each street had kolams, be it in front of a big bungalow or a small house.Shakuntala recalls how during one of her trips she found a big kolam in front of a hut owned by an underprivileged woman. All she owned was a goat that was tied to the pillar of the hut. I felt thats the spirit of this art form. Kolam gives some type of sustenance or courage and that for me was a ray of hope, smiles the author who has also penned the book, Sari the Kalakshetra Tradition.On a journey to revive the art, Shakuntala began researching the topic full time. The book not only focuses on Tamil Nadu, but also on an amalgamation of the different expressions of kolam in different parts of the country. From the yantras and mandals in domestic worship to the mandals in different rituals, she explains them all with illustrations and pictures that have been shared by kolam experts from various parts of the country including art centers like Santiniketan.Kolam has embedded its essence in different states under diverse names such as Muggulu (Andhra Pradesh). Kalamezhuttu (Kerala), Alpona (Bengal), Mandana (Rajasthan) and Jhooti Chitra (Orissa), but the similarities of the designs are striking. Every state has evolved the kolam according to their specialty and each design has a character of its own. But, some motifs like the lotus, sun and moon are universal, she points out.Drawing a connection between the mathematical Fibonacci series, she shares that Naranan, a mathematician stated how kolam has both science and maths involved in it. Kolam has circles, triangles, squares and a series of dots in a systematic order. In mathematical terms, both geometry and Fibonacci series are part of kolam. Its surprising how people back then without knowing the precise science or mathematics involved in the art have made such designs effortlessly. Putting dots on the ground with even spaces really impressed me! she exclaims.Does she believe that kolam belongs to a particular religion? No, not at all! I know a Christian boy Thomas who draws extraordinary kolams. He does it for most of the functions at Kalakshetra, she shares. Though kolam does not have relevance to specific rituals, it is a part of most festivals including Dusserah, Diwali and Pongal. Absorbing several influences which are cultural, religious and social, the complex art form has several layers.We used to place the banana plantains on a kolam before serving food. Wed clean the door front with water and decorate it with kolam and apply the ochre liquid called kaavi. This tradition has to be kept alive and one shouldnt close the door on it and call it old fashioned, she adds."

And Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) which owns 'Jaiva Pokkali' trade mark will share it with the Pokkali Farmer Producers Company to facilitate the marketing of the Pokkali products Initially, the collaboration will come up with value added products, including Pokkali Rice powder and crushed rice.The salt tolerant rice, which is cultivated in the water logged regions, is rich in nutrients and is cultivated in an organic manner.""KVK owns the trademark and the initial plan was to sublet the trademark to various Pokkali farmers groups. However, later the authorities concerned decided to explore the market potential of these produce. This has resulted in the registration of Pokkali Farmer Producers Company which has 50 members. The primary aim of the company is to market Pokkali products under the brand, providing Pokkali seeds, hatching fish seeds and distributing it among the farmers, besides lending water pumps and other equipment to farmers, according to KVK senior scientist and head Shinoj Subramanian.In Kerala, Pokkali is mainly cultivated in the islands in Ernakulam, the water logged areas in neighbouring Alappuzha and some parts of Thrissur. The Pokkali Rice, at present, is being sold in the retail market (through select outlets) at normal prices like the other rice varieties available on the market.The officials hope that the Pokkali rice, which is being sold at Rs 35-Rs 40 per kg now, will now commaznd better prices as a result of branding.The rice, which is cultivated manually, is normally expensive than the normal paddy cultivation. Moreover, out of the nearly 5,000 hectare of Pokkali farms in Ernakulam and neighbouring districts, cultivation has now shrunk to nearly 1,000 hectare due to the low market price and the high cost of production. Hence, if we can offer a much better market price through branding, we believe that more farmers will be drawn towards Pokkali farming, he added."

Curious enough, What is this tiffin box made of? we thought. But, as we walked closer to the stall that was neatly spread under a tree, we couldnt disapprove of the pricing. A cluster of brass vessels, wooden cupboards, bells, chairs and everything that a heritage buff would tag  antique, were on display at the stall. As we examined every piece one by one, a voice floated to us. These are all from Karaikudi, the source was Saradha Rajendran, owner of this antique trove, curated from Karaikudi, a heritage town in the Chettinadu region.A native of Karaikudi, Saradha has been a resident of Chennai for 18 years. So, what made her take up this business? Since I am from this place that is rich in heritage and known for its antiques, I used to make replicas of the objects and sell it when I first came to the city, she narrates, After a few years, my customers suggested that I collect the original pieces from Chettinadu and sell it to collectors and other buyers, she recalls. Since most antiques that are thrown away are destroyed without valuing their heritage, Saradha says that she decided to collect them and give it to better hands.For the past 10 years, Saradha has involved herself in collecting antiques, family heirlooms and objects of value which have their origin rooted to the big houses in Karaikudi and the surrounding areas. While the antiques at the stall are only a part of the collection, most of them are stored in a go-down. One of Saradhas aids opines, Its not an easy task to collect them. One should be an expert in selecting and choosing the right piece. She knows what her clients like and she knows what people prefer. Doing this single handedly is a huge effort!Aruvamanai (vegetable cutter/coconut scraper) in elaborate designs including a small portable one made of wood and steel, wooden panels with intricate carvings of gods and goddesses, old teak doors, rose wood cupboards, height-adjustable brass lamps, wooden rice strainer, baby cradle, rice barrels, and reclining chairs were some of the objects on display. Most of the items are over 70 years old and some are even as old as 100. Most people who buy them use it for interior decorationsbut, there are some who use it for day-to-day purposes as well, she says pointing to the brass vessels that were once used for cultural and religious purposes.What grabbed our attention were the vivid enamel wares. Karaikudi was home to the rich Nagarathar Chettiars who were a business community, and they not only had a business front in Tamil Nadu, but were known for their wealth which they brought from places like Sweden, Burma, Malaysia and Czechoslovakia. The Chettiars were the ones who used to travel to foreign countries for business deals. When they came back, they used to bring these wares and other valuables from these countries. You can find them only in Chettinadu. But, as time passed, these wares were also taken to places like Jodhpur, Coonoor and so on, she explains as she points to a huge wooden box  the dowry box. This is from Burmathe jewels and other valuables that were given as dowry, used to be given away in this box, she says as she opens the lid. What we saw were multiples compartments that went deep into the three feet box.With a huge clientele base in Chennai, Bangalore and Goa, Saradha says that the awareness on antiques is commendable in these places. If someone wants the brass wares to be polished or the wooden furniture to be varnished, we do it. Its gratifying to see people come forward to retain the heritage. If these objects are not preserved in some home, we will one day not have a heritage to talk about, she adds.For details, call 9444483535"

And their Facebook page has been drawing plenty of interest from pet owners all over the city.It is also significant to mention that the profile of folks in need of assistance with cooked meals for their pets goes well beyond rushed office goers too busy to cook daily. Vegetarians who arent comfortable cooking meat at home but dont want to deprive their dogs of it have been calling in, recalls Rajesh. His wife Corina jumps in, We had a senior citizen who couldnt find a beef stall in her neighbourhood reach us to us because she wanted to treat her dog to a little bit of variety...

The state government has failed to restore it. In such circumstances, the Food and Civil Supplies Minister, who virtually became a mute spectator, should quit, said Satheesan, while addressing a press conference here.The Congress MLA added that the state was shifting the blame for the situation on the Centre, saying that the latter denied ration allocation to the state.Actually, Centre allocated 14.25 metric tonne rice and had not provided the ad-hoc rice allocation of 2 lakh metric tonne. However, the state government failed to distribute foodgrains from FCI godowns to ration shops, which interrupted the ration supply, he pointed out.This derailment in ration distribution had adversely hit BPL families, as most families received only half of the allocated rice quantity, said Satheesan.Market prices of rice skyrocketed due to irregular ration supply. Common people are affected. Still, authorities have not taken steps to resolve the issue, he added.On a different query regarding appointment of new DCC presidents, Satheesan said the new presidents were selected on the basis of their calibre and hence there was no need for discontent."

Each 550 sq ft house is expected to be completed at an estimated cost of Rs 5.5 lakh.After the Jisha murder in Perumbavoor, the party had made it clear that nabbing the culprit alone will not end the woes of those who reside on puramboke land. The housing project is as part of that decision. Along with that, we are also planning to provide scholarships for the students staying on puramboke land, added Rajeeve."

Eight CEOs and directors stepped out of their white collar roles and donned a chefs hat at the hotel, accompanied by eight kids from Smile Foundation.Events like this help give our children an opportunity to see what luxury is and how people can be sensitive towards a cause. They see that even though they are not from a privileged background, there are people who can hold hands and guide them. With a little hard work, there is nothing to stop them from dreaming big. It helps build ambition to take them ahead, said Rajyalakshmi, from Smile Foundation.The winning teamThe idea is to use this great platform to bring together all corporates from India and abroad to our association with Smile, give them greater visibility and also contribute to a greater cause while still creating better engagement with customers, said Aashima Sharma, general manager, Park Hyatt Chennai.On the panel of judges were Tommy Ekstrand, Chef Teuku Syafrulsyah, Kavita Chestty and Ameena Agnihotri. Tommy was the winner of Hyatt Culinary Challenge 2015, Kavita a restaurateur, Teuku is the executive chef at Park Hyatt, Chennai, and Ameeta, a food critic. Benazir Hussain and her little masterchef Sharmine stole the show with an aromatic homestyle biryani, while Rathi and her junior chef Salman qualified as the runners up, with their Prawn Sambal. Among others, Vivek Karunakarans dish where two states met in the form of delicious Kerala beef cry with coastal Goan rice cake (sannas) and Premilas cauliflower manchurian with a healthy twist stood out.It was great to see the enthusiasm in participants. Some of them came in with very simple recipes, but once you start tasting the food, you realise that the simplest things are the most difficult to get perfectly, added Aashima.Chef Teuku concurred and added, It isnt easy to cook a biryani in 90 minutes. It was all done well considering the participants were not professionals.Since the challenge required a certain level of understanding and creativity, the kids from Smile who participated were all above the age of 14. This is the third season of the challenge, and the event will be held at other Hyatt hotels including Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi, among others. The finale will be held in Chandigarh on November 19 where the winners from all the other cities will participate."

Unable to transport onions to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka now has more supply than demand, leading to a drastic fall in prices. At the APMC Yard in Yeshwantpur, one of the biggest yards in the state, traders are selling onions for just `1 per kg.Protests over releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu have hit the trade of onions, foodgrains and other essential commodities between the two states.According to traders in the APMC Yard, Tamil Nadu is the main buyer of onion and garlic produced in Karnataka. Tamil Nadu buys 150 to 200 truckloads of onions every day from Karnataka.Paramesh, president of State APMC Yard Workers Union, told Express, Since this is one of the biggest yards in the state, usually, there are 10 to 15 lakh people here every day. But ever since the Cauvery agitation started, the number of people has come down by 30 per cent.According to traders in the market, onion is the worst hit. Onions have a short shelf life. Since the protests started, the onions that were in stock have started to rot. So we are selling them at `1 per kilo. Good quality onions cost `6 to `8 per kg.Nandeesha, a trader at APMC Yard, said, Some of our truck drivers are stuck midway and are forced to throw away the rotting onions.The rice market is also affected to a great extent. According to the traders, Karnataka sends some 200 to 250 truckloads of rice to Tamil Nadu daily.Though we are ready to send the load, the drivers are scared to cross the border. So we are stocking it up and will send it once the situation is normal, rice merchant Shivanna said."

Now, with water scarcity in the area, rice production in the state will take a hit, leading to rising prices.Last year, Karnataka produced 110 lakh tonnes of foodgrains. Agriculture Department officials were expecting a produce of 140 lakh tonnes this year but now they doubt if the state can even meet last years target.Sources in Karnataka Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Limited said last year the prices of most of the rice varieties increased because of the drought. This year, it is likely to increase further, they say. In December 2015, Sona Masuri was up from `42 per kg to `50 per kg and steam rice increased from `32 per kg to `40 per kg. It will increase further, a source said.According to Gokul Prasad, Deputy Director (Statistics), Karnataka State Department of Agriculture, the state has 73 lakh hectares of land under cultivation, of which sowing is done on 63 lakh hectares.A senior official from Mandya said 2.2 lakh hectares of land is under cultivation in the district. For paddy alone, 63,000 hectares of land is under cultivation, of which 25,000 hectares are already covered.But since the Kharif season is coming to an end, looks like sowing will not be done on even 35,000 hectares this year. It is no different in Mysuru, he said.Another source said that paddy production in the state usually covers 10.56 lakh hectares, but this year production is unlikely to cover about 7 lakh hectares."

A close friend of Subhash Chandra Bose, Phizo allied with the Japanese in Burma during World War II.From being a cradle of resistance to both the British and Indian rule, Khonoma has come a long way to become Asias first green village. The Angami Naga village of 600 houses was one of the last villages that fought a bloody war with the British from 1878-80 against imposed land tax rules.Christianity was introduced in 1897 by American Baptists after Khonomas defeat, Chase added.Until Shillong Accord of 1975, Indian Army had sealed the village. Even a child needed permission to relieve himself/ herself in the fields. Those were the heady days. We had to undergo tremendous torture at the hands of the Indian Army, he said.However, times have changed. The Indian Army has become friendly and helped construct an array of community assets from public toilets to irrigation facilities. Gradually, the birthplace of Naga nationalism has moved on to impose a total ban on hunting, and jhum cultivation, without which practically no Naga village can survive. Now, waste generated in the village is segregated and disposed, majorly by incineration.It was a very difficult task in the beginning to persuade people to give up hunting and jhum (shifting) cultivation. But, in 1998, the Khonoma Nature Conservation and Tragopan Sanctuary (KNCTS) was established by the Khonoma village council to protect wild animals and birds, including the rare tragophan bird, said Chase, then vice secretary of the village council.Over the years, we have conserved over 123.23 sq km of forest in Khonoma village, and people practice wet rice cultivation in terrace farms, he saidOwing to its history of resistance to outsider rule, Khonoma has over 1,000 country-made guns, despite its ban on hunting.After death of Phizo, a lot of factions of the Naga Army emerged, the Isak-Muivah, Khaplang factions and so our movement weakened. No one treads the path of Phizo. Added to that, the young generation is after easy money. Nobody wants to struggle for the Naga cause, he said."

There were families from all across India staying there, and it was from them that I explored cuisines from other states, she says.She really starting branching out while teaching cookery at the Cultural Academy in Santhome. Corporates started approaching me for demonstrations and promotions. I was also a professional food consultant for food appliance companies, wherein I would travel to various countries and study their cuisine to see how our appliances could be adapted for them, she says, adding that it exposed her to a lot of different cuisines.It is out of her vast experience that she came up with Kitchen Nostalgia.

All recipes in the book are curries, because they are the backbone of many Indian and Asian meals. You can make a satisfying meal out it with anything, from rice or breads! Also, they are all vegetarian because I wanted to show with more people adopting vegetarianism globally, there lots of options.

58fd5dde7be9e06c9371a7fa,Pellets or grains for furry friends?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/sep/21/Pellets-or-grains-for-furry-friends-1521949.html,2016-09-21,"CHENNAI: A nutritious and balanced diet is essential for your furry friends, but how can you pick the right one? You are pointed to many directions depending on who you ask. Lets take a quick run through the best available.The CarnivoresDogs have evolved from wolves and they are carnivorous. Hence, meat is a pre-requisite in their diet. Naveen Ronalds from Canine Cuisine who has been studying canine nutrition for the past five to six years says, Their digestive enzymes cannot break down the grains and vegetables. They should be given a meat-based diet.The dogs can survive but not thrive on grains, chapatis and vegetables. Amrut S Hiranya, a dog behaviourist, says that Indian dogs can survive on the food that is cooked in an Indian household because of their ancestry, but breed dogs cannot.Naveen adds, Grains and vegetables affect their kidney and liver as these organs overwork to excrete foreign foods. Dog guru Amrut says that dogs eat vegetables and fruits because of the smell and not the taste. Vegetables are not digestible. You can see small pieces of carrots in their stool.Sugar is a definite No. Amrut says, A small piece of chocolate can cut their life span by a week. Naveen adds, It affects their kidney.Some doctors say dogs can be given rice and vegetables. Dr Ashwin says, The diet depends on the breed and activity levels of a dog. They need some amount of carbohydrates. Boiled rice is better. Vegetables and fruits can be given except garlic, onion, tomato and tubers such as potato and yam. They affects their kidneys. Citrus fruits like lemon and grapes should be avoided.The BARF dietThe BARF diet is the best for dogs, suggests Amrut. It stands for Biologically Appropriate Raw Food. The quality of raw meat should be really good. That helps the canines live longer. But in India, it is difficult to get good quality meat because they are processed.The dogs are lactose-intolerant and hence they cannot digest packaged milk. Curd and butter milk act as better calcium and protein sources for dogs.Amrut adds, If the mother dies, goat milk is the best option for dogs. According to dogsnaturallymagazine.com, goat milk has some unique properties that make it more easily digestible than other kinds of milk. Studies show that cow milk, which contains something called alpha-s1-casein protein is more likely to cause allergic reactions than goat milk, which contains extremely low or no amounts of this protein.Formulated dietDr G Pampapathi, a veteranarian suggests formulated diet for the pets over homemade food. The formulated diet is the commercial dog food products that are manufactured according to the nutrient requirements and lifestyle of the dogs.He says, It is difficult to prepare home-cooked food for dogs that have adequate nutritional balance. There are categories according to the sizes - puppy junior, young adults, adults and seniors. Also, there are prescription diets for dogs with health issues. For example, there are weight loss diets and hepatitis diets. There is also breed-specific diet in the market available today, adds the vet. Theres pug food. But there isnt much difference in pug food and ordinary small breed dog foods.The main nutrient requirements for a dog include fats, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals like calcium and phosphorus are also very important for their bone growth. Dr Pampapathi says, There are tonics supplements that can be given to them in the form of tablets or syrups. But if your are buying formulated diet, you do not need supplements.Amrut adds that large and giant dog breeds are more prone to nutrient deficiency diseases. They grow rapidly and hence the demand for nutrition is also higher. It is important for them to have a proper nutritional food, otherwise it can lead to abnormal and stunted growth. It can create bone and thus limb abnormalities.OverfeedingOne should also keep a check on overfeeding. Amrut says that after 18 months, one large feed for a home dog is fine. Overfeeding is a big problem, he says. It has become a habit People tend to feed their dogs everytime they have a cup of tea or feed their children... Just because they are looking at you, you dont have to feed them. Repeated feeding messes up their health.The Body Score Index can be a good reference point to check if the pet is overweight. Dr Pampapathi says, We touch the chest area of a dog and if do not feel the ribs, we know that it is overweight and prescribe a weight-loss diet."

She had found her artistic inspiration. Jane now uses thin metal sheets to carve erotic Kama Sutra postures and frames them in glass.Want some fashion infused art? Social and political ideas find their imprint in the works of Daria Dorosh. Dried moss and paintings fuse to become romantic images in Melissa Furness collection titled Manly Moss. And one can see a blurred Mata Amritanandamayi in one of the blurred photographs of Maxine Henryson, who believes that theres a moment of darshan caught between blur and details.Inside the OED gallery, at Mattancherry, the artists from AIR (Artists in Residence, which is a collateral project)are making their voices heard and expressions felt in the delightful chaos of the Kochi biennale where art opens doors to fresh perspectives.Jayanthi Moorthy, co-curator of Cooperative Consciousness, AIR, endorses the idea of a womens collective, where artists work together rather than as standalone professionals.AIR in New York has been observing this pratice of inclusion since its inception. We believe that working together, exploring opportunities collectively will help us grow better, without getting tangled in the otherwise competitive atmosphere, says Jayanthi.Since it is an all-women group, is the perspective more feminine? Some, not all. Some women need to narrate their emotions that pertain to the hardships of being a woman. Others just need to find their expression, which neednt have a strong feminist outlook to it, Jayanthi elaborates.The collective works of 12 artists from diverse backgrounds, curated by Kathryn Myers, and co-curated by Jayanthi have been displayed.We are from all over the world. There are Mexican, Indian, Swedish and American artists of all ages working in collaboration. We go in search of venues in different countries to organise our exhibition, she said.The art isnt confined to the white cube space. Instead, it is taken outside, letting it find its expression with the unconventional materials that are used. For example, my work is in acrylic, but its texture differs. It has a woven effect and is more thread-like on canvas, Jayamthi explains. And when I take my art outside, my medium changes.Jayanthy uses sand and rice flour, inspired by the traditional art of Kolam. But my inspiration finds contemporary ways to express itself, and that becomes her off-the-white cube space artform, says Jayanthi, a Tamilian who grew up in Kerala before relocating to New York.A workshop on December 21 will duly follow a panel discussion scheduled on December 14 by the AIR representatives in OED gallery, Mattanncherry."

However, for the first time, the institute is trying to look for genes from a tropical wild rice, Porteresia coarctata, a tetraploid mangrove growing abundantly in coastal regions of India.Our focus is to understand salt-tolerance mechanism of this wild species and target transportable genes, directly involved in mitigating salinity. Then, introduce those genes in popular rice varieties like SR-64, Ponni and ADT-43 cultivated extensively in Tamil Nadu and Andhra and analyse salinity tolerance in a greenhouse set-up. Once successful, we can advance to field experiments on a pilot scale, he said.Gayatri Venkataraman, principal scientist at Plant Molecular Biology laboratory in MSSRF, said Porteresia is the closest relative of rice and evidence shows that there are some pathways critical to salt tolerance in this halophytic rice.The Australian researchers will complement the project by bringing expertise in structural biology and cell biology.According to Parida, this is a three-year project with $ 1 million granted under Australia-India Strategic Research Fund (AISRF)."

The Kings who favoured the Pandavas used to supply provisions to them at the Suryanelli forests which was not too far from Devikulam.Among the provisions, one of the Kings once supplied broken rice as a special item to Draupadi. She made steamed rice balls with it for her beloved husbands, especially Bhima, the second and the voracious giant of the five. The next day, Panchali served the rice delicacy for breakfast and set aside a major portion for Bhima. With vehement appetite for the rice balls piled up before him, he mouthed a big handful but, alas, there he stood with gaping mouth and popping eyeballs! All the four brothers including Panchali stood transfixed. Right the next moment, he spat it all out uttering derisively, No salt, no taste and he threw the entire rice balls away.Legend has it that the unsavoury balls he hurled spread over the entire foothills, and the farmers and sojourners, to this day, chance upon those balls as they spade or roam the foothills. This is a popular myth around the locality.Meawnhile, P B Peter, who has a thirst for knowledge where historic events are concerned, had collected two stone-like objects from Devikulam Hills during his visit to the place.Initially I thought it was just a stone. Later, when the locals told me about the myth, I broke one piece and tasted it. I was surprised to find that there was indeed no salty flavour to it; it was almost tasteless, said P B Peter.However Peter says that one cannot make sure if Bhima ever visited the hills or the incidents detailed took place. It is a complicated study. We can conclude in either ways; credit is attributed to the particular stone after finding its similarity to the incident in Mahabharatha or vice versa, he added.Legend also has it that Draupadi (Panchali Devi) used to bathe in the lake/pond (kulam) at the foothills, and hence the place came to be known as Devikulam.I still have the other stone aka rice ball with me. Ive kept it safely and hope that it will help researchers who are tracing the myth, he added."

But the students of the University of Madras have one more reason to be worried about the vacancy of the universitys Vice-Chancellor post  their food bills.The delay in the administrative activities caused by the vacancy of the VC post has resulted in closure of the canteen on the Chepauk campus for the last four months. Students say this has forced them to eat food from outside restaurants, which is expensive, or from roadside stalls, which many may consider unhygienic.The canteen food was cheap. For instance, variety rice would cost just Rs 8-12. But now, we spend up to Rs 30 for a proper meal, said a student of the Marina campus of the university.With a fresh batch of students joining the campus, the students said they had been demanding the opening of the canteen before the new students join. We requested the university authorities to reopen the canteen earlier, but no one lent us an ear, said another student. Asked about it, university sources attributed the situation to the delay in the administration caused by the vacancy of the Vice-Chancellor post. The post has been lying vacant since January, after R Thandavan vacated it.According to university norms, the service contract for running the canteens on the four campuses of the university  Chepauk, Marina, Guindy and Taramani  should be renewed once in three years. Given the slow progress, the administration has failed to renew the contract, which expired in March, university sources said.Talking to Express, Registrar P David Jawahar acknowledged that it was the VC post vacancy that is causing the delay in renewal of the contract. We have floated tenders and the canteens will probably be reopened by the end of this month, he added"

Trying to flee the inferno which razed her thatched hut last Tuesday night, she tripped on a large stone and fell face down. Although she is happy to have escaped with just a scar, she is concerned and anxious about her future. Sitting under a shamiyana that gently sways in the mid-day sea breeze, the mother of three children (two are girls), said, My first priority is finding a shelter for my girls.It has been six days since a blaze gutted more than 40 huts in Odai Kuppam near Elliots Beach. With the initial shock slowly wearing off, those affected by the fire are gradually getting back to their feet. Parents say school children have started going to classes, while working men have gone back to their livelihoods.However, the scene of the destruction, pretty much intact, presents a grim tale of sorrow and pathos. An assortment of vehicles, electrical appliances and documents lay scattered, all burnt. Although the land on which their huts stood was a poromboke land (unregistered public land), Aadhaar card, EB card and other government IDs, which served as proof of their residence, have all been lost in the midnight blaze.The State government stepped in immediately and gave an initial relief amount of `5,000, a dhoti and sari to each family. Though the residents are happy with the gesture, there are concerns. All that the 80-odd families want now is a place to stay  a place they can call home that they expect the authorities to give them.Valarmathi, a toy vendor who lost her hut, said, We cant afford to rebuild the huts with `5,000...just the materials alone would cost `4,000! When our huts were gutted, our lifetime savings went up in flames as well. Nothing can replace living under our own roof, be it an asbestos or even a thatched roof.When an official was asked about this, he said, The government is not going to replace the homes as existing norms prohibit any kind of developmental activity along Coastal Regulation Zone. We have announced financial aid to the affected families so that they can rebuild their huts themselves.Although material help including ration supplies and monetary assistance have been provided to them by the local MLA and a few political parties, residents admit that most of the relief efforts were taken by the NGOs. Says Archanaa Seker, a coordinator in relief efforts, The community is waiting for long-term housing and we dont know what plans, if any, the government has. Corporation officials provided only five meals, which was over last Saturday. But after we intervened, it was extended till Monday night.With food supplies expected to stop from Tuesday, Vaishnavi Jayakumar, co-founder of The Banyan, and member of the Disability Rights Alliance, pointed out, It was great that the government gave away rice and money, and the civil society groups gave stoves, and other relief materials. But what will the residents do without kerosene? How will they cook without it?"

""An order of this court has to be complied by all the concerned and it is the obligation of the executive to ensure that the orders are complied in letter and spirit. Protests by farmers have been reported from several parts of Karnataka over the Supreme Court order asking it to release water to Tamil Nadu.During the hearing, the bench noted the stiff claim and counter-claims of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu and said that it would apply the concept of fair compensation in the matter and fixed it for further hearing on September 20.The apex court was hearing the application filed by Karnataka seeking a direction to reduce the quantum of water to be released from Cauvery River to Tamil Nadu from 15,000 cusecs to 1,000 cusecs.The apex court's decision to hear the plea, filed late Saturday evening, came after it was mentioned before the court's registry, which consulted Chief Justice T S Thakur.In its plea, Karnataka has sought modification of the apex court's September 5 order for release of 15,000 cusecs of water for 10 days as immediate relief to Tamil Nadu farmers. The Cauvery Supervisory Committee is meeting here today to decide on the quantum of the river's water to be released to Tamil Nadu and other states.The application has sought that instead of 10 days, the apex court should restrict the release of water to only 6 as the state itself was facing a distress situation due to a massive agitation which was causing a loss of Rs 500 crore per day to Karnataka.In the plea, Karnataka has said there was ""huge public pressure"" and the state police, with great difficulty, has been able to prevent attempts to damage public property. ""Even the minimum arrangement mentioned by your lordships has caused distress and havoc in the entire southern part of Karnataka, paralysing civil life. The agitation of farmers has been that their dry crop is equalled with that of the farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu's need for the rice crop consumes more than twice the water which is needed for light crops in Karnataka,"" the application said.The application says that people, particularly farmers in the districts of Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya and Bengaluru, have been squatting on the roads and streets, affecting the IT industry in the state capital which earns huge revenue by way of income tax, service tax, and foreign exchange of USD 60 billion for the country.The application also referred to inputs from security agencies that said if the flow of water is allowed to continue further, the situation ""may go out of hand"". In an interim order on September 5, the court had directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day to Tamil Nadu for the next 10 days to ameliorate the plight of the farmers there.The apex court had also directed Tamil Nadu to approach Supervisory Committee, set up to implement the award of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, within three days for release of water as per the final order of the CWDT."

He will soon send a detailed note to the PM in this regard. I have told the Prime Minister how we can make use of paddy straw instead of burning it. You cannot ask farmers to stop burning paddy straw as he has to prepare his field for the next crop. You must find a mechanism to commercialise it, Swaminathan told PTI on the sidelines of an event here.A technology has been developed in Maharashtra for using paddy straw as animal feed, he said. You add urea and molasses in paddy straw, you can use it as animal feed. There are many different ways, paddy straw can be utilised. The PM was very interested and I will soon send a note to him on this topic, he said.India produces 140 million tonnes of paddy and 280 million tonnes of rice straw in a year, he added.Swaminathan, known as Father of India's Green Revolution, was sharing the dias with the Prime Minister at first ever international conference of agro-biodiversity being held here.While addressing the event, he spoke on the issue saying that when we talk about agro-biodiversity, it is not about grains alone but about the whole plant. Paddy straw enriched with urea and molasses is a wonderful animal feed, he said while citing example of research work done in Myanmar in this regard.Meanwhile, the Centre has called a meeting of Environment Ministers of all neighbouring states on Monday to curb stubble burning by farmers which has made Delhi a gas chamber. There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation, Union Environment Minister Anil Dave had said.Cases of severe breathlessness, asthma and allergy have sharply risen in Delhi as the city remains blanketed in thick layer of toxic air due to the worst smog in 17 years, aggravated by use of Diwali crackers last week."

She puts it on, combs her hair back into a bun and rushes to catch her early morning bus to work.Not too long ago the 23-year-old along with Hemavathi, 22, and Deepa, 24, were unemployed, struggling to make ends meet with their household expenses. Things are different now. The social organisations they were part of have ensured all three are employed.

58fd62947be9e06c9371ae09,The social relevance of Aadi Masam,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2016/aug/06/The-social-relevance-of-Aadi-Masam-1506006.html,2016-08-06,"CHENNAI: Outside an Amman temple, nearly five bricks coated with sandhanam (sandalwood paste) and kungumam are placed together, so you that you light a fire in-between them to prepare koozhu (rice-porridge). This is a common sight in almost all the temples in Chennai during the Tamil month of Aadi (July 16-August 17).City Express takes a tour to find out more about the significance of Aadi. There are a number of auspicious days for goddess Amman in this month. To name just a few  Aadi Pirappu, Aadi Ammavaasai, Aadi Karthigai, Aadi Pooram, Aadi Peruku, Aadi Velli and Varalakshmi Nombu.Despite such a line-up, families avoid occasions like marriage, house shifting and taking important business decisions. Why? Aadi is a month that is dedicated to the goddess. We, as devotees, worship her fervently during this month, said Usha Rani, who undertakes rituals and other religious activities. Tuesday, Friday and Sunday are considered to be the auspicious days in Aadi. People usually prepare items like koozhu, pongal or curd rice and distribute it to people. I have been offering pongal to Amman for nearly 36 years. I do it because my grandmother and mother have being doing it for many years, and I want to follow them. Also, I believe the goddess drives me to do this, said Gija Bhai, as she was making pongal in the temple on Mint Street.Another devotee Meenakshi, who was spotted distributing pongal with jaggery at a small temple in Nungambakkam, said, We make food for the entire day and feed the poor. In the morning, we make koozhu and fish; in the afternoon, its rice and jaggery, and for the night, we make kozhukattai and fish again.Apart from preparing food and distributing it to people, events like paal kudam poojai (devotees carry milk pots and give it to the goddess) and poo medhikarudhu (walking over burning embers) are common too.While some follow these rituals in the footsteps of their ancestors, others believe they are doing it as part of their vows after their wishes were fulfilled by the goddess. Most Amman temples are decorated with colourful lights and host a series of cultural, religious events that go on till late in the night.Rituals that bond many communitiesCity Express looks deeper into the Aadi festivities to know its anthropological, social and cultural significance. Professor A R Venkatachalapathy from the Madras Institute of Development Studies has researched subjects like social and cultural history of the State. He explains the Aadi festival is celebrated differently in the urban and rural areas.In the urban areas, it is closely related to Amman and Friday is an auspicious day. The festival is more women-centric and was inclined to give charity as people give away alms and feed the poor, he explained.But in villages, the festival is tied to agriculture. Aadi month is the season where the harvest is over and the next cycle begins. This is also the month where people can do financially planning for their families and businesses, he explained.Visit an Amman temple and you will find groups of people performing ritualsdo these festivals help in bonding the communities? Venkatachalapathy said, All festivals perform the role of bringing together communities. This is basically to strengthen the bond among people through religious events in temples.On the other hand, Professor S Sumathi, HoD, anthropology, University of Madras, said, The word community was started by mankind. Right from the beginning of the evolution, people wanted to live in groups. And rituals are an expression of a society. People form communities to share their happiness in the name of religion.There are many aspects that need to be looked into during this month. One main feature is the climate. The newly-wed couples are restricted from having sex during this month. So that they can avoid having a newborn during the peak of summer (Chithirai month) the following year, which would be uncomfortable for both mother and child, explained Prof Sumathi.From where did the Amman concept arise? The entire world started off with matriarchal domination unlike today, which is more patriarchal. Communities attributed certain features to womanhood and projected it as personification of goddess. It was a concept of gender identity. This is how the Amman concept emerged.

Bacharaniyana Appanna (82), retired professor of History, and his wife, Ranu Appanna, also a retired lecturer, collect antiques and memories. A custodian of some unique cultural treasures of Kodagu, Appanna has 400-year-old foodgrains among his precious collection. Legend has it that during the regime of kings in Kodagu about 400 years ago, eight Nayaks who ruled fought with each other. Once Machangada Nayak invaded Achchu Nayaks house in Hudikeri and burnt it down. During those times, people used to store foodgrains underground and all the grains were burnt during the invasion. But the Machangada family kept some foodgrains, which even now can be seen in Appannas house.What drew him to this passionate hobby? Appanna was curious about ancient history, culture and tradition of the district since a very young age. Whenever he visited a relatives house, he used to chance upon old tools and equipment thrown in a corner and enveloped in dust. This negligence pained him and he decided to collect antiques to showcase them for the future generations. He kept an eye for whatever he could salvage from the houses of relatives and friends. He has collected more than 200 delightful pieces of objects in the last three decades.Despite many people laughing at him for collecting junk, he proudly displays his collection at his house. What is remarkable is his passion for explaining the history of each object. His favourite piece is a fragile clay pot which was used to store meat. He said during olden days, people used to thus keep meat fresh for more than a week.Among his collections are mud cans to drink water from while going for hunting, a wooden oil lamp, cane boxes used for coins and trinkets, an eating bowl, wooden footwear, plough, cattle bells and a bamboo net for catching fish. He also has a clay pot specially designed to cook rice and strain gruel. Pointing to a knife, he says it was given to women for self-defence. He has a wooden drum which gives wonderful sound.Appanna doesnt want to sell his antiques. He exhibits them at his house during festivals. He also loans pieces from his collection to various cultural events. He has no plans to start a museum but will hand over the antiques to government if it starts one.Appanna says that the joy of owning a piece of history is indescribable. He rues that antiques have no appeal for the younger generation. He wants people to find their way back to the past and appreciate it."

Retaining the trained workers is also a problem as they tend to move out, said Rice Millers Association president P Veeraiah Chowdary. Echoing the same opinion, AP Small Scale Industries Association president T Pardha Saradhi said local workers are reluctant to work for long hours. They are not interested in upgrading their skills.We need to inculcate workmanship and effect an attitudinal change from the school level itself, he said. He said apprenticeship must be made mandatory and the Government should involve industries in training the young workers.Jhansi of COWEF said the hosiery unit that she runs needs specially skilled technicians and getting such persons within the state is proving to be difficult.Most speakers blamed it on the freebees being given by the Government and the populist measures of the parties.Those sitting idle are enjoying more benefits than those working hard, pointed out young entrepreneur S Sreenadh.Government sops should be incentive oriented and encourage the people to work. This in turn would make them learn new skills and upgrade their existing skills.Ghanta Subba Rao explained various skill development initiatives put in place by the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation and said the corporation would design courses based on the feedback from the industrialists.Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation principal consultant N Sailaja said through such interactive sessions with industry, they are trying to identify the required skill-sets for the various vocations and come out with customized training programmes."

As many as 40 students of Arteswar Upper Primary school in Jagannathpur village under Derabishi block were hospitalised on November 16 after consuming curry containing dead caterpillars during their midday meal. The food was thrown away after one of the students found the dead insects in the curry.Jayanti Panda, a teacher of the school and two mid-day meal cooks Basanti Panda and Sanjukta Das were suspended following an inquiry into the incident. Inquiry revealed that caterpillars had fallen into the egg curry while it was being cooked by Basanti and Sanjukta.Although Jayanti, who was in charge of mid-day meals that day, was supposed to check the quality of food before it was served to children, she did not do so. Soon after the meal the students began vomiting and complained of loose motion. They were admitted to Derabish community health centre and later shifted to Kendrapara district headquarters hospital, said Sangram Keshari Sahoo the district education officer. After the incident, locals locked the school for five days and demanded stern action against the teacher and cooks.Implementation of the mid-day meal scheme in schools in Kendrapara in the absence of requisite staff has thrown up challenges for the teachers. The teachers either remain busy in preparing the meal or managing the children waiting anxiously for the food. Some schools spend more money on transportation and fail to provide vegetables to the students.In many areas local people accuse teachers of pilfering rice and money meant for the scheme. Since a meagre amount is being paid to the cooks, teachers in many schools often have to try their hand at culinary skills. One can imagine the scenario in single teacher schools. There are nearly 75 such schools in the district, said a teacher."

Apart from the regular plain dosa and masala dosa, theres Avalakki Dosa, Pickle Dosa and Vegetable Dosa. The Avalakki Dosa, made with rice and gram, looks appealing and like the appams.

The onion chutney has a mild sweetness and the coconut chutney is spicy.The Pickle Dosa is another specialty with a tangy twist. The dosa has a chilli-pickle spread, which gives it a yellow tinge. Though these are made from chillies, it is not hot and tasted the best of all. It surprises you with its light tantalising flavour.The beetroot in the vegetable dosa lends it a pink colour and an overarching earthy flavour. The dosa also has other veggies like carrot and beans. Unlike the usual vegetable dosas at other food joints, with chopped and spiced vegetables as a filling, in this dosa the vegetables are ground well along with the batter.

Xalxo has set an example for other traditional farmers with his gradual shifting to mechanised farming.Assured water availability helped him cultivate ICAR 1509 variety of scented Basmati paddy during third week of June. Crop cutting was completed in four days by October 10 and he got an yield of about 25 tonnes.Xalxo said he has also cultivated Swarna variety of paddy for personal consumption on another six acres and crop cutting would be completed in a month.Unlike other traditional farmers, who usually get one crop in a year,Xalxo gets three crops. A former army man and sitting Lathikata Sarparch, Xalxo has bought a Rubberised Sheller machine at `2.4 lakh at 75 per cent government subsidy. It would ensure minimum damage during removal of husks and produce fine quality of long and slender Basmati rice which would fetch him at least `40 per kg.District Agriculture Officer (DAO) RK Mangal said, Xalxo is a role model for others and without entirely depending on Government he is making a difference. Agriculture Department is encouraging him with all possible support, Mangal added."

An auction takes place there. Traders from a wide area come to pick up huge volumes of vegetables. Its a unique market. The bids begin past midnight and the deals last through the wee hours. Prahallad Sahu hasnt been there in more than a week. Its 10 km from his village of Kalangapali but whats the point?There have been good years for Prahallad there but 2016 has been different. Tomato was going for a measly Rs 2 a kg, so he decided not to hire labour and made his family harvest the crop. Some of this seasons produce was picked up for that paltry price but the traders came to the village to pick it up. The rest is rotting in field.Vegetables had been a fetching crop for farmers in Bargarh block in previous years. This year too the yields had been bumper but then demonetisation drove the traders away. The only traders turning up in the market are those who had buy-back deals with farmers and had paid in advance. They got by the challenge of procuring fertilizers and seedlings by arranging credit, but paying for labour has no such solution. Many of the farmers have money in the bank but there are limits on how much you can withdraw.Winter is when vegetable prices soar. So theres hope when this demonetisation thing ends on Dec 30. When this crisis is over and we can sell vegetables for some profit again, said Uddhaba Deep, a farmer in Jamurda village. No one in Bargarh has read Shaktikanta Dass latest time horizon for that.Farmers who had already sold their produce before Narendra Modis bombshell on Nov. 8 ought to be happier, but they arent. Bipin Biswal is a cabbage farmer who sold his harvest before Nov. 8 and put his money in the bank. Now its locked and he cant pay his labourers. Really, the only lucky ones have been those who engaged local labourers. Villagers here have revived an age-old to cope with demonetization: they pay them in rice and vegetables. Farmers who employed migrant workers dont the luxury or barter.Bidyadhar Pradhan owes his labour contractor Rs 43,000. He can withdraw a maximum of Rs 24,000 per week from the bank. If he chooses to pay off the labourers as they are breathing down his neck, he has to forego preparing his field for the rabi rice. Hes got some tight management to do: he feeds his labourers twice a day and plies them with tea so they will a bit longer. Or, if the stars will it, his kharif crop will be sold and there will be money to pay them off.Some farmers said the heck with it and sold to any trader who will pay them in cash at whatever price, profit or loss, throwaway or handsome. Vegetable grower Shatrughan Mallick got rid of his entire lot of ladies fingers at one go. At least I got some money, he said.Take away the gnawing demonetization worries, villages in Bargarh have been sent back in time to days when apparently -- like in the Desh ki Dharti movies of the 1950s and 1960s -- kind neighbours helped out in each others fields and sang songs when the rain came. Since everybody is in the same boat, the merchants and traders of Bargarh are being sympathetic to the farmers, offering fertilizer and pesticides on credit.The villagers are ignorant but they never cheat and are very conscious of their prestige in the village. So they repay immediately after receiving the proceeds of their harvest, said a local merchant.Funny how the cashless economy has put rural India in the warm embrace of feudal practices."

But when he speaks, everyone takes note. At the valedictory function of the Odisha Literary Festival 2016, the Odisha Chief Minister opened up in a freewheeling interaction with Editorial Director of The New Indian Express Prabhu Chawla. From alliance politics to choice of his official car, Naveen spoke on an array of topics. Here is the full interview.Prabhu Chawla: A very important member of your party has hinted at possible alliance with Congress. Is it because BJP is emerging stronger and you want to have an anti-BJP alliance ?Naveen Patnaik: The gentleman you have referred to has said he was misquoted. I have also clarified that there is no question of an alliance with Congress. In fact, our (BJDs) policy is to remain equi-distant from the BJP and Congress. Just a little more than two years ago in elections, out of 147 seats in Assembly, the BJD got 116, Congress 16 and BJP 10. Odisha has 21 Lok Sabha seats out of which BJD won in 20 and BJP in one. There is no sign of those parties gaining in strength in the State.PC: When we say equi-distant which party is more distant, BJP or Congress ?NP: As I have said earlier, we are equi-distant from both BJP and Congress.PC: Why Odisha is still not in national mainstream. When somebody talks about Odisha, it is always about its poverty and such things. Why is nobody talking about the good things ?NP: Odisha has become a rice surplus State which is a major achievement. Odisha was buying rice before 2000. We came to power in 2000 and in 2006, Odisha became a rice exporting State. We are among the first three States in the country for doing very well in agriculture.PC: But look at the national newspapers and television channels. There is more about Dana Majhi and other such incidents. Why has the image of Odisha not changed ?NP: It has changed. For some years now, we have the scheme of 25 kg rice at `1 per kg for which starvation has become a story of the past. The Government has also built one million pucca houses during the last two years. We will certainly see that there will be no kutcha houses left in the State during next two years. In many development fields and welfare schemes, Odisha is doing extremely well.PC: You had two meets on investment in Mumbai and Bangalore and will be having another one in Bhubaneswar soon. But flow of investment to the State has not been as expected. Why?NP: Till two years back, we were among the top two States in the country in drawing investment. There has been certain failures like Posco, the biggest FDI in the country, because the Centre has changed policy and cannot give mines to them. Otherwise, a number of other projects have come up and are doing extremely well.PC: Most of the international projects which had shown interest in Odisha including Posco are no longer showing interest. Is it because of the negative publicity, the bureaucracy or something else?NP: That is because of the global problem. Global aspect has to be kept in mind.PC: Suddenly you have raised the Mahanadi river water dispute with Chhattisgarh. Is it because of the panchayat election in 2017 ?NP: If the Chhattisgarh Government builds small barrages, there will be no problem. But Chhattisgarh has plans to construct big barrages and has a masterplan because of which flow of water to Mahanadi will stop. Naturally, it is a matter of concern and the Government is exploring all options including legal ones. We may go to court to tackle the problem.PC: You say, Mahanadi river water dispute has nothing to do with panchayat polls ?NP: It has nothing to do with panchayat polls. We have raised the issue for water for irrigation, drinking water and power.PC: Prime Minister Narendra Modi talks about cooperative federalism. Do you have a feeling that it is working ?NP: I dont think there is much of cooperative federalism because the Centre has cut off large amount of funds to the State. That is a very big problem for us.PC: You want to say cooperative federalism is just a slogan for Modi?NP: I do not see this (cooperative federalism) is in operation.PC: But still you support GSTNP: Yes. GST is good thing.PC: You think you will get more money ?NP: Let us see.PC: Now it has been 17 years for you in Odisha. Dont you think you should play a role in national politics ? How can Biju Patnaiks son not be a national leader ?NP: My foremost concern is for the State. That is what I am concentrating on. I dont want to move to Delhi. I have been a Central minister. I am very content to be here and work for people. There is a great deal of unfinished work here.PC: Are you grooming any leader in Odisha ?NP: I think the people in their judgment will choose their own leader at an appropriate time. There is no need to groom any leader.PC: One of your political opponents admired your lifestyle. You are the only Chief Minister to be using a modest car where as other CMs prefer SUVs. Is it your simplicity or are you making a statement ? How is a tall leader like you comfortable in a small car like SX4 ?NP: (Smiles) I am happy and comfortable with the car the Government has provided for me.PC: What are the three achievements of your Government and two failures?NP: Odisha has become a food surplus State. Women SHGs have become hugely successful providing livelihood for five million and production of steel has increased by five times.I think Odisha still has a problem of poverty which we are trying to tackle.PC: Good and bad things about Modi Government.NP: I cannot think of them rightaway. But I think he ought to be given more time as India is a huge country.PC: Are you happy with what he has done ?NP: I think a lot has to be done."

They said Ali used to supply stationery items to various government offices and post offices.A police source said, We suspect that Ali had taken the new notes from rice mill owners in Mandya and he may have assured to give them some per cent of the commission he received while exchanging old notes for new ones.The source said, The accused told us that they were acting as middlemen and were expecting to get old denomination notes from a few bureaucrats from Bengaluru.The source added that according to the deal, Ali was to arrange new currency notes and exchange them for old notes for a 30 per cent commission. Ali had arranged Rs 10.5 lakh cash and was to meet the four accused and exchange the amount for old notes. This is when the four accused killed Ali and made away with the Rs 10 lakh.Fayaz, a family friend of Ali, said, He had been married for five years and the couple had adopted his younger brothers girl child. We staged a protest today, demanding that the accused be killed. According to our religion, it is wrong to burn a body and the accused have done exactly that. We have requested the police not to grant them bail.He added, Ali left the house around 8.30pm and said that he was going for some business deal. But he never returned. In fact, Ali had helped Sayed (an accused) financially during his brothers marriage.Deputy Superintendent of Police Thammaiah said, Investigations revealed that the accused had shifted Alis body in an auto to a forest area and burnt it there. Of the Rs 10.5 lakh cash, we have recovered Rs 7 lakh cash, of which Rs 2 lakh was given to Manappuram Finance. The accused have spent Rs 1.5 lakh."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

Both as a signal to Pakistan and as reassurance for Indian domestic audiences. Modi could not let the outrage at Uri go unanswered,"" Ashley Tellis of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a top American think-tank said.""The Indian action was carefully measured: striking at terrorist launch pads was meant to signal that India has not lost its freedom to retaliate, but puts the onus of further escalation on Pakistan,"" Tellis told PTI. Responding to a question, Tellis said the US will, counsel restraint, but unless the administration is willing to turn the screws on Pakistan--which is unlikely--India will be guided by its own interests, not American pleas for forbearance.""I think Pakistan has its hands full right now, it is unlikely to respond to the Indian action militarily, but the larger sub-conventional war against India will continue,"" Tellis said. Rick Rossow from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) recalled that the hint of such strikes as a possible tool last year, when the Indian Army initiated an attack against militants in Myanmar.""India has also shown other new tools in its confrontation with Pakistan, such as withdrawing from the upcoming SAARC summit, building stronger ties with other South Asian nations, and using closer security ties with the US as a hook to press for reduced military cooperation with Pakistan,"" he said.""This will likely keep Islamabad on its toes, though when employing new tools in such a struggle, clear messaging is key so both sides know the others' intentions. This will guard against unanticipated escalation,"" Rossow said.According to him, following a number of recent provocations that India has linked to Pakistan-based militant groups, the government of prime minister Narendra Modi has employed a different set of tools to respond to these incitements.""These tools may not be altogether new, but the fact that they have been the focus of India's response to Pakistan's incitements marks a different approach,"" he said. Rossow said while the Indian Ministry of Defence has stated it does not plan additional strikes, it is not clear whether the current tensions between India and Pakistan will escalate further.""There is certainly little expectation that Pakistani militants, under varying degrees of control by Pakistan's military, will be deterred from initiating further attacks. But the costs to Islamabad of supporting terrorism are increasing, and taking different forms than before,"" Rossow said.Jonah Blank, from the RAND Corporation think tank said that after the Mumbai 2008 attacks, India's patience had reached its limit. ""Pathankot was the breaking point. It was probably unrealistic to expect that the Uri attack would fail to bring a military response,""he said.""The phone call between Ajit Doval and Susan Rice accomplished two important things: First, it enlisted the US to help prevent a Pakistani counter-strike. Second, it avoided jeopardizing the India-US relationship by having Washington find out about the attack from Islamabad or the media, he noted. ""There was never much likelihood that the US would condemn the attack.After an American surgical strike against Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad, any criticism of India for a cross-border action would have seemed hypocritical,"" Blank said. ""The outcome, limited Indian strike, limited Pakistani response, was probably as good as could have been desired. A stronger Indian strike, or a Pakistani escalation into full warfare, would not have served either nation's interest,"" he said."

Thanks to the demonetisation of higher denomination notes, a large number of people are now trying to pass off their unaccounted cash as agriculture income which is not taxable.Hours after the Centre announced the move, black money hoarders made a beeline for their auditors to manipulate their taxation records by increasing their agricultural income as against their non-agricultural income. For tax payers, the maximum non-taxable income is `2.5 lakh, but there is a relaxation for farmers under the Income Tax Act.In Krishna, Guntur and the twin Godavari districts, which together are known as the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh, a large number of rich people have farm lands but are diversified into other businesses. The exemption afforded to agricultural income has apparently become a blessing for politicians in Andhra Pradesh, a majority of whom hold agricultural lands.As per the IT Act, agricultural income, including the lease of lands, is exempted from tax net. However, we keep a cap on agricultural income and an exaggerated income is bound to cause suspicion among the IT authorities. Our clients are now asking us to find ways to increase the cap on agricultural income and amend the records accordingly, a chartered accountant based in Hyderabad with clients who have lands in Krishna and Guntur districts said.Interestingly, demonetisation has also become a boon for small and marginal farmers who have been facing severe losses due to either drought or heavy rains for the past few years. Anjaneya Reddy (name changed) who leased 3 acres in Nellore for cultivation, invested `3 lakh, but lost the entire crop to rains. To his surprise, his financier called him up and offered to waive the entire debt.Instead, he wanted me to deposit his 11.5 lakh in my bank account and show it as farm income. It was only yesterday that I learnt that farm income has some benefits, Anjaneya Reddy said wryly.Many farmers who are caught in debts are being offered such help by politicians, businessmen and financiers known to them, in return for favours.Black money holders are also approaching SHG women who are in need of money, with offers of interest-free loans to clear their debts. However, a few financiers are asking for the mortgage of property or guarantee from farmers or women where the fresh loan obtained from the black money holders will be returned within a year.This method is said to be popular in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Nellore, Anantapur, and Godavari districts."

So, what we did is we signed letters of intent outlining four MOUs which we would work towards, one - Cooperation in health sector, two - Transfer of sentenced prisoners, three - Renewable energies and four - Customs cooperation, he said.Sinha said the meeting between Indian Vice President Hamid Ansari and Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari held on Tuesday, was focused upon range of issue covering Information and technology, agriculture, defence cooperation and civil use of nuclear energy.He said that Nigeria has expressed its interest in collaborating with Indian rice producers in the area of rice processing technology and was willing to produce more pulses for Indian markets.Agriculture was a key focus for them, both in terms of supplier of pulses, they were encouraged by the fact that India has huge demand and they have land and they feel that they could produce pulses for Indian market. Besides, they would want to collaborate in rice production they now that they can grow rice but they need a rice processing technology and rice mills that was something they wanted to collaborate with Indian rice producers,"" Sinha said.Acknowledging Nigeria as the major power in Africa, the Economic Relations Secretary said that it has an important say in key areas like United Nations Security Council reforms.Sinha said that India, during the delegation-level talks, has offered assistance in the area of space technology and applications of remote sensing.

We have invited their delegation to see our capabilities and discover areas that they can collaborate with India. Similarly, on applications of nuclear energy, they could be sending a team to look at our various facilities and various applications that we have put in place, he said.He said that the talks were aimed at taking the strategic partnership established in 2007 forward and to the next level, and therefore, it was necessary to give more content and increase the area of cooperation between both countries.Vice President Ansari is on a five-day official visit to Nigeria and Mali as part of efforts to bolster New Delhi's ties with both West African nations.The historic State visit to Nigeria by then prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh in October 2007 after a gap of over forty five years elevated the strategic partnership.Nigeria is India's largest trading partner in Africa with the bilateral trade amounting to USD 12.6 billion in 2015-16.India is also the largest buyer of crude oil from Nigeria, and more than 100 Indian companies have a large presence there as well as both the countries have strong defence cooperation.On the second leg of his trip, the Vice President will reach Mali on September 29 for the first ever high-level visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Modibo Keita."

Bengaluru-based media professional Pratima says, My former colleague Manju Latha Kalanidhi came up with the idea of the rice bucket challenge.The challenge involved people donating a bucket of rice to a poor person or family. The challenge soon went online with several Bengalureans taking to the trend too.You couldnt have missed the videos. They were everywhere, says Sandeep. Pratima says, shefed a dog boiled rice, as part of the challenge.THE LAST MILEA still from the movie Downfall;A lot of these initiatives gained momentum following the buzz generated online through either a song, a video or a Facebook challenge. So, are these fun ideas initiated to target the Twitter generation? It is not just about gaining the attention of the millennials or the internet generation. We wanted everyone to see and understand the problem through a fun Hitler video. It is not just restricted to the young, says Rana. Srinivas Alavilli, who played a pivotal role in creating a mass movement using social media for the steel flyover issue says, It is about making everyone aware of where their tax money is going. Online helps get people on the streets. We need to convert this virtual momentum to a fight on the ground. We recently got together at Majestic and went around educating drivers and autowallahs, telling them the amount that is being spent on the flyover. The internet generation is still aware of the problems, we need to get together and educate those who dont."

R Anjibabu, another resident of Kondamodu village along with some others complained that the floods of Kondamodu Vaagu has ruined their house and no official has visited their place till now. He went and inspected the cotton and mirchi fields.Jagan proceeded to Anupalem in Rajupalem Mandal and interacted with ST community members. They complained of political interference in relief measures. He also visited paddy fields and assured the farmers that he would exert maximum pressure on the Governments and see that they also get proper compensation.Finally he went to Reddygudem where the railway track got washed away during the floods and local MPTC member Ghousebi Nagul Meera criticized the CM for not doing anything other than aerial surveys. Only Ambati Rambabu senior leader of YSRCP was there to their rescue.While addressing the public gathered around him, Jagan launched a scathing attack against the State government for its apathy and carelessness in helping the flood victims. He also demanded that the government should realise its mistake and come to the rescue of the farmers.Had he (Naidu) come on foot instead of merry-go-round by helicopters, he would have experienced the difficulties the people are facing, Jagan said. He wanted the government to release input subsidy of Rs 1,000 crore which includes Rs 463 crores released by the Central government.The Opposition leader also criticised that instead of waiving the agriculture loans as the chief minister had promised in his election manifesto, he was advising that banks not to sanction any gold loans. Now the farmers are facing great difficulties in the present crisis.He commended his followers who have distributed 6 tons of rice to the needy and also chided the TDP leaders for distributing illegally procured ration rice. He was accompanied by party leaders Ambati Rambabu, Marrri Rajasekhar, MLA, Dr G Srinivasa Reddy, and others."

Their Blue Yonder company has also several projects lined up to promote responsible tourism in Fort KochiKOCHI: Thirteen years ago, when Gopinath Parayil stood on the banks of the Bharathapuzha to immerse his fathers ashes into the river, he felt grieved.This was the last time he would be physically with his father, but worse still, the Bharathapuzha too was dying.The dirt and sewage pouring into the river, known also as the Nila, was polluting the water and affecting the life clinging to its fringes.Thus was born the Nila Foundation as part of his dreams to conserve the river and its tributaries in the state. In 2004, Blue Yonder, a socially-committed enterprise took shape to promote responsible tourism across the country.A journey should become a life-changing experience for both the tourist and the locals associated with the place, says the activist. Gopinath, a graduate from a college in Oxford University, was in Kochi recently as part of TiECon.Blue Yonder, that is based in Pondicherry, will open its branch in Kochi in December where they will continue activities largely to conserve the Nila.Activities in KeralaThough Blue Yonder has now expanded to promote responsible tourism across the country, we havent forgotten Nila. We have lined many projects to promote responsible tourism here. For example, Fort Kochi has been the hub of tourist activities for decades. However, if you look today, most of the shopkeepers doing business in the area are North Indians, especially Kashmiris. This is where we come in. As responsible tourism promoters, we focus on ensuring that the locals get better job opportunities while promoting tourism too, Gopinath says.He adds there was so much more to Fort Kochi then just Chinese nets and the Jewish synagogue.Did you know that we are home to the most salt water resilient rice in the world- Pokkali? How many tourists arriving in Kerala know that. It is time, we become more interactive, he adds.The tourism activist (he calls himself that) says he is closely working with the Kerala Government to promote the Pokkali as part of his food security initiative.YathrasGopinaths Blue Yonder is also reviving the tradition of the Malabar region by uplifting the local communitys culture.  There are so many artisans whose talent and trade are lost once they die. Through our initiatives, we have brought several tourists to this region to give them a first-hand experience about the rich culture surrounding Nila. Many of these artisans, in turn, are earning a wonderful livelihood. Similarly, artists who earlier worked for just three to four months a year now are in demand throughout the year, saysGopinath.Art and musical classes are being run with around 854 students in 21 schools across Nila alone. Most recently, Blue Yonder ran a campaign Its the way you see it and had roped in photographer Ajay Menon for the project.As part of the programme, tourists travelled with the photographer and viewed several places in Malabar through the photographers eyes.Gopinath, who is also closely associated with palliative care in Kerala has received several awards for his responsible tourism company."

Immediately after the announcement of the pre-emptory strikes across the Line of Control, the diplomatic army of India swung into action and briefed 25 envoys of top countries, including the P-5 countries  the US, China, Russia, the UK and France  on the context of the strike.The task at hand has been to succinctly put across Indias point of view to the countries, including those in the immediate neighborhood, to provide context to the strikes starting from the Uri attack and the continued violation of the ceasefire agreement. The envoys were informed that it was a classic counter-terrorism operation more than a military one.Sources say Foreign Secretary S Jaishankar briefed the ambassadors of the countries at South Block. In the briefing he told them that surgical strikes on seven terror launchpads were carried out on late on Wednesday night and significant casualties were inflicted on the terrorists who were planning to infiltrate through the LoC to carry out terror attacks in India.The ambassadors were also told that India had no intentions of launching further operations on these lines but made it clear that the armed forces wouldnt allow terrorists to carry out any more attacks.On Thursday morning the US National Security Advisor Susan E Rice telephoned his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval. In a statement the US National Security Council pokesperson Ned Price said, Highlighting the danger that cross-border terrorism poses to the region, ambassador Rice reiterated our expectation that Pakistan take effective action to combat and de-legitimise UN-designated terrorist individuals and entities, including Laskar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and their affiliates.The diplomatic-military synergy was at display on Thursday morning when Director General of Military Operation Lt Gen Ranbir Singh in an unprecedented joint media briefing with Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Vikas Swarup announced the surgical strikes. Joint briefings were previously conducted during the Kargil War, the first televised conflict between Indian armed forces and Pakistan-backed infiltrators, but this has been the first instance of joint briefing of ministries.The government also said the surgical strikes were a necessary step which had not been taken for many years. The surgical strikes on terrorists has been welcomed across the country because it was a necessary step, which had not been taken for many years, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said. Javadekar said the SAARC Summit wouldnt be held in Pakistan as several countries have supported India, while the issue of Indus waters was also being looked at. He also said that from the way Union minister Sushma Swaraj presented Indias viewpoint at the UN, Pakistan has been completely exposed."

However, the free food is being wasted by some pilgrims leaving others hungry.Owing to a heavy rush during Krishna Pushkaralu, around 55 voluntary organisations and philanthropists have set up stalls in the 20 Pushkar Nagars to feed the pilgrims. Vegetable biryani, lemon rice, curd rice, tomato rice and sambar rice are being offered to the pilgrims at many makeshift tents. In the wake of consecutive holidays during the weekend, voluntary organisations made elaborate arrangements to feed as many as pilgrims they can.But the situation was different at many Pushkar Nagars as many dumper bins were seen filled with the excess food thrown away by the pilgrims. Pilgrims who arrived late at the Pushkar Nagars, were forced to return with empty stomachs as the food packets were exhausted.Karanam Jogayya, pilgrim from Lakkavarapu Kota in Vizianagaram district, expressed his dissatisfaction over the officials for their failure in monitoring the food supply near the Pushkar Nagars. I cant afford the food at roadside eateries which were being sold out at an exorbitant prices. The voluntary organisations should not confine themselves to particular area, they should spread their activity to other places to feed the hungry, he said.Most of the pilgrims at Pushkar Nagar near Pandit Nehru Bus Station (PNBS) and city railway station had bitter experience and left the place with hunger. We have prepared estimations to supply lemon rice and sambar rice for 30,000 pilgrims per day, said D Chalapathi Rao, an NGO volunteer at PNBS.From Day One of Krishna Pushkarams, Chalapathi Rao said that they have noticed that most of the pilgrims were taking excess food as a precautionary measure but throwing it away after all of them ate. To reduce wastage, we deployed additional volunteers near the queue lines to control the food wastage. Every pilgrim should feel responsible and extend their support in controlling the food wastage, he maintained.Meanwhile, the roadside eateries and hotels dotting the main stretches increased the rates of eatables and were fleecing the pilgrims. Pilgrims complained that the roadside eateries and hotels were charging anywhere around `10-20 per dish in excess of the prices mentioned in the menu. If opposed, many hotel staff were asking the pilgrims to leave. Some hotels have adopted a clever tactic. Though prices were not changed, they have reduced the quantity per each dish, said Raghavendra, a kirana shop owner."

(Photo | AP)WASHINGTON: US President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped ExxonMobil chief Rex Tillerson as his nominee to be secretary of state, despite concerns on both sides of the political aisle about the oilman's deep ties to Russia.The nomination was the one most awaited by observers at home and abroad as the 70-year-old Republican billionaire builds his cabinet before taking office on January 20 -- and reveals how his administration might alter foreign policy.The president-elect has stoked alarm -- even among fellow Republicans -- by calling for closer ties with Moscow, in contrast to the belief in Washington that Russia remains a global security threat.The nomination comes just days after the CIA accused Russia of interfering to help Trump win the US election -- a development which could complicate Tillerson's confirmation hearings before the Senate.Trump promised that the executive, whose nomination was immediately welcomed by Vladimir Putin's Kremlin, has relationships with world leaders that are ""second to none.""Tillerson ""will be a forceful and clear-eyed advocate for America's vital national interests, and help reverse years of misguided foreign policies and actions that have weakened America's security and standing in the world,"" Trump said.As ExxonMobil CEO, Tillerson -- who has spent his entire professional life at the company, joining in 1975 -- was a vocal opponent of sanctions on Moscow that thwarted his attempt to strike huge oil deals in the Russian Arctic.In 2013, Tillerson was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship by President Vladimir Putin.A senior Kremlin aide said Putin and other Russians have ""good, business-like relations"" with Tillerson and praised him as a ""very solid figure.""As ExxonMobil's president and chief executive, the 64-year-old Texan oversees the company's business activities in more than 50 countries. Appointed CEO in 2006, he was due to retire in March.""Rex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none,"" Trump said.- Putin's friend? -Tillerson -- who has no formal foreign policy background -- is nevertheless sure to face sharp questions in the Senate confirmation hearings, including from within the Republican party.Senior Republican Senator John McCain has said Tillerson's ties to Putin are ""a matter of concern.""""Vladimir Putin is a thug, bully and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying,"" McCain said before the nomination was formalized.Senator Marco Rubio, who fought Trump for the Republican White House nomination, tweeted: ""Being a 'friend of Vladimir' is not an attribute I am hoping for from a #SecretaryofState.""Leading senators -- including McCain -- on Monday threw their backing behind a congressional probe into US intelligence assessments on Russia election interference, putting top Republicans on a collision course with Trump.The president-elect has dismissed the intelligence reports about Russian interference as ""ridiculous,"" defying an increasing number of senators from his own party, as well as top Democrats, the Central Intelligence Agency and the outgoing White House.Tillerson bested eight or nine contenders for the job of secretary of state, including former CIA director David Petraeus, former UN ambassador John Bolton, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and erstwhile Trump critic and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.Former US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and former defense secretary Bob Gates, who have done consultancy work for ExxonMobil, praised the choice.""He will bring to the post remarkable and broad international experience; a deep understanding of the global economy; and a belief in America's special role in the world,"" Rice said.Outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry congratulated Tillerson and said the State Department would provide ""full support for a smooth transition.""- Russia and China -Trump's secretary of state will be tasked with overseeing international relations for a president intent on trashing protocol and upending relationships built on decades of delicate diplomacy.Beyond thorny ties with Russia, Sino-US relations are strained after a series of moves by Trump that provoked China, the world's second-largest economy.Trump raised eyebrows by taking a congratulatory call from the president of Taiwan, a self-ruling island that Beijing considers to be part of its territory awaiting reunification.The president-elect is also courting controversy over the state of his real estate empire.Critics argue that it would be an unprecedented ethical conflict for Trump to maintain interest in properties spanning the globe -- investments that rely partly on goodwill from foreign governments and regulators.Trump postponed a press conference originally set for Thursday at which he was to unveil his plans for separating himself from his global business dealings, instead taking to Twitter.""No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office,"" he said late Monday, adding that he would leave his businesses before January 20 and that his two adult sons, Don and Eric, would manage his companies.With Tillerson's nomination, Trump is wrapping up the process of building a cabinet. Multiple reports say he has chosen former Texas governor Rick Perry to be energy secretary.He greeted the usual stream of officials at Trump Tower on Tuesday -- along with rapper Kanye West. The president-elect said the unusual pair discussed ""life."""

We want to make use of the remaining 20g rice, said the official.The Foundation plans to prepare nippattu and chakli with the remaining rice. We have a kitchen where we prepare mid-day meals.

The unit, located on the premises of Udyogiri at Gandamunda area, is equipped with eight motor-enabled oil extraction machines.Earlier, a Kachi ghani mustard oil unit existed at the same location which was destroyed in the super cyclone of 1999. With financial assistance from the State Government, the OKVIB took an initiative to revive the unit at a cost of `10 lakh. The cold pressed machines which can extract upto 60 litres of mustard oil per day, have been procured from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, OKVIB Chairman Tejeswar Parida said.Procurement of mustard seeds to run the plant will be done from remote districts of the State where farmers are victims of distress sale. Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune. Once the facility is fully operational, the Board expects to supply more processed honey inside and outside State.On the occasion, sanction letters of village industries were distributed to 26 entrepreneurs from six districts. Projects like rice mill, paper cup and plate production, beauty parlour, automobile servicing, ready-made garment manufacturing, cement products and carpentry were approved for assistance by the MSME Department."

I am accepting things which I can use. Rice and coconut can be resold. Bamboo will be used in fencing and wooden planks for furniture, Palai said.With rural Odisha facing currency crisis and most of the panchayats still remaining unbanked, people have adopted barter system to purchase essential commodities and manage their daily requirements.Barter is an old system of exchange of goods and services without involving money. Treated as cashless economy, it is usually a reciprocal medium of exchange, benefiting both the parties - giver and taker.While people in urban Odisha are using debit or credit cards to make payments, communities in rural areas have turned to the older form of cashless payment. Other things apart, rice, which is abundantly available after the autumn harvest, has become a common medium of exchange.Unlike coastal areas, people in hilly and forest regions have been availing goods, grocery items and vegetables in exchange of forest produces like honey and resin. Even as the Centre chalked out a series of measures for smooth flow of cash into rural areas, this barter system proved beneficial for people like daily wager Dibakar Soren (62) who is yet to have a bank account.I purchased one kg potato, 250 gms dal, 500 gms onion and some spices in exchange of one litre of honey. I have two old Rs 500 notes, but none is willing to accept it. The bank, where I can exchange the notes is seven km away, Soren, a resident of Jashipur in Mayurbhanj district, said.Adding to the woes of senior citizens, the officials have paid them old-age pension in old currency notes.In many parts of the State, two persons have been provided one Rs 500 note and one Rs 100 note asking them to exchange the old one and divide the amount. People above the age of 60 years are entitled to get Rs 300 each as old-age pension.While there are reports of dharna by pensioners in front of panchayat offices in protest against the payment through banned currency notes, people in several districts staged demonstrations before cooperative banks demanding exchange of demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes."

This was informed by District Tourist Officer Bijaya Mohanty on Monday.The 179-year-old lighthouse located in the seaside village of Batighar under Mahakalpada block was built by the British during the early 19th century. Sources said ships of the East India Company approaching Calcutta port used to mistake Mahanadi entrance for Hooghly. Therefore, the point near mouths of the river came to be known as False Point. Later, a lighthouse was constructed and it was renamed as False Point Lighthouse. Construction work on the 38-metre high lighthouse was completed on October 16, 1837.Similarly, the century old colonial building at Hukitola Island attracts visitors for its architecture. Hukitola is an hour boat ride from Ramanagar. Recently, the State Government granted `1.2 crore for renovation work of Hukitola building by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) under World Bank sponsored Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) project. Renovation work is going on.The size of Hukitola building, including a post office and refuse house, is 6,836 sq feet. While the length of the building is 125 feet, its breadth is 63 feet. Hukitola building has six large rooms and three small chambers.It was constructed in 1888 to store rice brought from Burma and other places following Naanka drought. It was named after Hokkey Walker who served as superintending engineer in irrigation division of Public Works Department (PWD) in Cuttack. Since then, it is being called as Hukitola and it was built with the laterite stones from the Barabati fort in Cuttack.The magnificent colonial building on the island in the Bay of Bengal is a major tourist attraction. The False Point Lighthouse is situated on the island created by the Mahanadi delta near Ramanagar, he said.The the nearby mangrove forest and water bodies have the potential of making the district a major tourist destination, Mohanty added.Both the places lack basic civic amenities and need more public conveniences, said Mohanty adding that the State Government is planning to build road to Jamboo and Kharinashi for the tourists to visit both the sites."

Thanks to the ongoing harvest season, paddy has become the new currency for Bibhishan and other villagers. A kilogram of paddy is valued at Rs 10, and villagers are bartering rice for their daily needs at the groceries of Meghpal Chowk, the main market of the gram panchayat.Bibhishan Marei collects paddy in his hay yard in MurtalGrocer Pradip Jal (26) understands the plight of villagers. Their small change has been spent, and their savings are locked up in the bank. And since most banks are located at far-off places, villagers cannot travel everyday to stand in the queue and withdraw cash, he says.Meghpal, considered the Naxalbari of Sambalpur, is a gram panchayat with no bank. It was in the headlines on January 23, 2003, when Maoists killed Kader Singh, the sarpanch of Tampargarh. Out of the 645 households in the panchayat, as many as 503 are tribal. Most of them depend on agriculture, either as farmers or as daily wagers.To access a bank, villagers have to go to Hatibari, Jujumura or Padiabahal. Hatibari is 20 km from Meghpal, Jujumura 25 km and Padiabahal 19 km. The village has no post office either, the nearest one being at Chhamunda, 10 km away. If that is not bad enough, buses run only up to Hatibari. People with invalid 500 or 1000 rupee notes have no other option but to go to those distant places to deposit and exchange the money, losing their daily earnings in the process. Many people return empty-handed as banks run out of cash, and the whole process has to be gone through again.With wholesalers asking for legal currency to replenish stocks, shop-owners are at out on a limb. What has added to the woes of small farmers is that the local rice millers are reluctant to purchase paddy from them due to demonetization."

He warned that if the State Government does not take steps to eradicate regional imbalance, it may lead towards the demand for a separate State by the people of the area.Alleging that corruption is widespread in WODC, Naba Kishore Das (Cong) said projects are being approved without tender. Stating that there has been large-scale corruption in WODC, he demanded a high-level probe into the matter. He alleged that though MLAs should be made members of the council on rotation basis as per rules, opposition MLAs are not nominated.Pradip Purohit, Radharani Panda (both BJP) and Subal Sahu (Cong) also alleged widespread corruption in WODC and demanded immediate shifting of the headquarters. However, several BJD members including Padmanabha Behera, Dibyashankar Mishra, Sanjib Kumar Sahu and Raseswari Panigrahi alleged that the attack on WODC is politically motivated.Making a statement in response, Minister for Planning and Coordination Usha Devi said the State Government has repeatedly sought the views of the council on shifting of headquarters. An appropriate decision will be taken only after the views of the council are received, she said.Stating that WODC was formed to accelerate development in Western Odisha, the Minister said so far 28,782 projects amounting to `1250.89 crore have been sanctioned since its inception.MLAs express concern over NFSA irregularitiesBhubaneswar: Members cutting across party lines on Saturday expressed their grave concern in the Assembly over the largescale irregularities in the distribution of ration cards under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The issue cropped up in question hour while Minister of State for Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Sanjay Dasburma was replying to question in this regard. Padmanabha Behera (BJD) wanted to know about the steps taken so far to distribute ration cards to the poor people who are the genuine beneficiaries under the NFSA.Alleging that persons not eligible have got ration cards, Behera said many genuine beneficiaries are yet to covered under the scheme. Opposition Chief Whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati said the Government should also provide wheat to the beneficiaries in urban areas and rice in rural areas, failing which there resentment will mount against the Government. The Minister, however, said as per the the provisions under NFSA, the Government has initiated several steps to identify genuine beneficiaries. ""I request the people to bring to the notice of my department about the genuine beneficiaries whose name has not been included in the list,"" he said."

It has a dark crown and long dropping dark scapulars while its grey sides are set off on the front and rear with white bars. They were found on Wednesday at the wetland in Satabhaya village within the park and this is the first record of the presence of Baikul Teal in the State, he added.Baikal Teal breeds in the forest zone of eastern Siberia while during winter, it migrates to India, Burma, China, Japan, Bahamas and other countries. Few years back, few Baikal Teal birds were sighted in the forest of Assam. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has categorised them as of Least Concern. Loss of habitat due to agriculture extension and human developments, hunting, collisions with any kind of wires and disturbances by fishermen and poachers are the reasons behind the decline of the species, Das said.Baikal Teal feeds on seeds, leaves, grass weeds, sedges, aquatic vegetation, seeds coming from crops such as rice and soya. It also consumes small aquatic invertebrates, snails and insects, he informed.Similarly, Common Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) is a waterfowl species. It is widespread and common in Eurasia, mainly breeding in temperate and wintering in subtropical regions. They resemble a small short-necked goose in size and shape, he added. Bhitarakanika is home to about 269 species of birds including 98 species of migratory birds."

Instead we got lower rains in the second half,"" the official said.Since the start of the monsoon season on June 1, rains have been 5 percent below average.""Our forecast of a surplus rainfall has gone wrong,"" D. S. Pai, IMD's head of the long range forecast, confirmed to Reuters. ""We will receive less than 100 percent rainfall this season.""India's weather office defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season. The IMD in August forecast monsoon rains at 106 percent or above normal.Last week, a U.S. government weather forecaster said La Nina conditions were no longer likely to develop during the Northern Hemisphere fall and winter 2016/17. In June, the agency said there was a 75 percent chance La Nina would develop."

Apparently, farmers are left with the surplus stock of 2.88 lakh tonnes, which they would be forced to sell below the MSP of over Rs 1400 per quintal.With the district administration helpless in either enhancing the procurement target or stopping distress sale, farmers have started selling the surplus paddy at Rs 900 to Rs 1000 per quintal. Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO), Abhiram Pradhan informed that paddy procurement in the district would start from Thursday through 112 paddy procurement centres (PPCs) with initial target to procure 67,00 tonnes rice or 89,000 tonnes paddy.He said PPAS (Paddy-Procurement Automated System) mode would be applicable in all 17 blocks of the district and sale proceeds would directly reach bank accounts of farmers. He added that so far 25,600 farmers have registered online for selling their paddy. The MSP for common or fair average quality paddy is Rs 1,470 per quintal, while it is Rs 1,510 per quintal for Grade A quality paddy. Last year about 1.32 lakh tonnes paddy were procured and this year it is unlikely to go beyond that.Sources said with paddy crop cutting nearing completion, it is expected that the district may get a total of six lakh tonnes of paddy from 2.13 lakh hectares (ha). Usually, farmers keep 30 per cent of their paddy yield for own consumption and sell the surplus stocks. This year, the surplus has been estimated at about 2.88 lakh tonnes. Sources said the administration has no mechanism to guard surplus stock from distress sale and even if the administration prevents distress sale, then the surplus stocks would rot in possession of the cash-starved farmers.Bonai Krushak Sangh leader Dambrudhar Kishan said marginal farmers and share croppers, who require immediate cash, can be seen selling their surplus paddy stocks Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal at Khuntgaon, Gamlei and Lahunipara weekly markets. Barring a small chunk of large and influential farmers, rest take agriculture loans and hand loans from money lenders for cultivation.

And the military is at the heart of the graft, according to documents and interviews with more than 60 officials, company owners and workers, including five former generals.As a result, food is not reaching those who most need it.The U.S. government has taken notice. Prosecutors have opened investigations against senior Venezuelan officials for laundering riches from food contracts through the U.S. financial system, according to several people with direct knowledge of the probes. No charges have been brought.""Lately, food is a better business than drugs,"" said retired Gen. Cliver Alcala, who helped oversee border security.The late President Hugo Chavez created a Food Ministry in 2004. His socialist government nationalized and then neglected farms and factories, and domestic production dried up. When the price of oil collapsed in 2014, the government no longer could afford to import all the country needed.Hungry Venezuelans began rioting, and so Maduro handed the generals complete power over food. The government now imports nearly all the country's food, and corruption drives prices sky-high, said Werner Gutierrez, agronomy professor at the University of Zulia.""If Venezuela paid market prices, we'd be able to double our imports,"" Gutierrez said. ""Instead, people are starving.""In large part due to concerns of graft, the three largest global food traders, all based in the U.S., have stopped selling directly to the Venezuelan government.One South American businessman says he paid millions in kickbacks to Venezuelan officials as the hunger crisis worsened, including $8 million to people who work for the food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres. The businessman insisted on speaking anonymously because he did not want to acknowledge participating in corruption.He explained that vendors like him can afford to pay off officials because they build large profit margins into what they bill the state. A single $52 million contract of his to import yellow corn last year, seen by AP, included a potential overpayment of more than $20 million, compared with market prices at the time.Marco Torres did not respond to requests for comment by phone, email and hand-delivered letter. In the past, he has said he will not be lured into fights with an unpatriotic opposition.Some contracts go to companies that have no experience dealing in food or seem to exist only on paper. Financial documents obtained by AP show that Marco Torres did business with Panama-registered Atlas Systems International, which has all the hallmarks of a shell company. Another government food supplier, J.A. Comercio de Generos Alimenticios, lists on its website a nonexistent address in an industrial city near Sao Paulo, Brazil.The two companies transferred more than $5.5 million in 2012 and 2013 to a Geneva account controlled by the brothers-in-law of the then-food minister, Gen. Carlos Osorio, according to bank and internal company documents seen by AP.Osorio, recently appointed to oversee transparency in the military, did not respond to requests for comment, but in the past dismissed charges of corruption as personal attacks from the opposition.The socialist administration says it takes graft seriously.""The state has an obligation to root out corruption in all levels of public administration,"" the defense minister, Gen. Vladimir Padrino Lopez, said this fall.And yet dirty dealing persists from the port to the markets, according to dozens of people working in Puerto Cabello, which handles the majority of imported food. Officials sometimes keep ships waiting at sea until they are paid off, according to a stevedore who spoke anonymously because he feared losing his job.After the cargo is unloaded, customs officials take their cut, refusing to even start the process of nationalizing goods without a payment, four customs workers said, .""It's an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks,"" said Luis Pena, a director at the Caracas-based importer Premier Foods.If importers try to get through the process without greasing the wheels, food sits and spoils, Pena said. Rotting food is a problem even as 90 percent of Venezuelans say they can't afford enough to eat. The demands for bribes delay shipments, and state officials sometimes neglect to distribute what they import.Puerto Cabello crane operator Daniel Arteaga watched last winter as state workers buried hundreds of containers of spoiled chicken, meat and beans.""All these refrigerated containers, and meanwhile people are waiting in food lines each week just to buy a single chicken,"" Arteaga said.The corruption doesn't stop once cargo leaves the port, according to truck drivers. The military has set up checkpoints along highways to catch food traffickers, and truck drivers say they have to pay bribes at about half of them.At the end of the food chain, some soldiers partake in selling food directly to citizens, according to business owners. Bakery owner Jose Ferreira cuts two checks for each purchase of sugar: one for the official price of 2 cents a pound and one for the kickback of 60 cents a pound. He keeps copies of both checks in his books, seen by the AP, in case he is ever audited.""We have no other option,"" he said."

The teachers either remain busyin preparing the meal or managing the children waiting anxiously for the food. Some schools spend more money on transportation and fail to provide vegetables to the students.In many areas local people accuse teachers of pilfering rice and money meant for the scheme.""Since a meagre amount is being paid to the cooks, teachers in many schools often have to try their hand at culinary skills. One can imagine the scenario in single teacher schools. There are nearly 75 such schools in the district,"" said a teacher."

Colourful pathways with flowers plants on both sides lead to these toilet blocks. Locals consider them as pride of their village, literally.At Similihata under Lulang gram panchayat of Reamal block, villagers were on a mission to end open defecation through their initiative 'My Toilet My Pride' under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Home to 266 people of 46 households, primarily Scheduled Tribe, the village witnessed the initiative a year back.Today, the villagers take pride in the fact that Similihata is the first village in the district to have become open defecation free and has emerged as the model village to have adopted 'My Toilet My Pride', which is being emulated by 60 more villages under Reamal, Barkote and Tileibani blocks.Helping them in the initiative were the District Water & Sanitation Mission (DWSM) and the UNICEF. The village also has dustbins installed everywhere so that no solid waste is thrown outside the houses.It was in 2008-09 when villagers first started building toilets following an outbreak of diarrhoea that affected 30 families. Then, eight families built toilets in their houses but they were not used by all members of the families.In November last year, village head Fakir Pradhan took up the responsibility and with the help of DWSM trained masons, got Individual Household Latrines (IHHLs) constructed in each of the households.Every household was sanctioned `12,000 under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan for the purpose.""Due to lack of awareness, people did not take interest in using these toilets and continued open defecation. Then we decided to form a Swachhata Committee with 11 members of the village,"" said Pradhan, who is also the president of the committee. The committee decided to impose a fine of `50 on every person who resorted to open defecation.The fine, though, was never collected as villagers who are mostly into agriculture and forest product collection, could not afford to pay the amount and hence, started using toilets.To increase people's participation in the Abhiyan, DWSM officials suggested committee members to involve villagers in painting the theme of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan on the toilet walls and named the initiative 'My Toilet My Pride'.""It actually started as a competition among households to prepare the most colourful toilet block. Since synthetic paints are not affordable, villagers, mostly women, prepared colours made of ash, turmeric, dried flowers, rice powder and liquid blue dye,"" Pardhan said.""The expenditure ranged from `150 to `250 per IHHL and the artworks created on toilet walls included 'rangolis', Soura paintings, Sanskrit slokas and messages on ills of open defecation. Toilets are a matter of pride for villagers today as people come to their houses not to visit them but see how colourful their toilets are"", said secretary of the Swachhata Committee, Bijay Kumar Pradhan with a smile."

Stating thatirrigation is one of the primary concerns of the government, the chief minister said the annual target for creating irrigation potential will be 2.5 lakh hectares.""Emphasis should be on utilising ground water resources through bore wells, shallow tube wells and dug wells,"" he said.The chief minister expressed satisfaction over the NSSO report which said Odisha is the only state in the country to have doubled the income for farmers. Stating that increased contribution from animalfarming has played a significant role in doubling of income, he said Odisha has also become rice surplus.""In fact, we are now the third largest contributor of rice to the Public Distribution System in India,"" Naveen said, adding, efforts are on to augment the irrigation potential and use of technology.Chief secretary AP Padhi told mediapersons that out of the target to set up 12,000 deep wells during 2016-17, the government has dug 6500 so far. Remaining 5500 deep wells will be dug by March,2017, he said.Padhi said the agriculture cabinet decided to set up a drought management cell under the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority (OSDMA) as the state was regularly hit by dry spells affectingthe livelihood of farmers. The cell will keep track on the monsoon and make weather forecast.The meeting also resolved to undertake improvement of existing canal system so that more agricultural fields get irrigated, he said and added the state government is working with an objective tofurther double the income of farmers in the next five years. ""The average income of farmers in Odisha in the next five years will be `4,000 per month,"" he said.The chief secretary said the farmers of Odisha will soon get the 2015 Kharif crop insurance benefits as the Centre has sanctioned its share of ` 800 crore. ""The state government is ready with itsshare of Rs 800 crore,"" he said, adding, the farmers sustained crop damage due to the drought in 2015 Kharif season.Similarly, a new plant of OMFED to be set up on the outskirts of the capital city near Barang was also approved.

I got two Rs 2,000 notes. As I did not get change from any of the shops, I again went to the Reserve Bank of India, Kaloor, to get the lower denomination notes, said P N Renjith.Most of the shop owners said that they were unable to accept the Rs 2,000 notes because they did not have enough number of Rs 100 and other notes and coins with lower denomination. For instance, if a customer purchases goods worth Rs 300 and gives us a Rs 2,000 note, we cannot give them Rs 1,000 or Rs 500 notes as balance. They will demand the balance in Rs 100 notes or other lower value notes, which we do not have. Hence, the business has slumped. At least, they could have rolled out the new Rs 500 notes when the banks reopened on Thursday, according to Shanavas, who runs a shop at Kaloor.Majority of the large-scale vendors too faced difficulties in tendering change for cash purchases made with the new Rs 2,000 note. The owner of K R Mohanan Company Rice Merchant at Kaloor market said he did not accept Rs 2,000 notes. It was the medium and small scale shops which did not have card swipe machines that suffered the brunt. Ours is a meat shop and most of the people, who came to purchase meat items gave Rs 2,000 notes. As we do not have lower denomination notes, we sent them back. But for regular customers, we offered the items on credit. At least the government could have made necessary preparations before announcing the decision to pull out the Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, said Shiras, a meat vendor."

While evasion of commercial taxes including VAT and Entry Tax has been going on since long, the CT Department in the district has failed to check the practice.Rourkela Police with a series of seizures of illegal consignments has brought massive tax evasions to the fore. While police suspect that multiple well-knit rackets are involved in tax evasions, they managed to get vital clues against a particular city-based trader.Zone - II DSP RK Panigrahi informed that on September 29, they intercepted a truck near the godown of trader Naresh Agarwal with edible oil worth above Rs 18 lakh without e-way bills or Central Sales Tax document. The truck driver also confessed that he was taking the consignment to Agarwal. Yet, proprietor of Supreme Trader Sheikh Saukat Ali, who runs his office on the premises of Agarwal, claimed ownership of the oil consignment. But he had not paid Income Tax since 2010 and his firm was registered with CT Department in 2015.The DSP said the oil consignment was brought to Rourkela using forged documents of electrical goods to show that it was sent from Kolkata to Puja Electricals, Jharsuguda. The vehicle also had fake registration number. The truck driver told police that the oil consignment was loaded at Murena in Madhya Pradesh and call records revealed that he was in constant touch with Agarwal and never talked to Ali.On November 4, police again seized a truck-load of wheat flour and fine wheat flour near the godown of Agarwal. This time, his brother Rajesh claimed ownership and paid tax and fine of Rs 95,000 to CT Department and Rs 23,000 to Transport Department for overloading. On the same day, Brahmani Tarang police also seized about 12 tonnes of rice in Saw Mill area from a trader who claimed involvement of Agarwal. Later, the CT Department fined him Rs 2.77 lakh.Rourkela SP Anirudh Singh said Agarwal is not alone in the illegal business and all police stations have been directed to take actions against tax evaders.Sources said revenue target of Commercial Taxes in the district is about Rs 1,040 crore, but actual collection could go beyond Rs 1,200 crore with strict enforcement.National vice-president of Confederation of All India Traders BM Agarwal said strict action is needed to stop tax evasion and hoped introduction of GST would be of great help."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.

November is when they harvest the kharif crop and sow for rabi. Even as they were coming to terms with the carryover effects of drought and low prices, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pulled a fast one on them.Lepakshi Naidu, a farmer of Hosapete taluk, says demonetization left him with no cash to buy pesticide for the chilli crop he had sown. He got by by borrowing from someone he knew. His own money is in the bank but it allows him to withdraw only Rs 2,000 per day, He cant pay his workers and for the other inputs.Its a familiar story in Ballari, the granary of Karnataka, irrigated by the Tungabhadra.So what about rabi then? Naidu said water has not been released from the Tungabhadra dam anyway, so he had not bothered to sow a postrainy season crop. My worry is now the chilli crop. I sowed 30 acres, and I hope it survives. I need pesticides urgently but I have no cash, Naidu said.Years of drought have rendered the farmers of Ballari a stoic lot. So the anger does not burst forth from the likes of Lepakshi Naidu but it takes a lot of smothering of temper to accept the possible loss of 30 acres of chilli for the lack of a few thousand rupees.The pesticide shops in Ballari is a good place to sense the the distress of farmers. The owner of one, Chandrashekhar, told New Indian Express that rabi sowing had indeed dwindled due to the water shortage but the cash crunch made it worse. But what has kept farm operations going despite these twin blights has been the age-old informal coping systems policymakers make light of. Chandrasekhar sells his pesticide bottles on credit. But for how many farmers will I be able to do so? he asked.The pesticide bottle evokes a particularly morbid image in southern Indias farmscape, drinking monocrotophos mixed with Coca Cola being a preferred method of committing suicide by farmers.At Kolagallu village, about 8 km from Ballari, the demonetization debate among farmers has moved onto its effects on market prices for produce. Will the price crash below last years? Will it soar miraculously? Will produce be sold at all? Yerriswamy, a farmer, cited paddy as an instance. It fell. He grew sona masoori rice on his five acre patch and the harvest is in progress. But news from the market is not good, as it rarely is even in a normal year. But then this is the new normal, a memorable post-demonetisation coinage by the eloquent Arun Jaitley. The mills are not buying paddy owing to shortage of cash.Sowing target 2,04,000 hectares Actually Sown 33,421 hectares Unsown 80%Last year, Yerriswamy sold his paddy for Rs 2,100 a quintal. This year, ahead of harvest, he is ready to sell for Rs 1,800 per quintal  if they would only buy.Right now, his priority is his harvest. He has no money for the harvester, which costs Rs 2000 a day to hire. The rich farmers may manage but what about farmers like me? he asked.He revealed that he has a loan of Rs 3 lakh to clear. And before long, the dreaded quote drops from his lips: We are left with no choice but to consume poison.In the same village of Kollagallu we move on to cotton, a notorious source suicide stories in the past. Honnur Swamy has apportioned all his three acres to cotton this year and is now caught without an exit option. He has no money to pay to labourers. The banks dont understand the plight of farmers. They dont allow us to withdraw more than Rs 2,000. And we have to pay commission to some people to get Rs 100 notes.CROP TARGET ACTUAL Cereals 37,245 7,427 Pulses 1,04,630 22,230 Oilseeds 54,340 3,434 Commercial 7,785 330Farming isnt only about inputs and labour. There are incidental costs too. For instance, drinking water has to be bought for the farm workers. We met Kumar, a young small farmer, as he was serving food to workers on his farm under the shade of a tree. He has an arrangement with the shopkeeper. He makes the payment in one go at the end of the month.

Later, the civic body identified additional 18 acre land adjacent to it after a team of Central Zoo Authority of India on August 17 asked CMC authorities to construct the new park on 20 acre of land and prepare a master plan for the same.Accordingly, CMC initiated steps for acquisition of land. However, it landed in a spot of bother after it was found that the additional 18 acre was part of Kuakhai river.With the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ban on construction work on riverbeds, CMC had no option but to cancel the site at Uttamapur. The civic body is now on lookout of a new site for the deer park.We had already selected the land at Uttamapur for the new deer park. As the additional 18 acre is part of Kuakhai river, we have again started searching for suitable land in Baranga and Cuttack Sadar tehsil area, said CMC Deputy Commissioner Radha Krishna Rout.Land at Sartol and Nuapada under Cuttack Sadar has been inspected and efforts are on to locate more land in Barang tehsil, Rout added.However, getting land at new sites would not be easy as the civic body has already selected land twice for the purpose but has met with disappointment due to different reasons.Sources said prior to Uttamapur, the CMC had identified 12 acre of land at Markat Nagar near CDA Sector-8. But the land could not be transferred due to lack of coordination between CMC and Forest Department. Later, the CMC identified a land near National Rice Research Institute(NRRI) at Bidyadharpur for the new deer park. But it was cancelled due to unfavourable environmental surroundings.The second deer park was necessitated after the Orissa High Court order. The HC move came in the wake of a writ petition alleging that overcrowding in the existing park at Madhusudan Nagar resulted in frequent deaths of deer.The deer park was set up at Madhusudan Nagar in 1981 over 2.5 acre of land with five deer. At present, the number of deer in the park has increased to 173, thereby resulting in overcrowding."

He said there are many villages like Nagada in Odisha where children die of malnutrition but the Government machinery is yet to reach there.Mishra criticised Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for not visiting Gumudumaha or Nagada. He alleged that both the villages do not have approach roads and rudimentary health, education and other facilities.Referring to Dana Majhi case, in which the poor tribal had to carry the body of his wife 10 km from district headquarters hospital at Bhawanipatna as he was not provided a vehicle, and consumption of mango kernel by tribals in Rayagada, Mishra said such incidents have exposed the development slogan of the BJD Government.Bhujabal Majhi, Prafulla Majhi, Krushna Chandra Sagaria, Kailash Kulesika (all Congress) and Rabi Naik (BJP) also criticised the Government for neglecting dalits and tribals.Making a statement in response, Minister of State for Tribal Welfare Sudam Marandi, however, said the State Government has launched several schemes for the socio-economic development of dalits and tribals. He said nearly 40 per cent funds of the Budget is being allocated for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.Referring to the Gumudumaha incident, the Minister said inquiry is on and report will be submitted to the Government within three months. Action will be taken based on the recommendations of the inquiry, he added."

The latest Kharif crop situation shows that rice sown area has been less than 2015 which happened to be a year of drought that gripped over 25 districts of Odisha. The crop-weather watch of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation revealed that rice has been sown over 22.89 lakh hectare (ha) area by August 12 which is about 1.78 lakh ha less than the corresponding period of last year.The total rice sown area so far has been about 60 per cent of the overall coverage area. As against 38.39 lakh ha, kharif rice has been sown over 22.98 lakh ha this year. Last year, the rice sown area was about 24.76 lakh ha. Crop coverage of pulses, oilseeds, sugarcane, cotton, jute and mesta as well as total coarse cereals has been more or less on par with last year's sown area. This time, the total sown area for all crops so far stands at 33.41 lakh ha as against 34.94 lakh ha during the corresponding period last year. Compared with the normal sown area for the year, which stands at 35.88 lakh ha, the shortfall has been 2.47 lakh ha. The crop report of the Agriculture Department, however, gives a different picture. It shows that total area under paddy coverage stands at 28.24 lakh ha, higher than last year's figure of 28.14 lakh ha.In fact, the overall crop coverage stands at 45.73 lakh ha compared to 45.28 lakh ha in 2015. While the crop coverage remains a reason for worry in the backdrop of the spate of farmer suicides, the rainfall scenario has been less than encouraging. As on Sunday, Odisha received 696 mm rain against the normal rainfall of 810 mm, registering a 14 per cent deficit. Between June and August 17, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) statistics showed that nine districts have registered deficit rainfall. However, the ground reality is far more worse as the last week has been pretty much dry for most of the districts. In the week ending August 12, 18 districts reported huge deficit rainfall which has affected farming activities.Nuapada recorded 75 per cent deficit while Balangir reported 71 per cent shortfall. Bargarh, Deogarh, Ganjam, Gajapati, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Khurda, Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur, Nayagarh, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur, Sundargarh and Puri also registered deficit rainfall during the week. Although the last week saw two weather systems forming off the Balasore coast, it rained mostly in the northern districts and West Bengal.A third system which formed north east of Myanmar on Saturday went close to Bangladesh and was heading into WB-Bihar region. It may not cause any rainfall. The weather office said another circulation is likely to form around August 25-26 and turn into a low pressure off south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast."

While artisans are busy completing the welcome arches, decorators have decked up every corner of the city with impressive lighting arrangements, thereby adding sparkle to the festivity. Organisers have spent a huge amount of money on innovative light works using LED lights.The entire Badambadi stretch is replete with rice light strings and the decorations include three massive light gates in addition to the replica of ISKCON temple at Mayapur in West Bengal. Similar decorations can be seen at Dolomundai, Bajrakabati and Haripur where five light gates have come up apart from the roadside decorations. Apparently, each of the puja committees spends between `2 lakh and `5 lakh on illumination. With 48 big pujas being organised in the city, the total figure hovers above `70 lakh during the fourday autumn festival.Malgodown Puja Committee is decorating the entire stretch with rice lights and five tall light gates have been erected at the cost of `four lakh. At Khan Nagar, 10 light gates have come up on a stretch of four km. Ganesh Kumar Das, chief artisan from Cuttack who designed lighting arrangements in Khan Nagar, says he has used various mythological themes to design the gates. At Jobra, Chauliaganj, Sheikh Bazaar, Ranihaat and Mangalabaag, light decorations have come up in every nook and cranny.Similarly in Bhubaneswar, replicas of temples, Dhauli Shanti Stupa and many more heritage sites will give Durga Puja a festive glow.

Each Puja committees consume between 20 KW and 22 KW of power through light decorations every day, he said and added that use of bulbs and traditional lights increases the power consumption by five times. CESU Superintending Engineer, Bhubaneswar Circle-I Sukanta Kumar Swain said each Puja committee consumes an average of 20 KW power every day and the total consumption in the four days is around 3.6 MW. He informed that eight regular and three special squads have been formed to check illegal connections."

In the past, locals had lodged several complaints regarding the poor quality of rice but higher officials of Civil Supplies department turned a deaf ear to their pleas.One Maitree Rice Miller from Tirtol stored nearly 25,000 quintals of substandard rice at Taradapada godown and also issued a copy of acceptance to the miller concerned without checking its quality though there is a provision to do so.On a tip off, Collector Yamini Sarangi asked Sub- Collector Narahari Sethy to unearth the racket following which he verified the rice and other documents and submitted a detailed report to the administration on Friday. It was found that the registers regarding measurement and weighing of PDS commodities were not maintained properly.Local millers procure paddy through Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC) and deliver it after milling at the godowns of OSCSC.Nearly `2.7 crore is pending on these millers who have cheated OSCSC to pay this amount in which certificate cases have been initiated against errant millers.The role of procurement inspector and quality analyst is also under the scanner.District Civil Supply Officer Raghunath Gamango confessed that the stock at Taradapda godown was poor quality in but exact quantity is yet to be ascertained."

Unlike those produced in China or even in neighbouring West Bengal, rice from the State is found to possess no toxicity.Studies conducted at US Naval Research Laboratory, Washington by Dr SB Qadri and Dr BB Rath in collaboration with Dr BK Roul of the Institute of Materials Science (IMS), Bhubaneswar, have found the evidence in rice husks which are an efficient concentrator of soil minerals.Samples collected from rice fields of Maluda island near Chilika lake and Dhusuri in Bhadrak district were put to study over the last three years for rice husk chemistry. Roul said the study showed varying amounts of minority elements concentrated by the plant in the husk. The Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) technique used to identify elemental composition showed high and medium concentration of manganese and high concentrations of iron from rice husks of these two areas.These elemental concentrations are uniquely present in the husk but not in rice grain and are directly correlated with the soil chemistry, he said.The study found that there is a clear indication of effectiveness of the rice plant to concentrate the mineral content of soil in the husk which can be easily determined using the EDXRF analysis as an indicator of mineral deposits in different locations.Moreover, arsenic is known as a carcinogen readily collected in the rice plant from soil and water. Earlier studies have also suggested that brown rice and white rice contain arsenic of various concentrations from different parts of the world. However, samples of rice husks and kernels obtained from Odisha showed no arsenic content, Roul said, adding rice of Odisha should have been sold at higher price in the global market due to its non-toxicity.The study which establishes food value of rice without presence of toxic elements could be of tremendous help in identifying many varieties of mineral deposits in the soil by simply examining the husks collected from various rice fields of Odisha. Similarly, it would also provide instant information on the soil chemistry and soil mineral of the region.The study by the three scientists points at the fact that nature, during billion years of evolution, protects its grains. The plant produces a coating to prevent damage of grains from pests and the environment, and these protective shells are known as rice hulls or rice husks.Advanced processing of the husk can even produce high value industrial materials such as silicon carbide and silicon oxide and silicon nitride and silicates of zinc, zirconium and cadmium."

I wanted to meet him to talk about providing shelter to some of my dogs, but he was not free. When I spoke to him over the phone, he said he would come visit my shelter after Diwali. I was not aware of his death as I hadnt read the newspaper or watched news. I went to his office on Wednesday and found it locked. Thats how I got to know he is no more.Surya then rushed to Surendras shelter only to find the dogs starving. The staff had fed them little bit of Pedigree. They were hungry. I made some arrangements for their food. I already have about 90 dogs in my shelter. It is getting difficult to maintain. So, we are looking to give the dogs up for adoption. There are a few handicapped dogs, which I will take to my shelter.All the dogs are over two-years-old, most of whom are Indies. There are a few breed dogs as well, likeWe see tears in the dogs' eyes. They have understood that their father is no more. I have made arrangements for some rice to feed these dogs. The staff says they have not been paid for two to three months. They do not seem interested, adds Surya.Chandrashekar, the owner of the land Surendra had leased out in Devanahalli and also an advocate, says Surendra had taken the land from him on lease from April 1, this year. I went to Sanjay Nagar Police Station. I do not know what is happening. I was asked to wait from 11 am to 8 pm, just for an hour of questioning and investigation. There are many police officers investigating the case. The ACP asked me to give him a requisition. I gave it immediately asking to give the dogs to some needy people. They have asked to wait for two days and that nothing can be done until they visit the property and mark the area for investigation. Another inspector told me the dogs can be taken away now.He adds, he has spoken to couple of people who can adopt the dogs. He claims that hes been giving money to the staff of Parchuri, to feed the dogs.I am spending Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 every day. I cannot afford to take care of these dogs. If they are not adopted, we would shift them to the shelter. Thats our last resort,"" says Chandrashekar.If you are willing to adopt the dogs, contact Surya Singh, Save Animals India."

Moreover, members of the Rourkela District Congress Committee (RDCC) recently took to the street for immediate refund of fines.By the end of June, panic had gripped ineligible beneficiaries with the district administration launching crackdown against them. Till first week of August, fine to the tune of `2.51 crore was recovered, about 10,000 NFSA cards cancelled, 253 police complaints filed and at least 21 persons jailed, most of them female family heads. By then, resentment was also at its peak against the department for messing up the scheme with additional introduction of ninth exclusion criteria of three-room pucca house from March 16.After Rourkela BJP MLA Dilip Ray sought the intervention of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on August 4, the Food Supply Department in a hurried decision announced to stop police action, recovery of fine and spare those who own three-room pucca house under Indira Awas Yojana, PM Awas Yojana and Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana.But interestingly none of the three housing schemes was implemented in Rourkela Municipal Corporation limits. Similarly, the Congress on August 11 called Rourkela bandh demanding removal of ninth criteria.Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer Abhiram Pradhan said further instruction over the issue is awaited from the State Government and as per the new refund norms, efforts are underway to supply details of disputed beneficiaries for refund of fines to their bank accounts. Till now, about 13.98 lakh persons have been covered through 4.07 lakh NFSA cards while the districts monthly quota of rice and wheat stands at around 7,000 tonnes and 1,200 tonnes respectively.FS&CW Dept is under pressure to refund fines collected from the beneficiaries earlierThe dept in second week of August had suspended police action against ineligible beneficiaries and stopped recovery of finesIt had issued September 30 ultimatum for voluntary surrender of NFSA cards till first week of August, fine to the tune of C2.51 crore was recovered and 10,000 NFSA cards cancelled."

The child's share ranges from Rs 500 to Rs 1200. Infact, going by the sources, this is the only money that the child receives for eight to 10 hours of labour that he/she puts in each day for eight months a year.The children are sent to work in kilns in Andhra Pradesh, Delhi and Karnataka with the middlemen, are left at the mercy of owners and are fed cooked broken rice porridge for lunch and dinner.Social activist and trade union leader Lalit Kumar Naik said, when children travel to brick kilns, they miss school and have to repeat their classes next year and eventually they drop out. They are also constantly exposed to all kinds of hazards including furnace heat and physical and sexual abuse, said Naik.Naik questioned what happens to the 20,000 children's share of rice in the Mid-day Meal scheme and Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan fund with the children gone and schools deserted. District Project Officer of SSA Dhananjay Mohapatra said, 134 seasonal hostelhave been opened in which 4823 children have been accommodated.District Labour Officer Suresh Behera said, the State is taking the issue seriously and Labour Minister, Commissioner and other State-level senior officers are scheduled to visit the district to review the situation."

Though no human casualty is reported so far, the elephants have damaged standing paddy and maize crops in several acres.As part of their annual sojourn the elephant herd comprising 12 calves and 6 tuskers from Dalma sanctuary has entered Mayurbhanj forests through their usual corridor in search of food after creating havoc in bordering districts of West Bengal.Locals are scared as the marauding jumbos has been causing widespread damage to paddy and vegetable crops in more than 100 forest side villages in both Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts besides killing people for the past six years.We are spending sleepless nights after knowing that the herd is camping in the jungle close to our village. The residents are guarding their houses by burning timber logs in the night, said a local Guruba Singh.Forest officials have warned local residents not to chase the elephants which may turn violent if they are irritated by fire crackers. They have also been asked not to store any intoxicating substance like rice beer in their houses to keep the elephants away.Baripada DFO Sanjay Swain said 120 forest personnel have been engaged in the border areas to monitor the movement of the elephant herd. They have been asked to prevent the entry of the pachyderms into the human habitations.Since horse-shit keep the elephants away, the officials also have deployed two horses along the Morada border to stop the elephants from proceeding further. According to experts, the neigh, smell of stool and urine of male horses irritate elephants.Last year the pachyderms had failed to enter Dukura, Betnoti and Rasgobindpur reserve forests as six male horses, two each, were deployed in these areas.Meanwhile, a 24-hour control room has been opened at Baripada divisional forest office to monitor the movement of a herd of wild elephants and collect information from the people.The deployed forest staff will provide regular updates about the movement of the herd.

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has indicted the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department for showing undue favour to private rice millers for custom milling of paddy despite huge arrears pending against them, he said.He dared the State Government for a CBI probe and said it will land many bureaucrats and politicians behind bars.The paddy procurement system has been virtually outsourced to rice millers and farmers are at their mercy, Pujari said. Though the Centre is paying for FAQ paddy, millers are deducting money on the plea of moisture content and foreign bodies to earn quick bucks, Pujari leader said, adding that the State Government is hand-in-glove with rice millers.The State Government has failed on both fronts __ in the land of farmers and in governance. Blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi for covering up its failure will not absolve the BJD and time has come to pack Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in Mahaprayan and the process would begin from Bargarh, he added. The BJD is providing mobiles to farmers and in return giving water to the companies, Pujari said.Addressing the gathering, Panda said failure of the State Government to support the farming community forced them to reach out to farmers and take up their cause.Speaking on other problems faced by the people of the State, Panda said several schools have no teachers while many are running short of staff. There are no doctors in hospitals and corruption has reached a new high while law and order has collapsed. Time has come to give the BJD a befitting reply, Panda said.The meeting was presided over State BJP vice-president Ashwini Sarangi, State executive member Sureshswar Satpathy and State Yuva Morcha general secretary Irasis Acharya.

Eastern India, especially Odisha and West Bengal, never produce rice above 63 per cent of the paddy supplied due to climatic condition. But millers in these two States are asked to provide 68 per cent rice, Saini said.General secretary Santosh Sonthalia said instead of storing entire procured paddy will millers, the State agencies should have their own storage arrangements from where the millers can lift paddy against 100 per cent security from time to time by rotating delivery. The millers warned to sit on dharna at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi in September if the Government fails to consider their demand.
