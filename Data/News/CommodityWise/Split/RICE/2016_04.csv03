The NGO will provide breakfast at 20 government schools in Hyderabad from September.We will give idly-sambar, upma-chutney and pongal-chutney for breakfast, said Kaunteya Dasa of Akshaya Patra. The breakfast initiative is funded by Aurobindo Pharma, a pharmaceutical company as a part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities.We are already helping government schools with mid-day meal schemes providing lunch for over one lakh children, he adderd.We started this initiative based on inputs from teachers saying the children are not able to concentrate during the mornings due to hunger, Kaunteya said.We want to provide breakfast for around 10,000 children every day. We are doing case studies and surveys of student enrolment and what students feel about the programme. After successful implementation of this programme we will approach the government, Kaunteya Dasa said. However, officials at the state women and child development department were not too happy with the quality of food the NGO serves. As far as Akshaya Patra is concerned, I am not happy, said KRS Laxmi Devi, joint director of women and child welfare department. Their quality of food is not good and it is either overcooked or undercooked, said the official.The rice is not washed properly and one can find insects in the food. Sometimes one can also find particles of scrubbers used for cleaning utensils in their meals, she added.Akshya Patra had recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to provide them with millets and recipes for millet based dishes. We will have millets in the menu, as they are very healthy. Depending on how the children respond we will take it forward, Kaunteya added.This will definitely help children, not only to gain weight but also to provide enough immunity to fight diseases. Its a welcome decision to include upma and other such calorie-rich foods, as majority of the Protein Energy Malnutrition cases are deficient in calories, said Mohammad Reshad, a practicing pediatrician."

The Punji family became overnight poverty celebs but things only got worse. Joining the conversation sullenly, Phanas pours out her bile. People got jealous of us and we were virtually cast out of the neighbourhood in Amlapali, she says. Her husband had never been around, and after the poverty tourists went home, she became the sole bread-earner of the family. the nations pity and the neighbours envy made things worse. A tubewell was promised and she applied for it. The papers were issued but someone cleverly hijacked it. I asked and the authorities said the borewell was for me but I never got it. I still dont have one, she says. Jagabandhu and his wife Chanchala are working towards getting a motor pump. If they raise `30,000, the Government will give a likely subsidy and the pump is theirs. The wife and he decided to save their NREGS wages and theyve raked together `4000 so far. I dont think we can ever manage `30,000, says Jagabandhu with a wry smile.Nuapada is one of the poorest districts in Odisha. At least 83 per cent of the families here live below the poverty line. Of them, over 50 per cent are tagged very poor, earning barely `6,000 a year. Perennially drought-hit, Nuapada, Kalahandi and Balangir are witness to migration by the thousands every year. Phanas and her son have been spared that fate till now. The latest district gazetteer calculates that one year of drought pushes the poor of Nuapada into 10 years of indebtedness. Even in a good year, a social function could deplete all of a familys reserves and leave it in a food deficit.The annual festivals are always a worry. Nuakhai, the biggest festival of western Odisha, is now here. It has to be celebrated with good food and new clothes to welcome the new rice of the season but for Phanas and Jagabandhu, it will be a just another day of struggle. From mother to son, a generation has passed and the faces have changed on the posters. From Phanas Punji to Dana Majhi, this is Kalahandi reinventing itself, trying to make itself interesting to a nation that sends 65 satellites into space all at once."

Till now.Gajanana Hegde of Tumbemane, near Sirsi in Uttara Kannada district, has developed a fibreboard stencil to speed up jackfruit papad-making, and cottage industries just love it.The crispy jackfruit wafer is a monsoon delight, and is eaten with almost every meal. It goes well with rice and sambar.There was no finesse in the home products now in great demand at local markets. I was wondering why it was not possible to make perfectly round papads. The jackfruit papads were not just uneven in size but also in shape and thickness, he told Express.Hegde got thinking, and used geometry instruments and acrylic to cut out a perfect stencil. He pressed the raw mix using it, and the results were encouraging.I later improvised and identified a fibreboard that lasts longer and gives uniform thickness, he said. It worked splendidly.Hegde has now set up a factory in Bengaluru and markets his stencils to cottage industries.The papads look better, and home products look more professional now. In fact, the Kadamba Home Products Co-operative Society in Sirsi is one of the top users of this mould, he told Express.Earlier, women made papads using rolling pins. The process was labour-intensive. But with the new mould, they just smear the batter with a spatula and put out the papads to dry.About 300-400 papads can be made in an hour manually. But with the fibreboard stencil, women are making four times as many.Jackfruit specialist Sree Padre hails the innovation and believes it could put the papad on the export shelf. Hegde has sold 4,500 moulds so far, 500 of them this year. The price of a two-eyed stencil is `140."

Eight others of Sipijode village have been admitted to Kashipur Community Health Centre since Thursday.Villagers, who are NFSA beneficiaries, said they were forced to consume gruel prepared with dry mango kernel powder as they were not provided their quota of ration, including rice, for a month. They were provided rice only on Sunday following a visit by Sub-Collector Murali Dhar Swain and other officials to Kashipur. However, Swain said the deaths might be due to malaria or cardiac arrest and not diarrhoea. On Saturday, Kashipur CHC Medical Officer Prasanna Kumar Mishra had said the patients were admitted to the hospital with diarrhoeal complications and many of the villagers also suffered from malaria.Meanwhile, members of the BJP and the Congress visited Sipijode village on Sunday to take stock of the situation. A seven-member team of the BJP, Rayagada unit, led by Siba Shankar Ulka, interacted with villagers. Ulka later accused the State Government of being responsible for the deaths. He said villagers are not getting their ration quota regularly which forces them to consume mango kernel powder. Ulka also criticised the district and block officials for their negligence in monitoring the situation. Congress chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati also visited Sipijode village and blamed the State Government for not being able to address issues at the grassroots.

Unlike other beaches with brown sand, this beach is known for its black sand.Teelmaati beach, located about 12 km from Karwar city, may soon get the attention of authorities to develop it as a tourist spot. For years, researchers have been visiting Teelmaati beach for various reasons.It is also one of the smallest beaches on the west coast and has a shore area of 50m. The Teelmaati beach has large black rocks and the water currents are quite strong.A few years ago, we had given a proposal to the district administration to construct a tourism infrastructure near Teelmaati because of its specialty.There are very few beaches in India which have such unique sand colour. One can see multi-coloured sand dunes in Kanyakumari where the two seas meet the ocean. But barring Teelmaati, there are no such beaches in Karnataka. Recently, some tourism developers from Karwar purchased land near the beach and have asked for infrastructure like road and electricity. The district administration has responded positively, said V N Naik, retired marine biologist and a Karwar resident.Deputy Commissioner S S Nakul said the administration is aware about the unique feature of the beach and soon, development works will be taken up. Under Swadesh Darshan scheme, the Tourism Department is expected to take up development works.During 1960s, Teelmaati beach was the international border between India and Goa which was under Portuguese rule. Locals in Teelmaati say the beach was once a smuggling point between Karwar and Goa where rice and liquor were exchanged.A villager from Majali said, In the past few years, the beach has slowly become popular among locals. But now the area near the beach is getting polluted. The authorities must make sure pollution is addressed."

At the sampling we tasted Dahi Bara Aloo Dum - a unique combination of dahi bara with soft spicy potatoes. We liked Sijha Manda - rice dumplings with moong dal filling. It somewhat appeared like bao. After two more starters we tasted the main course. Thunka Puri with its jumbo size made for a great combo with Chenna Tarkari and Ghanta Tarkari, a mix of crushed vegetables and sprouted grams. We liked it with Oau Khatta a chutney of elephant apple. We tried Dahi Machha and Mansha Kassa with Ghia Arna, a rice preparation. We recommend Badi Chura with rice. Its nothing but urad dal baris fried, crushed and mixed with spices. Our pick from the dessert platter is Kheera Sagar - a rasmalai like dish made from baby rasgollas. It is a delicious spread, but we missed Kanika with which Odia food is associated with."

At a district-level workshop on quality control of paddy and rice organised by Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation Limited (OSCSC) here, agriculture experts said that the farmers of Koraput region have been practising paddy harvesting process without considering the FAQ (Fair Average Quality) standards set by the Government. As a result, their produce fails in the quality checking conducted in different paddy mandis during procurement, they said. The experts suggested that the farmers should maintain the quality of paddy from the beginning of the harvesting. This apart, storage of paddy, use of pesticides and distribution of quality paddy seeds among beneficiaries were discussed. Sources said paddy is being cultivated in one lakh acres of land in Jeypore, Kotpad, Boipariguda, Kundra and Borrigumma for the kharif season. The paddy harvesting process would start from October onwards for which, the OSCSC is organising such workshops to create awareness among farmers and millers over quality of grains, the sources further said. Among others, Sub-Collector Kurtivas Raut, ACSO RN Nanda, GS Dash of district civil supply office, RMC and PACS officials and leader of rice millers association Gopal Panda were present."

That attractive and comptent Indian is Aruna Miller, the first Telugu woman to be serving in the United States politics.Aruna was elected to represent the 15th Legislative District in the Maryland House of Delegates in 2010. She serves on the Ways and Means Committee where she sits on the Revenue, Transportation and Education sub-committees. Daughter of an immigrant, Arunas journey is inspiring to many immigrants who step on the land of immigration in a hope to make it big.I believe in engaging communities. That is what democracy is. There are several issues that I deal with from drinking water to funding for the schools. In every step of mine, I remember that, I am serving people and I need to act in the best interest of the public. Success is making others dreams and goals come true, says Aruna.As the US is still struggling to have its first woman president, representatives like Aruna have opportunities to serve the public. Its been a journey of 14 years as a volunteer and as an elected representative. I signed up as a democrat and started volunteering in the office a decade ago. I volunteered for almost four years. Then there was an open position and I was approached to contest, says Aruna who was skeptical to enter the mainstream politics as a candidate. I stepped back and thats when my husband boosted my confidence saying that if I win, I will get the opportunity to represent USA and India. If I lose, I will still be a volunteer and continue my activities. I took it up as a challenge and nominated myself. Amazingly, my community supported me. I ran in the primary where we were six democrats competing for three open posts. Then, I made it to the top three during general elections and won the post. It was exhilarating as I had the opportunity to give back to this country which gave me the education and life.Not to forget, Indians represent just 1% in the US politics though they are in good number in science in technology. Indian women in US politics are a rare phenomenon. I take pride in saying I belong to both USA and India. You can see, I still speak good Telugu, smiles Aruna whose undeterred energy is now seen in Hillary Clintons presidential campaign.Aruna believes women bring a much-needed different perspective when they become leaders. Women are in the minority in leadership roles take up issues such as child care and reproductive rights, will get the priority.A win for her (Hillary) is a win for all women, she says.Working in US politics is a challenge by itself. When I walk into the office, I walk with confidence. I make sure; my voice is heard and is strong as any other representative. There are definitely many things that I dont know. But everyday, I learn and study my challenges. I push the door, take the seat on the table and tell them, I am elected just like you and I am here to represent the people who trusted me, says Aruna who is happy with her work so far.When asked about her inspiration, she says, My father. He was a true Indian by heart who migrated to the US to give us a better life. When he passed away, I felt empty and found joy in giving back to society.We were living in Hyderabad when my parents moved to the United States. Thats when I started living with my grandmother in Vijayawada until I came here at the age of 7. My parents did everything they could to provide us the best education.Aruna has a civil engineering degree from University of Missouri, where she also met her husband, David Miller. My husband takes care of my family when I am attending the assembly sessions. Our daughters - Meena, Chloe and Sasha understand my schedules and I am also fortunate to have my mother lend a helping hand. Aruna, a vegetarian, enjoys cooking. Sambar, gongura, brinjal and rice and some pickle - thats her kind of meal."

This is what the doctors experienced while attending to the old aged persons on the occasion of International Day of Older Persons, on Saturday at Sundarayya Vignana Kendram, Baghlingampally. The doctors were particpating in a programme organised by HelpAge India, which saw the attendance of scores of sexagenarian and septuagenarians.A 70-year-old woman with hunch back, who was not able to walk steadily, took the support of the arm of a chair and then crashed into it. Likewise, there were several men and women who struggled to walk even with help of a walking stick.The woman, Venkatamma, does not remember her age, neither the number of years her husband has been dead. He could have died around 50 years ago. I used to work as labourer, but now I survive on `1,000 pension issued by the government. I do not spend money at a go since I have to ensure there is money for lean days, said Venkatamma, whose two daughters are married and stay at Shamshabad.Another woman, around 72-year-old from Karimnagar said she receives six kg rice a month from a NGO and survives on it. I have been eating only once a day from past many years, the woman said, adding that she has problems in knees and cannot work anymore. I serve old people at 12 villages in Shamshabad. When I check their blood pressure and speak to them, they cry, make me cry as well. They say I remind them of their children. If I dont visit the clinic a week, they ask me if I forgot them. A lot of them live alone. Isolation from families leads to depression, said Md Akbar, a doctor who works with HelpAge India.On the sidelines of the programme, vice-president of Federation of Senior Citizens Organizations (FESCO)-Telangana, V Gopala Rao said that the policies should be framed in a way that senior citizens are given preference at police stations, government offices or other places.In a representation which he submitted to the government, Gopala Rao mentioned around 20 issues that old aged suffer from."

Despite a high-pitched campaign by the opposition parties, and allegations of corruption against its leaders, the Trinamool finished with 211 seats in the 294-member House. The Congress emerged as the principal opposition party, winning 44 seats, followed by the Left Front with 33 (including one independent backed by the Front), while the BJP and its associates got half a dozen seats.The Trinamool, which had campaigned on the plank of development, highlighting the welfare initiatives like providing rice to the poor at Rs 2 a kg, cycles to students and grants to girls under the Kanyashree scheme, decimated the opposition in 15 out of 20 districts.The verdict was particularly disappointing for the Left Front, the state's rulers for 34 years at a stretch from 1977 to 2011. Front major Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M), which had taken the lead in cobbling togerher the alliance with the Congress even at the cost of annoying some decades-old Left Front partners, failed to arrest its journey downhill that had started in the twilight years of the Left rule.What rubbed salt into the comrades' wounds was the fact that they had to cede the principal opposition status to the Congress, despite having contested the lion's share of the 294 elected seats in the 295-member house (one member is nominated).The lead-up to the polls was marred by a low-level of political discourse as many of the speakers from various parties were caught in television grabs issuing life threats to opponents, using indecent language and invectives and even threatening the administration and the police.The Narada sting footage, which purportedly showed Trinamool leaders, including ministers, MPs, state lawmakers and party office-bearers, accepting bundles of cash in exchange of a promise to give lucrative contracts to a fictitious company, hit the public domain in the midst of the hurly-burly of campaigning and immediately generated a big political storm. While the Trinamool questioned the genuineness of the footage, the opposition parties made the ""revelations"" a major poll issue.The Vivekananda Road flyover, at the crowded Posta area in north Kolkata, came apart on March 31, taking 26 human lives and injuring over 100 persons. This led to another bout of allegations and counter-allegations among political opponents in the election-bound state.Months later, a report drawn up by former faculty members of the Indian Institute of Technology-Kharagpur concluded that faulty design, sub-standard raw material and inadequate supervision caused the flyover's collapse.After its assembly poll success, the Trinamool had more reason to cheer as the Supreme Court struck down the land acquisition made by the erstwhile Left Front government for the Tata Motors' Nano project in Hooghly district's Singur in 2006, and ordered that the land be returned to the cultivators.As the supremo of the then principal opposition party, the Trinamool, Banerjee had spearheaded the anti-land acquisition protests, undertaking a 26-day hunger-strike followed by a 16-day sit-in demanding 400 of the 997.11 acres acquired for the project be returned to those farmers who did not want to part with their land. Following a sustained movement, the Tatas relocated the factory from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat.In the aftermath of the Supreme Court judgement, the Trinamool administration went into overdrive to return physical and empirical possession of land to the peasants.Banerjee, affectionately called ""didi"" (elder sister), herself made a couple of highly publicised trips to Singur, sowing seeds in the fields and returning title deeds to the farmers.Buoyed by the judicial verdict, the Trinamool went from strength to strength as front-ranking Congress leaders like Manas Bhunia and several other lawmakers from the opposition ranks crossed over to its fold.The Trinamool got a further boost when it received national party status from the Election Commission, and through the year tried to position itself as the epicentre of the anti-BJP political space nationally. Banerjee raised the intensity of her attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi after the central government demonetised high-value currency notes.In order to tap investments, the Banerjee government organised the Bengal global business summit, and claimed to have received investment proposals worth at least Rs 2,50,104 crore. How many of these proposals will reach the implementation stage of the industry-starved state remains a big question.However, taking a big stride in medical treatment, the state saw a number of cadaver transplants, with the administration providing green channels in Kolkata to vehicles transferring body parts from one hospital to another.During the year, the state lost one of its cultural icons, writer activist Mahasweta Devi, while death also snatched away 103-year-old bodybuilder and former Mr Universe Manohar Aich.But 2016, in its last lap, brought a piece of good news when poet Shankha Ghosh was chosen for the Jnanpith, the country's highest literary award."

However, the government will have to pull up the socks now, following last weeks National Green Tribunal (NGT) directive to the states to apprise it of any increase or slump in the population of indigenous breeds of cows in the last 10 years and also to file state-specific details within two weeks or pay a Rs 25,000 fine.Post the NGT order, the head of the Genetics Division of the Kerala University of Veterinary Sciences, Mannuthy, in a report to Registrar Joseph Mathew stated that there has been a steady increase in the number of Vechur Cows after a conservation project was initiated in 1989.According to the report, he said Vechur Cows had been given to 200 farmers over the last two decades and their numbers would have multiplied. The Registrar will submit the report to the state government to be forwarded to the Tribunal. Says M Brahmadathan of Pattambi, who had reared more than a dozen native cows and oxen on his 10 acre farm, it was largely due to famed agricultarist Subhash Palekars efforts that the native breeds gained wider acceptance in Kerala.In North India, though, breeds like Gir, Sahival and Tharparker are reared for milk. The indigenous breeds of Kerala are Vechur (124 cm long and 87 cm high), Kasaragod dwarf and Malanadan Gidda. The National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resource (NBAGR) at Karnal, Haryana, has chalked out schemes for the protection of native bovine breeds. But only Vechur has been registered from Kerala. However, Brahmadathan added that post-2010 Kerala Livestock Development(KLD) Board was providing the semen of Gir, Sahiwal, Kankrej, Vechur and Kasaragod dwarf free of cost. All these cows are grazed in the open.Adds Manikandan alias Sadanandan of Kottekad, who has 17 native cows, Now, I am cultivating paddy on 18 acre of leased land using organic manure and dung of native cows. Earlier, I used to rear hybrids, but subsequently I chanced to read the book Devil in the Milk by agricultural scientist Keith Woodford which made me turn to native breeds. Now, I sell organic boiled rice for Rs 70 per kg and raw rice at Rs 60 per kg to 100-odd households. The consumer can demand the percentage of bran which has to be retained in his rice. I also sell premium ghee of native cows, which costs Rs 1,600 per kg and value-added products like tooth powder, washing powder, soap, vibhooti, manures, pesticides and other medicinal preparations.Further, he pointed out that all Indian breeds of cows produce A2 milk where as Western or hybrid produce A1 milk. Definitely A2 has better taste, flavour and is also hygienic. The hump on the native cows help them adjust their water needs, Manikandan said. According to K Shudhodhanan, former deputy director of the Animal Husbandry Department,The desi breeds are heat tolerant and disease resistant.The management cost is low and they dont need factory made feed concentrate. The Centre provides a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 for the native cows. There is also NDDB assistance for goshalas.In Elapully, the Dakshin Vrindavan is conserving 44 native breeds, mostly North Indian, on 20 acre of leased land."

But nearly 2,500 km away from home, he is guarding the perimeter of a luxury hotel in Kasargod.The 21-year-old Robin Singh is an 18-time state champion in sub-junior, junior and senior categories between 2012 and 2016. At the Subrata Classic International Powerlifting Championship at Jamshedpur, he finished second behind Irans Arash Rezaei in the 93kg category.I thought the government would support me. But all I got was `10,000 from the district administration on the Republic Day, he said, choking on his words. Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan directed Perinthalmanna Sub-Collector to conduct a comprehensive probe into the incident and submit a report.The case, registered in connection with the encounter killing, was handed over to the Crime Branch, the Chief Minister's Office said in a statement. The government's decision came in the wake of CPI, a major partner in ruling LDF, and human rights activists coming out against the encounter of the Left rebels. Two Maoists- Kuppuswamy Devaraj (65), a central committee member of the outlawed outfit and Ajitha (45), were killed in an encounter with police in Nilambur forests on November 24.The Crime Branch probe was ordered late last night by DGP Loknath Behara as the Supreme Court had in September 2014 laid down guidelines as per which in all cases of encounter deaths a mandatory registration of FIR and investigation by CID or any other independent agency was necessary. According to police, the Maoists had opened fire at a patrolling party following which police retaliated, killing the two.The attack took place in a 500-acre forest area in the Western Ghats, they said. Improvised explosive devices, materials used to make explosives and explosive materials, solar panels, some battery chargers, a set of pen drives, a modem, an electronic tab, a pistol and 40 sacks of rice were also recovered from the hideout of the Maoists, police said.Police also said the ultras fired at a police party on a combing operation in Nilambur area and two of them were killed in retaliatory firing. The search operations were undertaken by a 60-member elite team of the Thunderbolt Force, based on a tip-off that Maoists were camping in the area."

You can visit the states later, but can get a preview of their cuisines which range from spicy, sweety to tangy in one place. The Square, Novotel Hyderabad Airport is organising a food promotion Best of the West comprising food from the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.This food promotion is only for dinner. At night the restaurant comes alive with stewards moving in traditional mirror work jackets, kurta and dhotis. There are embroidered umbrellas hanging upside down from the ceiling look kaleidoscopic. The food is equally colourful. For the starters there was Murgh Angara, Khasta Babycorn, Jalander Machhi Tikka and Kebab Dilruba. We liked Khasta Babycorn, which tasted just like home-made pakodas savoured on rainy days. The taste was simple and spices kept minimal.For the main course the Gujarati rice preparation Khatta Meetha Bhaat was done nicely with tang and sweetness rightly balanced. We tried it with Konbdi Rasa, chicken cooked Maharashtra style. Though the dish was spicy, the flavours werent overpowering. The rice tasted equally well with Bhindi Nariyal Ki Bhaji; it was okra prepared with grated coconut. Among the meat preparations we liked Safed Maans, from Rajasthan, the best among the meat preparations. The gravy was kept light with use of curd, nuts paste and select condiments. We tried Nauratan Sabzi with Missi Roti and Singhada Roti. The combination is a must try. The dessert platter has many varieties like Rabdi Ghevar, Murmure Ke Laddu, Tava Mithai and Malpua. Interestingly there are more than 50 items in the food promotion and the combination is changed everyday. The promotion will be on till September 11. Thebuffet will cost you `1,440+ taxes."

For most part of the day, the villagers are busy in the sugarcane and paddy fields. They have little time to worry about the cash crisis that is bothering the rest of the country. Nor do they need to. Here, a family can manage with Rs 500 for two weeks. For now, they are making do with the small change they have.The village has no buses. People have to walk to Tatwanagi village, 2 km away, to catch a bus. There is no ATM either. The population of 1,000 consists mostly of farm labourers. Their meagre existence means the villagers are yet to feel the pinch of the prevailing cash crunch. But they have heard about it.The villagers leave their homes by 8 am after packing their lunch and return only by evening. They earn about Rs 150 for a days work in the fields. The contractors are still paying them in old notes or asking them to defer their wages. Many have not been paid for a week now. Those who dont have any money are managing by buying groceries on credit from one of the two petty shops in the village. One of the shops is run by Jannat Nayak, a Siddi. She is one of the few graduates in the village. People like her are finding themselves in great demand.Most of the villagers do not have bank accounts. We are unaware of the ways of banks and are dependent on some educated villagers, says Juben, a villager. Many of the elderly people keep their savings in the discontinued denominations. They have to now exchange their money. He said he found one elderly couple sitting at a bus stop in Tatwanagi village for more than half a day without catching any bus. When he asked them why, they reluctantly revealed that they were carrying Rs 3,000 with them and did not know where to go to exchange the old notes.Mallesh, a tractor driver, says he has been helping people in his village to get their notes exchanged. Most of the people have money ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000. Banks in Haliyal are helping them with quick exchange, he says. Miladri Doddamani, a former panchayat member, says villagers have learnt to live within means. During the mango season we make lot of pickle which can be consumed with rice for many months. We also get mushrooms and tubers from the forest, he says."

The armed team, including CPI(Maoist) south zonal committee member Vikram Gowda, Soman and Sundari, reportedly resurfaced at Cholanaiykar colony at Mannala, near Karimbuzha, Nilambur.Confirming their presence, the anti-naxal squad at the Nilambur forest said the insurgents had visited the area in the night on Monday, and vowed to take revenge on the killings of their two leaders.The police said the gang had told the colony dwellers that they would regroup and give a fitting reply to the government and the police when an opportunity arrives. They said the deaths of Kuppu Devaraj and Ajitha would not diminish their spirit, and that they would retaliate with weapons. The Maoist team revealed that none was injured in the police attack, and sought the support of the tribesmen to begin an armed revolution against the government, the police said. The gang spent about two hours in the area before returning to the woods with rice and other essential commodities from the tribal area. The police said high alerts were issued to forest stations following the report.Cremation put off till SaturdayManjeri Principal Sessions Court on Tuesday stayed the cremation of Maoist leaders Kuppu Devaraj and Ajitha till December 5. Passing the order, the court sought the opinion of the government and the police. The order came on a petition filed by the brother of Kuppu and the members of the Janakeeya Manushayavakash Prasthanam, seeking a stay on the cremation.A detailed hearing of the case is posted to December 9. The plea requested for a detailed investigation into the killing of the leaders. The petitioners expressed their resentment at asking the same person who carried out the inquest to do the magisterial probe.The relatives of the Kuppu and Ajitha have planned to approach High Court asking for a re-postmortem on the duo. The inquest had showed that Ajitha and Kuppu had multiple gunshot wounds, but their dresses never carried any mark of the gun shots."

Long before eco-friendly houses came on the radar of builders, Dr L K Sripathi, professor of mechanical engineering in JNN College of Engineering, had shown the way.As you reach his house in LBS Nagar, all the 10 shining solar panels on the rooftop give you a warm welcome. You name it, his house has it: From cool hollow cement blocks to rain water harvesting to vermi compost unit to a kitchen waste bio-gas plant to a vegetable and flower garden.His house, aptly named Vibha (means Sun or light in Sanskrit), relies mostly on sun power...this, even on gloomy rainy days.Talking about his dream of living clean and green, he says, Right from my college days, I was passionate about the alternative energy system. I worked on solar and biomass energy during my MTech course and I did PhD in the relevant area of renewable energy and energy conservation.This green dream turned into reality in 2004 when he built the two-storeyed Vibha, focusing on renewable energy sources.Appliances like grinder, television, computer, fan and lighting are fed by solar energy. Only the fridge runs on electricity.The performance of this system is excellent. The cost of installation is less compared to electricity, and I havent faced any major maintenance problems, says Sripathi.Cooking, the major component of domestic energy consumption, is taken care of by a solar box type cooker and parabolic cookers. While the solar cooker is mainly used for drying grains and reheating food, the parabolic cooker is used to cook rice and boil rainwater for drinking purpose. LPG cylinder is there as backup too.I am happy there are no constraints in my kitchen work, says P N Mamatha, Sripathis wife. Mamatha works as a lecturer of home science in Kamala Nehru National College for Women.But how do they manage during monsoon? All days are not cloudy. Moreover, we have battery back-ups that store energy for two days. This autonomy certainly helps us. Use of grid power even during rainy days is very rare, says Sripathi.The residents here are high on water wisdom. They catch every rain drop and use it for both drinking after filtering and non-potable purposes. Every year, around 45 per cent of their water requirement is fulfilled by the RWH system. Sripathi says the annual amount of rain water collected (900mm with approximate 20 per cent loss) in Vibha is about 86,000 litres. But this year it has been less.It has two water storage sumps of 20,000-litre and 10,000-litre capacity where rainwater is collected. The house has two components for reuse of grey water (wastewater generated from domestic processes such as washing and bathing). The second component consists of two percolation pits.During the off monsoon days, water from this tank is lifted up manually and used to water the garden. During monsoon, the grey water is sent to these percolation pits to recharge the underground water table.The house also has a biogas unit. It uses 1.5 kg feed (kitchen waste) a day to produce 0.13 Nm3 gas a day, which supplies around 20 per cent of the energy required for cooking. Sripathi has been motivating people to switch over to renewable energy sources. Inspired by his initiatives, some of his friends and relatives too have adopted rainwater harvesting system and solar power generation."

Some put the number of deaths due to CKD at 5,000 per annum, as many deaths due to CKD are not recorded as such when they occur at home in remote rural areas.Dr.Asoka Bandarage says that about 20,000 have died of CKD over the past two decades in the NCP alone, with 80 percent of the deaths occurring within two years of diagnosis because of late reporting and diagnosis, lack of dialysis machines, non-availability of pure drinking water, expensiveness of the drugs and poverty.CKD is not commonly found in other rural areas of Sri Lanka though they have rice cultivation practices and lifestyles similar to the NCP. Some researchers consider the unique hydrochemistry of the drinking water in the NCP to be the reason for the prevalence of CKD there. Others consider the hardness of ground water and the heavy metal retention capacity of the soil in the region to be the causative factors.Fertilizers and pesticides are also blamed. A study published in January 2010 by a team of Sri Lankan and Japanese scientists hypothesized that the unique hydro-geo-chemistry of the drinking water, especifically high levels of fluoride, is the decisive factor in the emergence of CKD in NCP. The rising temperature in NCP has also caused the problem with people having to drink large quantities of chemically polluted water.Sri Lanka has a relatively comprehensive and free public state health care system. And yet it finds it difficult to keep pace with the alarming rate of growth of CKD. Only about 5 percent of the governments annual health budget is earmarked for the management of CKD.Private treatment is extremely costly. According to Dr.Bandarage, in 2005, a kidney patient had to spend approximately LKR 10,000 (US$ 79) for dialysis and LKR 800,000 (approximately US$ 6,320) for a kidney transplant. Each tablet now costs about LKR 350 and that has to be taken without fail and on time.Kidney donors are extremely difficult to find in Sri Lanka, as kidney sales are illegal here. Until September 2010, kidney donations were accepted only from relatives and members of the clergy. The desperate need for kidneys led to a change in government policy which now allows non-relatives to donate.CKD in Sri Lanka, Nicaragua, and India have common features: The victims are farm workers; all suffer from a rare form of kidney damage known as tubule-interstitial disease, consistent with severe dehydration and toxic poisoning; and a few suffer from diabetes and hypertension.In these countries CKD goes undiagnosed as it is insidious disease. It can manifest itself as just a swelling in the ankle or as gastritis. Therefore, it tends to be neglected or incorrectly treated.Sensing the urgency of the matter, Sri Lankas leading hotelier, Sanjeev Gardiner, tied up his Gardiner Foundation (GF) with the International Society of Nephrology (ISN) to start, not just a Sri Lankan, but a global mission, to initiate and ensure the sustainability of multi-faceted activity for the prevention and treatment of CKD.The ISN-Gardiner Foundation (ISN-GF) is to be inaugurated in Colombo by Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on December 19. Last year, the President had appointed Gardiner as the Ambassador for the Prevention of Kidney Diseases. Since CKD is a social and economic problem, and not just a medical one to be tackled only by doctors and the government, the President wanted a private sector person to be the Ambassador and Gardiner was the natural choice.Gardiner has secured the help of the Indian nephrologist Prof. Georgi Abraham of the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences, who is also Consultant and Director of Nephrology at the Madras Medical Mission Hospital in Chennai.Dr. Georgi AbrahamKnown among his patients as a saint for his missionary zeal, Prof.Abraham is involved in the prevention and treatment of CKD both in India and internationally. He was a member of the Governing Council of the ISN between 2005 and 2011.Gardiner has already contributed LKR 30 million to the anti-CKD campaign. ISN will manage the fund of the ISN-GF and distribute the benefits among the needy countries. This has been done both for transparency and to reap the benefits of globalization of the anti-CKD campaign.In Sri Lanka, the issues are lack of awareness of the nature of CKD, its symptoms, causes and treatment, besides the non-availability of drugs and equipment. Awareness and preventive measures have to propagated, and more dialysis equipment and Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants to supply purified water have to be set up.Dialysis machines could be imported from India as these are cheaper. A 10,000 gallons a day RO plant, some of which have been set by GF, can serve 100,000 people."

The IUML, the second largest constituent party in UDF, has already said the issue would be raised at the Front meet.A day after Muraleedharans statement, IUML as well as the Kerala Congress (J) echoed the same. IUML national secretary E T Mohammed Basheer criticised the UDF of having failed to play the role of a creative Opposition. Pointing out that the Opposition has failed to expose the failures of government, he said UDF has not been able to rise to the situation and launch a strong protest despite LDF having failed in many sectors.When the rice issue was its peak, the UDF and the Opposition proved to be a failure. Same was the case when UAPA was imposed and the resignation of M M Mani came up, he said. Kerala Congress (J) leader Johnny Nellore also said the Opposition had failed to raise issues like disruption of ration distribution.Blame game continuesThe war of words between K Muraleedharan and Rajmohan Unnithan continued on Tuesday with both the leaders blaming each other. Muraleedharan said that he stuck to his remarks on the Opposition. He said the KPCC president would speak if anything needs to be said about party policy and matters. He also said he had not brought disrespect to the party but only expressed party workers sentiments.Meanwhile, Unnithan said Muraleedharan was a constant troublemaker in party. He said he had made a statement against Muraleedharan as he had ridiculed the party. He alleged that Muraleedharan had gone abroad to participate in a programme organised by the rebels in the party on the day of his father K Karunakarans death anniversary."

Not just them, but around 100 tribals in the region, who are no stranger to travelling into jungle almost every day to collect items that they could sell and earn a livelihood, said they believed that going into the forest would be suicidal now.We always travel into the forest to collect honey, firewood and medicinal plants. Though this is where the naxals mostly hide, we never felt threatened. Now we do, said Mathi.She said the insurgents often visit their colonies and other households to collect food and many give them rice and vegetables under threats. However, they never actually harmed local residents, she said.Chengan said it was really dangerous for them to go to the forest now.How do we go there now? They would be looking for an opportunity to retaliate, he said, adding, However, our livelihood is under threat, as we cannot live without going into the forest.

Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled.I wanted to stand up and crow, Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw! What else do you think he eats?He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal.

For him to wake up hungry and crying. For a bolt of lightning to strike me down.None of that happened. He did wake up the next morning, hungrier than usual though.So, my advice to mothers, sincenobody asked, is if your kid wont eat, let them go hungry once in a while.I swear nothing terrible will happen. And unless you write acolumn about it in the newspapers, no one will judge you harshly either."

As per the Fisheries and Aquaculture Act, the sluice separating the paddy field and the water body could be opened only on November 15 every year.The union workers opened the sluice to my pokkali field of more than two acres, as instructed by the Padasekhara Samithi, much before the harvest, alleged farmer M M Chandu in a complaint filed at the Kannamali police station.According to sources, the sluice was opened to prepare the field for prawns cultivation on November 15.As per rule, fish cultivation can be carried out from November 15 to April 15. They broke the rule as they wanted to start aquaculture before mid November, so that prawns could be cultivated two times, which normally takes 90-120 days to mature. The trend has been affecting pokkali farming, said Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi general convener Francis Kalathungal.Though the various government departments - Revenue, Irrigation, Agriculture and Fisheries - have equal role in enforcing the order, most of them are not really concerned.Though I instructed the Padasekhara Samithi to close the sluice, after receiving the complaint, they refused. The Collector has even directed the police to take action against the Padasekhara Samithi, in the wake of the rampant violation. Fish cultivation is more profitable than pokkali farming, said agriculture officer Sheeba.When contacted, Padasekhara Samithi secretary Jacob said the sluice was opened to facilitate transportation of rice by boat. It is a routine practice for us every year. There is nothing wrong in it, because we opened the sluice after the paddy cultivation was over, he said."

""We all have bank accounts. MNREGS credits our payment in the bank. We go to the bank once in two or three months to take out our money. We don't need large amounts to run the household here,"" said Anumol, a tribal woman.But though demonetization hasnt impacted these families, the state government's policy of categorizing ration cards as Priority and Non-priority has. As part of the Priority and Non-priority system, the government has taken our ration cards.So we cannot collect rice from the ration shops at the moment. We are now forced to buy rice for a higher price.Though demonetization has not affected us, the state government's policy has hit us badly,"" said Kanji, an Adivasi woman and a member of the Kuttampuzha gram panchayat."

The Civil Supplies Department has a solution: rice shops.In a bid to provide rice at fair prices to the public, the department is opening rice shops. Orders in this regard were issued on Tuesday, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman said. The shops are coming up under the aegis of the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco). The first group of shops will start functioning at the five mega Xmas Fairs of the Supplyco which are in full swing in Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur.Our plan is to open one each in the districts at the Sypplyco hyper markets, he said. The Food Corporation of India has agreed to provide rice to Supplyco at Rs 21.50. This is a reasonable price as most brands cost Rs 32- 35 a kilo in the open market, he said. Even adding the transportation charges of the food grain, the price will not go beyond Rs 25, Thilothaman said.On whether the rice shops would become a permanent fixture, he said it would depend on the response and need. Supplyco has opened rice shops before also, when the price of rice spiralled out of control. This time, the shops will be offering the best raw rice (Pachari) also, he said. Supplyco, entrusted with the job of lifting food grain from FCI depots and delivering it to individual ration shops under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the state, has also been instructed to form a special cell to oversee the smooth enforcement of NFSA."

Elderly women there boldly stated that four to five generations were involved in sale of Gudumba and their expenses were met through the business, but not anymore.The women said that after the present government cracked down on production and sale of Gudumba, they are finding it tough to get by the day. Some of them borrowed money from well-wishers and took credit to buy rice and pulses.Though the women took the paper plate making machines to their homes hoping to make some money, they are anxious on how would they earn money for basic necessities after demand for the paper plates slumps, as the products are in demand for four to five-months when marriages are performed.Sitting outside Jai Lodheswari Bhavan at Dhoolpet on Monday afternoon, with cardboard material provided for making the product, an elderly woman, Shanti Ben, said that three generations of family before her and her kids were involved in sale of Gudumba. The centuries old source of income came to an end after officials from prohibition and excise department took stringent action.Fierce while explaining how raids have affected their livelihood, Shanti Ben said, Gudumba used to take care of all expenses at home.

Cooked to perfect thick consistency, the tomato flavour drumstick leaf soup is creamy and delectable. The drumstick leaves lace the spicy soup with a bitter taste.The Chettinad cuisine served here offers a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. For starters, there are Palkatti Chukka, Kaikari Kola Urundai, Chettinadu Egg Roast, Chicken Leg Roast and Kuvepoo Kara Varuval.Palkatti Chukka is batter-fried paneer cubes tossed in Chettinad masala. The crunchy cubes are served along with generous amount of lightly fried curry leaves and shallots. The Kaikari Kola Urundai are fried balls of minced vegetables coated with bread crumbs. They are laced with Chettinad spices. Boiled egg is fried crispy for Chettinadu Egg Roast. They taste zesty.The Chicken Leg Roast is tawa roasted. The sounf-flavoured chicken drumsticks are juicy. Marinated with spices, the drumsticks are pan fried. This crunchy appetiser has a blend of ground masala and curry leaves. The Kuvepoo Kara Varuval has some crispy fried cauliflower florets tossed in Chettinad spices. Though the name suggests Kara, meaning spicy, it is not spicy at all.All the preparations are garnished with curry leaves lending them a strong aroma and flavour to the food. Though the Chettinad cuisines are believed to be spicy and rich, these food preparations are made less spicy, customised to the taste of the Bengalureans. Though, towards the end, everything tastes the same.For the main course, there is the Chicken Biryani and Veg Biryani. Both look appetising and colourful but, on tasting, the dish is mediocre.

Back in 2010, I was working with a couple of schools in Kerala that housed physically and mentally challenged students with them. I found out that this form of therapy has amazing results and the kids were more involved than before.Customised SessionsIn horticultural therapy, Karthikeyan first tries to find out what the children require and categorise their needs separately. The sessions are split into three: therapeutic, social and vocational.In therapeutic classes, we teach children how to control their emotions and behaviour, in social classes we try to involve children in group activities. In vocational sessions, we try to help them in interacting with the society. In each session, we examine the childs behavioural and mental understanding of his or her peers, environment and subjects and facilitate the learning of horticulture accordingly. The therapy sessions are individual to give more focus on the child. The therapy sessions are not just about the science of horticulture, but they also incorporate psychology, physiotherapy and other elements of learning into it.Work those FingersWhen asked about how horticultural therapy actually works, he states anexample to explain. For people with such kind of a problem, we ask them to use a sponge and spray to water the plants. Thus, their fingers are given continuous work and that is one form of therapy. The children are encouraged to maintain gardens and build terrariums, while they are taking their therapy sessions.Healthy DietAlong with the therapy classes, it is essential for parents to consciously maintain a healthy diet. A GFCF diet which stands for Gluten free and Casein free diet does not involve wheat, rice and other whole grain elements is involved in the therapy. This diet is fully plant based and we encourage not to eat processed food of any kind, white rice, sugar, oil etc. When the children are not given animal based food, their symptoms reduce. They are not agitative or repulsive. This helps in regulating their digestive system. This diet will prevent constipation in these children, which is a very huge concern. says Dr Achyuthan Eswar, a naturopathy doctor who recommends the above diet plan to children.Rejuvinates MoodThe belief that nature has healing powers inherent in it allows it to calm a child in seconds when doctors take hours trying to lull a child back to normalcy. The best healing therapies are the ones associated with nature. I was beginning to notice this in the elders of my household. They take great joy in helping out with the little things, say pealing peas out of the pod, picking out curry leaves. The smell rejuvunates them and they are instantly put in a fresh mood, says Radha Eswar at Artyplantz who is keen on spreading a sustainable economy.Skill DevelopmentA structured procedure is necessary to understand what a childs limitations are, whether they are hyper or hypo. The sensory part of the therapy helps in identifying the smell, texture of different substances. It is a very good form of exercise. It makes them very calm. We also encourages kids to identify different shrubs and plants, describe what plants give fruits and vegetables. In the long term, this can also become a form of skill development, says a parent who encourages horticultural therapy for autistic children.Improvised ApproachIf there are any barriers in learning, the method of approach is improvised. The physical hand-eye coordination for potting plants and watering them stimulates the sensory feeling in the body. It rejuvenate the child and keeps them participative. This form of therapy makes use of the fingers to do gardening which in ways is therapeutic. concedes another parent."

Rice, coconut, pepper, cashew and rubber form the backbone of Keralas rural economy and most of the small scale/marginal farmers in these sectors transact in cash.Even the workers of these rural economy section are paid their wages in cash. While the consumption pattern of common men is likely to get affected because of the cash crunch, the traders will also hesitate to buy crops - at least in the next quarter. As per the available statistics (2015), the production of rubber in Kerala was 6,48,220 tonnes, coconut -5921 and rice 564325.We used to buy coconut from farmers and they are paid after one to three months after getting the sales returns from the primary and value added products. But after the demonetisation drive, sales figures have started to dip. For instance, under the Palakkad Coconut Producers Company, there are 40 outlets across the state which sell primary products of coconut and value added products like Neera. Before demonetisation, our sales were `50,000 per day. For the last four days, the average sales per day was only `10,000. The demand for coconut oil too has dwindled. Under the prevailing circumstances, we will not be able to procure coconuts from the farmers, said Vinod Kumar P, CEO, Palakkad Coconut Producers Company.Agricultural Department of Kerala officials said paddy cultivation was showing a downward curve but they were expecting nearly 5 per cent growth in rubber and coconut production. Demonetisation has scuttled the progress, they said. Many of these farmers buy seeds, fertilisers and farm equipment in cash. They also pay their workers in cash and both sections will feel the heat."

For tonights meal, she and her two brothers and parents have half a roti each. Her father Babloo worries how he will arrange food tomorrow.Things began to go bad when the local stone crushing unit was shut down a few months ago due to legal tangles and Babloo and other labourers had to take up other jobs. Most of them enlisted as daily wage labourers under a contractor who paid them between Rs 500 and Rs 700. And then came demonetisation on Nov. 8. The contractor suddenly stopped work as he had no money to pay the labourers.More than 1.50 lakh labourers across Bundelkhand, particularly in and around Bharatkoop, are sitting idle. Many have left for other places in search of work, leaving behind their families.I used to earn about Rs 800 per day in the stone crushing unit. One day, it was abruptly closed. I was worried how I would feed my family. But luckily, all of us here were called by a contractor who took us in as daily wagers. But after demonetisation, the contractors told us they have no money to pay us, Babloo says.His wife, Rupa, takes up the story: For the last 15 days, I have been borrowing rice from my neighbours but now even they have run out of food. But demonetisation has shattered us completely. No one is bothered about our fate.A few metres from Babloos hut is the house of Dayaram where his family, his wife and two children stay. Dayaram left home in search of livelihood 10 days ago. The family is borrowing food from neighbours. He left home looking for work. I dont know when he will return. It is getting difficult to carry on with life. The children are going without food most days, says his wife, Munni.According to Suresh Kesarwani, the contractor, the going was smooth till demonetisation. Initially after Nov. 8 we managed to pay our labourers. But as the days passed, it became difficult to get cash. I had no other option but to stop work. All other contractors have done the same as despite making endless rounds of banks there was no money. I think the situation will continue like this for a few more months, he says.In Bharatkoop alone, there were over one lakh of labourers who earned their livelihood by working in the stone crushing units located there. They continue to stay there in the hope that the factories will start functioning soon. But then came demonetization, says another contractor, Neelkanth.A local BJP leader, Munna, told me that he and his fellow party workers are trying to do their bit for the labourers. We are talking to other contractors in Bundelkhand and asking them to employ these labourers. But not many are willing to go far, he said.Asked demonetisation, he trots out what senior BJP leaders have been saying to the nation: The situation will improve soon. Demonetisation is for the good of the people.In Banda district, some 50,000 labourers have been badly hit by demonetisation.Some have left for Lucknow, others for Allahabad, Varanasi, Meerut, Ghaziabad and Noida. Under the prevailing circumstances, Im unsure whether they can get jobs easily as no one has money to pay, says Shiv Prasad Sony, another contractor. He says that the government ought to have thought about the poor."

The koftas include nadru kofta, palak kofta, alubukhara kofta, mahi kofta, murgh phaldari kofta and kofte ka surkh salan.The palak anjeer kofta had a creamy texture. Bathed in a rich and thick consistent gravy, the kofta has a coating of anjeer, which gives a mild sweet taste. You get the milky taste of the curry and perhaps that subsides the bitter taste of the spinach.The non-vegetarians may like kofte ka surkh salan more than the vegetarian counterpart. The mutton kofta in the red gravy was like meatballs with flavour in every bite.All the kebabs and koftas were layered with oil drippings.

Every kind of fish was available. Our earnings were good,"" he told AFP.""When my father would go fishing he would bring back over a hundred kilos of fish. Now the situation has changed. The fish is extinct because of the bad water,"" he added.The wooden, flat-bottomed barge he lives in with his mother, wife, and their nine children, has ornate carvings but it has seen better days.Now Yusuf barely catches enough fish to feed his family, let alone be able to save the money he needs to maintain his boat.He estimates they have just five years before it is beyond repair, fearing he will soon have to leave the place where he was born.And yet their whole life is packed into this floating home: Clothes and linen are stacked in the stern, kitchenware and food under the prow. Cooking is done down in the hold, on a little earthen hearth fed by the stems of aquatic plants.""If it is hot we sleep on the roof, in the winter we sleep inside the boat on the floor,"" said Yusuf.Two cradles swing as the breeze softens the heat: the larger for his child born on board some 40 days ago, the smaller one for the Koran, a dignified place for the Holy Book to avoid desecration.Neighbouring boathouses are anchored a few dozen metres away. Children wade or swim in the shallows while adults navigate the water in narrow wooden canoes, which they skillfully push with a pole.""We have been living this way for generations,"" explained the fisherman.- Undrinkable -The size of Manchar Lake, one of the largest fresh water reserves in Pakistan, varies depending on rainfall. It can measure more than 250 square kilometres (100 square miles) after the annual monsoon.In the 1970s a series of drains and canals were built to carry sewage to the lake from several major cities in Sindh province, as well as industrial wastewater, and overflow from rice paddies full of pesticides and fertilisers.The system, known as the Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD), also dumps into the lake vast quantities of brackish water drained from the right bank of the Indus to make the surrounding land arable.Meanwhile, mountain torrents supplying fresh water have declined. So too has the flow of the Indus itself into the lake, due to the building of dams and greater irrigation, explains Mustafa Mirani of the Pakistani Fishermen Forum, which campaigns for the protection and conservation of the lake.As far back as the 1990s, assessments found the land and the water was being destroyed by a toxic mix of saline, chemicals and sewage, explains the activist, who grew up on the lake.It was then proposed to re-route the RBOD to empty into the Arabian Sea further south. But the plan has been suspended for years due to lack of funds, and dirty water continues to flow into the lake untreated and unabated.The water is no longer drinkable. The pollution has killed off flora and fauna and it has become impossible to grow vegetables in the toxic silt.Migrating birds, which once came in their thousands to rest among the reeds on the lake, are now rarely seen.Fish stock has also plummeted. In the 1970s, more than 15,000 tons were netted each year compared with 2,000-3,800 tons in recent years, according to the Sindh Fisheries Department.- Ruined beauty -The number of the Mohanna tribe living around the lake has halved in the last 25 years, according to Mirani.""When I was growing I saw some 400 boats and that many families on them. All of them, eating, sleeping, marrying, all would take place on the boats,"" he recalled.""Now, because of poverty, they can't mend or repair their boats. So gradually all these boats are vanishing.""There are now just four dozen floating homes left on the lake. But life on the shore is tough too.Their rudimentary villages are made from mud and have little sanitation.Saindad, a toothless sexagenerian, who now lives on the shore in a shabby reed cabin has had no source of income since his last boat sank.""We don't have water or any filtration facility. And no-one cares about us. We are so poor we don't even have cooking utensils or other essential things,"" he said.His sons left to look for work in neighbouring cities. Some of of the lake's inhabitants have taken to fishing the seas near Karachi or neighbouring Balochistan.The Pakistani Supreme Court took up the issue in 2010, but has failed to force government action.""This lake is gifted from God,"" sighs Mirani, ""but all its beauty has been ruined."""

Under the project, around 100 acres of paddy fields will be made cultivable.We are in the process of reviving the lost glory of Thottara Puncha which is infested with weeds.Preparatory works need to be carried out before kick-starting the project, including analysis of the soil condition. We have identified certain spots in the puncha for conducting a trial. While certain areas can be restored using tractor, tiller can be used for reviving some other areas. Work on the remaining area needs to be done manually, said the Collector during a visit to the area on Sunday.He was accompanied by the Principal Agricultural Officer, Amballur panchayat president and farmers.Though the UDF Government had initiated a similar project in 2014, it failed to take off. Representatives of Anbodu Kochi have expressed willingness to be part of the project.A meeting of farmers, panchayat officials and the agricultural officer will be held on Tuesday to chalk out the project plan. Our part in the project is only to make the land cultivable, and the rest will be done by farmers. We hope to complete the project by November 20, said the Collector, and directed the agricultural officer to submit estimate for the project, which requires extensive use of machinery."

One fine morning, executive chef Prakash Chettiyar and he headed to Kozhikode to unravel the magic that left many drooling. They visited the kitchens of Kozhikodes favourite and famous food haunts, tasting and learning the secrets.And, for those who want to have a taste of the treasure (read: handful of tasty tips), one can have it at the month-long Kozhikodan food festival, going on at Cassava, Kochi Marriott.We wanted to know why people thought the Kozhikodan variety was supreme. That was the whole motive behind the journey. It is not just about the biriyani, but other dishes like the fish curry, too. Undoubtedly, Kozhikode is a foodies haven. The journey in search of food gave us the first-hand experience, says Saji.He also learnt some valuable biriyani lessons: the first being the meat used. In chicken biriyani, the difference lay in the chicken used. The taste of Kozhikodan biriyani is the white leghorn breed. The meat is firm but very juicy. That makes a lot of difference, says the chef.Even the spices are minimal. There isnt an excess of flavours. The balance is perfect, says the chef, who has replicated the technique at Cassava, including the cooking method.Slow cooking is the key. It should be the heat that cooks, and not the flame. It takes over one hour and 40 minutes to prepare it, says the chef.Saji also speaks about how flavour overdrive can kill the taste. Meen Mulakittath is a famous Kozhikodan dish. They usually have it with porotta. The secret of the curry is that it is cooked using tomatoes for the sour taste. Unlike in other parts of Kerala, the people dont use tamarind. The advantage is the curry doesnt kill the taste of porotta. It is such subtle things that give the dish its authentic taste, says Saji.The food festival also features dishes like beef dry fry, chicken chukka and the Kuttichira-special chemeen charu.The people here are very innovative when it comes to food, says Saji. Try kozhikal, a vegetarian snack made of tapioca, besan, maida and rice flour, you will know how. Vegetarians can also try the koon pathiri (mushroom pathiri)."

However, now there would be a drop of 30-40 per cent in agriculture loans for farmers after the restrictions on transactions in the wake of demonetisation, he said.Though there is provision for the continuation of interest subvention by cooperative banks for short-term crop loans at 7 per cent, the farmers who had availed interest subvention scheme are likely to lose the three per cent subvention announced by the government this time, said Jose. He added that paddy farmers will be the most affected by demonetisation as 70 per cent of the agriculture loan extended to farmers was in paddy farming sector.Dr P Indira Devi, Head of Centre of Excellence in Environmental Economics, Kerala Agriculture University, said the cash crunch will certainly affect the farming activities and the farmers will be forced to tighten their purse strings in order to cut costs in the field in the absence of sufficient money to meet farming requirements.Though the State Government has announced a moratorium on repayment of loans given by cooperative credit institutions till March 31 next year, it is still not clear whether the farmers who availed the agriculture loans will get the benefit of interest subvention, she said.The department has already taken steps to cultivate rice in 2,567.82 hectares of fallow land in 11 districts. Rani, Chithira and Methrankayal and Aranmula paddy fields will be covered. Besides, the government is on a mission to raise the area under acreage of paddy from the current 1.94 lakh hectares to 3 lakh hectares, apart from the upland paddy cultivation to one lakh hectares in the state, over the next five years.The effect of the current financial crisis would be multiplied in the wake of truant rains, which were 34 per cent deficient during the south west monsoon period and 62 per cent deficient in north east monsoon, which is likely to open up a slew of issues in terms of plant health management and crop production, say experts."

I catch the delicate smell of boiled chana, sprinkled with coconut, and the sweet smell of rava (semolina) fried in ghee.Chef Gaurav Bathla, sous chef, says that he has tried to put one dish from every corner of the state into the buffet.Our meal starts with Kalu Palya, made of black chana. Lightly fried with onion and freshly grated coconut, the boiled-chana appetiser is a perfect way to start gorging on Kannada cuisine.Palyas such as Sabske Soppin Peda, dill leaves cooked with toor dal, and Balekayi Palya, raw banana shallow fried, is paired well with chapatti. Both the dishes  one mildly bitter and the other a little tangy  are something that most Kannadigas have grown up eating.The chef says that he got the recipes from Kannadiga friends. I learnt them from my friends mothers and grannies, who make these dishes regularly at home, he says. Little wonder then, that the fine-dining restaurant reminded me of my home kitchen.Chicken Curry is strictly for those who enjoy a spicy meal. The strong spices and the soft meat make it a must-have. To balance out the hotness, have it with roti.Mangaloreon Prawn Curry, with coconut, tamarind and red chillies, and Pandi Curry, pork cooked in tamarind water and spiced with pepper, are for people who like medium spiciness. Both the dishes are easy to bite into and melt in the mouth. Rice goes best with prawn curry and pork with roti.Mandya Mutton Curry, with ghee and coconut, is a bit bland for my taste but otherwise is a good dish to try.Vangi Bath, rice cooked with brinjal, tamarind and spices, is sweet, sour and spicy. All good here.Desserts such as Dharwad Mishra Peda, Rava Unde (laddoos made from semolina lightly fried with ghee), Ante Unde (made from different dry fruits) made for a perfect closing."

Thats how we have Moplah Food Festival happening at Aish, The Park which will be on till November 20.So what exactly is the new fetish about Moplah food? Its a region of North Kerala dominated by Muslim population who trace their roots to the Arabs as the latter came to the region for the trade of spices and silk. Talk about spices and the same reflects in the cuisine. Chef Abida Rasheed speaks amiably dropping abundant portions on our plates asking the stewards to bring more warm food. There was not command in her tone but affection that reflects in the dishes she so lovingly cooks. We enjoyed eating Mutton Ishtew that had the desired consistency, neither gooey nor sticky  just the right thickness that you can relish with Kerala Parota. The potatoes were succulent and dissolved with the curry, the mutton pieces were juicy and soft. The green coriander leaves just added the ghar ka khana bit. Food needs to be cooked in clay pots as the same give breathing space to your food which keeps your food fresh for a longer time, said the chef.Its not just clay pots that do the wonder, the use of ghee gives the food its own deliciously different taste thats how the mutton biryani she cooked turned out to be really different from what we eat in Hyderabad, Calcutta or Lucknow. The rice used wasnt the long-grained biryani rice, instead the grains were smaller and better known as Khaima rice. She describes, Earlier this rice used to grow in valleys and as the wind blew the crop became more fragrant. It cooks really well giving the biryani its unique texture.We relished Kozhi Nirachathu, pot roasted chicken with deep-fried onion gravy that had that subtle sweet flavour. Begum Abida added, We use spring chickens that dont weigh more than 400 gms. The bones of these chickens give that special flavour and taste to the curry.And not just these dishes there are a variety to be relished such as: Meen Porichattu, Vada with thenga manga chutney, Kadala Kari, Parupu Kari and more. It was the dessert which amazed us. The egg yolk and white had been separated and cooked differently. The egg white was steamed with sugar, while the yolk was whisked and dropped in loops in hot boiling sugar syrup which gave it noodle like shape and consistency. It was topped on the sweet steamed white. Any guesses for the name? Its that famous Mutta Mala people associated Moplah cuisine with.Price: `999 all inclusive for lunch and `1,495 all inclusive for dinner."

They need to be revived for the state to become self-reliant in agriculture, he said.Saying the government gave much importance to organic farming, which had now gained momentum in the state, Vijayan stressed on making the research findings of agricultural university to farmers.He also touched upon the problem of the state reeling under drought-like conditions despite having 48 rivers and several waterbodies and said, We get enough rain, but lose the water. We have to go for rain pits (recharge pits) to tap rainwater. Planting more trees is also essential.As part of the launch, Vijayan handed over rice seedlings to farmers at Kalatharakal ela in Kollayil. Farming is being taken up across 58 acres of paddy fields under the mission.Cooperation Minister Kadakampally Surendran, MLAs C K Hareendran, I B Satheesh and K Ansalan, District Panchayat president V K Madhu, noted singer K J Yesudas and actor Manju Warrier were present at the launch. In the first phase, preservation of water sources, would be taken up.Develop culture of cleanlinessOne of the focus of the mission was waste disposal, said Vijayan, adding that emphasis should be on waste disposal at source and households. Apart from this, a separate system for waste disposal at block and district levels will also be implemented. However, people should develop a culture of keeping their surroundings clean the same way they keep themselves and their houses clean, he said.Participation from allStating that Haritha Keralam was one of the important projects of Navakerala Mission, Vijayan exhorted everyone to take part in the drive, irrespective of political or religious affiliations."

The Education Department had inked an agreement with the foundation in this regard recently."

Welcome to Vyayama Shale, a place where bodybuilders, popularly known as pehelwans or pailwans, use traditional methods of physical exercise. However, they have now switched over to mats instead of muscling it in the mud.Back then body building was hot.With glitzy modern gyms being very popular now, can this once-cherished workout be cool again?It has no modern equipment nor complex exercise regimen. Yet, these exercise houses attract youngsters. Ask Nithin Nayak (19), studying PUC in Canara Pre-University College here. He says he was weighing 50kg last year and his attempt to build his body by practising at a modern gym was not helpful. His PT teacher suggested that he join a Vyayama Shale. He now weighs 75kg. He says he is bowled over by the discipline, dedication and devotion. Inspired by him, three of his classmates joined the same traditional gym.Nithesh Kumar Hegde, BE second semester student at Shri Devi College of Engineering, says he wanted to join a Vyayama Shale after watching a Kusthi tournament in Mangala Stadium. He says the traditional method not only keeps the body fit and supple but also serves as a stress-buster.The students at Veeranjaneya Gymnasium in Maripalla say they have shifted from a modern gym to a traditional one. Rakesh Bangera (20), who weighs 89kg, says that his exercise starts with a prayer to Lord Hanuman. He has also inspired seven of his friends to join the Vyayama Shale. Modern gymnasiums are helpful for building the body for a temporary period while the toned body at the Shale is permanent, he says.They say the workout builds the core strength and preserves youthful energy. They point to sprightly old men for proof.Seventy-two-year-old Thukrappa Poojary of Vittal can lift a 30kg wooden mace effortlessly. He won the title of Pailwan in 1958. Being a Talim artist who performed during the festivals of local temples, Poojary was trained under Narayana Master in Puttur. In his heydays, he was able to take three rice bags of 90kg as head load. His wife says that Pailwans of those days were held in high esteem by the people.Umesh Kotian, a wrestler, says the traditional style of body building is underlined by dedication. He says the fitness regimen used to be so good that his grandfather would anchor a fishing boat single-handedly.Thumbey-based Rathnakar Suvarna (65), another wrestler, says that the trainers are recognised as Ustads and there was a special kind of respect for them.These fitness rockers spent years and years of their lives focused on perfecting the human body through proper training and nutrition. These bodybuilding houses have started perking up with government supportand funds.Dakshina Kannada boasts of bodybuilders like Raymond Dsouza, Roshan Ferrao and Vincent Prakash Carlo, to name a few."

The camaraderie between them was famous.Castro narrated his experience in a media interview: The first person who came to see me was Prime Minister Nehru. I can never forget his magnificent gesture. I was 34 years of age, not widely known. I was tense. Nehru boosted my morale. My tension disappeared.Thereafter, in 1985, PM Rajiv Gandhi and in 2006, PM Manmohan Singh have visited Cuba. Castro himself visited India in 1973 and 1983, both times when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister.He had said, The maturity of India, its unconditional adherence to the principles which lay at the foundation of the Non-Aligned Movement give us the assurances that under the wise leadership of Indira Gandhi [the former Prime Minister of India], the non-aligned countries will continue advancing in their inalienable role as a bastion for peace, national independence and development""In fact the famous Castro hug for Indira Gandhi has now become one of the most memorable and well-publicised photographs in India-Cuba relations.The bread of India phrase is quite well-known in Cuba and one that Fidel Castro came up with. During 1992, India had provided Cuba with 10,000 tonnes of wheat and 10,000 tonnes of rice when Cuba was undergoing hardship due to an economic crisis brought about by US sanctions. Fidel Castro termed this donation from Delhi as the Bread of India, because it was sufficient for one loaf of bread for each one of the then Cuban population of eleven million people. At the same time, India had also provided donations worth two million US dollars during the Cuban earthquake.Cuba has also repeatedly supported India's candidature as a permanent member on a reformed Security Council at the United Nations, and India had always pushed for lifting of US sanctions against the socialist nation."

The Chef Armando Di Filippo says that if there are no breads, theres no tables in Italy.To serve a global favourite  pizza  Movenpick has crafted Italy on your Platter. There are Italian herbs and flavours, luscious cheese and array of toppings to spoil your choice.The Italian chef says that the charm of a pizza doesnt only lie in the myriad toppings but starts with the dough and the base.Chef Aramando says, Pizza is also considered a bread in Italy. Several decades ago, with no bakeries, families in Italy used to bake breads at home. Bread is a must on the menu.The dining begins with a welcome watermelon drink. The starters consist of Bread Sticks, Baked Zucchini, Aranchini and Bruschetta. The platter is simple yet appealing.The round Aranchini, made of rice is crunchy outside and creamy inside. There are breads in different shapes and sizes too. The Bruschetta is said to complement many dishes. The bread is topped with fresh chopped tomatoes and sprinkled with salt and pepper which helps draw out the tomato juice. The sweet and tart flavours magically blend in your mouth. Even people who dont care much for tomatoes will be tempted to have a bite.The slice of Zucchini is baked with ricotta cheese and mixed with veggies, lending it a fresh flavour and creamy texture. The pizzas on the menu are with a thin crust and named after different places in Rome. The Trinita Dei Monti is named after the church in Italy. The velvety ricotta cheese lends it a sweetness. The asparagus topped on the light pizza base is crunchy.The Colosseo Pizza is topped with cheese and crushed black pepper. More the black pepper, better the taste. In Quirinale, cream of broccoli, you can get the raw and bitter taste of the florets.The Pincio is unique. Topped with thin slices of ham, decorated with figs, they are perfect to romance with this monsoon. These pizzas pair well with the beer, which is also served.The Aventino  Allarrabbiata is served with penne pasta. The arrabbiata sauce makes it spicy. The base is as usual crispy topped with fine cheese. It is a treat for the pasta lovers.No menu is complete without a dessert. Pannacotta, the cooked cream topped with berries, tastes like custard.The best bit is that the pizzas dont stuff you. They are light and you can taste the toppings, unlike the others that are usually smothered with cheese."

Dana Majhi does not. After two weeks of media inquiry, hes had it. Like Sania Mirza in her post-match pressers, he reels off the data in a rat-a-tat-tat manner. Hes a man in grief, has three daughters to care for and a life to pick up. What kind of stardom is that anyway if a poor mans grief-laden trudge on a country road is what it takes to remind a nation of its superpower poverty? Dana Majhi has reminded India that we used to know a woman called Phanas Punji in the 1980s. She was the Dana Majhi of Kalahandi in the Rajiv Gandhi years. Some websites still remember her as the poster woman of poverty, underlining our acute need for posters and photographs of women with lines of want and need on their faces.It was 1984 and Rajiv Gandhi was in the throes of making a difference, that decades code for achche din. Phanas Punji was found selling her 14-year-old sister-in-law Banita for Rs 40 and a saree. Her tale of destitution set against the grand theatre of the Kalahandi-Balangir-Koraput (KBK) region provided the nation an opportunity for self-flagellation and brought the Prime Minister down to this nether world for a photo op. In the present Dana Majhi saga, Phanas Punji is the flashback. She is now 55 years old and lives in Amlapali, now in Nuapada district which was carved out of Kalahandi in 1993.But she isnt pleased to be remembered. She bristles at any stranger bearing even the faintest resemblance of a journalist or cameraman who might approach her. Go away. You guys take my pictures and sell them for a price while I continue to wallow in poverty, she says.Phanas lives in a house on the same Khariar-Kantabanjhi road where she was found hawking her sister-in-law back then. Its a pucca house, built with money given to her under Odishas Mo Kudia Yojna. But her family has grown to six - son, daughter-in-law, their three children plus herself - and its a bit cramped.Her old ramshackle hut still stands on the lot.Shes a cook at the local anganwadi and it pays Rs 2,000. But then, payments have not come for the last five months. Son Jagabandhu tills the small 2.25 acre patch of land left behind by his father but back-to-back droughts have killed his hope. He is yet to receive his agricultural input subsidy of Rs 6,800 for the loss of last years kharif crop.This year, Nuapada has notched up a 22 per cent rainfall deficit. His application for a bore-well is pending with the local administration. The going is not good. In his thirties, Jagabandhu has grown philosophical. I faintly remember being held up by the Prime Minister. It was a long time ago. My mother hoped things would change for better but they didnt, he says.Jagabandhu had to drop out of school after Class V as hopes of government support faded. The Punji family became overnight poverty celebs but things only got worse.Joining the conversation sullenly, Phanas pours out her bile. People got jealous of us and we were virtually cast out of the neighbourhood in Amlapali, she says. Her husband had never been around, and after the poverty tourists went home, she became the sole bread-earner of the family.The nations pity and the neighbours envy made things worse. A tubewell was promised and she applied for it. The papers were issued but someone cleverly hijacked it. I asked and the authorities said the bore-well was for me but I never got it. I still dont have one, she says.Jagabandhu and his wife Chanchala are working towards getting a motor pump. If they raise Rs 30,000 the government will give a likely subsidy and the pump is theirs. The wife and he decided to save their NREGS wages and theyve raked together Rs 4000 so far. I dont think we can ever manage Rs 30,000, says Jagabandhu with a wry smile.Nuapada is one of the poorest districts in Odisha. At least 83 per cent of the families here live below the poverty line. Of them, over 50 per cent are tagged very poor, earning barely Rs 6,000 a year. Perennially drought-hit, Nuapada, Kalahandi and Balangir are witness to migration by the thousands every year. Phanas and her son have been spared that fate till now.The latest district gazetteer calculates that one year of drought pushes the poor of Nuapada into 10 years of indebtedness. Even in a good year, a social function could deplete all of a familys reserves and leave it in a food deficit.The annual festivals are always a worry. Nuakhai, the biggest festival of western Odisha, is now here. It has to be celebrated with good food and new clothes to welcome the new rice of the season but for Phanas and Jagabandhu, it will be a just another day of struggle.From mother to son, a generation has passed and the faces have changed on the posters. From Phanas Punji to Dana Majhi, this is Kalahandi reinventing itself, trying to make itself interesting to a nation that sends 65 satellites into space all at once."

Union Minister for Human Resources Development (HRD) Prakash Javdekar, who is also party in-charge for Manipur, claimed that like the former Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi his Manipur counterpart Okram Ibobi Singh too is running into high anti-incumbency factor.The situations in Manipur are same as had been in Assam before the BJP wrested power from the Congress. Like Tarun Gogoi, Ibobi Singh too has been the chief minister of Manipur for almost 15 years after having come to power in 2002. The people there are keen for a change in the government, said Javdekar.The BJP is gearing up to launch a massive electoral campaign in Manipur, with a large number of Union Ministers set to visit the North-eastern state. The BJP currently has two MLAs, but has been successful in attracting two ministers and Congress leaders from the Ibobi Singh camp. Incidentally, the BJP had got a shot in the arms in the run up to the Assam polls after the senior state Congress leader Hemant Bisse Sharma joined the saffron party.Javdekar said that the BJP has been able to get leaders like Sharma in Manipur too, who can help the party come to power. The BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav has also been focussing on Manipur in the bid to further expand the party footprint in the North-east.Recent developments in Manipur have made people amenable to the BJP. Rice distributede through the public distribution system is now available at Rs 3 a kg, while the LPG cylinder are being delivered to the consumers at the normal price without any delay. These two developments have addressed the main concerns of the people there, added Javdekar.Manipur is heading to Assembly elections in January next year."

The country cannot go into cashless mode simply by the PMs declaration. The decision has adversely affected agriculture and commercial sectors, he added.He also lashed out at CPM, saying the UDF did not require its certificate to fight BJP. He was referring to the accusation by state Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac, who had accused Chennithala of having the same stand as BJP, after he allegedly backtracked from a joint agitation with the CPM against the Centre.Ration distributionChennithala also demanded additional rice distribution to the state in wake of the currency crisis. The UDF leaders alleged that ration distribution in Kerala had been disrupted under LDF regime.Ration distribution was effective during UDFs rule. The Oommen Chandy-led government also procured additional ration share to the state from the Centre. However, the Pinarayi Government has brought people to the brink of poverty, alleged Chennithala, adding that the state government had failed to initiate steps to restore ration distribution, since it was disrupted last October.Demanding immediate steps to resolve the crisis cause by demonetisation, UDF on Monday announced it would stage a sit-in of its MPS and MLAs at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi, on December 14.

58fd9d687be9e012bf2845e6,The African children tortured for being 'witches',http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2016/aug/06/The-African-children-tortured-for-being-witches-1506117.html,2016-08-06,"In Montserrado County, the witches come out on Wednesdays. They come - some more willingly than others - from all across the county, indeed from every corner of Liberia, to Pastor John Carr's church, the Healing Temple of Christ.Outside the narrow tin-roofed building, aid agencies' pickups race each other along shoddy roads. Their drivers dodge men on motorbikes, girls hawking watermelons and the torrents of brown water unleashed by the constant downpour.Inside, villagers take their places on a handful of pews or the couple of dozen plastic chairs. When newcomers arrive, inquiring eyes appraise them.Are they here to confess?As the pastor told me one recent Wednesday, this is a deliverance ministry, one of several in Liberia (just up the road a sign advertises another, the Victory of Fire Healing and Deliverance Ministry). Every month or so, a ""witch"" will be brought here by their parents, ready to be delivered from evil.The child stands beside the pastor at the front, facing the entire congregation. Then the questioning begins. ""First of all, we ask their parents 'what is happening?'"" said the pastor, explaining that the ""witches"" are often 12 or 13: sometimes older, sometimes even younger.""Then we will ask them 'what are you doing? What are you saying?'"" Some are ready to talk right away; others protest their innocence. Either way, any member of the congregation is free to take part in the probing: they may ask the child whatever they wish. There is no levity about the occasion; the accusations are a grave matter. Asked that day if they believed in witches, more than half the congregation raised their hands.""Yes, yes!"" some of them chorused.One time, a mother brought her 17-year-old daughter here, saying she had been a witch since the age of five. Her daughter's special powers, she said, were to blame for her divorce. Another time, a child confessed she had been initiated into a witchcraft society by her grandmother. Together, she said, they drank blood in the ""dark world"".Once the questions are exhausted, the congregation joins the pastor to pray for the child. Of course, he acknowledged, the experience can make the children ""nervous - they can be afraid"". Still, he said, it was worth it.""They don't want to die in their sin. That's the reason they confess their sin even though they are children... Every knee shall bow, every tongue shall confess when they hear the word of God.""From Salem to 'sassywood'The notorious witch trials that convulsed Salem in the late 17th century conformed to a stereotype that was well-established even then: the majority of those who were hanged were women, often elderly. The victims - to begin with, Betty Parris, 9, and Abigail Williams, 11, both struck down by ""fits"" - were children.These days, the accused are young as well as old. A 2010 report by Unicef concluded that in several central African countries there is ""a growing and recent phenomenon in urban areas of witchcraft accusations against children and adolescents"".In a small number of cases, such beliefs have spread to Britain. Probably the most high profile instance was the murder of eight-year-old Victoria Climbie in 2000, who died after prolonged abuse by guardians who believed she was possessed by spirits. Last year, Scotland Yard dealt with 73 reported instances of child abuse linked to witchcraft, a sharp increase from nine instances in 2011. In some cases, children were being ill-treated here; in others, they were sent for deliverance ceremonies in Africa.In Liberia, belief in witchcraft is far less unusual: according to Lovely Sie, advocacy and child protection manager at Save The Children in Liberia, the labelling of children as witches has become ""commonplace"". The taboos around the subject mean it is under-reported; between 2012 and 2015, the United Nations recorded cases where at least 214 people were accused of witchcraft, but the true figure is likely to be far higher.As recently as 2008, the Liberian Ministry of Internal Affairs employed traditional practitioners of sassywood, a form of trial by ordeal used to extract confessions from suspected witches that can include placing red-hot metal on their skin.Sassywood and witch doctors are now banned. Today, the ministry encourages Liberians accused of witchcraft to sue for the damage to their reputations. Yet ""traditional doctors"" and pastors dealing in deliverance continue to thrive.""When I was growing up, you would hear of it mostly in rural communities,"" said Ms Sie. ""But in contemporary Liberia, you hear of witchcraft everywhere. It is a growing problem."" Some, like John Carr, merely offer prayers for deliverance. Others subject the suspects to ""cleansing"" rituals: they can be forced to retrieve a pebble from a pot of hot oil or to have chilli pepper rubbed into their orifices. According to Marcel Akpovo, chief of human rights and protection for the United Nations mission in Liberia, who recently wrote a report on witchcraft accusations, ""what we saw in many cases may amount to torture"".Tamba Taylor still bears the scars. The long, deep marks on the 11-year-old's wrists and arms are only the most visible signs of the torment he suffered after he was labelled a witch. As he spoke about the treatment he endured, sitting in a corner of the Monrovian mechanics' yard where his father, Titus, works, he repeatedly scraped his nails. When his father spoke, he put his head down, eventually resting it on his arm.As teenagers ferried parts across the dirt to a dozen smashed-up cars behind him, Mr Taylor told how his son had been abused for six months in the church where he took him when he suspected him of being a witch.Tamba took up the story, explaining that he was fed a small portion of rice a day and slept on the floor. When he refused to confess, he was threatened with molten plastic or a razor blade. ""One day when they tied my hands and lit a fire outside the church and tried to put my hands in the fire,"" he said.Mr Taylor knew his son was suffering but could not easily remove him from the church: his landlord was too afraid to let Tamba in her house. If they moved elsewhere, he said, the stigma would surely follow. One day, though, he saw people at the church rubbing chilli into his son's eyes, and finally decided he must do something.When I meet him seven months later, Tamba was sleeping in the mechanics' yard, choosing a different car for a bed each night. Though Mr Taylor agreed the church had gone about it the wrong way, he still believed Tamba needed to be ""delivered"": He was saving up to buy olive oil for a more traditional ceremony.By September, he said he hoped that Tamba might even return to school: ""That's my prayer. But it depends on my child - whether he is willing for the process to happen. It might take a longer time.""The child scapegoatsThere are many reasons a child might be called a witch. Sometimes, it is because he or she is born with a disability or wets the bed. Often, though, they are blamed for some misfortune that befalls their family: a father who loses his job, a relative who suffers an untimely death. In Liberia, there is plenty of misfortune to go around. Founded in 1822 as a haven for freed slaves, it has often proven anything but. Up to 250,000 Liberians are thought to have died in the civil wars at the end of the last century; thousands were mutilated or raped. The former president, Charles Taylor, who is now imprisoned in a British jail, led child soldiers into battle.Then came Ebola. The disease killed more than 4,000 Liberians, and some in the country attributed the outbreak to witchcraft. Will Pooley, the British nurse who caught the disease while working in a hospital in neighbouring Sierra Leone, has said even some of his colleagues shared this belief. ""All the people I worked with, educated people with degrees, believed in witchcraft,"" he said. ""Some thought Ebola was caused by supernatural forces.""The war, and the threat from Ebola, is over, but the effects are still being felt. Children are often brought up by distant relatives; poverty and unemployment are common. A 2008 study by members of the American Medical Association, found that 44 per cent of adults display symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.Not that children are only on the hook for death or disease; they can be blamed for relatively trivial matters. Tamba was first implicated when belongings went missing at his school and at home. His family called in a witch doctor. ""The witch doctor told us that the whole place was enclosed by the spiritual world,"" said Tamba's father. ""The demon had taken possession of the place."" One pastor called a teenager girl a witch after her mother struggled to find a boyfriend. When the girl would not confess, her mother began whipping her.An hour's drive from the yard where Tamba worked, Confidence Dweh, who is nine, lives with her much older cousin, Eleanor Bondo, who looks after 14 children, including five of her own. Confidence was sent by her mother to live there so she could be closer to school. Soon after she arrived, though, Mrs Bondo's three-month-old baby fell ill. Mrs Bondo summoned a witch doctor, who picked out Confidence and another of the children. ""It made me feel bad,"" said Confidence. ""They used to call me 'witch'.""Muddle at the ministryA narrow two-storey building in central Monrovia makes up the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In the car park, a hawker stood beneath a parasol, selling mobile phone vouchers. Inside, Ishmael Walker, liaison for culture and custom, sat behind a desk beside a typewriter and a large map of Liberia. He pointed towards a sign on his office wall: STOP STOP STOP, it began.Mr Walker is responsible for putting an end to all manner of what he terms ""negative cultural practices"". The sign went on to list some of these: child labour, beating your wife, trial by ordeal - and sassywood. ""Way back there were some people here that used to investigate witchcraft,"" said Mr Walker, referring to the ministry itself. ""We used our traditional method.""In those days, if you used to come to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this sassywood was hot water, needle, put it on the fire, put it on your foot. It would be very, very hot and they would put it there."" Now, he said, ""we don't do it anymore - the section that was here for that has been closed. These are traditional practices that are harmful and we are trying to call it out."" Even so, he said, ""we hear plenty of it"". About once a week, he said, someone comes in hoping to accuse a suspect. ""We give them government information that we don't investigate witchcraft and you don't accuse anyone of being a witch."" He said his ministry kept a register of more than 100 traditional doctors or ""herbalists"". They are not allowed to deal in deliverance or eliciting confessions, but they can use herbal remedies to treat ailments, such as back pain or malaria.If any of these doctors were found to be investigating witchcraft, he said, they would be struck off. ""Maybe we confiscate your licence, tell you not to practise for one or two years."" He was asked how many licences had been confiscated. ""So many licences we have taken from people."" Yet, seated beside him, David Free, a senior cultural inspector for 18 years, did not seem so sure. Asked how many licences he has confiscated, he said he had never ""had any case like that"".Not one in 18 years? ""Not yet.""To lesser or greater extents, the government itself, the UN and charities are working to prevent children being accused, and to help those who have been. After Save The Children heard about Tamba, they stepped in: he now lives with his aunt, has been given psychological and medical support and should return to school this year.Yet, according to Lovely Sie, the Save the Children worker, ""a lot of people are not even aware of the laws"". ""If people do not change their perceptions and their attitudes, the laws are not going to make any difference."" For now, the stigma endures. Mrs Bondo's baby recovered and a year has passed since Confidence was ""healed"" by a traditional doctor in a ceremony that cost Mrs Bondo two weeks' wages, yet the family's reputation remains tarnished.""It causes a lot of confusion and hatred,"" she said. ""People look at me as being associated with children who are witches."" She said her business had suffered as customers feared being linked to her family; Confidence and her nephew, who was also accused, were still not allowed into their friends' houses. ""Other children refer to them as witches, laugh at them and make fun of them."" As her cousin spoke, Confidence kept her head down. She looked at the floor or at a chair, anywhere but at another pair of inquiring eyes. When it was her turn to talk, she whispered her answers to an interpreter, then dried up entirely. Shame still gripped her, its power greater than any curse.Names of children and their relatives have been changed."

Asha and several others say that if they go to the toilet during their working hours, between 6 am and 1 pm, it would be too risky.We work in a slum and in case we want to use the bathroom, we have to either knock on the doors of people in the slum or walk 15 minutes to the Sulabh Complex. People dont entertain us if we ask them for water. You think they will let us use their bathroom? laughed Sunitha, another contract employee.They use the only option available and walk up to the Sulabh Complex.If a supervisor comes to inspect at the time and doesnt see us on duty, he is likely to mark us absent. That means we lose Rs 350. Sometimes, they understand that we have no other option and hence ask us to be cautious. In case some superior comes for an inspection, then we will be in trouble. They could even sack us, shared Asha.Several others, like Asha and Sunitha who are among the 17,000 outsourced sweepers and 3,366 permanent sweepers, manually cleaning 7,862 kms in GHMC limits, shared that their lives are left hanging in the balance.It starts with their pay which is a meagre Rs 10,300. Women sweepers and several other sanitation workers attended the workshop, Amplifying the voices, water and sanitation for sanitation workers conducted by the NGO Association for Social Action in the city on Thursday.Our monthly salary is Rs 12,000. Some amount goes into the Provident Fund. Only a year ago we received the ESI health card and some of the money goes into it. We spend Rs 3,000 at least every month to travel 25 km from our home to the work place, said Malathi, another employee, adding that the salary is credited on time, every month.It is just that we dont have much left by the end of it. Not to forget, in case we take a leave, we lose `350 per day, she said.Most of the employees stay at least 20 km away from their work place, change buses and walk for many kilometres to reach their destination.We somehow reach on time for duty. We are there by 6 am. While going back home, it often takes more than two hours, shared Asha. While on duty, besides dealing with their toilet breaks, these women also have to endure the harsh working conditions. We have no masks or gloves. We dont have anything to cover ourselves with in the chilly mornings. We pack rice from the previous night. We are lucky if it doesnt go bad by 12 pm, shared Malathi.All of these women have served 19 years as contract employees and hope that their jobs are made permanent. They can fire us whenever they feel like. Permanent employees earn close to `55,000 and also have all the benefits, she said, lost in thought and Malathi added, No one will know if we die."

But India is continuing cooperation on connectivity and economic issues all the SAARC members who are also part of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) that will be invited to the BRICS (Bangladesh Russia India China South Africa) Summit as part of the outreach program.Asked what steps are being taken that Afghanistan is not left out of the economic connectivity in the region, Secretary (Economic Relations) in the Ministry of External Affairs Amar Sinha said: Chahbahar (port in Iran) is our way forward. President Ashraf Ghani talked about the air corridor we wish to establish through Kabul and Qandahar.The Secretary without naming Pakistan added that in terms of isolation a country that has closed its borders with two neighbors is the one isolated in the region. . in terms of isolation, you have to see who is isolated because ultimately isolation is not just geographic it is also a mentality. If any country decides to shut its only two borders it has with both the neighbors, I think that country is the most isolated, Sinha said. Pakistan has refused to allow passage to Indian rice to land-locked Afghanistan. Recently Pakistan also refused transit to Afghanistans horticulture products.Besides economic connectivity, the issue of terrorism will be at the forefront of the BRICS Summit on October 16 to be attended by all the Heads of the States. Even though India will not be taking the issue of Chinas blocking Indias attempt to get Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) Chief Masood Azhar blacklisted with President Xi Jinping bilaterally, the supply of arms and ammunition to terrorist will be the focus. ""At NSA-level meet (of BRICS countries), we have also actually shifted the goalpost a little by talking about not only sources of finances but also sources from where they (terrorists) get arms and ammunition. These will be reflected in the BRICS discussions,"" Sinha added.Strong statements from the member countries can be expected at the end of the summit on ending the differential policy towards good and bad terrorist.

Aid agencies had warned of the risk of starvation for the remaining 300,000 residents, who have been surviving on mostly rice and lentils.Civilians still remained trapped on Sunday however, as the road, under regular attack, was not yet safe enough for them to use.""The Great Battle for Aleppo"", as the opposition has dubbed it, saw an unprecedented alliance of around 10,000 rebels, Islamists, and jihadists fighting regime troops for control of the city's southern suburbs.Much of the manpower came from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) - until recently known as the Nusra Front and affiliated with al-Qaeda - which brought in reinforcements from its various strongholds across the country.Footage released by the group showed fighters from inside the city linking up with others on the outskirts after they managed to overrun the government's military complex in the Ramussa district, seizing huge caches of weapons.Mostafa Mahamed, a commander with JFS, tweeted news of the victory late on Saturday: ""When we unite, (President Bashar) Assad won't stand a chance.""Since the start of the offensive a week ago more than 700 fighters from both sides have been killed, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Most have been suffered by the rebel side, which has been bombarded by Russian air strikes.The news of the liberation was met with euphoric scenes on the streets of eastern Aleppo. But celebrations were short-lived after regime warplanes began pounding the city in retaliation.Doctors at the Omar bin Abdulaziz hospital told The Daily Telegraph patients and staff took cover in the basement for most of night.""Everyone is staying in the safest room,"" said Dr Fatima AlMousalem, whose hospital has been targeted several times in recent weeks. ""We expected this bloody attack from the Assad regime. It happens every time they lose ground.""The defeat is a crushing one for Assad's government, which sees Aleppo as the prize in the civil war.Both sides have thrown everything they have at the battle for the city, as each believes its fate will decide the outcome of the conflict.But the beleaguered Syrian army has become increasingly reliant on air support from Russia, and on Afghan recruits and troops from the Lebanese Shia militia Hizbollah, on the ground.The rebel advance now endangers a major highway linking the government-controlled part of Aleppo to the outside world, leaving an estimated population of 1.2 million at risk of losing a supply line.Families in the western districts late on Saturday rushed to buy any food and drink left in preparation for shortages.Eastern Aleppo is mainly controlled by US-backed Free Syrian Army fighters. Some in the opposition camp were uneasy about Islamists taking the lead in the battle.""People love Nusra now they liberated the city, but they do not represent us,"" said activist Ahmad al-Abdullah, who was wary about the jihadists' intentions for Aleppo.But the president of the Syrian National Council, an umbrella opposition group, hinted at the need for further cooperation among the ""revolutionary forces"".Any such move would complicate matters for the US, which has been trying to reach a deal with Russia to jointly target jihadist forces while sparing non-jihadist groups.""This is the final blow to the initial US policy meant to support the moderate opposition in Syria,"" Michael Horowitz, analyst at the Levantine Group, told the Telegraph. ""Residents of Aleppo will, unfortunately, always remember that America did nothing to help, and that it is eventually the armed opposition that saved them."""

A growing breed of youngstersarmed with professional degrees and successful enterprisesare proving that their degrees are assets out in the field. From using lessons in mechanical engineering to mechanise farms and creating e-commerce websites to sell organic farm produce, these youngsters are proving that careers can be created away from the confines of a cubicle.Your creations on the computer are intangible. When it comes to agriculture, you can touch, feel, smell and taste your creations, and even share your outputs with your loved ones. I believe this school of thought is urging youngsters to take up farming, says Mathew Sebastian, a veteran agriculturist and co-founder of the farm-certifying agency, INDOCERT, elaborating,Currently, the biggest hurdles to agriculture are lack of access to markets, real-time information, and middlemen who rig markets to their convenience. Now young agriculturists have opened online market places (think Farming Colors, Farmers FZ and Ente Krishi), which are supplying farm produce directly to households and cutting out middle men. Queries on agricultural practices, too, are easily clarified on Whatsapp groups like Kaarshiga Rengam (details: 9447001122). These individuals are poised to change the face of agricultural commerce in the coming years.Pradeep P SChief profession: PHP developerAgricultural land hold: Six acresProduces: Tapioca, ladies finger,red banana, bitter gourdThe monotony of working full-time as a web developer and the thirst to find a larger market for the agricultural produce from his household in Mala, Thrissur, motivated this 26-year-old to take the shovel. My father grew vegetables in our backyard. Once, when he tried to sell 200 kg of bottle gourd in the market, he was offered `1 for a kg. This really disturbed me. I vowed to create something that would take our farm produce directly to households, where it would be appreciated. Thus was born the online store and app FarmersFZ last year, which now serves close to 4,000 customers, says Pradeep, who skips chemical fertilisers and adds cowdung to his crops for its essential micro nutrients. Apart from attaining self-sufficiency in the future, I want to fuse agriculture and technology, and create AgroIT careers, adds Pradeep, who engages in the end-to-end process on his farm.Details: farmersfz.comRanjith ChittethChief profession: MachinistAgricultural land hold: 26 acresProduces: Tomatoes, hybrid redchillies, brinjals, snake gourdA precision tool maker by profession, Chitteths love for tractors and farming equipment brought him to the farm. Applying his expertise on the field, the 37-year-old developed precision farming methods in his farm at Ashtamichira, Thrissur, by introducing drip irrigation, hybrid seeds and farm mechanisationall of which greatly reduced water consumption and wastage, and recently earned him an accolade from the Kerala Government: Best Young Farmer. I used simple plastic sheets for mulching, which increased the moisture content of the soil and water retention. I also skipped the heavily-built high power consuming tractors in the local market and opted for the smaller Japanese Kuboto tractor and customised it with multiple attachments, which could pluck weeds and till the soil, says Chitteth, who keeps tab of the latest technologies in agriculture on the Haifa Chemicals website (aifa-group.com) and Tamil Nadu Agricultural Universitys e-learning portal (tnau.ac.in/eagri). Only after researching online did I realis our soil was acidic, compared to the alkaline-rich soil in Tamil Nadu, which gives more yields. I am aware about the benefits of going organic, but going completely organic will reduce 70 per cent of my output and the projected market for organic produce is hyped, too, so I will stick with using pesticides responsibly, adds Chitteth.

Though their NRI father has invited them to the Gulf, the youngsters chose to remain in their home town, North Paravur, working on their familys farmland. We now farm pokkali rice and coconuts (organically). We also farm prawns. From adopting a simple litmus test, learned in school chemistry classes, to test acidity content in the waters, to accessing YouTube farming channels like Ag Proud and emailing agricultural societies around the world, we have an upper hand when it comes to farming practices, says the elder Vineeth, who entirely mechanised their farming operations, devised a strategy to yield multiple crops post harvest and use something as simple aspeanut fodder for increasing soil nutrients the organic way.Details: facebook.com/noshhausDigol ThomasChief profession: Interior designerAgricultural land hold: 25 centsProduces: English cucumber, capsicum, musk melon, bitter gourdWhen the 2009 recession hit, 37-year-old Digol Thomas realised it would be wise to rely on ones backyard rather than some unforeseen global economic forces. This marked the engineering graduates venture into farming at Manathavadi, Wayand. I started out with bitter gourd, which is relatively easily to cultivate. Initially, a few of my bitter gourds wilted, and every one opined it was a nematode attack (a soil-bourne plant disease). But I posted pictures of the vegetables on Facebook and some farmers hinted it maybe an iron and magnesium deficiency. Digging up the roots confirmed the same and I was able to salvage the situation with basic manure, says Thomas, who now specialises in identifying plant diseases under the brand name, Avani.Details: facebook.com/avaniagrofarm"

Successive international attempts to find a peaceful resolution have failed.De Mistura said he opened his talks with Muallem by ""expressing serious concern and indeed shared the general international outrage for the news coming from eastern Aleppo"".Muallem said he had rejected a proposal for a truce deal that would recognise an autonomous rebel administration in east Aleppo.De Mistura has recently floated a proposal to halt fighting in the city, under which jihadist forces would leave and the government would recognise the opposition administration in the east.But Muallem said that was a non-starter.""We told him that we reject that completely,"" he said. ""How is it possible that the UN wants to reward terrorists?""The regime offensive has forced the closure of hospitals and schools, destroyed rescue worker facilities and left residents cowering in their homes.US National Security Advisor Susan Rice said Washington condemned ""in the strongest terms these horrific attacks against medical infrastructure and humanitarian aid workers"".""The Syrian regime and its allies, Russia in particular, bears responsibility for the immediate and long-term consequences these actions have caused in Syria and beyond.""Moscow intervened militarily in support of President Bashar al-Assad's government last year.It says it is not involved in the current assault on Aleppo, concentrating its firepower on opposition and jihadist forces in neighbouring Idlib province instead.But Damascus and its allies have made clear they want rebels expelled from eastern Aleppo, which fell from regime control in mid-2012.Family of six killedMore than 250,000 people remain in eastern Aleppo, which has been sealed off since government forces surrounded it in mid-July.No aid has entered the east since then, and the siege has created food and fuel shortages.In mid-October, Russia said it was halting its strikes on Aleppo, and organised a series of brief ceasefires intended to encourage civilians and surrendering rebels to evacuate the east.But few did so, and the UN said the short windows were insufficient for it to secure security guarantees for aid deliveries or evacuations.The renewed bombing has particularly affected medical and rescue facilities in the east, and shelling on Friday destroyed one of the last hospitals in rebel-held Aleppo.Staff were also forced to evacuate the east's only children's hospital because of repeated attacks.Among those killed in bombing on Saturday were a couple and their four children who died in a barrel bomb attack in the Sakhur neighbourhood, the Observatory said.Activists circulated footage that they said showed the four siblings lying lifeless on a stone floor."

Theres no debate to egg on here. But try it the way the food loving populace of Singapore does iton everything from macarons to ice creamand its hardly a breakfast story anymore. If you havent heard of this trendy culinary excess, the salted egg yolk is a sweet and savoury golden sauce made of brined duck eggs, which has become something of a Singapore staple this past year.So, of course, when I got the call to fly to the Lion City, the Merlion statue was the farthest thing from my mind. Instead, I found myself plotting a missionto hunt down as many salted yolk delights as possible. Imagine my joy when, as I board our Scoot plane, I notice that it has the largest splash of yellow you will ever see at an airport. Clearly the Universe was giving me a go ahead.Bulls eye beginningsHours after landing, I get my first runny yolk on the trip. An old-school bulls eye at the brand new Ibis Styles Singapore on MacPherson Road. As I swipe into my gorgeous room for the next couple of days, with a spectacular view of the pool below and ruler-straight traffic lines further in the distance, for a moment (a teeny one) the poke of the egg yolk takes a back seat. Our guide thinks it appropriate that our first stop be a place close to home, Little India. Bollywood tunes blare, cell phone shops boast names like MGR Mobiles and gold jewellery showrooms are everywhere. No yolks, but its ok. As Mr Incredible says in the beginning of that movie, Ive got time. Four days to be precise.Hawking crab masalaI am sure I will find the answer to my yolk cravings at the Tekka Hawker Centre where we head for lunch. But after not one but two walk arounds that throw up everything from goose and duck rice to South Indian meals with crab masala served on a banana leaf, it is evident Ill have to reroute my craving to something more traditionally local. So we settle for a delicious bowlful of laksa and chicken rice with chilled soy milk to wash it down.Rose blossoms for teaHeavy lunches call for a nap or a walk after. We pick the latter, to make the most of our trip, and end up on Haji Lane, home to indie designer stores, graffiti walls and adorable little cafs. We head into one called Shop Wonderland that has dried flowers on the walls, which also seems to inspire their patisserie selection. Dessert is a delectable slice of rose blossom cake with raspberry icing. As I polish this off, I feed my yolk obsession by asking the girl at the counter whether they can get me a fix. Oh, we dont have any, she says. But head over to Toast Box. Ive tasted salted egg yolk there and its pretty good.Golden lava on toastOur party of four really make an effort to find Toast Box. And we put off shopping at a premium Singapore mall in the bustling Bugis junction to do it. But when we do find it, there is just no question about lost opportunitiesfreshly made toast served with cold kopi beats an evening of shoe shopping any day. I order the French toast oozing with a golden lava-style yolk that is sweet and rich. That first bite will be stuck in my memory and Instagram forever. The egg-cellent cocktailHappy with the first taste of my yolk adventure, I return to my room to locate my next stop. I figure perhaps a bar would give me a glimpse of Singapores night life and throw up some new yolk experiences. So I set my sights on The World is Flat by Tanuki Raw, Shinkansen and Standing Sushi Bar. Founder Howard Lo promises a wide selection of favourites on the menu with a yolky twist, including chicken wings and a salted egg yolk char siew pork donburi.At this point, every type of F&B business here has gotten in on the trend. Whether its a fast food or budget dining spot to a high-end eatery, everyone is doing something with salted egg in it. Its also hit that saturation point where its starting to get some backlash, some of that, oh man, not another salted egg yolk dish! he shares.Cold comfortOther memorable highs in my food diary include the award-winning oven-baked spring chicken at the Mercure Bugis restaurant, Sauces, and a Mediterranean assortment that has me gobsmacked at a must-try dinner spot called Artichoke.The writer was invited by AccorHotels and Scoot."

(AP)SANAA, Yemen: Sitting by her son's hospital bed, Houdaid Masbah looks at her 5-year-old boy's skeletal body and sunken cheeks, helplessness engulfing her like a thick cloud  a desperation she shares with many other mothers in Hodeidah.Even before the war, Hodeidah was one of the poorest cities in Yemen, the Arab world's most impoverished nation. Now, the destruction of the port city's fishing boats and infrastructure by the Saudi-led coalition's airstrikes over the past 18 months of war has deprived the townspeople of their prime livelihood.The U.N. estimates that about 100,000 children under the age of five in the city and the surrounding province, also called Hodeidah, are at risk of severe malnutrition.Life became harder for the people in this Red Sea city after March 2015, when the coalition of nine Arab Sunni countries began bombing Yemen's Shiite Houthi rebels to help the internationally recognized government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi return to power. The Houthis had pushed Hadi into self-imposed exile in Saudi Arabia and captured large chunks of the country, including the capital, Sanaa.The coalition suspected the Houthis were using Hodeidah fishermen to smuggle weapons across the sea from Iran. The airstrikes destroyed most of the wooden boats along with fish storage facilities, markets, roads and bridges  leaving the fishermen jobless and fearful after seeing some of their colleagues were killed in the strikes.As Yemen's conflict dragged on, food prices soared and gasoline ran out.At Hodeidah's central hospital, the 12-bed unit for children with severe malnutrition has been fully occupied for months. Children reduced to skin and bone cry tearlessly as their mothers watch by their bedsides, unable to help.Masbah, the mother of 5-year-old Salem Ali Salem, says her boy remembers only hunger.""From the day I gave birth to him ... till now, we are suffering,"" said the mother of eight. ""He got better for a short period of time and then he relapsed.""Salem's father is a fisherman and the family lives in Baqea, a village nearly an hour's drive from Hodeidah. That's where Ibrahim al-Kaali, a social worker, first saw him and helped bring him to the hospital in early September.""When I first carried him, I was afraid of crushing his bones under the weight of my hands,"" said al-Kaali. Salem's family is just one of about 600 impoverished and desperate families in villages along Hodeidah's western coastline, he added.Before the war, a fisherman could support his family on about 700 rials a day (about 2 dollars), feeding them fish, bread and rice. But with no fish and no money, the villagers' meals were mostly reduced to bread and tea for breakfast and a plate of rice for lunch, said al-Kaali.""We have 20 Salems, this (situation) is prevalent all over Hodeidah,"" Ossan al-Abbsi, a pediatrician at the hospital, told The Associated Press, speaking over the phone like others interviewed for this story.""There is an accelerating increase in the number of children suffering malnutrition,"" he said. ""We used to have five cases while the rest of the beds were empty on any given day. Now, you can never find an empty bed in our unit.""Al-Abbsi says that even after the children improved enough to be discharged from hospital, their condition often deteriorated rapidly as their family struggled once more to feed them.International agencies have classified Hodeidah among nine of Yemen's 22 provinces that are a step away from famine. A U.N. report in June said that in Yemen, ""the highest malnutrition prevalence"" is in Hodeidah.More than 10,000 people have been killed or wounded in Yemen's war so far, and 2.8 million have been displaced. The land-and-sea blockade imposed by the coalition and the Houthis' ground offensives have contributed to the deteriorating situation. U.N.-mediated peace talks in Kuwait were suspended last month, with no signs of progress.Over half of the country's population of 26 million is suffering from food insecurity, according to U.N. figures. UNICEF said that 2015 nutrition surveys in five of 10 highly affected governorates in Yemen, including Hodeidah, showed that 96,600 children under the age of five are at risk of severe acute malnutrition  compared to 23,000 before the conflict escalated in March that year.U.N. figures also show fishing declined by 75 per cent in Hodeidah and the western city of Taiz as the Saudi-led coalition restricted access to the sea and bombed boats.Food prices in Yemen have soared by 60 percent, according to a June-September report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, which is being used by international organizations to measure food security.Hodeidah used to have public markets with fresh produce and food items three times a week, while now they are only held once weekly because of fuel shortages, al-Abbsi said.At least 12 villages along Hodeidah's coastline, including the one where Salem's family is from, have never seen any type of development projects, leaving them marginalized and underdeveloped, al-Kaali said.When the conflict erupted, they suffered the most.""Here you won't find a school, a medical center ... drinking water is from the wells. They are already deprived of everything,"" he said.Sheikh Dawoud Gunid, a village elder in Baqea, said high levels of illiteracy and a shortage of medical centers, coupled with high transport costs, means children often receive no medical treatment until they are severely ill.Ali Hassan Tanmina, a fisherman and a father of eight, said the airstrikes have made him fear the sea.""We can't go to work to get food for our children,"" he said. ""We are besieged by hunger."""

That's because this chubby chick named Rice is the first of its auspicious species to survive after hatching in the wild in Thailand in 50 years.The tallest flying birds in the world, 70 incubator-hatched, hand-fed sarus cranes have been raised and released over the past five years in Thailand's farm-rich northeast province of Buriram, whooping their startling two-toned song at dawn.""The older generations told us about these cranes, they said they bring luck, but when I actually saw one in my field I was so excited,"" village leader Thongpoon Unjit said.He and dozens of other farmers stopped using pesticides and parked their noisy tractors to help the birds survive. They hand-harvest for acres and leave large swaths untouched around nests.Already the birds have brought good fortune: The farmers' organic rice sells for a premium at Bangkok supermarkets.Forty-two of the cranes released in the wild have survived so far, and eight are living in monogamous pairs. But until now none have managed to successfully reproduce. Rice, now about a month old, likely pecked its little sibling to death, but that's to be expected, say the experts.""It's been really fun to watch this family,"" said visiting ornithologist George Archibald, spying on the yellow-brown hatchling and its magenta-topped parents through a spotting scope. ""I've been really touched by the intimacy of the parents to their juvenile. They're just continually watching that chick.""Archibald, co-founder of the International Crane Foundation, has advised Thai animal scientists throughout their efforts to reintroduce sarus cranes, 6-foot-tall birds listed as vulnerable globally and extinct in Thailand.""There are many challenges facing these cranes,"" said Archibald. ""Will the farmers tolerate a little bit of damage in their rice fields? Will there be too many powerlines? Will the cranes fly into them? Will this landscape that has been absolutely transformed by modern man have a place that's safe for these enormous birds?""To bring them back, scientists borrowed a few sarus cranes from neighboring Cambodia, where a rare flock lives in a refuge. The United Nations Development Program helped pull together more than $1.5 million for sarus cranes and two other endangered species in Thailand.But raising any type of crane to survive in the wild is a delicate matter, in large part because the birds tend to imprint on humans around them. Wildlife biologists who feed, care for and transport the birds from zoo incubators to temporary outdoor habitats wear fake crane suits to stop the birds from bonding.At the Korat Zoo last week, birdkeeper Sarawut Wongsombat, sweating in his white gown, opened and closed a large Sarus crane puppet mouth in his right hand while waving a tiny tilapia in front of the beak of an 8-day-old chick that wobbled on its skinny legs. The little bird refused the fish again and again, shaking its head and hopping away. But when Sarawut took a break, the curious chick gobbled a few mealworms it found in a bowl, followed by some pink vitamin water.""He did OK for his first meal,"" said Sarawut, pulling off the costume.About 100 miles north, two sarus cranes were released just one day earlier, hopping into a wetland from the arms of their ""Mom and Dad,"" animal scientists Tanat Uttaraviset and Natawut Wanna, wearing gray-white gowns with hoods and fabric flapping wings.The shaky fledglings, who had spent the past three months in a temporary mesh shelter in the wetland, hopped around and flapped their wings before launching on their first flights.Standing thigh-high in a bog next to an organic rice paddy, conservationists watched nervously as the birds they'd help raise each flapped a large loop over the field. It's a dicey moment when a sarus crane first flies: Sometimes they crash into trees. Other times they face plant on touchdown.On this day both aced their landings.More of these releases are slated for later this month. Organizers plan a ceremony with the Environmental Ministry to introduce nine adolescent sarus cranes into the wild, honoring King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died Oct. 13 at age 88. The birds are considered good luck, and better yet, the number nine honors the king, who was known as Rama IX for his place in the nation's dynasty.Bhumibol's legacy includes his concern for upcountry rice farms, where he introduced sustainable, environmentally friendly methods.""It will be a great way to honor the king, with these special birds,"" said Nathanik Klaklangsmorn of the U.N. Development Program."

""This marks a significant increase over our existing funding, and it will ensure that Israel has the support it needs to defend itself by itself and to preserve its qualitative military edge. This is the single largest pledge of military assistanceto any countryin American history,"" Rice said.Rice said it is a reminder of the US' unshakeable commitment to Israel's security.This additional funding will, among other things, allow Israel to update the lion's share of its fighter aircraft fleet, including the acquisition of additional F-35s and F-15s.It will also enable Israel to substantially enhance the mobility of its ground forces, she added.""As Israel continues to face the threat of rocket fire, this funding will help Israel to further strengthen missile defence systems like Iron Dome,"" she said.For years, the US' funding for Israeli missile defence has been subject to the uncertainty of the annual appropriations process.Some years, the amount of missile defence funding has been unclear for months at a time. Some years, it has even declined, she said.The Acting Israeli National Security Advisor Jacob Nagel said the military assistance package that the US has generously agreed to provide Israel is not taken for granted and will help it shoulder the enormous defense burden that they face and enable better Israel  and enable Israel to better defend itself by itself against any threat.""This unprecedented assistance will also cover a robust missile defence funding through the next decade for the first time and will help us effectively plan and develop multi-layer missile defense systems to counter the growing missile threats in our region,"" he said."

At the exhitibion, he serves a 16 dish sadya- Thali meals- daily. I don't repeat dishes here and make more than 101 dishes in a week as I make 16 daily. Even one can make jackfruit chicken biriyani, replacing the rice with this fruit. However, one has to be careful that the jackfruit does not overcook,"" Rafeeq says.

Though he offered me a token advance of Rs 101, I have told him to wait till the end of the festival, said Rafeeq He started his experiments with jack fruit six years ago.  I was doing chips business. Soon, I started diverting and within time I was preparing dishes with jackfruits. We made a number of dishes from several parts of the jackfruit. When I learned about the medicinal values of the fruit, I realised my attempt was not a futile one, he said.Confused what to have?Disappointed, you dont have fish or meat for lunch?  Replace it with jackfruit. Make a curry or a fry with it, he adds. He needs at least 100 jack fruits per day and has 20 helpers to assist him. Though it is a seasonal fruit, Rafeeq is not worried about the lack of availability of jackfruit the year round.  It is simple. We have to learn the period of harvest in various parts of the state and Tamil Nadu. We can move to Kollam when the fruits are over in Thiruvanathapuram as they have 20 days more in the season. We also collect our jackfruits from Kanyakumari. The jack fruit used at the fair has been brought from Idukki, he said. In addition to this he has his own methods for conserving the fruit. We boil the fruit first and drain the water and later keep it for drying. We can use the jackfruit by adding water througout the rest of the year, he said."

I am very happy and I hope everything goes well until the end of hajj,"" said Saudi pilgrim Bashar Aatabi, 30.He was eating chicken and rice on the ground with his friends after reaching Muzdalifah.Mohammed Khyara, 51, from Syria, was busy collecting stones for Monday's ritual.""It's my fourth hajj but this time my wife is with me so the happiness is even greater,"" he said.At midday prayers in Mount Arafat, hundreds of thousands of people prostrated themselves, men and women side-by-side, in wide alleys that run between prefabricated pilgrim lodgings.""It's beautiful to see the Muslims of the world pray together here,"" said Indian pilgrim Mohammed Arafan, 40.A teenage Indian pilgrim, who gave her name only as Janifa, said she was ""lucky, and very grateful"" to have made the pilgrimage with her parents.Safety measuresFrom a distance, the Arafat hill appeared a snowy white because of the seamless two-piece white garment, ihram, worn by male pilgrims. Women also usually wear white.They come from every corner of the globe for the hajj, but Indonesia -- the most populous Muslim nation -- has the largest contingent.Trucks loaded with bottled water were stationed throughout, and pilgrims doused themselves.Empty bottles and leftover meals littered the ground as ambulances patrolled.At Muzdalifah, half way between Arafat and Mina, pilgrims gather 49 pebbles for Monday's symbolic stoning of the devil, the last major rite of hajj.It coincides with Eid al-Adha, the feast of sacrifice marked by Muslims worldwide.King Salman arrived in Mina to ensure pilgrims can ""perform their rituals easily, conveniently and safely"", the Saudi Press Agency said.He was also being briefed on the movement of pilgrims between the holy sites.During last year's stoning ritual in Mina, a stampede killed roughly 2,300 people on their way to the Jamarat Bridge to perform the rite.Saudi Arabia issued a death toll of 769, but figures compiled from foreign officials in more than 30 countries gave a tally almost three times higher.Authorities announced an investigation into the tragedy but no results have ever been released, although a number of safety measures have been taken.Among these is the distribution of bracelets which store pilgrims' personal data. Roads have also been widened in the Jamarat area, newspapers reported.Pilgrims have told AFP they feel safe and have noticed organisational improvements.""The Saudis organise everything for us. We are truly at ease here in Arafat,"" Youssef al-Mehri, 24, of Oman said with a prayer rug slung over his shoulder.No IraniansOn Sunday, helicopters monitored the crowd flow from the skies, while on the ground, police directed pedestrians and made sure there were no bottlenecks.Despite the safety and security measures which Sunni-dominated Saudi Arabia says it has taken, Shiite Iran has angrily questioned the kingdom's custodianship of Islam's holiest places.Iran last year reported the largest number of stampede victims, at 464, and its 64,000 pilgrims are excluded for the first time in decades after the regional rivals failed to agree on security and logistics.Hundreds of thousands of Iranian faithful held an alternative pilgrimage on Saturday in the Iraqi Shiite holy city of Karbala, according to an official at the shrine of Imam Hussein.Saudi Arabia on Sunday said it had launched a television channel to broadcast the hajj rituals in the Persian language, also known as Farsi, spoken in Iran."

Temples in the city will offer freshly harvested sheaves of paddy to the presiding deities. Devotees hang rice panicles received from temples as prasadam at their homes because it is considered auspicious to do so. Niraputhari festivals held at Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple, Attukal temple and Pazhavangady Ganapathy temple are the most famous ones.City Corporation has been entrusted with the cultivation and procurement of paddy sheaves, which are grown at Putharikandam field, for Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple. The paddy field in front of the temple thus got its name Putharikandam maidanam due to this. This year the paddy sheaves will not be procured from Putharikandam because a part of the paddy field has been rendered useless for cultivation due to development works. Over the years, large tracts of field have been filled for conducting various activities in the city and only a small portion has been kept aside for cultivation. But irrigating this low lying land has become a problem since the surrounding areas has been raised. During monsoon the entire area becomes flooded with sewerage water and the paddy becomes disease affected. The incomplete works of Operation Anantha, a major infrastructure initiative for preventing floods in the city, is being blamed for this problem. We anticipated this and made alternate arrangements. We cultivated paddy in grow bags and on other fields this time, said Mayor V K Prashant.He handed over the paddy cultivated by Karshika Karma Sena at Kudappanakunnu, which functions under Krishi Bhavan, to the temple authorities on Sunday. Considering the demand for paddy sheaves Cropping Systems Research Centre (CSRC) under Kerala Agricultural University at Nedumcad near Karamana, kept their office open on Sunday. The centre has been providing paddy sheaves of Uma rice variety to around 70 temples in the city for the past 10 years. Seventeen acre farm of CSRC produced more than two tonnes of paddy stalks for this purpose alone for Rs 100 per one sqmt. Seeds for the paddy sheaves meant for Niraputhari are sown on the first day of the Medam month, the day on which Vishu is celebrated, and the ripe paddy sheaves are harvested by the middle or end of Karkidakam."

If reports coming in from Technopark and the incident which occurred at the Infopark in Kochi are any indications then it can be said, Yes, they are. Three days ago, techies at the Infopark were shocked to find a millipede in a snack served by a cafeteria attached to one of the blocks in the park.The situation is not so different at Technopark! For years, the techies have been complaining about the poor quality of food and also the unhygienic conditions in which they are being prepared at the several cafeterias inside the campus.Techies point out that several cafeterias have been serving stale food even after being served notices by the Food and Safety Department threatening closure if conditions arent improved. At present, 22 cafeterias are functioning inside the park at various blocks. Apart from branded food outlets, several cafeterias serve local cuisine to attract Kerala-based techies. In fact, it is these cafeterias which are in the news for all the wrong reasons. Two weeks back the Food and Safety Department raided the cafeterias inside the park after receiving large number of complaints from techies. Food and Safety officials issued warning and penalised many of these restaurants for serving stale food and that too in unhygienic conditions. They also slapped closure notice on a restaurant functioning in Bhavani building.Techies said that they have been at the receiving end for years. Though Technopark exudes glamour, the condition of the eateries inside the campus will put off people from food for a long time. For how long should we suffer unhygienic food ? a techie asked.Harrowing experienceOn August 4, a group of techies spent a harrowing night after having food from one of the restaurants functioning on the ground floor of Nila building. A software developer who didnt wish to disclose his identity told TPuram Express that he was served tomato rice which was two-days-old and spent half of his day puking. When they complained to the owner, he tried to return their money. We dont want the money back. What we want is hygienic food. Ours is not an isolated incident. Others too have been complaining about the poor quality of food here, a Senior operations manager with a multi-national company said.The records with the nearby hospitals indicate that there has been a rise in food poisoning cases from Technopark. Sources said that the hospital authorities cited a case wherein the chef of a restaurant came to them seeking treatment for allergic eruptions on his hands.Strict actionWhen contacted, A Satheesh Kumar, Assistant Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram in-charge, Food and Safety department, said that strict action has been taken against such restaurants inside the park. He also added that this is the third incident being reported from the park.We have formed two special squads to keep a check on the food inside the park. Two weeks ago, we raid all the cafeterias and found that eight to nine restaurants have been serving stale food and that too in an unhygienic environment. This is a serious issue. We have penalised some restaurants functioning at Nila and Bhavani buildings. We have also issued a closure notice to one working at Bhavani building. They were also directed to replace all the unhygienic plates and bowls. However, the raids dont end here. It will be continued in the coming days. The restaurants outside the park will be also under our surveillance, Satheesh said."
58fdb2547be9e012bf28599d,"Samsung heir joins board, moving toward top leadership role",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2016/oct/27/samsung-heir-joins-board-moving-toward-top-leadership-role-1532409.html,2016-10-27,"SEOUL: The grandson of Samsung's founder is stepping up as its new leader after the failure of the company's flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7.Shareholders of Samsung Electronics Co. voted Thursday to appoint 48-year-old Lee Jae-yong, chairman Lee Kun-hee's only son, to its board of directors.The appointment of the Harvard-educated vice chairman as a board member comes at a crucial time for Samsung, South Korea's biggest company.Samsung Electronics, the world's largest maker of smartphones, memory chips and TVs, reported a sharp fall in its quarterly earnings after the unprecedented recall and discontinuation of fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 smartphones wiped out its mobile profit in the last quarter.The Note 7, initially launched as Samsung's weapon against the iPhone, was scrapped less than two months after its launch after consumers reported some of the devices were catching fire. Replacement Note 7s given for the recalled phones also were found to be overheating.Samsung's net income was 4.4 trillion won ($3.9 billion) in July-September, down 17 percent from 5.3 trillion won a year earlier.Its troubled mobile business generated just 100 billion won ($87.9 million) in operating income during the quarter, compared with 2.4 trillion won a year earlier. Samsung's mobile business usually contributes more than half of its overall income.Sales fell 7 percent while operating income slumped 30 percent, in line with the company's guidance earlier this month.Even before the messy recalls, like other big ""chaebol,"" or industrial conglomerates in South Korea, Samsung was being urged to improve its transparency and corporate governance.Lee Jae-yong is the grandson of Samsung's founder, Lee Byung-chull. The younger Lee is thought to have been making key decisions for Samsung since his 74-year-old father was hospitalized after a heart attack in 2014 left him unable to oversee the company. But he largely handled internal management and meetings with VIPs.Lee Kun-hee resigned from the board of Samsung Electronics in 2008 as he faced investigation over alleged tax evasion and other financial violations. His son's appointment to the board was long expected, but is raising questions.Some South Koreans opposed giving him a board position because of questions about how he amassed billions of dollars of personal wealth and about the performance of businesses he has run.""He has never successfully demonstrated that he is eligible to be a board member,"" said Lee Jee-soo, a lawyer and head of the Law and Business Research Center. ""Just because he was born as the son of Lee Kun-hee, he is joining the board.""Last year, Samsung narrowly won shareholder approval for merging two group companies, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries. Critics of the plan said there was no reason to merge the two companies apart from enabling Lee Jae-yong to strengthen his control over Samsung Electronics without having to pay for acquiring more shares.Samsung contended that the merger was in line with local laws and necessary for the future of the two companies.Lee currently does not hold any ""C-level"" positions after serving as Samsung's chief operating officer from 2010 to 2012. Samsung now has three CEOs overseeing its components, mobile devices and TV businesses.Kwon Oh-hyun, CEO of Samsung Electronics, said Lee has proven his leadership in other ways, such as helping to improve the company's profitability through restructuring.Samsung's earnings report Thursday showed that while its mobile profit shrank dramatically, its components businesses, especially its high-density chips for computers and next-generation smartphone displays called OLEDs, performed well thanks to strong demand from global smartphone makers. The component businesses generated more than 80 percent of the company's quarterly income in the latest quarter, helping Samsung weather the cost of the handset recall.Analysts expect those high-end components to be Samsung's growth engine next year as more smartphone makers adopt Samsung's OLEDs.Anticipating strong growth in demand, Samsung said it will spend 27 trillion won ($23.7 billion) this year to increase production of OLEDs and an advanced chip.Looking ahead, Samsung hinted that the worst may be over for its mobile division, forecasting that its mobile profit in the fourth quarter will likely be on a par with last year's.The company estimated costs from the Note 7 fiasco will amount to at least $5.3 billion.Lacking a new high-end gadget to fight Apple's new iPhone, Samsung said it will introduce new mid- to low-end handset models while selling the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge smartphones, which were launched in spring.Samsung founder Lee Byung-chull started out trading rice and dried fish in the late 1930s. The company grew into an empire offering everything that South Koreans need from cradle to grave, from ships and washing machines to insurance and semiconductors. Cheap government financing helped, as South Korea rushed to recover from wartime devastation and catch up with Japan and other developed nations.The Lee family holds only a minority share in the company, but maintains control through a maze of cross-shareholdings in the 59-odd companies that make up the group."

But he warned that China will not allow anyone to use the project to spoil relations between China and Sri Lanka.The Ambassador said this in answer to a question whether Indian firms will be participating in the multi-billion dollar project about which the government of India had some apprehensions in the early stages.Some Indian companies are already in involved in it, since work on it was restarted in April this year, Yi said.He was speaking to the National Chamber of Commerce here on Wednesday.Indian participation is needed. We welcome participation by any third party, the envoy said emphatically.Earlier, while addressing the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies, Yi said that when he went to India scouting for participants in what was then called the Colombo Port City project, five top Indian companies had shown eagerness to participate. But he would not name them.The Ambassador, who is a professional economist and a trade expert in the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said that it is very important for Sri Lanka to build international relations on the basis of trade and investment ties rather than strategic, political and cultural ties, as only economic ties will ensure a strong foundation for and stability in bilateral relations.Yi said that China sets much store by economic relations relegating political, strategic and cultural ties to the background, because it is convinced about the critical importance of trade and investment in ensuring good and long lasting political relations.In this context, he recalled the lasting contribution of the Rubber for Rice Pact between Sri Lanka and China signed in 1952 to Sino-Sri Lankan relations. The celebrated pact, which met Sri Lankas dire need for rice while securing a reasonable price for its rubber, laid the foundation for lasting friendship between Sri Lanka and China.Even now, every Sri Lankan and Chinese recalls the Rubber-Rice Pact when talking of Sino-Sri Lankan friendship, Ambassador Yi said.The envoy stressed the need for a China-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement as such agreements are in the interest of both countries. He hoped it would be signed by year end.Although Sri Lanka has very little that China does not itself produce, China is ready to buy more from Sri Lanka, especially tea, gems, vegetables and fish and fish products. Chinese shop keepers have told him that they are eager to stock more Sri Lankan products.But the way forward for Sri Lanka is not just to export more of the same but to increase and improve the basket of exportable goods, while reducing imports, Yi said. This needs investment and the development of new skills. China has huge investment plans in Sri Lanka in the Colombo Financial City, in the Mattala Airport, the Humbantota Economic Zone and the Galle Harbor which will help reduce imports and increase exports and enable Sri Lanka to get out of the present debt trap.The Colombo Financial City is expected to get US$ 8 billion in Foreign Direct Investment and the Humbantota Economic Zone US$ 5 billion.When these projects reach fruition, Sri Lankans will know who are their real friends, Yi quipped.Asked whether the Chinese projects will employ Sri Lankan workers in substantial numbers, the envy said that 99 percent will be locally recruited as indeed they are now. Even in the existing projects only 1 percent are Chinese.However, Yi said that Sri Lankan workers need to be trained in various skills and also need to be taught Chinese language and culture to ensure perfect communication and mutual understanding at the floor level. Training is already on."

""What can this meeting bring us except surrealism in all its splendor?""Televisa news anchor Carlos Loret de Mola marveled that Trump would dare come to Mexico and reiterate his intention to build the wall. ""The humiliation is now complete,"" he tweeted.Particularly irksome to Mexicans was that Pena Nieto appeared to do little to push back against Trump's earlier negative statements about Mexican migrants and unpopular proposals.Pena Nieto ""did not even take a really strong stand and talk to Mr. Trump directly to his face and tell him exactly why his stances are not acceptable to Mexicans,"" said Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University's Baker Institute. ""He sounded tepid and too soft. He essentially rolled over and allowed Mr. Trump to get away with his own goals without getting anything in return.""Pena Nieto did say that Mexicans felt ""aggrieved"" and had disagreements with Trump, but most felt that it was not enough.Javier Urbano Reyes, a professor in the department of International Studies at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City, said he thought Trump gained a little with the meeting but Mexico's president lost a lot.""Without a doubt, my perception is that it is going to make it even worse, even stronger the drop in approval,"" he said, referring to Pena Nieto's near 20-percent approval rating, according to recent polls.Former Mexican President Vicente Fox said Trump was trying to boost his sagging campaign. ""He fooled him (Pena Nieto) .""Pena Nieto and Trump even appeared to disagree about what was said in the meeting.Standing next to Pena Nieto, Trump said the topic of who would pay for the wall would be discussed later. Pena Nieto, at the time, said nothing about the wall.Hours later, Pena Nieto said in a tweet that he had told Trump clearly in their private meeting that Mexico would not pay. It seemed to contradict Trump's statement that payment wasn't discussed, but the president's office said only that Pena Nieto made his statement and the topic was dropped.Later Wednesday night, in a speech on immigration in Phoenix, Arizona, Trump made building the wall the featured element of his immigration plan. He referred to Pena Nieto as a ""wonderful, wonderful president,"" but reaffirmed the pledge he had not repeated in Mexico: ""They don't know it yet, but they're going to pay for the wall.""Many Mexicans wonder why Pena Nieto agreed to the meeting.Payan hypothesized that Pena Nieto had little good news to give in his state-of-the-nation address scheduled for Thursday and was looking for a distraction with the ""ill-advised"" meeting.""Maybe Pena saw the opportunity to distract the attention of the Mexican people,"" he said.Writer Angeles Mastretta tweeted that Mexicans saw ""what was expected: a president who isn't capable of demanding apologies ... how sad."""

It's like a curfew,"" fisheries department official Iqbal Hossain said from the coastal river district of Patuakhali.""One mother (hilsa) can lay two million eggs per year. So one can easily understand how big the production will be if the protection drive is successful,"" said Hossain.Hilsa is the most sought-after delicacy for 160 million Bangladeshis and another 90 million Bengalis who live in eastern India.Bangladesh has introduced temporary bans on catching it before, but they have never been enforced this thoroughly.""A war is ongoing to keep the mother hilsa safe,"" said Jahid Habib, who is campaigning to save the fish.Bangladesh has already banned fishermen from catching young hilsa at certain times of the year. Five years ago it banned the export of the fish to India.Some critics said the drive will hit fishermen in the impoverished country. But Hossain said authorities were giving free rice to 32,000 fishermen during the ban to make up for the financial loss."

""It's just how I live,"" he says, shrugging. ""Go home, take my shoes off, take my clothes off.""Then he starts cooking - experimenting with ingredients he has picked up on his way back to his flat in the trendy Williamsburg area of New York, spending two hours a night chopping and blending. Which sounds a little like dicing with danger, when done in the altogether.""I've been cooking naked with knives for the longest time, so I feel pretty comfortable chopping,"" he says.Now he is making a career of it. Noriega, 27, has been widely dubbed ""the world's hottest chef"", while more than 200,000 followers digest his delectable daily dishes on Instagram. His most recent post on his YouTube channel, Franco Cooks, has been viewed over 70,000 times in the five days since he sat down, in his very skimpy boxers, to teach us how to cook chia seed pudding.The former model - catapulted to stardom when fellow Peruvian, photographer Mario Testino, recommended him to Dolce & Gabbana - is riding a viral publicity wave: having opened Baby Brasa in Manhattan's Lower East Side earlier this year, he will open his second restaurant in the West Village in January, quickly followed by a third in his own neighbourhood.Is there not a risk that, by using his chiselled abs to promote his culinary concoctions, he'll be seen as nothing more than a gimmick?""It is a risk,"" he concedes, perched on a stool outside his Peruvian rotisserie. The pocket-sized restaurant specialises in organic free-range chicken with Peruvian spices, but also serves up quinoa salads, jasmine rice with Peruvian corn, and yucca fries.""But life is full of risk - and that's what makes it interesting.""Noriega is savvy enough to realise that, were a woman to promote her restaurant in a bikini, she'd be pilloried for it. ""It's not like I'm posing for this,"" he insists, of his impossibly chiselled photo feed.""I live like that. I swam for Peru when I was younger, so was always almost naked - in my Speedos, anyway. And Peru is a hot country, so you wear fewer clothes.""For him, the whole ""naked"" USP is just good business sense: using the God-given tools at his disposal.""Can you tell me who this Jamie Oliver guy is?"" he asks, having never heard of his British namesake until he was mentioned in an article comparing the two. ""Did he cook naked?""No, no, I say, he used ""naked"" ingredients - stripped-down, simple food. No fuss. But now he's built an empire, married a model, lives in a huge house in London and has made a fortune from cookbooks and saucepans and things.Noriega's eyes light up and he nods, keenly - clearly taking mental notes.Inside the open-plan kitchen, Noriega - now modestly clad in a T-shirt and denim apron - shows me how to whip up his special chicken and lentil superfood salad. He laughs at my massacring of an avocado as I try to concentrate on his CV - and not get blinded by his biceps, or lose a finger - while wielding a massive knife.It was when he moved to New York a decade ago that he was introduced to Testino, through a family friend. ""I was very fortunate, because thanks to Mario I could go straight to the top,"" he says. ""I didn't have to hustle. Immediately I was doing D&G, Burberry, Calvin Klein.""But I wasn't using my brain. And I saw very quickly that it's different for women - they have much more creative control, and then they can become muses and creative directors as they get older. There are so many successful female models. But I bet you can't name more than five men. We have to do something else.""Besides, the restaurant business was in his blood. When he was a child growing up in Lima, his parents ran a successful chain of them and were always in search of new ventures. Food was a huge part of his life: ingredients such as avocado, quinoa, and ceviche - now considered superfoods in fashionable quarters on both sides of the Atlantic - were simply daily staples there.Enrolling in New York's International Culinary Center, he sweated for a year in the kitchens to learn his craft. He worked alongside the celebrated French chef Daniel Boulud, owner of the Michelin-starred Daniel and dozens of restaurants in New York and around the world. He grafted at a Peruvian restaurant in Queens, Pio Pio - determined that, when it came to opening his own place, he'd be on top of his game.He was also determined not to spoil those abs. Ah yes, those abs. As a former professional swimmer (he qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was injured before they began) and model (something he still does on the side), he's well versed in the importance of healthy eating. ""But not just salad. I didn't want to lose weight - just be good to my body.""Nowadays he keeps fit in the gym, by skateboarding across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan, and riding his bike around town. Many of his clients, he says, are men who come in after the gym and want a filling, healthy meal.His organic, free-range chicken is three times more expensive wholesale than battery-farmed chicken - but he believes it's worth it. Half a bird costs $13 - more than fast-food joints, but still very affordable for New York.""I don't understand how you can work out and then go and scoff a $10 Thai meal - full of sodium and MSG,"" he says. ""People come here who care about what they eat.""Not surprisingly, he is perfectly happy to strip off for the Telegraph's photographer - despite winter having arrived in New York this week. Endearingly helpful and friendly, he happily flashes the Blue Steel when handed a knife to strike a pose - before breaking back into an easy grin, and putting his T-shirt on again.And he insists he is still single (though, like many a pin-up before him, swerves the question of whether he's straight). Women do make up the majority of customers, laughs Milan Kelez, his business partner and another Peruvian former model, as two women in their twenties ask to have their photo with him. They make quite a pair.""People think we're brothers or gay,"" Kelez says. ""But we're just really good friends.""He hands Noriega a new dish to try - patacones, a traditional South American plantain cake, with avocado toppings. They chew on it, intently. ""More seasoning,"" they conclude.The new restaurants will be much bigger, with around 80 covers in both the West Village and Williamsburg locations. And Noriega has more in store. His YouTube channel may be in his mother tongue - one of the few printable comments under a recent video says: ""Watching to improve my Spanish. Honest"" - but he is thinking about an English version, and is in talks for a possible television show.This week he was in Peru, speaking to financiers about more projects. His hope is to have a Baby Brasa - the name comes from ""pollo a la brasa"", a Peruvian roast chicken dish - in every major city in the US. Perhaps even the UK, I ask, imagining the queue.""I know that people might come into the restaurant for the first time because of my Instagram,"" he said. ""But when they come back, it's because of the food."""

""You can see it was a substantial impact.""Abele said it was not known if alcohol, drugs or fatigue played a role in the crash about 100 miles east of Los Angeles. The USA Holiday tour bus was returning to Los Angeles after a visit to the Red Earth Casino in Thermal, about 25 miles southeast of Palm Springs.The bus driver was killed, and the truck driver received minor injuries.Passengers told officials that most people were asleep when the crash occurred at 5:17 a.m. Abele said he didn't believe the 1996 bus had seat belts and likely didn't have a black box outfitted in newer vehicles.The bus was inspected in 2014, 2015 and this year and didn't have any mechanical issues, Abele said. Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration records show it had no crashes in the two years before Oct. 22 and had a satisfactory safety rating.The front of the bus had crumpled into the semi-truck's trailer and debris was scattered across the key route through Southern California.Firefighters used ladders to climb into the bus' windows to remove bodies and tow trucks lifted the trailer to make it easier to reach the bus, whose front end was demolished.Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs received 14 patients: five in critical condition, three in serious condition and six with minor injuries, hospital marketing director Rich Ramhoff said.Eleven people with minor injuries were sent to Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, spokesperson Lee Rice said. JFK Memorial Medical Center in Indio received five patients, all with minor injuries, chief development officer Linda Evans said.CHP Officer Stephanie Hamilton earlier told the Desert Sun newspaper in Palm Springs that the driver was one of the owners of USA Holiday, based near Los Angeles. The company has one vehicle and one driver, according to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.A phone message left for the company was not immediately returned. A Facebook message from USA Holiday said it did not have much information about the crash.The company says on social media that is has more than 25 years of experience in traveling to casinos in Southern California. It posts about trips leaving the Los Angeles area to casinos around the Coachella Valley and Las Vegas.The CHP says all westbound lanes of the highway were closed and traffic was being diverted.The National Transportation Safety Board is sending a team to California to investigate the crash, board spokesman Eric Weiss said.It comes two years after a FedEx truck veered across an interstate median north of Sacramento and slammed into a bus full of high school students, killing 10 people. In August, a bus in central California hit a highway sign post that tore through the vehicle and left four people dead."

58fed5f97be9e0420db27ebf,Eyes on July after tardy rains onset,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160704/jsp/nation/story_94704.jsp,2016-07-04,"Nagpur, July 3: A slow-off-the-mark monsoon in a year billed for good rainfall by weather scientists has hobbled crop-sowing, leaving farmers hoping for adequate and uniform rainfall in July. Data released by the Union agriculture ministry on July 1 show that farmers are yet to start planting crops in full swing across large tracts, particularly central India. Officials are blaming the slow start on a delayed southwest monsoon and deficient June rainfall, with the added factor of a cash crunch among farmers after two to three years of drought. Delayed sowing leads not just to delayed arrival of fresh crops but also to lower yields. Crop scientists don't see a problem yet because, in many parts of the country, sowing picks up pace in July and even spills onto the first week of August. But any climatic aberration in July - either low rainfall or extreme weather events - could spell disaster for a vast majority of farmers in rain-dependent regions such as Marathwada, Vidarbha and Bundelkhand. The good news so far is that the India Meteorological Department's weekly forecast on Thursday suggests the southwest monsoon is gathering steam. Officials in Maharashtra blamed the delayed onset of the rains on a change in their pattern of arrival in the state. The southwest monsoon usually strikes Konkan first and then spreads to the state's eastern parts. This time, it entered Maharashtra from the eastern Vidarbha region and spread westward. Konkan and Mumbai witnessed heavy rain over the past week, but Vidarbha, Marathwada and western Maharashtra are yet to receive enough rain to start sowing. Seeds need a certain level of soil moisture for better germination and growth. Premature sowing is fraught with the risk of failure, necessitating re-sowing and thus pushing up the cost of production and labour. Besides, in many states, farmers are cash-strapped after successive years of drought. The banks have yet to restructure the outstanding loans and issue fresh credit for the current season. Maharashtra alone has more than 25 lakh such farmers. On July 1, going by the official data, sowing was way behind schedule in the case of crops such as cotton, pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals. If one considers only the major crops, India's farmers had finished sowing on 279 lakh hectares by this time last year. This season, the figure stands at 216 lakh hectares - a deficit of nearly 23 per cent. ( See chart) ""We have finished sowing but the rain has not been satisfactory,"" Sudam Pawar, a five-acre cotton grower in Wardha district, about 60km from Nagpur, said. ""We expect good rain this week,"" he added, drawing hope from the forecast for the region. The India Meteorological Department has predicted above-average rainfall in July and August, but farmers say it is crucial that the rain is uniform in spread and pattern. The past several years, including the so-called good-monsoon years, have seen extreme rainfall events in these parts. ""It's not just the amount of rain but the number of rainy days and its spatial spread that is important to us,"" said Pawar. India grows cotton on roughly 120 lakh hectares; a third of it in Maharashtra. Friday's ministry data showed that cotton-sowing had crossed barely 30 lakh hectares in the country - half the acreage compared with the corresponding period last year - mainly because of scanty or unsatisfactory rainfall in the cotton belt. Marathwada and Vidarbha, key cotton-growing regions, have faced droughts the past two to three years and, therefore, lower yields. Pulses, whose prices are sky-rocketing across the country owing to shortages caused by successive droughts, too have lagged last year's acreage - less than 20 lakh hectares sown against 22 lakh hectares last year. In the case of oilseeds, the figures are 28.7 lakh hectares this year compared with 54 lakh hectares by this time last year - lower by 47 per cent. Sowing is likely to speed up once the monsoon gathers steam in states like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, officials say. Coarse cereals like jowar, bajra and millets, grown mostly in the drier regions, have been planted across 37 lakh hectares, lower than the nearly 44 lakh hectares planted in the same period last year. The area under rice, the main kharifcrop, stands close to 48 lakh hectares, marginally higher than last year, thanks to good rainfall in Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh. The seasonal area under rice is 393 lakh hectares. Sugarcane too has a marginally higher acreage this year but officials attribute it to good rainfall in western Uttar Pradesh, where most of the crop is planted around this time. Sugarcane acreage in water-stressed regions like Marathwada and north Karnataka, they fear, would drop this year."

Are you prepared for it? I am really happy to get the invitation from the US Consulate Generals office in Hyderabad to attend the programme.They selected me after going through my background. I will be there from May 9 to May 28. Being a member of the Bonda community, I will present a case study on the major issues affecting the tribal communities, especially the particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTG). I will also try to learn what steps other countries are taking to protect the particularly vulnerable tribal groups. After I return, I will also present a case study before the state government. You represent Chitrakonda Assembly constituency, which is dominated by Maoists. Have you ever received any threats from them? Everyone is aware that our area is affected by Maoists. They keep a tab on our activities. If they feel that someone is dishonest and not committed to the cause of common people, they issue all kinds of threats.As I maintain a simple life and total transparency in my work, they have never threatened me. I am the peoples representative and dont belong to any particular group. The kidnapping of former MLA and your partys current Koraput MP Jhina Hikaka in 2012 and former Malkangiri collector Vineel Krishna in 2011 must have had an impact on the minds of peoples representatives who hail from tribal areas? Yes, thats true. But you have no other option but to work in that atmosphere. You have no control over your birth and death. You cannot remain confined to your house fearing possible death. Of course, our movement has been restricted. The state government has already issued guidelines on how to move in Maoist-affected areas. We avoid travelling after sunset.We are following the guidelines strictly by taking intelligence inputs and sometimes move in a camouflaged manner. In both the kidnappings, Hikaka and Krishna had made a few mistakes. But they did not do that knowingly. Sometimes, you have to ignore guidelines for the cause of the people. Hikaka avoided visiting his constituency after his kidnapping. Is it the same with you? I belong to a tribal community -Bonda  which is a reclusive community. I wanted to be the voice of my people. I decided to stay in Chitrakonda and rarely visit Bhubaneswar with this in mind. These visits mostly take place during Assembly sessions. How do you feel the Maoist problem can be solved? This is an old problem and cannot be solved overnight. The government alone cannot solve the issue. There is a need to change the publics attitude. A massive awareness drive is needed for this. Besides, the governments implementing agency should effectively implement the various welfare programmes meant for the tribal communities. People should get a chance to see what the government is doing for them. The Maoists have started issuing threats to the tribal community to join their movement. They have also killed some tribal people. Bondas are conscious of their self-esteem. They are, by nature, very independent and dont like to work under any group or system. That spirit of independence has, so far, prohibited us from joining the Maoists. I can proudly say that not a single member of our 12,700 strong Bonda (out of them, 6,670 live in the upper parts of the hills and the rest in the villages adjoining the footsteps of the hills) community has joined the Maoist movement so far. Besides, the Maoists have also not issued any threat to our community. The rich culture of Bonda community is on the decline. We have noticed that those who are educated among the community have started alienating themselves from the culture This is the age of globalisation and modernisation. Modern technologies such as mobile phones, televisions and radios have reached every nook and corner of the state. Despite this, we have been able to preserve our culture and tradition.In order to preserve it, we have constituted a Bonda Samaj and meet frequently to discuss ways of further preserving our culture and tradition. Despite the fact that we are in the 21st century, our people have, so far, not accepted any kind of pesticides and chemical fertilisers for farming. Even if you provide them with these things free of cost, they will not use it. The world will be surprised to know we have preserved 80 varieties of paddy seeds. Are there any government initiatives to protect the Bonda culture? The state government has introduced an innovative system to protect our culture and language. Bonda tribals are being taught in Bonda language using Odia script. The state government has appointed people of Bonda tribe as Multi Lingual Education (MLD) community teachers who are teaching the students in their language. It has helped the Bonda community to understand things easily. The tribal pockets were considered Congress bastions earlier. But the BJP is slowly replacing the Congress. Why is it so? Earlier, Koraput and Malkangiri were considered as strongholds of the Congress. But people are fed up with the party because of its faulty policies and the lack of strong leadership. The BJP has taken this opportunity and had tried hard to make inroads into the tribal belt. But if one analyses their vote percentage in the last election, one will see they have miserably failed. In fact, people have reposed their faith and confidence in the BJD, which has gained because of its dynamic leadership and welfare programmes for tribals. The people living in urban pockets will not understand the importance of Re 1-a-kg rice scheme but it has been a game-changer for the tribals, particularly Bondas. The scheme has saved them from starvation and is a big help at a time when their crops are destroyed by rain. Similarly, the Rs 300 monthly pension scheme for old people has also helped BJD strengthen its position. What issues do you wish to take up as an MLA? A number of rivers criss-cross the Malkangiri district but we are unable to provide irrigation facilities to our people. If we are able to come up with the proposed Saptadhara project, farmlands in our area will be irrigated. The state government has already initiated steps to this effect and made a budget estimate of Rs 26 crore for the project. Work on the Gurupriya bridge project, which will link the districts mainland areas with the cut-off areas (bicchinanchal), is on in full swing. The project will overcome the problem of transport and communication. The ongoing Vijaywada-Ranchi Highway, once completed, will also boost communication. Health and education also remain major concerns. But the good thing is that government has posted 27 doctors in our district. Another issue is the fear haunting our people because of the Polavaram project in Andhra Pradesh. Maoists are against the Gurupriya project. Are you hopeful that the project will be completed? This is a dream project for the people of the area. They have waited 60 years to see the project take off. The work is going on under BSF supervision. Only 16 of the bridges 108 pillars are left to be completed. You are talking of the Polavaram project, but it seems that BJDs protest over the issue has lost steam. Our party is constantly organising movements against the project, particularly by raising the issue of the height of the dam. Because of its height, large swathes of land in our district will be submerged. Its unfortunate that despite a case pending in the Supreme Court, Andhra Pradesh is going ahead with the project. You married a woman from outside your own community. Do you support inter-caste marriage ? I have always argued in favour of inter-caste marriage as it exposes you to other cultures. But despite inter-cast marriages, one should strive to protect ones language and culture FEARLESS LEGISLATOR Sisa, 34, a postgraduate degree holder in Mathematics, is now pursuing his PhD in law from Berhampur University He studied at the residential Sarvodaya Samiti School in Koraput He joined the CRPF in 2001 in the rank of a constable before taking up a job with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) His desire to work for his community made him quit his job with NTPC and join the social sector In 2009, he contested on a BJD ticket but was defeated by a margin of only 256 votes by the Congress candidate. He emerged victorious in his second attempt in 2014 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN HAD YOU NOT BEEN A POLITICIAN? Taking into account my academic background, I would have continued with my job in the CRPF. But, I didnt want to be selfish and so decided to join the social sector and then politics."
58fed6007be9e0420db27ed0,‘BJP cannot forge alliance with BJD’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160528/jsp/odisha/story_88032.jsp,2016-05-28,"Prime minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit the state on June 2. How is the state unit preparing for the visit? Our workers are jubilant for the Prime Ministers visit to Balasore. Preparations are in full swing. We expect more than four lakh people at the meeting. Here, the Prime Minister is coming to the state to show his two-year report card to the people. Have you ever heard of anything like this in the past? Why did the party choose Balasore as the venue of the visit? Anything special about it? He has already visited and addressed people at Paradip in east Odisha, Bargarh and Rourkela in west Odisha. This time, we have requested him to come to north Odisha (Balasore being the nerve centre) and interact with the people there. We are honoured that he has kept our request. The BJP has a strong foothold in west Odisha, but has failed to make inroads into the other parts of the state. We are trying to make our presence felt by winning the confidence of the people. We want to be with the people all the time. You have already seen this. The party has been making claims about its growth in the state in the past 15 years, but the claim is not borne out by election results. Fifteen years is not a long time in politics. Failures and successes are part of life. We have ambitions and there is nothing wrong with that. Being the party president, I have faith in the dreams of Modiji to make India strong  Sabka saath, sabka vikas. We hope the BJP will come to power inthe state. The BJP is now trying to invoke the name of Biju Patnaik. The Union government has announced that it would observe Biju Patnaiks birth centenary. This is incorrect. The Modi government believes in honouring the sons of the soil. We have decided to observe the birth centenaries of around nine illustrious sons of the soils. Guru Gobind Singh and B.R. Ambdekar are not from the BJP, but we are observing their birth centenaries. We dont want politics on this. But you must be aware that Biju babu was very critical of the RSS. I dont want to comment on someones personal views. The government under the leadership of Modiji believes in the development of every one. I dont know why some people are taking it otherwise. We have noticed that the people from non-RSS backgrounds are sidelined in the party. Have they no scope to rise in the party cadres? Without foundation, a building cannot be properly constructed. We believe in One team, one dream. Perhaps, you are hinting that I have been made the party unit president only because of my RSS background. Do you think that I am not worthy of my position? People without RSS backgrounds, such as Suresh Prabhu and Yashwant Sinha, have also been successful in the BJP. But here in the state, we have noticed how Bijoy Mohapatra, K.V. Singh Deo and a few other leaders have been sidelined by the party leadership Even in a house, there are differences of opinion among brothers. There is difference of opinion between a husband and a wife. There is difference of opinion between a son and a father. But when it comes to a crunch situation, they all unite. Similarly in our party, there is difference of opinion but that does not mean we are not united. I regularly seek advice and suggestions from all senior leaders including Bijoy Mohapatra, K.V. Singh Deo, Dharmendra Pradhan, Jual Oram and others. You have been described as the man of the Union minister for state for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan. People say that those who have found berths in the partys state executive have been picked according to the wishes of Pradhan. When I joined the BJP, what was the age of Dharmendra Pradhan? Do you want to say that I was elected as district president and later on as an MLA with the blessings of Dharmendra Pradhan? My only identity is that I am a disciplined worker of the party. Whenever the party has sought my services, I have offered it. Senior BJP leader Ashok Sahu was suspended from the party because he was critical of the outgoing president K.V. Singh Deos style of functioning. But with the change of guard, the suspension was withdrawn, indicating differences in the party. Suspension is not a punishment. The party had suspended him because of some unfortunate incidents that had happened at that time. However, the situation has changed. The party analysed his work and found that his commitment to the party was unflinching. The party is also divided on the issue of the CBIs investigation into the money deposit scam. You have been quoted saying that the central agency was moving in the right direction, but there are other leaders in the party who have stated otherwise. Each person has his own point of view. Those who have commented on the CBIs (poor) performance are senior leaders of our party. I cannot comment on them. But to me, the CBI is the best investigating agency of the country and they are doing their duty. It may take some time but culprits will be punished. The party is talking of sabka vikas, but its unfortunate that despite Odishas repeated demand to release more rice for its people, it is not allocating it. It seems the Centre is playing with the people of the state A good thing has emerged from this. The people are now getting to know who is giving them the subsidised rice. The false claim of the BJD government that it is giving them the cheap rice has been exposed. I am personally happy that they had met governor S.C. Jamir on this issue and alleged that the Centre was not releasing the rice. They are trying to do politics on this issue. But it has backfired. The people have realised that the Centre is giving them rice and not the state government.I agree Odisha needs more rice. At the same time, I can say the food habit of the people has gradually changed and people have started taking wheat-based food. Two senior leaders of the BJD have accused the central government of dumping wheat in Odisha at the insistence of the wheat lobby of north India. I dont know about it and without having knowledge about something, one should not comment. As Union food and consumer welfare minister Ram Vilas Paswan has already announced that more rice would be allocated to the state on a 85:15 ratio, Naveen Patnaik government need not worry on this front. The state has been demanding special category state status for the past several years. What is the BJP state units stand on this issue? We are not like BJD, which is busy shedding crocodile tears on the special category issue. What have they done in the past 15 years? There is no development in the state. Of the total state budget of Rs 94,000 crore, the Centre is giving aroundRs 44,000 crore. At present, the state is spending Rs 45,000 crore to pay salary and pension and it is left with little money to carry out development works from its own pocket. Please be straight and say whether you are supporting the demand for a special category state or not. I will not say what you want to hear. Dont try to put words in my mouth. Being a mediaperson you should not argue for a non-performing government whose only job is to raise slogans against the Centre. We want to see Odishas development and we want it to become the number one state. The Prime Minister has already said that he wants the development of the country as well as the states. He is also focusing on the development of eastern India. We are not praising the Naveen Patnaik government. Your BJP ministers (central) are heaping praises on his government and the state is getting awards for its performances. I will not make any comment on this issue. The Centre and states relations are bound by the principle of the spirit of federalism. I am doing my duty as the states party president. My job is to encourage lakhs of party workers and instil a sense of confidence in them. My job is to strengthen party in all the 36 organisational districts and also ensure that the BJP reaches the panchayat level. Now, our team is ready to go to the panchayat polls. The chief minister is frequently meeting the Prime Minister, which was not seen during the UPA regime. He seems to have established a cordial relationship with the central leadership. Even Modi and BJP president Amit Shah had shied away from criticising Naveen. It naturally creates a doubt about the BJPs approach towards the Naveen Patnaik government. In a federal structure, it is desirable that the Centre and the state have cordial relations. Accordingly, the Prime Minister is meeting the chief minister regularly. The Prime Ministers aim is to ensure that the whole country marches on the path of development and he is focusing on the development of eastern India. He even had called the chief minister to discuss the drought situation. No one is untouchable in politics. If situation demands, there is a public perception that the BJP may enter into an alliance with the BJD... There is no chance of forging any tie with the BJD at any point of time. How can we forget how the BJD had ditched us in 2009? At this point of time, we want to play a positive role in the state, but BJD should give up its ego. The BJP always argues in favour of one man and one post. You are holding two positions  party unit president and the BJPs legislature party leader. I have already intimated the leadership about my decision to step down from the BJP legislature party leader. New names have already been sent to parliamentary board. They will take a call and announce the name. I have no role in this."

But on Tuesday, her biggest catch was not on the field but in the IIHM Delhi kitchen where a four-course meal won her the Young Chef India Schools crown. The Class XII student of La Martiniere for Girls won the Young Chef finale - held by the International Institute of Hotel Management (IIHM), in association with t2 - with a perfect play of time management, concept, technique, plating and taste. She beat six other finalists from Ahmedabad, Pune, Hyderabad, Delhi, Bangalore and Jaipur. ""My heart was beating a million times per minute in my throat! It still hasn't sunk in but I was confident about my main dish. I think that's the best I've ever cooked in my life!"" said the senior prefect of LMG who made her school proud. ""We want to congratulate her. She is a true picture of a Martinian who is an all-rounder, dedicated to her work. She is the best goalkeeper of the school's football team, is a dancer and despite living in the hostel with limited resources and access and maintaining all the rules and regulations, she manages to participate in all kinds of activities and excel,"" said Rupkatha Sarkar, principal of La Martiniere for Girls. At Tuesday's finale held on the Delhi campus of IIHM in Badarpur, Agnes along with six other finalists donned aprons and hats in order to cook up a storm, one last time. It wasn't an easy feat. There were two rounds. The first was cooking the classic French dessert Oeufs a la Neige (also known as Floating Islands) in one hour. The second was cooking a main dish that's ""Indian at heart"", along with two accompaniments, in two hours. ""After the first round, I wasn't so confident because I did face some difficulties in making my Ouefs a la Neige but I think I nailed my main dish,"" an excited Agnes told Metro post the cook-off. The girl, whose idol in the culinary world is Sanjeev Kapoor, was inspired by south Indian cuisine and she whipped up Fish Karakozumbhu, Meen Moilee, Deconstructed Sambhar and Vendakkai Vepudu in just two hours. ""Since I'm from Calcutta, I knew that people would expect me to make Bengali food and I didn't want to do anything expected. Instead, I thought of my childhood vacations spent at Vizag (her father is from there), where I would gorge on Tamarind Rice and curries with coconut milk and decided to present that to the judges,"" said the girl who was christened ""Rosogolla"" by her fellow contestants. Just like the semis, when she didn't have lime for her Lemon Rice, Agnes didn't have the tamarind required for her sambhar. But instead of freaking out like last time, she used lemon to make her sambhar sour. ""Thinking on the spot has saved me multiple times. I just wanted to work with simple flavours, make them well and present them in a different way. Also I feel that Anglo-Indian and south Indian cuisine are somewhat similar,"" said Agnes, a big smile plastered on her face. Wearing the judges' hat on Tuesday were celebrity chef and principal judge Ranveer Brar, director of culinary arts, IndiSmart Group, chef Sanjay Kak of IIHM and chef Sabyasachi Gorai of Lavaash by Saby; t2 food columnist Shaun Kenworthy played mentor. ""Overall, Agnes's dish was comfort food, very well balanced but at the same time showed sparks of brilliance. The toasted coconut in the sambhar and the quenelling of the Karakozumbhu were amazing touches so that's where she scored,"" said chef Brar. ""Whatever she planned, she executed it very well and she was very calm and poised. Her main dish was basic Indian food with modern twists and she didn't overdo it by cooking a lot of components, which went against some other contestants,"" said chef Kak. This is the sixth edition of Young Chef India Schools. ""When we created this competition in 2011, I wanted youngsters to know basic cooking as it is a life skill like driving or swimming. As we moved forward, I realised the huge demand for Indian chefs not just in the country but across the world. Most of the participants from previous years are now pursuing a career in the culinary and hospitality field and that's great news for the ever-expanding Indian hospitality industry,"" said Suborno Bose, CEO of IIHM. Apart from the winner, five other prizes were given out at the awards ceremony - The Jury Award went to Karanveer Singh Arora from Delhi, Best Dessert Award was bagged by Sejal Lobo from Bangalore, Sushaanth Kuttua from Hyderabad took home the Most Organised Chef Award, Digital Savvy Chef Award was won by Sanjana Mukherjee from Ahmedabad. Agnes also took home an award for the Best Main Course. And, of course, prize money of Rs 5 lakh that she will use for her ""college fund"". ""Now, I know for sure that I want to be a chef,"" she told Metro before attending to a Skype call from her friends. ""OMG! I can't believe it, you guys!"" she screamed on the phone.

The growth in exports have fallen for the US (3.87 per cent), the European Union (0.04 per cent), China (25.34 per cent) and Japan (1.10 per cent) for February over the year-ago period according to WTO statistics,"" the commerce ministry said in a statement.Exports have been falling since December 2014 on account of a weak global demand and slide in oil prices. However, exporters saw early signs of revival in shipments.A slide in exports has been arrested to some extent both in March and April. We hope that exports will move into the positive territory from June, said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.He said, ""Fourteen out of 30 products, for which data have been released, are showing a positive growth. Gems and jewellery, organic and inorganic chemicals, plastic goods and electronic goods have shown promising results, which augur well for the future.""A subdued gold demand, because of a jewellers' strike and a sharp rise in prices, led to an annual fall of 60 per cent. Imports of the yellow metal totalled $1.2 billion, down from $3.1 billion a year ago.Slump in global crude prices drove down the oil import bill by 24 per cent to $5.66 billion last month over the year-ago period. Import of fertilisers declined 58.90 per cent to $281 million and sulphur and unroasted iron pyrites by 44.28 per cent to $9.01 million.

(AFP) July 9: Nearly 1,100 people in Golaghat and Jorhat districts in Upper Assam are taking shelter in six relief camps as over 1.05 lakh people in Assam remained affected by floods that inundated many areas in five districts. The daily flood bulletin of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority this evening said Lakhimpur, Golaghat, Jorhat, Morigaon and Barpeta were impacted by the floods. The Brahmaputra was still flowing above the danger mark at Neematighat in Jorhat and Dhubri in lower Assam. The Dhansiri crossed the danger level in Numaligarh in Golaghat district. Crops on 1,690 hectares in 138 villages in the five districts have been damaged in the deluge, the bulletin said. The river island of Majuli in Upper Assam has been severely eroded because of the floods. Jorhat district reported the maximum number of people (49,498) affected by the floods. The Bhogdoi has flooded 20 more villages in addition to the 20 inundated yesterday following a 100m breach in the embankment at the Malowkhat area in west Jorhat. The army and local residents are working overtime to stem the severe erosion on the embankment on the opposite side. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal today reviewed the flood situation and asked officials to gear up relief operations on a war footing at a high-level meeting at the secretariat in Dispur. He asked the health and family welfare department to keep sufficient stock of medicines to check water-borne diseases and directed the public health engineering department to provide pure drinking water in flood-affected areas. Sonowal asked chief secretary Vinod Kumar Pipersenia to instruct deputy commissioners to provide all help and support to the flood- affected people, especially in the marooned areas. He also asked the ministers and MLAs to fan out to the flood-affected areas and monitor relief operations. Kaliabor MP Gaurav Gogoi, who visited the flooded area, was heckled by residents who shouted slogans against him. The Malowkhat area in Jorhat district falls in the Kaliabor Lok Sabha constituency and Dergaon Assembly constituency. B. Bharali, the AGP legislator from Dergaon, is yet to visit the area. The villagers complained that they had not received drinking water, medicines or food. ""Gogoi has come now but he did not visit earlier,"" Anu Neog, a resident said. Circle officer (east) Utpal Doley said the river was flowing inward through the breach and about 50,000 people had been affected. He said 1,600 hectares of agricultural land have been destroyed and that a crisis of this scale was unprecedented. ""In a family of 10 members, six came out of the flooded house and four opted to remain behind. Some have shifted to the roadside or to parts of the embankment which are still holding up. Today we are trying to reach out to everyone with food and drinking water,"" he said. H.P. Mili, executive engineer, water resources department, said nearly 50 armymen, local people and his department's personnel were working to stem the severe erosion. ""We have placed geobags in places where the embankment has become eroded or dented. In front of those we have placed the porcupines to deflect the water away from these areas. We have also shored up the embankment on the other side of the river. The total stretch is about 1.5km,"" Mili said. More than 20 villages were inundated this morning when the Satrong washed away an embankment near ward 2 of Gohpur subdivision in Biswanath district. Floodwaters have been rising gradually because of heavy rainfall in neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh. People have taken shelter in three relief camps since early this morning. The civil administration of Gohpur has started providing relief to the affected. Two schools of Hazarihat village under South Salmara-Mancachar district were completely engulfed by the Brahmaputra today owing to unabated erosion on the south bank. Debabrata Saikia, leader of the Oppposition, today urged state Sonowal to seek allocation of central funds to check floods. The plea came following the Centre's decision to earmark Rs 20,000 crore for cleaning and rejuvenating the Ganga. ""The Brahmaputra should get equal focus and assistance for its development. Brahmaputra and Barak wreak havoc every year. Thousands of hectares of land get gobbled up by the river resulting in loss of life and property, reducing most of the affected to penury,"" Saikia, the Congress Legislature Party leader, said this evening. Extending his ""complete"" support to the state government if it takes up the cause of the two rivers, Saikia said: ""The Brahmaputra may be dug deep, embankments may be strengthened and multipurpose social economic project taken up for the welfare of the people living both in the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys so that these rivers may become rivers of joy instead of sorrow."""

Picture by Mehedi Hedaytullah Islampur, April 25: A village in Goalpokhar block with around 250 huts was razed to the ground in a fire that broke out in a kitchen this afternoon. No one died in the blaze, nor was anyone injured in the fire that flattened Dakshin Lodhan village with a population of about 1,200. Police said the fire started around 12.30pm. Mohammad Mostafa, a farmer from the village, 40km from Islampur town, said the flames were first spotted in his neighbour Mohammad Arshad's house. ""The fire started from his kitchen, most probably from the coal hearth. Before we could realise anything, the fire spread. There is a pond about 200m from the village but that has almost no water because of the dry spell,"" he said. ""We are poor and most of the houses here are made of bamboo and mud with thatched roofs, which the fire engulfed easily. Two fire engines came from Kishenganj after an hour. But the flames had spread so rapidly that little could be done. We could hardly save anything. Now we are looking up to the administration for relief,"" Mostafa added. The nearest fire station from the village is at Kishenganj in Bihar, 35km away. Around 2pm, four fire tenders, one from Islampur, two from Kishenganj and one from Dalkhola, 50km from Goalpokhar, arrived. Till about 7.30pm, the firemen were still at work. Abdul Karim, another farmer from Dakshin Lodhan, said: ""Had the fire engines come earlier, some huts could have been saved. We have not received any relief yet and the families are staying in the open."" Goalpokhor block development officer Raju Sherpa who visited the village, said: ""Around 250 huts, where about 1,200 people stayed, have been destroyed in the fire that broke out in a kitchen. We are trying to get an estimate of the loss. No one was injured in the blaze."" Three women were injured while trying to escape the fire or saving their belongings. They were released after first-aid at the local health centre. Sherpa said: ""We are making a list of those affected and they will be provided with polythene sheets. We are going to distribute flattened rice and jaggery among them."" Trinamul MLA of Goalpokhar, Gholam Rabbani, said he was in Calcutta. ""As soon as I heard about the fire I contacted by brother Gholam Monir. He is the saha sabhapati of Goalpokhar panchayat samity. I have asked him to ensure that the affected people get immediate relief. I am taking a train tonight so that I can be there tomorrow morning,"" he said."
58fed7617be9e0420db28134,All's not fair in Assam PDS records,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160730/jsp/northeast/story_99500.jsp,2016-07-30,"Guwahati, July 29: More than 300 ghost Gram Panchayat Samabay Samiti (GPSS) and fair-price shops are collecting rice under the public distribution system in Assam. Officials of the food and civil supplies department estimated that the number of bogus beneficiaries might be as high as one-fourth of the total beneficiaries who receive subsidised rice under the public distribution system. According to government records, there are 812 Gram Panchayat Samabay Samitis and such agencies authorised to lift rice from the districts to distribute them among BPL families. The matter came to light while digitalising the data of beneficiaries and food-lifting agencies. The digitalisation is part of the implementation of the National Food Security Act that stresses on making the food allocation process online. ""As part of the process, officials of the food and civil supplies department from each district were invited here recently. Data was taken from them about the number of samabay samitis and fair price shops. Astoundingly, the number is much more than what is there in official records,"" said a source. The source said there were no detailed addresses or contact numbers of these bogus GPSS and fair-price shops. A large number of them are in chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal's home constituency - Majuli. According to the data submitted by the officials, it was found that 905 GPSS and 215 fair-price shops are directly lifting rice from the districts. This means that 308 agencies, which are not listed in government records, are collecting rice. ""It is surprising that it took so many years for Dispur to find that such a huge number of bogus agencies were collecting rice. Dispur had been allotting rice as demanded by the districts. The data was never updated and crosschecked,"" said the source. ""If we can collect correct data of the beneficiaries and remove the bogus agencies and fair-price shops, the requirement of rice will be much less than what it is now,"" the source. The matter has come to light at a time when the Centre increased the amount of rice to 1,35,479 tonnes a month to Assam from this month. The amount was 1,30,233 tonnes till last month. The discrepancy in the data has halted the process of online allocation of rice under the Food Security Act. Although the Act was implemented in December last year, the online allocation system is yet to be completed. While the state government has been accusing the National Informatics Centre for the delay, the centre has been repeatedly requesting the state government to provide correct data. Official documents said Majuli, Udalguri, Tezpur, Dhemaji, Jonai, Sivasagar and Charaideo are some of the subdivisions where some fair-price shops are lifting rice directly from the corporation to distribute among beneficiaries. According to the system, a fair price shop should collect rice from samabay samitis and not the corporation. Sources said Dima Hasao district has been ignoring repeated requests from Dispur to send data on its beneficiaries. This is adding to the delay in making a complete databank of beneficiaries."
58fed7dd7be9e0420db281e8,Professor who inspired 'fat tax',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160721/jsp/nation/story_97930.jsp,2016-07-21,"Muhammed Kabir Thiruvananthapuram, July 20: As Kerala's finance minister Thomas Isaac made headlines by introducing ""fat tax"" on junk food, economist Muhammed Kabir was quietly rejoicing from the shadows, happy that his fight against unhealthy food had begun to bear fruit. It was on an email suggestion from the city-based, retired economics professor that Isaac had incorporated the 14.5 per cent levy in his budget. Kabir is happy Isaac acknowledged his contribution on Facebook but upset that he has taxed the health-friendly rice bran oil, which is ""counterproductive and against the spirit of a system of fat tax"". A pragmatist, Kabir admitted there was a world of difference between practice and preaching and that it would be difficult to stop people from eating unhealthy food unless it became prohibitively expensive. Kabir, who retired as head of the department of economics of Government Women's College, told The Telegraph he had taken up the question of fat tax with Isaac only two days before the budget. ""I'm very happy he understood its importance and implemented it, even though it was a last-minute suggestion."" Two days after the budget, on July 19, Isaac wrote on his Facebook page: ""It was Muhammed Kabir, a college teacher who studied in the Centre for Development Studies, who put forth this demand (to introduce fat tax) in an email."" Isaac was a faculty member at the Centre for Development Studies, a city-based social research institute, when Kabir was a student there. So what made the economist go after pizzas and burgers? ""Concern for public health,"" says Kabir, and attributes it to his PhD guide and economist, late T.N. Krishnan. ""Krishnan's area of interest was public health and it attracted me too. We did a joint paper in 1992 titled 'Social intermediation and health changes: Lessons from Kerala'. That's how I grew interested in public health,"" he said. Kabir was also part of a Dutch-funded study on Kerala's Health Status between 2004 and 2007. The study, conducted in Kannur, Malappuram and Thiruvananthapuram, showed that ""lifestyle diseases were on the rise and constituted a major chunk of morbidity rates in Kerala"". ""During my PhD days, I came across literature about how Denmark imposed fat tax and withdrew it within a year,"" Kabir said, adding that Denmark's failure should not discourage Kerala. ""Denmark was unsuccessful because people started smuggling the taxed items from neighbouring Germany and Hungary. That scenario cannot be applied to Kerala,"" he opines. The retired professor conceded there was nothing to directly link obesity to calorie intake, but added it was well known that there was definitely a link between what people chose to eat and their health. He referred to a 2011 study on school students in Kochi. Done by Alice T. Cherian, Sarah S. Cherian and Sobhana Subbiah of the department of paediatrics of city-based Lakeshore hospital, the study on 1,634 students from three schools between the ages of 6 and 15 found that 3 per cent boys and 5.3 per cent girls were obese. About 10.2 per cent boys and 12.1 per cent girls were overweight. The study said instances of obesity and excess weight were found more among the high-income group and was lowest among children of the low-income group. ""The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the Upper Income Group in this study is comparable to levels of overweight and obesity in developed countries,"" it said. The study attributed the trend to ""easy access to calorie-rich foods with growing economic prosperity coupled with lack of awareness in parents about childhood obesity and nutritive diets"". ""A UN report had placed India in the list of top 10 countries with obese people,"" Kabir said, explaining how agrarian Kerala, known for its healthy food habits that have deep links with ayurveda, had changed since the Gulf boom in the mid-nineties. ""There is something called demonstration effect. It refers to the idea that people expect or want to buy or have things because they see that other people are able to have them. It happened after the Crusades when Europeans felt an affinity for things eastern,"" said Kabir. ""Same happened to Malayalis who went to Persia, which was what Gulf was popularly referred to as. But what they brought back from places like Dubai was not just the money, but also the culture. ""After 1985, Kerala's economic growth picked up after long stagnation mainly due to the Gulf income. The prosperity also influenced food habits and people moved away from traditional cuisines. ""National Sample Survey Organisation data shows... a fall in the proportion of income spent on cereals and increase in the proportion spent on non-cereals, meat, egg and packed foods. What has happened to Kerala is that this change in consumption patterns has not been in a manner beneficial to people's health."" Wouldn't it be more appropriate to tax porotta and beef than junk food to which exposure is still limited? ""Porotta and red meat are dangerous to health and must be discouraged with more taxes. Hope that happens in the next stage,"" said Kabir. Asked a similar question, Isaac wrote on his FB page: ""It is not yet time to tax porotta and beef which is consumed by common people. Unlike in the West, it is the elite sections which eat the food items that have been brought under tax net. Let the debate go on. Then we can bring more and more unhealthy foods in the net."" On his objection to taxing rice bran oil, Kabir said it was one of the healthiest of edible oils as it had little saturated fat. ""Taxing it would be opposite to the concept of fat tax."" He added: ""Isaac explained at a seminar that it was only for the purpose of adjusting MRP and was not to disincentivise the health alternative."" The minister could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts. Asked if he was hopeful that higher taxes would stop people from having junk food, Kabir breaks into a smile and refers to his two-year-old granddaughter. ""She was so thin that doctors advised that she be given meat and other fat-rich foods. ""Now she knows almost every chicken and shwarma outlet on the way from our home to the city. She is so fond of it and there's no point trying to dissuade her."" If family could not be dissuaded, how could the rest of the world be persuaded? Kabir is candid: ""A noted Malayalam poet once wrote a poem on ahimsa. A Gandhian liked it very much and called on the poet to express appreciation. ""But what he saw there shocked him. The poet was biting into a juicy chicken leg. The upset visitor asked him how come he was a non-vegetarian and writing on ahimsa. To this the poet replied that the poem was his philosophy and what the visitor witnessed was his life."" Kabir continued: ""What I mean to say is it will be difficult to deter people unless junk food becomes prohibitively expensive. Tax should be imposed in such a way that demand becomes elastic. That is to say the demand should fall with rising prices. Let's wait and see if the fat tax makes demand for food items elastic. If not, we must even think of increasing it."" He said his suggestion about fat tax was based on two grounds. ""One, the incidence of life-style diseases and, two, the level of obesity in Kerala. ""As per NFHS 2005-06, Kerala is next only to Punjab in terms of obesity. About 17.8 per cent men in Kerala (against 22.2 per cent in Punjab) and 28.1 per cent women (against 29.9 per cent in Punjab) have a BMI of more than 25. The relationship between obesity and life-style diseases, including coronary heart diseases, diabetes and strokes, is known."" It was not just consumption of fat-rich food but sedentary lifestyle that added to the danger, he said. ""A part of the tax so collected may be used to build gymnasiums and other health-improving infrastructure in the rural areas,"" he suggested."

Rehana Khatun, 38, mother of two daughters, epitomises the axiom that determination and relentless pursuit of a goal always lead to success. Born in the Badharghat area of Agartala, she has five sisters and a brother. Her father was a poor day labourer and part-time rickshaw-puller. ""I used to stand first in all annual exams of Badharghat High School and my teachers were always very affectionate towards me and would help me with books. After I cleared Class VII, my father started preparations for my wedding. My teachers requested him not to marry me off so early, but he had his obligations. So I was married off at 14,"" Rehana said over phone. Her husband, Akhtar Ali, 45, is a poor man with a small paddy field. He sells puffed rice in the Bishalgarh market. Rehana accompanies him to make ends meet. Akhtar never stood in the way of his wife's aspirations, but after the birth of their elder daughter Nisha, she had to discontinue studies for several years. ""My husband got me admitted to Bhadrabati School in Durganagar village and I got admission to Class IX. However, I could not continue my studies after Nisha was born. When Nisha was promoted to Class IX, I felt that I might as well try to pass the Madhyamik,"" Rehana said. She contacted the teachers of Badharghat High School and they were very forthcoming. ""My teachers coached me once a week for which I had to come to Agartala. Their affection enabled me to get through Madhyamik Examination in 2013 as an external candidate."" Nisha got into Class XI last year and Rehana started preparing for higher secondary exams with books purchased for her daughter. With help from the headmaster and teachers of Koroimura Higher Secondary School near her home, Rehana appeared for this year's Higher Secondary Examination and got 55 per cent marks. She is determined to obtain a university degree with honours in Bengali."
58fed8277be9e0420db28264,Powerless morning for western Patna,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160630/jsp/bihar/story_93922.jsp,2016-06-30,"Over 6 lakh residents of western Patna and adjoining areas were affected on Wednesday morning as the power supply went off for several hours, throwing lives out of gear and hampering the routine of students and office workers. Power went out around 7.30am - as people were getting up or rushing through their daily chores - affecting Danapur, Khagaul, Phulwarisharif, Saguna Mor, Rupaspur, Jagdeo Path, Ashiana Mor, Rajiv Nagar, Raja Bazaar, AG Colony, Punaichak, Digha, Kurji, Sadaquat Ashram, Pataliputra Colony, Boring Road, Rajapur and several other areas. At first, people took it as a regular load shedding but the supply did not resume even after an hour. Thanks to the defunct public water supply system, a majority of people living in the areas of western Patna are forced to rely on borings or borewells that need electric motors to pump out water. So the power cuts immediately cut off water supply as well. ""I was just waiting for the power to come back when the stored water ran out. The entire work of my household, right from bathing and cleaning to cooking, suffered. I could not even use the toaster, mixer-grinder or rice cooker. My husband went to work and my son went to school without taking a bath or having a proper meal,"" said Kumari Ranjana, a homemaker in the Anand Puri area. Raju Ranjan Prasad, a teacher who lives in the Sri Nagar locality, said: ""There were long power cuts throughout the morning and people living in my area suffered due to the heat and water scarcity. There is no government piped water supply system in these areas and people depend on borewells for water."" Patna Electric Supply Undertaking (Pesu) washed its hands of the problem, with general manager Dilip Kumar Singh saying Pesu had nothing to do with it and that the supply was stopped due to the closure of Khagaul and Digha electricity grid sub-stations by the Bihar State Power Transmission Company Limited (BSPTCL). Dilip added that at times power supply is stopped for project-related works like replacing electricity supply lines, installing transformers and conductors of higher capacity, repair and maintenance work but prior information about the timings of the power cuts is relayed to the people through newspapers. Though the timing for the disruption on Wednesday was scheduled between 8am and 10am, it started earlier than that and lasted almost till noon at several places. ""The Khagaul grid sub-station was shut in the morning down for maintenance work, including replacement of some equipment, which had developed faults,"" BSPTCL managing director R. Lakshmanan told The Telegraph. ""We had made an alternative arrangement of power supply from the Digha grid sub-station via the Digha-Khagaul supply line, but it tripped due to an earthing fault and overload of current."""

What does BJP want in Assam. First they will come and ask for your votes and then Assam will not be run from here, but will be run from Nagpur or the Prime Minister's Office,"" he said addressing a poll rally here in Karbi district.Gandhi said wherever BJP has gone it has brought violence and has disturbed peace and cited the example of Haryana where within months of its coming to power there was violence between jats and non-jats.""The truth is wherever BJP goes, it tries to make people fight with each other. For example in Haryana, for 10 years there was peace and no violence or anger was there when Congress was in power, but within months of BJP coming to power there was violence and jats and non-jats are fighting with each other.""You have seen what has happened in Gujarat. In Bihar they tried to bring violence before polls and in Assam too they are trying to spread violence. They will end the peace that has come here after violence stopped. They don't think about you or Assam, they just want to impose one ideology and thought on the entire country, what RSS people say,"" he said.Gandhi also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making false promises and said the people of Bihar have sent him packing in a ""direct flight"" from the state as he failed to fulfil any of the promises made to them during Lok Sabha polls.While BJP wanted one kind of thought to be imposed across the country it was Congress that took everyone along and did not want anyone to be suppressed irrespective of one's religion, caste or area, he said.""If one thought is imposed across the country, what will happen to your language, what will happen to your customs, your history. Because this country is not of anyone or one thought, but crores of people of different languages, history live here and this country belongs to all.Attacking the Prime Minister and asking people to reject BJP as they did in Bihar, Gandhi said, ""the next time Modiji comes to Assam, ask him about the promises he made to you for bringing back black money, tackle price rise, funding of Assam and providing MSP for farmers, ask him as to which promise he has fulfilled.""Because this question was posed to him by people of Bihar, as he made a lot of promises during Lok Sabha polls and when he returned during assembly polls a few months later, people of Bihar asked about these promises none of which were honoured and said he is 'deceiver' and decided to teach him a lesson. They sent him packing to Delhi in a direct flight. Now people of Assam also have to do the same.""Rahul accused Modi of not fulfilling his promises of bringing back black money, bringing down prices or addressing the plight of farmers and the poor and instead allowing people like Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi, who possessed black money, to escape from the country.""When I asked him in Parliament about his unfulfilled promises, he did not answer me,"" Gandhi said, asking people to pose these questions to Modi now when he comes to seek their votes.Rahul, however, made a host of promises himself from providing 10 lakh jobs to youth, filling up all vacant government posts, giving jobs to 2 lakh teachers, providing rice at Rs 2 a kilo, cold storage facilities and agriculture banks to farmers and housing for all.Apart from Rs 1,000 crore package announced by Tarun Gogoi, he also promised to open a medical, engineering and nursing college in the area.""We make promises and fulfil them. In the last 15 years, Congress party and Tarun Gogoi has worked for you and will work faster in the next 5 years.

(Suman Tamang) Darjeeling, June 5: Bimal Gurung today said he would invite Union ministers to inaugurate various projects being completed by the GTA as most of them were funded by the Centre, a remark which is perceived to pre-empt any move by the Mamata Banerjee government to take credit for the schemes in the hills. Talking to the media after a Gorkha Janmukti Morcha delegation met Bengal governor Keshari Nath Tripathi at Raj Bhavan in Darjeeling today, the GTA chief executive said: ""It is through central funds that we have been constructing car parking facilities, Nepali academy, model schools and auditoriums. During my last visit to New Delhi on May 26, I had invited the Union home minister to visit Darjeeling between July 11 and 17 to inaugurate the car parking facilities."" Two car parking lots are being constructed at Singamari and near Darjeeling railway station. ""Since the Centre has funded these projects, we have to invite Union ministers to inaugurate them... we will invite central leaders to launch the projects funded by the Union government,"" said Gurung. Observers said Gurung had referred to the central assistance to implement various projects in the hills so that the Trinamul government didn't take credit for the same ahead of the municipal and GTA elections. ""The distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg to BPL families has helped Trinamul to a great extent in the just-concluded Assembly polls. But the fact is that the state is implementing the scheme with central funds. Gurung seems to be aware of it and doesn't want Mamata to stake claim to the projects,"" said an observer. In the Assembly polls, the Morcha's victory margin has come down in the three hill seats compared to the 2011 elections. While elections to four municipalities in the hills are slated for December, those to the GTA are due next year. Regarding the relation with the state, Gurung today said: ""The Trinamul Congress has formed the new government. We have to create a good atmosphere for the welfare of the people and for development to take place."" Asked if he would meet Mamata during her next visit to Darjeeling, Gurung said: ""I will definitely meet her as protocol demands so."" During the times of strained relations between the duo, Gurung didn't meet Mamata during her visits to the hills. Talking about the Morcha delegation's meeting with the governor, Gurung said: ""We took up with him the issue of proper transfer of departments from the state to the GTA, implementation of three-tier pachayats in the hills, granting land rights to tea garden and cinchona plantation inhabitants and giving tribal status to 11 communities."" Later in the day, Gurung attended a meeting organised by the 11 communities seeking the ST status at Gorkha Rangamanch Bhavan here. He urged leaders of the 11 communities to prepare detailed documents on the respective communities."

Bichabhanga Primary School, on the fringes of Gorumara National Park, now does not know where to hide the rice. Last night, the rice meant for 90 students was kept on the top of a watchtower as the small school kitchen had been broken into by a herd of elephants. This morning, the watchtower was found damaged and the rice eaten. The wild elephants are visiting the school at regular intervals. Since the first week of June, the elephants have come here at least six times. Every time, the animals have damaged walls of the school and furniture to eat the rice in the school, Khurshed Alam, a schoolteacher said. Even the small kitchen we had was damaged by the animals. It seems the school has become a place for the elephants to get fodder. As they are aware that rice is being kept here, they are coming here again and again. We dont know how the rice can be saved from the wild elephants, the teacher said. Interestingly, it was not only the school building that the elephants were searching for food. After repeated incidents last month when the mid-day meal rice was consumed by the herd, we decided to keep the sacks at a watch tower close to the school. Yesterday night, the elephants came and this time, they damaged the watchtower and devoured the rice. We have approached the sub-divisional administration in Malbazar to help us as we have no idea where we should keep the rice, Alam said. Forest officials, when asked about such repeated visits of wild elephants, said it was usual for jumbos to do this. The elephants have understood that easy fodder is available in the school. That is why they are visiting the site again and again. They can smell rice easily and it would not help even if the rice is concealed somewhere, a senior forester said. The animals can be prevented from visiting the school if the rice is not kept there. There are cases when it has been found that after foraging for fodder in a known area for two-three days, if the elephants do not get it there, they leave that site and go to other places. In the Dooars, elephant attacks on schools on the fringes of forests in blocks such as Metelli and Nagrakata are common. We have reports from different schools, mostly primary schools, that elephant herds are damaging the buildings and taking away rice kept there. Some schools had tried to store the rice by burying the sacks under the floor but even that did not help, J. Tanti, the SDO of Malbazar, said. We will soon speak to forest officials on the issue."
58fed9067be9e0420db283cb,'Copycat' manifesto barbs fly in TN,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160507/jsp/nation/story_84365.jsp,2016-05-07,"S Ramadoss, Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi Salem, May 6: Political parties in Tamil Nadu would do well to get a copyright on their election manifestos. Allegations of plagiarism are flying thick and fast, with at least three parties accusing others of lifting their poll promises. The PMK was the first to complain, after the DMK released its manifesto on April 10. It alleged that the Dravidian major had incorporated many of the promises listed in the PMK's draft manifesto circulated last September. ""The DMK has copied 42 schemes we had proposed in that draft,"" PMK founder S. Ramadoss said while releasing his party's manifesto on April 15. The PMK's promise of a separate budget for agriculture and government repaying educational loans had been stolen by the DMK, he said. But the DMK said its manifesto had been prepared by a committee that toured the state for six months, meeting various stake-holders to get inputs. ""There is no need to copy anyone. We have in the past presented novel manifestos that were also practical,"" countered former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran. After Jayalalithaa released her much-delayed manifesto yesterday, it is the DMK's turn now to cry ""she copied us"". The party today listed 16 schemes promised in the DMK manifesto that had been either repeated exactly in the AIADMK document or had merely been tweaked. ""While our promise of 200 units of free power to handloom weavers and 750 units for power loom weavers has been repeated verbatim, the monthly power billing has been altered to 100 free units every two months. We promised to bring down the milk price by Rs 7 a litre (to Rs 27 from the present Rs 34) and Jayalalithaa announced she would supply it at Rs 25 per litre. It is ironic that it was her government that had hiked power and milk prices steeply,"" DMK spokesperson T.K.S. Elangovan said. Jayalalithaa's promise of at least one job in every family was first made by the PMK. The DMK is claiming that it had also promised an Android phone to families that could not afford one and that Jayalalithaa has made it appear that she was the first to offer a cellphone to each family. ""We had targeted the phone only to those families without one and had not blown it into a big issue as we wanted to play down even the odd freebie in our manifesto,"" Elangovan said. The DMK said its promise of either a mixer or grinder in 2011 had been adopted by Jayalalithaa, who promised both as well as a table fan. ""Similarly our manifesto has inspired her this year as well,"" Maran said. Refuting this, an AIADMK leader said former ministers and retired IAS officers had put their heads together to come up with Amma's dream manifesto. ""Amma herself incorporated a few schemes before it was finalised,"" he said. Not to be left behind, even the BJP has accused Amma of running away with its central schemes. ""She announced ""Thooimai village"" (clean village) yesterday. It is nothing but Swachh Bharat and the funds would come from the Centre. She is giving away free rice as ""Amma Arisi"" (Amma rice) when the Centre gives Rs 32 per kg and the state only Rs 3. Whatever we give, she puts the Amma label on it,"" Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said today."
58fed91c7be9e0420db283f2, journalist Sydney Schanberg dead,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160710/jsp/foreign/story_95846.jsp,2016-07-10,"(From left) New York Times correspondent Sydney Schanberg with Dith Pran in Cambodia in August 1973; Actor Haing S. Ngor as Dith Pran and actor Sam Waterston as Schanberg in Roland Joffes Killing FieldsJuly 9: Sydney H. Schanberg, a correspondent for The New York Times who won a Pulitzer Prize for covering Cambodia's fall to the Khmer Rouge in 1975 and inspired the film The Killing Fields with the story of his Cambodian colleague's survival during the genocide of millions, died today in Poughkeepsie, New York. He was 82. His death was confirmed by Charles Kaiser, a friend and former Times reporter, who said Schanberg had a heart attack on Tuesday. A restive, intense, Harvard-educated newspaperman with bulldog tenacity, Schanberg was a nearly ideal foreign correspondent: a risk-taking adventurer who distrusted officials, relied on himself in a war zone and wrote vividly of political and military tyrants and the suffering and death of their victims with the passion of an eyewitness to history. In the spring of 1975, as Pol Pot's Communist guerrillas closed in on the capital, Phnom Penh, after five years of civil war in Cambodia, Schanberg and his assistant, Dith Pran, refused to heed directives from Times editors in New York to evacuate the city and remained behind as nearly all western reporters, diplomats and senior officials of Cambodia's American-backed Lon Nol government fled for their lives. ""Our decision to stay,"" Schanberg wrote later, ""was founded on our belief - perhaps, looking back, it was more a devout wish or hope - that when the Khmer Rouge won their victory, they would have what they wanted and would end the terrorism and brutal behaviour we had written so often about."" But when the guerrillas rolled in, after a brief period of calm, there was widespread shooting, looting and many executions. Schanberg and Dith were seized and threatened with death. ""Most of the soldiers are teenagers,"" Schanberg noted in his last dispatch. ""They are universally grim, robotlike, brutal. Weapons drip from them like fruit from trees - grenades, pistols, rifles, rockets."" Dith's pleas saved Schanberg, and the two journalists took refuge in the French embassy compound, a vestige of colonial rule. Later, Dith and other Cambodians were expelled from the compound and forced to join an exodus of civilians into the countryside. It was the beginning of a monstrous social experiment: the expulsion of millions from cities and the suppression of educated classes to recast Cambodia as an agrarian utopia. The failed experiment over the next four years cost the lives of two million people to starvation, disease, slave-labour brutality and murder. Two weeks after his capture, Schanberg and other foreigners were evacuated by truck to Thailand, where he filed the first account of the fall and emptying of Phnom Penh. He told of massacres and fires, of streets and roads littered with bodies, of forced marches that turned the city overnight into a graveyard. ""Two million people suddenly moved out of the city in stunned silence - walking, bicycling, pushing cars that had run out of fuel, covering the roads like a human carpet,"" he wrote. ""A once-throbbing city became an echo chamber of silent streets lined with abandoned cars and gaping, empty shops. Streetlights burned eerily for a population that was no longer there."" Schanberg returned to New York. Overwhelmed with guilt over having to leave Dith behind, he asked for time off to write about his experiences, to help Dith's refugee wife and four children establish a new life in San Francisco and to begin the seemingly hopeless task of finding his friend. He was showered with awards, including the Pulitzer, which he said he shared with Dith. He also became a metropolitan editor and columnist at The Times. For years there was no news of Dith, who had disguised his educated background and survived beatings, backbreaking labour and a diet of insects, rodents and as little as a tablespoon of rice a day. In 1978, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and replaced Pol Pot with a client regime. Dith escaped over the border with Thailand in 1979 and was soon reunited with Schanberg. After moving Dith and his family to New York and helping him obtain a job as a photographer at The Times, Schanberg wrote The Death and Life of Dith Pran, a 1980 cover article for The New York Times Magazine, which was later published as a book. The story became the basis for Roland Joffe's 1984 movie, The Killing Fields, starring Sam Waterston as Schanberg and Haing S. Ngor as Dith. Ngor, who won an Oscar for best supporting actor, was a physician who had also survived the Cambodian holocaust. The film was widely praised. "" The Killing Fields emerges as an emotionally charged vision of hell on earth, a jolting reminder of the wanton destruction of a gentle people by another of history's madmen,"" Kathleen Carroll wrote in The Daily News. But Vincent Canby of The Times called it ""diffuse and wandering"", adding, ""Something vital is missing, and that's the emotional intensity of Schanberg's first-person prose."" Sydney Hillel Schanberg was born in Clinton, Massachusetts. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

Shanmuganathan at the interactive session at Raj Bhavan in Shillong on Wednesday. Picture by UB Photos Shillong, May 11: The special guests at Raj Bhavan were excited about the opportunity to have an audience with the first citizen of the state and sharing their stories with him while Governor V. Shanmuganathan saluted them for being an inspiration. Students and representatives of NGOs working with physically challenged persons were invited to Raj Bhavan today. State government officials, including additional chief secretary Hector Marwein and those from the social welfare department, were also present. The NGOs include Jyoti Sroat School, Roilang Livelihood Academy, Mary Rice Centre, School and Centre for the Hearing Handicapped Children, ASHA School, Dwar Jingkyrmen and Agency for Sustainable Development Initiatives (KJP Synod Sepngi). Introductions were exchanged and representatives of the NGOs and the physically challenged persons shared their experiences and problems with the governor. Senior coordinator of Bethany Society, Bertha G. Dkhar, who is visually impaired, gave an impressive speech narrating the hardship of physically challenged persons. Dkhar informed the gathering that Meghalaya has around 45,000 physically challenged persons and the number of such persons who had come to Raj Bhavan was very few. ""Thousands of persons with disabilities are confined to their homes, especially in the rural areas, where they have no access to services or rehabilitation. The number of children with disabilities is very small in our schools and we do not have schools for persons with disabilities run by the government,"" she said. Dkhar lamented that the state did not have trained teachers to cater to the needs of the physically challenged and that only 50 special educators were working in the entire state. However, she said, the persons with disabilities were hopeful that their problems and shortcomings would be rectified with the help and support of the government. ""Many a time, persons with disabilities are termed extra-ordinary. I do not know how we are extra-ordinary because we are ordinary citizens and we do not want to be objects of charity. We believe that we can live together in an inclusive society,"" Dkhar said. She urged the governor to take up the pending Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill with Prime Minister Narendra Modi so that it can be passed by Parliament in the interest of the physically challenged persons. A few students, including those of Jyoti Sroat School, spoke at the gathering while representatives of the NGOs narrated the problems faced by them and sought support from the governor. The speeches and interactions were interpreted by an interpreter through sign language for the benefit of the persons with disabilities. Shanmuganathan hailed his guests by saying, ""You are the inspiration and you give confidence to many people. For you, there is no word like impossible in the dictionary."" He dwelt on the success stories of legends such as John Milton who suffered from physical disability. Though blind, he became one of the greatest English poets. The governor also narrated the feat of India's star mountaineer Arunima Sinha, who lost her leg but successfully scaled Mount Everest."
58fedab47be9e0420db2867b,Rainfall low but no crop worry yet,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160630/jsp/nation/story_94049.jsp,2016-06-30,"Crop weather specialist Nabansu Chattopadhyay isn't worried yet by the multiple patches of dark red on a map of India on his computer displaying rainfall deficit zones since the start of the 2016 monsoon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has documented 12 per cent lower than expected normal rainfall across the country between June 1 and June 29, but 36 per cent of India's land area has received deficient or scanty rainfall. While the monsoon's onset was delayed in many parts of India, weather scientists say the delayed advance is not expected to have any significant impact on the amount of rainfall. Crop performance largely hinges on the rainfall during July and August, they add. ""Sowing activities are proceeding as expected in several places despite the rain deficit,"" said Chattopadhyay, a senior agrometeorologist at the IMD Pune, who is among scientists tracking the monsoon's progress and providing guidance to farm activities. ""Rice transplantation has already started in Kerala, coastal Karnataka, and Konkan and Goa and rice seedlings are waiting in nurseries for transplantation in Odisha, Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, among other rice-growing areas,"" he said. Scientists say there is nothing in the behaviour of the monsoon thus far to indicate any deviation from the IMD's long-range forecast that India would receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall during the four-month season from June to September. India's kharif crops such as rice, maize, pigeonpea, sugarcane and groundnut, among others, rely significantly on monsoon rains. ""But a 12 per cent rainfall deficit during June is no cause for any alarm,"" said Vadlamudi U.M. Rao, the president of the Association of Agrometeorologists. ""Even some amount of weak rain during June helps in preparing land and soil, but July and August are crucial for most crops."" Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch have experienced the largest rainfall deficits during June, with Gujarat receiving 80 per cent lower than normal rainfall and Saurashtra and Kutch receiving 72 per cent lower than normal rainfall. ""There is still time, but only a week or two - after that we'll have to think about alternative crops for this region,"" said Vyas Pande, professor and head of agrometeorology at Anand Agricultural University. ""Farmers can wait at the most until mid-July - beyond that they could face the risk of reduced yields,"" he said, referring to cotton and groundnut, the main kharif crops cultivated in the state. The IMD, in its long-range forecast issued earlier this year, had predicted that rainfall would be above normal during July (107 per cent of long-period average) and August (104 per cent of the long-period average.) #Some parts of eastern India, including the Gangetic region of Bengal and Bihar, have experienced subdued rainfall activity soon after the monsoon advanced there between June 17 and 19. Meteorologists have attributed this to changes in wind patterns that drove moisture to southern Odisha and coastal Andhra Pradesh. Gangetic Bengal has a current rainfall deficit of 28 per cent, while Bihar's rainfall is 17 per cent below the expected amount over the past four weeks. ""Computer forecasts predict rainfall will pick up in the coming two weeks,"" said P. Chandra Sekhara Rao, a senior meteorologist at the IMD. ""After the onset, the rains don't fall every day, there are break periods. Moreover, we're still in the aftermath of an El Nino that is just going away,"" he said, referring to subtle changes in the Pacific sea surface temperatures that have in the past been linked to poor monsoon rainfall."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, June 17: At a time when most people live their lives online, can the Lord be left far behind? No, He cannot be and several websites are out to prove that. Websites, both national and regional, are offering mahaprasad, the food offered to Lord Jagannath and His siblings, online. Devotees who cannot make it to the temple in Puri can get the mahaprasad delivered to their homes. And with rath yatra knocking at the doors, websites are feeling the rush of advance booking. According to popular belief, the mahaprasad consolidates human bond, sanctifies sacraments and grooms the departing soul for its journey towards heaven. As a result, the demand for mahaprasad across the country is high. Shakti Prasad Palo started shrikhetra.com to meet the demand for mahaprasad and make handicraft products from Puri available across the country. His products include the dried mahaprasad - khaja and dry rice known as Nirmalya. Commenting on the authenticity of the prasad, Palo said it was procured from Anand Bazar, which is the market area inside the temple. ""We started the website around three months ago and we have been receiving orders from places such as Assam, New Delhi, Maharashtra and Bengal,"" Palo said. The portal has received several orders for rath yatra from Jagannath temple committees in other states. ""There is always a demand for the prasad that is offered during the chariot festival. So, pre-orders are quite high,"" said the 39-year-old, who is also a social activist. The portals have not limited their inventories to just the Lord's food. Holy books and handicraft products popular in Puri such as stone utensils and bamboo crafts are also available online. Several other websites such as onlineprasad.com and prasadseva.com also offer similar services. ""I ordered the prasad last week. The delivery was not on time, but the wait is always worth it when it comes to the prasad. The quantity was satisfactory as well,"" said Neerajraj Pal, who ordered from onlineprasad.com. In 2013, the Puri temple administration had decided to start online services from its official website, but the project failed to take off. ""We felt that it would hamper the temple's sanctity. So, we halted the initiative,"" Laxmidhar Pujapanda, the temple's public relations officer, said. He also warned against being duped by fake prasad that are sometimes made available online. ""The prasad might not be the original and instead they could be procured from outside shops that sells dry confectioneries. Such instances are a hindrance to the holiness of the food offered to the Trinity,"" he added."

Today, the biodiversity park added 220 varieties of paddy found in Assam and other parts of the Northeast and began their cultivation in the fields close to it. ""We sowed 10kg seeds of purple rice of Manipur, which rich in fibre and is popular not only in the country but also abroad. The indigenous varieties of paddy, which were integral parts of our rural economy, are disappearing fast. Our attempt is to protect such varieties by cultivating them."" ""We are planning to distribute the seeds of such indigenous paddy to the foreign and domestic tourists visiting our park for their promotion,"" Akhil said. ""We have taken land on lease from the nearby villagers and some others for cultivation of the paddy varieties."" ""The KMSS has also engaged local villagers and youths as tourist guides. ""Our attempt is to promote rural economy and offer employment to indigenous people. We cannot allow the indigenous seeds of paddy to disappear and give the corporate groups to spread hybrid seeds. Our park has made Kaziranga more attractive and we will try to keep up the good work,"" Akhil said. The park today opened a photo gallery displaying the archaeological sites of Assam and other states of the Northeast. ""Tourists will get a glimpse of the archaeological sites of the Northeast. We have also opened a park of 300 varieties of medicinal plants inside the garden. These medicinal plants are used by the Karbi community. It will preserve the medicinal plants used by the community in their food item. The tourists can also relish the traditional food items during their visit to the park,"" Akhil said."
58fedcb07be9e0420db289d2,Call of populism,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160520/jsp/opinion/story_86525.jsp,2016-05-20,"Winston Churchill once famously remarked of the general, Lord Montgomery, that in victory he was unbearable. It is to be hoped that a similar statement will not have to be made about Mamata Banerjee after her remarkable victory at the hustings yesterday. She deserves to bask in this moment of glory that belongs to her. Moving away from personalities, the election results also point to some broad trends in Bengal's politics and society. The people of West Bengal are not averse to change but they take their time to change things. They perhaps think in what a group of French historians in the second half of the 20th century called longue dure. For over three decades the voters of West Bengal loyally stood by the Left. Nothing seemed to make a dent in this show of loyalty. Then in one great upheaval in 2011 the people decided that the time had come to end the Left regime and to usher in change. Indeed, the removal of the Left became synonymous with Mamata Banerjee's rallying cry of paribartan or change. Having voted her to power, the people have decided to continue to support and trust her in spite of growing criticism of her regime from among the members of the intelligentsia. Change once made in 2011 is now shelved. No one quite knows when it will emerge again and what direction it will take. Perhaps the people of West Bengal think in terms of three decades as marking an epoch. Within this tendency to provide the political leadership with a sense and an opportunity of continuity, there is another trend that is worthy of note. The urban intelligentsia tends to lose faith in a political leader or a party far more quickly than those who live in rural Bengal and in district towns. Voices of criticism against the Left originated in Calcutta, which became Mamata Banerjee's first stronghold and then, only very gradually, did disillusionment spread to the villages. Similarly, critics of Mamata Banerjee's rule (like the present writer) are mostly urban dwellers. Their sentiments and arguments find no immediate echo among the common people, most of whom are in the rural world. The results rub home this point. One of the charges made against Mamata Banerjee's regime - this was highlighted by her critics and opponents - was the one of corruption. Various scams and ponzy schemes came to light; important party members were alleged to have taken bribes and so on. But these charges cut no ice with the voters. Some implications follow from this. First is that the voters do not believe these allegations. Second, the voters feel that even if these allegations are true or partially true, Mamata Banerjee is still worth voting for. This is a comment on Mamata Banerjee's personal standing among the people. And third, issues of corruption are not important enough to affect voting patterns. If the third implication above has any validity, then the yardstick of morality the people of Bengal live by stands in need of a radical review. A scandal like Bofors could bring down a prime minister but Saradha has no adverse impact on the popularity of Mamata Banerjee. A point to ponder. One plank on which Mamata Banerjee's popularity rests is the series of measures she announced as chief minister to benefit the common people. These included gifts of money to small clubs in various localities; the gift of bicycles for girls; monetary subventions for unmarried women over 18 who are studying; making available rice at a cheap price; subsidies to religious leaders and so on. Such measures are usually captured within the rubric of ""populism"". It is a term that carries with it pejorative overtones. Mamata Banerjee has made this her own brand of politics. These announcements immediately make her appear pro-people. The beneficiaries of these proposals are never concerned about what impact these have on the state's finances. The advantages of populism are obvious and Mamata Banerjee is certainly not the only political leader in India, past or present, to practise this kind of politics to garner votes. There is nothing unexpected in Mamata Banerjee's choice of populism since she actively projected herself prior to 2011 as being pro-peasant and anti-industry. In her second innings as chief minister one of the principal challenges before Mamata Banerjee will be to change the investment and the industrial climate of West Bengal. Whatever might be her rhetoric and her public posturing she knows that West Bengal is not seen as an attractive investment destination. On the other hand, having received an overwhelming endorsement from the people she might feel (and indeed will be justified in feeling thus) that there is no need to change anything, least of all her attitudes. Why bring paribartan to populism? There is one taint that Mamata Banerjee will have to remove as she settles into power the second time round. West Bengal's image and reputation have been tarnished by violence. The state is seen as a place where political cadre can do as they please and get away with it because of political patronage. There is continuity in this since this is exactly how the cadre of the CPI(M) behaved when their party called the shots. Mamata Banerjee should guarantee the safety of the people by allowing the rule of law to prevail irrespective of political and party interests. The vote is a vote for continuity in political leadership. But no political process, even a continuing one, can be totally bereft of change. In the vote for continuity is embedded the challenge - even the hope - that things will move towards the better. Mamata Banerjee has successfully made the Left disappear from the political map of West Bengal. But the big question that will continue to chase Mamata Banerjee's tenure as chief minister will centre around how successfully, if at all, she has caused a rupture with Left policies and the Left mindset. Her dependence on populism, her reliance on State control on education, her use of party cadre, her politicization of the police and the bureaucracy, her blurring of the dividing line between the party and the government - all these aspects of her rule have distinct Left lineages. They were all used by the Left Front and brought it dividends. On Mamata Banerjee, however ironical it sounds, has fallen the mantle of the Left. The border of her sari is often blue. It could very well be red."

He said the state would get more rice now as compared to what it used to through the public distribution system during the UPA regime. However, the state's food supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma countered that the state had not received any letter to this effect.Allocation of rice has been a political issue in the state with the BJD accusing the Centre of dumping wheat in the rice-consuming state.Service tax protestThe Odisha government protested the hike in service tax following imposition of Krishi Kalyan cess with effect from June 1 and demanded its roll back.

Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Six Indian ambassadors to different countries posted across the globe - tied by the common thread of their native state, Bihar - came to explore possibilities and opportunities to enhance trade, as well as, industrial and technological cooperation. The visit was part of a novel initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ministry of external affairs (MEA). During the two-day visit ending Thursday, they met Governor Ram Nath Kovind, chief minister Nitish Kumar and state government secretaries led by chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh, and representatives of various commerce and industry bodies led by the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries (BCCI) president O.P. Sah. ""It is a new beginning by the Prime Minister and the MEA. They want the Indian ambassadors to other countries to visit their native states and make efforts to establish deeper economic relations. We have noticed that in other countries, the states or provinces are very active, and interact on their own with other countries. Their economic condition is very good,"" said Prabhat Kumar, ambassador to Colombia and Ecuador. Prabhat said the role of states in global cooperation, especially with regard to economy was increasing, and the purpose of the visit was that Indian states should also follow the trend. He pointed out that Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were already pursuing it at their levels. Alok Kumar Sinha, the ambassador to Bahrain, said: ""According to the current vision of the Prime Minister and MEA, the ambassadors are geared up to give specific and proper attention to each and every request for cooperation from their native states."" Ambassador to Ukraine Manoj Kumar Bharti said it was the first time that so many ambassadors to other countries were visiting Bihar together to discuss what could be done to increase cooperation among them. The ambassadors discovered that three areas - development of human resources to provide gainful employment to people, agriculture and culture, including tourism - were the ones in which cooperation was possible between Bihar and the countries where they are currently posted. ""Ukraine is the most industrialised area of the former Soviet Union. It has excelled in various forms of energy production, and has highly developed research and educational institutions, including universities focusing on specialised areas like railways and ship designing. It has very good medical colleges too,"" Manoj said. Though Manoj pointed out that the economic condition of Ukraine was bad these days due to its conflict with Russia, Bihar could still explore to convert and upgrade some of its universities, or build new technical education institutions with its help, ""which will adhere to the 'Skill India' slogan coined by the Prime Minister"". The ambassador to Ukraine added that Bihar should make efforts to attract more tourists from Ukraine as hardly one per cent of its tourists visiting India come here. He pointed out that Bihar could also easily seek technological help from there to set up agricultural processing plants or other industries, as ""the Ukrainians were not arrogant like people from western European countries"". All the ambassadors were unanimous about tourism and cultural possibilities of Bihar. Sanjiv Ranjan, who is all set to take charge of ambassador to Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, said: ""Indian spiritual and philosophical traditions, as well as yoga were very popular in Argentina and there were around 300 yoga schools functioning there."" ""The Argentine people know about the excellence of Bihar School of Yoga at Munger. Indian companies like TCS, Bajaj, Mahindra, Sonalika Tractors are working there as the country is primarily has an agriculture-based economy. Bihar could seek cooperation from their highly developed agriculture technology. Argentina has 'agriculture process outsourcing' units just like BPOs, and IT engineers monitor fields with the help of satellite technology,"" Sanjiv said. Rajiv Kumar, the ambassador to Senegal, Gambia and Guinea Bissau pointed out that those countries import rice and textile from India and Bihar could benefit by supplying these products. The ambassadors said according to the MEA directives, they would visit their native state every year."

The committee, with former chief minister and Congress leader D.D. Lapang as its chairman, met yesterday along with a host of MLAs who are members of the committee and summoned officers from departments of health and family welfare, hospital management, planning, urban affairs and food and civil supplies. A statement issued here today said the committee had raised many important points on several projects and pointed out delays in completion and non-functional due to omissions, commissions and lack of commitment of officers. Besides Lapang, other MLAs who are members of the committee and attended the meeting were R.V. Lyngdoh, Jemino Mawthoh, Nihim D. Shira, Witting Mawsor, senior officers of the rank of additional chief secretary, secretaries, directors and other officers.

(Source: Reuters file photo) Police watch on as a man participates in a protest in Union Square after Baltimore Police Officer Caesar Goodson Jr. was acquitted of all charges for his involvement in the death of Freddie Gray in the Manhattan borough of New York. (Source: Reuters file photo)A judge acquitted a Baltimore police officer of manslaughter and other charges Monday in the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who was critically injured in a police transport van.It was the fourth straight trial prosecutors failed to win in the case.Lt. Brian Rice, the highest-ranking of six officers charged, faced charges of involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. Williams previously dismissed a second-degree assault charge, and prosecutors dropped a second misconduct charge against the 42-year-old officer, who is white.Grays death in 2015 became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, fueling outrage nationwide over the treatment of black people by the criminal justice system and prompting the worst rioting in the city in decades.But the case hasnt fit quite so neatly into the narrative of white authorities imposing unfair justice on minorities.In this case, three of the officers charged are white and three are black. The victim, judge, top prosecutor and mayor are African-American. At the time of Grays death, so was the police chief.In his verdict, Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams said the failure to seat belt a detainee in a transport wagon is not inherently a crime, adding that the state failed to prove both that Rice was aware of his duty to seat belt Gray, and that he intentionally failed in that duty.The state failed to show that the defendant, even if he was aware of the risk, consciously disregarded that risk, the judge said.Three officers have been acquitted and a fourth trial ended in a hung jury. The other officers are scheduled to be tried or retried, but Mondays verdict raises questions about those cases.Warren Alperstein, a prominent lawyer in the city who has been observing the case, said after the ruling that prosecutors have exhausted their theories and need to question whether to move forward.There are no more theories to put forth to a judge or a jury for that matter, and the state really has to think about, you know, not prosecuting anymore, Alperstein said outside the courthouse.The judge said the state failed to show that Rice was aware of an updated policy that requires officers to buckle in prisoners. As a result, Williams said he operated under the impression that Rice was guided by a previous policy that allows for officer discretion when deciding when to belt.He said the reckless endangerment charge was moot because the law doesnt apply to crimes related to motor vehicles unless the car is in motion.Gray was arrested after he ran from police officers in a high-crime area of the city. He was handcuffed and later shackled and placed on his stomach in the back of the police van. Officers did not buckle him in, which is the departments policy. Gray died a week after his arrest.Prosecutors had said Rice was most responsible of the six officers charged for following police procedures to fasten a prisoner in a seat belt, citing his 18 years of experience on the force.The officers attorney said police could use discretion, if they believe their safety is at risk. Rice attorney Michael Belsky said officers had concerns, because Gray was not cooperative and they werent sure what onlookers would do if extra time was taken to fasten Gray in the van.Prosecutors and defense attorneys gave different characterizations of the onlookers. Prosecutors described them as concerned observers, while Belsky said officers heard threatening comments during the arrest.Im disgusted, as usual, and theyre sending a daily message all across the world that our lives dont matter, and thats sad, said Tawanda Jones said outside the courthouse. She was there marking the third anniversary of her brothers death in a separate case involving Baltimore police.Were more than hashtags and body bags, she added.Baltimore States Attorney Marilyn Mosby vowed to bring justice to an aggrieved citizenry when she announced the charges last year. But she has yet to find success in court, and is being sued for defamation by five of the officers.After four trials and no convictions, its increasingly clear that the evidence against six Baltimore police officers is too weak to sustain the hopes of citizens desperate for reform.Grays family received a $6.4 million settlement from the city.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP File Photo) U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. (AP File Photo)U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday he supported the resumption of talks between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea, following an international court ruling against Beijing over the dispute earlier this month.China did not participate in and has refused to accept the July 12 ruling by the UN-backed Permanent Court of Arbitration, in which U.S. ally Manila won an emphatic legal victory.Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi had asked Kerry to lend his support for bilateral talks to restart between Manila and Beijing in a meeting between the two in the Laos capital of Vientiane on Monday.The foreign minister said the time has come to move away from public tensions and turn the page, Kerry told a news conference. And we agree with that; no claimant should be acting in a way that is provocative, no claimant should take steps that wind up raising tensions.Kerry said he would encourage Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to engage in dialogue and negotiations with China when the two meet in Manila on Wednesday. Kerry is due to travel to the Philippines later on Tuesday.Chinas dismissal of the court ruling as illegitimate presented a challenge, Kerry said. The international community, including the United States, sees the ruling as legally binding and a matter of law, he added.So we still have a task ahead of us, a challenge, which is to try to work going forward to make sure that we are resolving the issues through diplomacy and the rule of law, he said.China claims most of the South China Sea, through which more than $5 trillion of trade moves annually. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have rival claims.China has repeatedly blamed the United States for stoking tensions in the region through its military patrols, and of taking sides in the dispute, accusations Washington denies.Speaking to reporters on a conference call, a senior U.S. administration official said at the end of a visit to China by National Security Adviser Susan Rice that she had emphasised all parties should take steps to reduce tensions and use the ruling to reinvigorate regional diplomacy.Watch Video: Whats making newsRice also told Chinese officials, who included a top military officer, that U.S. military operations were designed to contribute to peace and stability wherever they happened, including in the South China Sea, the official said.Those operations are lawful, they will continue, theyve been longstanding, and again theyre designed to impart confidence and stability, he added.Vital Shipping LaneIn a meeting on the sidelines of a gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Wang told Kerry that China and ASEAN had agreed the dispute should get back onto the correct track of being resolved by direct talks with the parties concerned.China hopes the United States side takes actual steps to support the resumption of talks between China and the Philippines, and support the efforts of China and ASEAN to maintain regional peace and stability, Wang said, according to a foreign ministry statement released on Tuesday.Competing claims with China in the vital shipping lane and resource-rich sea are among the most contentious issues for the 10 members of ASEAN, who are pulled between their desire to assert their sovereignty while fostering ties with an increasingly assertive Beijing.China scored a diplomatic victory on Monday as ASEAN dropped any reference to the court ruling in a joint statement in the face of resolute objections from Cambodia, Chinas closest ASEAN ally.Speaking to reporters in Vientiane, Philippines Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay said the dispute was not between China and the United States but between China and the Philippines.We would like to pursue bilateral relationships in so far as the peaceful resolution of the dispute is concerned that is between the China and the Philippines. The others are not concerned with that dispute, Yasay told reporters.China has also accused Japan of interfering in the dispute.Chinas foreign ministry said Wang again urged Tokyo not to intervene in the South China Sea, saying Japan was not a claimant in the disputes and should avoid interfering in up the maritime spats.The China-Japan relations are still vulnerable and unsatisfactory, Wang told Fumio Kishida, Japans minister for foreign affairs.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

On Thursday, this correspondent saw eight kitchen helps out of the total 25 engaged in making rotis. ""It takes us three-four hours to prepare 500 rotis,"" one said. ""The roti-maker keeps going out of order often these days. Last time, during Id, it remained out of order for nearly 10 days."" However, RIMS dietician Kumari Meenakshi had a different story to narrate. ""The staff are careless in handling the device that results in frequent breakdowns,"" Meenakshi alleged. ""Oiling the machine and keeping the griddle (tawa) maintained properly was very important. Somehow, the kitchen staff don't follow the maintenance routine. On Tuesday night, someone put some heavy objects on the griddle after which it stopped functioning."" Usually, three staffers are engaged in making rotis on the device, Meenakshi said. But, she alleged that the staffers complained that manual labour was no less even when the device was used. They complained that preparing dough and balls to put in the device was time consuming, the dietician rued. ""They have often said that making 500 rotis for them was easier than investing time and labour for 5,000 rotis with the machine,"" Meenakshi said. If Meenakshi's accusations against the staff are any hint to how the RIMS kitchen operates, there are bigger issues that needs to be look at. At present patients are entitled to a diet worth Rs 100 each day, but what they get is hardly worth Rs 50 to Rs 60. Going by rates, pomegranates could be bought Rs 125 per kilo. What do patients get? Kitchen staff and other employees keep aside good proportion of the food,"" the source claimed. ""The food meant for patients that Dr Basundhara (RIMS deputy superintendent) checks regularly for quality is different from what is actually served to the ailing. When Dr Basundhara catches the difference, she does scold the kitchen staff. But it fall falls on deaf ears."" When Meenakshi was quizzed whether rotten mangoes were served on Tuesday, she did not deny the charge. Asked it was okay to serve rice at night to patients in monsoon, she kept quiet. ""The roti-maker will be repaired by tomorrow (Friday),"" she said. Dr Basundhara, when contacted, readily agreed when asked whether installing CCTV cameras at the RIMS kitchen was a good idea. ""It seems to be the need of the hour, considering the way things are going,"" she said."

Picture by UB Photos July 24: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal today reviewed the flood situation in the state, which has affected nearly 6.5 lakh people in 14 districts, with the Brahmaputra and its tributaries flowing above danger level following incessant rain. Sonowal instructed deputy commissioners to hold a review of the distribution of relief materials and rescue operations at 9am tomorrow. The meetings will be a daily affair till the water recedes. Sonowal will also hold a video conference with the deputy commissioners at 3pm tomorrow. ""Any lapse or reluctance on the part of officials in carrying out rescue and relief operations will not be tolerated,"" Sonowal said during a review meeting here this afternoon with water resources minister Keshab Mahanta and other top officials of the government. A press communiqu issued by the chief minister's office this evening said altogether 6.5 lakh people of 15 districts have been affected by the current wave of floods. The state government has set up 70 camps for the flood victims so far. Sonowal instructed the officials and deputy commissioners that adequate pure drinking water and essential medicines must be made available in the flood-affected areas. ""Both items are essential to prevent any outbreak of diseases,"" he said. The Kamrup (metro) district administration has prohibited plying of all boats, mechanised or manual, in the Brahmaputra, keeping in mind the rising water level and safety of passengers. Jorhat and Dhemaji been the most affected in the state, with 1,10,344 and 1,05, 474 people respectively. The government has opened 81 relief camps housing 21,931 inmates. Roads and bamboo bridges have been damaged in several areas of Majuli in Jorhat. Schools and Anganwadi centres have been partially affected by the floods and erosion. In Dibrugarh, several schools have been partially damaged and in Goalpara, flood waters have submerged a PWD road at Kalitapara and Dhumerghat Chariali. The Assam state disaster management authority has also issued a low flood situation alert for 24-48 hours in Darrang and Karimganj districts respectively. In Kokrajhar, the district administration sealed the rice godown of GB Enterprise in Kokrajhar town after the supplier provided bad quality rice to the flood-affected people in the district. Deputy commissioner M.P. Sarma said the firm was entrusted with supplying rice to the people at Kashibari, Patgaon and Habrubari. ""During distribution it was found that the supplied rice was of bad quality and unfit for consumption, he said. An FIR was lodged against the supplier, Goutam Biswas, of GB Enterprise and the godown was sealed. The supplier is now blacklisted, the deputy commissioner said. Biswas is absconding. The situation in Kokrajhar improved slightly today, with floodwaters receding slowly, though neighbouring Chirang continues to reel under floods. The villagers of Gedhabazar in Daukha Nagar, which has been flooded by the Aie river, complained that they were yet to receive any relief from the administration. The rising water level in the rivers flowing through the lower Assam districts - like Saralbanga, Swrmanga, Gongia, Longa, Gaurang in Kokrajhar and Aie Nangalbangha, Khanamakra, Taklai and Champamoti in Chirang - is attributed to heavy rainfall in upstream Bhutan where these rivers originate. Two workers, Shyamal Barma, 35 and Abdul Latif, 40, engaged in road repairs on KD Road, which was eroded by the Gangadhar river of Dhubri district, were critically injured when a part of road breached and they fell into a ditch today. They were shifted to Gauripur private nursing home, a police source said. Arunachal Pradesh has been hit hard, with chief minister Pema Khandu taking serious note of the prevailing flood situation in Tezu, Namsai and Jairampur areas. Khandu has directed the legislators of Tezu, Namsai and Jairampur- Mohesh Chai, Zingnu Namchoom and Laisam Simai - to oversee the situation. Deputy chief minister Chowna Mein has rushed back from New Delhi to the state today to inspect the flood-affected areas of eastern Arunachal, particularly Lohit, Namsai and Changlang districts. East Siang Deputy commissioner Isha Khosla has advised the people residing in low-lying areas adjacent to the Siang, to be careful and warned against boating or fishing in the river and restricted collection of gravel and movement of heavy and commercial vehicles along river banks."

58feea707be9e0420db29540,CM: Nothing done after tea takeover,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160629/jsp/bengal/story_93830.jsp,2016-06-29,"Alipurduar, June 28: Mamata Banerjee today alleged ""nothing had happened"" in the seven Duncans tea gardens whose management control the Centre took over in January and urged the Union government to ensure the workers of these closed units got wages and other benefits. The chief minister drew attention to the welfare measures her government had taken for the workers of the 14 Duncans gardens in the Dooars. On January 28, the Centre invoked a rarely used section of the Tea Act of 1953 and asked the Tea Board of India to take over the management control of the seven Duncans gardens in Alipurduar, saying they ""are being managed in a manner highly detrimental to the tea industry and to public interest"". Mamata today said the state government had taken the initiative to reopen the remaining seven Duncans gardens in the Dooars and the workers in these estates were getting wages, unlike those in the gardens whose management control has been acquired by the Centre. ""The seven tea estates that the Centre had said it would take over - nothing has happened in those gardens so far.... We will take up the matter with the Centre,"" the chief minister said after holding an administrative review meeting in Alipurduar. ""The state government did a lot and got Duncans to reopen the remaining gardens. They have been paying wages to their workers. But the gardens the Centre had decided to take over, all of them are closed now. We provide food grain and medical help to the workers and even pay their electricity bills. We have done a lot,"" Mamata added. The state government has been providing rice at Rs 2 a kg and free medical aid to the workers of 22 gardens in north Bengal, including the 14 Duncans estates. The chief minister urged the Centre to pay wages and other benefits to the workers of the seven Duncans gardens, saying the labourers had been ""left nowhere"". ""Before the elections, the Centre had said it would acquire the tea estates, but the workers of these gardens have been left nowhere. The Centre should take necessary steps,"" she added. Duncans workers have alleged irregular wage payment since April last year and deaths due to suspected malnutrition at the gardens. The CID is probing a complaint by a worker alleging non-payment of wages. Duncans had appealed in Calcutta High Court against the Centre's order. The court has directed the tea board to go ahead with the process of finding new investors for the gardens whose management control has been taken over. Santosh Sarangi, the chairman of the tea board, said: ""None of the gardens has been taken over by the tea board. Only steps to pass on the management control of the tea gardens have been taken. We had called for an expression of interest for the gardens. For three gardens, bids have been received and they are being evaluated. A fresh expression of interest for the four other gardens has been issued. Till the time the management is handed over to the bidders, paying wages to workers is the responsibility of Duncans."" At today's review meeting, Mamata discussed the possibility of reopening six tea estates that are lying closed for several years. ""There are six other tea estates which are lying closed for several years. We are planning to adopt a policy in this regard. A review of these tea estates will be done and wherever it is possible, the state will take over the garden and auction it. If we get a good buyer, the garden can be reopened. If required, we can even allow the new investor to carry out agricultural activities on a portion of the land. This can help the cause of the workers,"" Mamata said. In 2014, the state government cancelled the land lease of four of the six gardens - Dheklapara, Bundapani, Redbank and Dharanipur - as their owners appeared reluctant to reopen them. A state government does not have the authority to take over and auction tea gardens. This can be done by invoking the Tea Act, which only the Centre can do. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY R SURYAMURTHY"

Telegraph picturesb Kokrajhar, Aug. 1: The residents of 37 families at Choto Nilibari in Chirang district have endured a week of hapless misery after the Aie and its tributaries washed away their village. It was late on July 25 evening when the Aie, which flows downstream from Bhutan, charted a course of destruction. ""The river has taken away everything - our house and land. We have nowhere to go with our three bighas of land engulfed by the Aie,"" said Haita Daimary. ""The river has swallowed our land and our house,"" lamented Tezi Basumatary, 40, another villager. ""I don't know where we are going to stay. Our future is bleak,"" she added, gazing at the place which was once the site of her house, with betel nuts, jackfruit, guava and mango trees all around. Haita Daimary and his wife Longsri stand at the spot where their house used to be at Choto Nilibari The situation is the same in neighbouring Dababil and Naturbari. Eight families at Dababil and nine families at Naturbari have lost everything to the Aie's hungry tide. ""We could never imagine that there would be so much damage. As the river was rising dangerously, we tried collecting all that we could. But how much can one collect?"" asked Sunil Roy of Dababil, now camping at Subhaijhar High School. Sunil, along with eight other families of the village, has not only lost his house but also five bigha of cultivated land. ""The future of our children looks uncertain. God knows if we can rebuild our lives again, said Mahesh Basumatary of Choto Nilibari, who has schoolgoing children. ""BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary has promised us land to rebuild our houses. We hope he keeps his promise,"" he said. Tezi Basumatary at the ruins of her house The people of the three villages are now taking shelter at Subhaijhar High School and Subhaijhar community hall, about 5km away. The camp houses over 50 children, 30 of them less than six years old. Lankeswar Basumatary, the head teacher of Dababil Adivasi LP School, expressed concern over the fate of his children. Lankeswar, who hails from Choto Nilibari, has also lost his home and land. The women in the camp have also expressed concern over the food supplied by the government. ""We are getting only dal, rice and oil. How can we expect our children to survive on this? We would be happy if we are provided some vegetables and nutritious diet for the children,"" a woman with two young children said. The Aie has also breached the embankment at several places in Dangaigaon and Birhanggaon villages adjoining Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, posing a danger to the refinery and Bongaigaon town, 5km away. Hundreds of people from the flood-affected villages today came out and attempted to erect dykes at Choto Nilibari, using bamboo and boulders. Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who had visited and assessed the damage caused by erosion a few days ago, also expressed concern and stressed the need for a permanent solution to tackle the erosion."
58feeada7be9e0420db295f4,Tea unions vent subsidy grouse,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160701/jsp/siliguri/story_94176.jsp,2016-07-01,"Jyotipriya Mullick June 30: Tea trade union leaders today criticised the state government for not bearing additional subsidy on foodgrains distributed to workers in closed gardens in north Bengal. Mamata Banerjee and her cabinet colleague Jyotipriya Mullick had said the state cannot provide food grains at 45 paisa a kg to shut gardens - the rate at which foodgrains are distributed in open estates. On June 27, Mamata, while speaking to reporters in Alipurduar, had said the state was providing food grains to workers and their families of the 22-odd shut tea estates at Rs 2 a kg. ""It is true that we are providing them rice at Rs 2 a kg. You must be aware that in open markets, cost of a kg of rice is Rs 25. If you feel that the state will give relief on everything ... then how can the government run? If we could, we would have provided rice to them free of cost but we have to pay dues to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore a year.... In the open gardens, it is part of their wages,"" Mamata said in reply to a question regarding the anomaly that while workers of open tea estates were getting rice at 45 paisa a kg, those in shut gardens were paying Rs 2 for a kg. ""You should appreciate that we are providing rice at Rs 2 per kg to eight crore people of the state,"" she added. Earlier, tea planters used to provide food grains to the workers according to the Plantation Labour Act. But as the state planned to introduce the central national food security scheme - it has been named Khadya Sathi in the state - it was decided that tea planters will buy food grains from the state at Rs 2 a kg. They will bear a subsidy of Rs 1.55 and distribute the foodgrains among the workers and their families at 45 paisa per kg. But in closed tea estates where there is no management to bear the subsidy, the workers and their families need to pay Rs 2 for a kg. The grain subsidy given in the gardens is provided by the Centre. While in open gardens, the owners are facilitating the additional subsidy, in the closed gardens, it is only the central subsidy that the workers are benefiting from. The state has no hand in providing it. State food minister Mullick had told The Telegraph: ""It is true that in open tea estates, the owners are bearing the subsidy. We could not find anybody to bear the subsidy in the closed tea estates. That is why we are distributing rice among workers through self-help groups at Rs 2 a kg."" The comments have drawn criticisms from the Left tea trade unions. ""It is disappointing that the state is spending so much money to host fairs, festivals and other events but it can't bear the additional subsidy that can help the jobless and impoverished workers and their families (in shut gardens),"" Gopal Pradhan, the president of Utuc-backed Dooars Cha Bagan Workers' Union, said. ""Because of the new system, the management has been benefited. They are saving around Rs 7 against each kg of food grains as they are getting it at Rs 2 now whereas earlier, they used to buy it from the open market for around Rs 9 a kg."" Prabhat Mukherjee, the general secretary of Intuc-backed National Union of Plantation Workers, said: ""We protest such biased decision of the state. We will launch a movement if such disparity persists and there is no initiative from state's side."" According to trade union leaders, after the introduction of Khadya Sathi scheme, each family is entitled to get 35 kg of rice a month. ""If the state pays the additional subsidy of 1.55 paisa, it will have to pay over Rs 13 la-kh to provide foodgrains to about 25,000 families in the shut gardens,"" a union leader said."

Picture by Sarat Patra A tradition that dates back to more than 100 years was observed once again on bahuda yatra when men and women from 80 families assembled in front of Gundicha Temple with terracotta pots of varying sizes. These villagers from Sakhigopal near Puri come here every year on this day to prepare a special sweet dish chuda ghasa, which is a mixture of beaten rice and coconut, with milk and bananas as add-ons. They prepare it on the spot and distribute it for free among the devotees. The villagers, most of whom are involved in farming, said they never sold the special sweet that they made. While people have their own unique ways to serve the Lord during rath yatra, these residents of Sakhigopal have this sweet tradition to follow. ""We do it for spiritual satisfaction. Each of us spends around Rs 1,000 to buy the ingredients. But, it does not bother us. Since we cannot become servitors, we have found our own way to serve the Lord,"" said Sakhigopal resident Laxmi Narayan Sahoo, who was there with his elder brother. Reminiscing about the times when his forefathers used to come here, Sahoo added: ""They used to load the pots and ingredients onto bullock carts and travel to Puri on foot. The journey used to be long and arduous, but no one wanted to miss it. Nowadays, of course, we come here by bus."" Some of them were also accompanied by their children, who were seen lending a helping hand as their parents prepared the sweet dish. ""I want to learn how to make the dish and make it as tasty as my father does,"" said 14-year-old Nigam Jena. The tradition initially began at Sakhigopal, but gradually people from nearby villages such as Tentulia and Satyabadi also joined in. ""This is a wonderful custom that promotes selfless service to the Lord. So, it gradually spread to nearby areas. My friend from Sakhigopal once invited me to join him and the experience I gathered was extremely fulfilling. I have been coming here for the past 10 years,"" said Tentulia resident Brajabandhu Rout, who was accompanied by his wife. While Brajabandhu was busy preparing the dish, his wife was packing it into the terracotta pots. ""It has become a custom during bahuda yatra and one cannot pass by without tasting the delicacy. This is a unique tradition that the people of Sakhigopal village are carrying forward. Not many people know about it, so I feel the government should recognise it,"" said septuagenarian Maheswar Mishra, a resident of Puri."

(Source: AP/File) International Monetary Fund Chief Christine Lagarde. (Source: AP/File)Frances highest appeals court ruled on Friday that International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde must stand trial for her role in a 400 million euros ($440 million) state payout in 2008 to businessman Bernard Tapie.She was French finance minister at the time.The court rejected her appeal against a judges order in December for her to stand trial at the Cour de Justice de la Republique, a special court that tries ministers for crimes in office.Her lawyer Patrick Maisonneuve expressed regret over the decision and said he was convinced that the trial would show she was innocent.IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said that its executive board had been briefed on the matter and continued to have confidence in Lagardes capacity to carry out her functions.Lagarde is accused of negligence by improperly signing off on a decision to allow an extremely rare out-of-court arbitration in a dispute between Tapie, a supporter of conservative former president Nicolas Sarkozy, and the state.The arbitration judges later ruled in Tapies favour and ordered the state payout to him, but appeals courts have since thrown out that settlement decision.A Paris appeals court has ordered Tapie to reimburse the state, but the businessman has lodged an appeal, which is still pending.The case goes back to when Tapie sued the state for compensation after selling his stake in sports company Adidas to Credit Lyonnais in 1993. He claimed the bank had defrauded him after it later resold his stake for a much higher sum.Despite the case looming over her, Lagarde was appointed in January for a second five-year term as managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Lagarde has had a high-flying career, first as a top corporate lawyer in the United States, then as a cabinet minister and most recently as managing director at the IMF.At the Fund, she has won praise for persuading the U.S. Congress to approve a landmark reform programme that shifted more voting power to China and other key emerging market countries and has generally been considered a skilful negotiator.As Frances finance minister from 2007 to 2011 Lagarde played a key role in Europes response to the global financial crisis.Watch Video: Whats making newsShe joined the international law firm Baker & McKenzie in Paris aged 25 after completing a masters degree in English and labour law, and quickly rose to the top of the Chicago-based firm before entering politics.Born in Paris and raised in the northern port city of Le Havre, Lagarde is a vocal proponent of women as senior executives, once noting dryly that if Lehman Brothers had been Lehman Sisters, it might have survived.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Telegraph picture Ranchi, May 24: Birsa Agricultural University (BAU), Ranchi, today hailed the concept of "" dobas"" (small farm ponds for rainwater harvesting) as revolutionary, and stressed on the need for using low cost technologies to offset ill-effects of climate changes. BAU vice chancellor George John pointed out that dobas would have a multiplier effect across Jharkhand. He was speaking at a daylong workshop on Sustainable Agriculture and Farmers' Livelihood (SAFAL), the project that was launched on a pilot basis in Angara block of Ranchi district around April-May last year. ""Low cost congenial farm technologies will be more helpful for farmers. When technology is simpler, it has wider adaptability. High-end technologies often fail to attract poor farmers,"" the BAU vice chancellor said. The government has planned to construct one lakh dobas of four different sizes across the districts from state's own resources during the current financial year. Further, funds under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) will be used to dig up another five lakh dobas in a couple of years to increase the state's total irrigated area. ""However, one needs to be cautious while selecting a site for digging a doba. The selected site should be such that it receives adequate seepage,"" he added. John said there was a need to take a re-look at the potential of traditional agricultural technologies, which had survived for centuries. The workshop was organised by BAU, in association with United States Agency for International development and Columbia University's Centres for International Projects Trust, to share the success of SAFAL in the first year of its inception. Being implemented by BAU in 10 villages of Angara block, the SAFAL project includes promotion of modern inputs, rainwater harvesting in small wells (locally called dobas) for irrigation, capacity building of farmers, building agricultural information networks in villages, encouraging climate resilience and developing value chains for crops to enhance farm incomes. A. Wadood, chairman, department of agricultural physics and meteorology and nodal officer of SAFAL project, said the dobas constructed under the project had helped retain water up to 11 months (from June to April). ""As a result farmers in the project villages reaped 2-3 times higher yields of improved varieties of rice and harvested bumper crop of vegetables during winter,"" he claimed."

But this was Vasudeo S. Gaitonde's week in London when two of his paintings fetched the top prices, totalling 2,213,000, at an auction held at Christie's. Together they made up half of the total value of sales worth 4,429,625 of the South Asian and Contemporary Art Auction. Christie's said ""the selection of modernist sculpture did exceptionally well achieving world auction records for Meera Mukherjee (110,500), as well as for sculptures by Ramkinkar Baij and Sadanand Bakre. Notably, works offered by Jamini Roy, Bhupen Khakhar and Francis Newton Souza from private collections achieved particularly strong results."" Damian Vesey, head of sale, London, South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art, said in a statement: ""We were pleased to see very strong prices achieved for Vasudeo S. Gaitonde, the top two lots of the sale, each selling for over one million dollars and also saw record prices for major works of Indian modernist sculpture."" ""The London sale also benefited from significant interest in the Indian artist Bhupen Khakhar, with all works selling above estimate, ahead of his major retrospective opening next week at Tate Modern in London,"" the statement added. ""The range of prices realised demonstrates a broad interest in the category from new buyers to seasoned collectors spanning across early modern through to contemporary works."" Combined with the Arts of India auction, which took place earlier in the morning of May 26 and the Indian Art Online only auction Images of Rajasthan, brought the total for Christie's Indian Art Week London to 5,600,133. The first Gaitonde, an untitled oil canvas from 1975, went to a buyer in the sale room for 1,370,500, against an estimate of 400,000. Its provenance was described as ""acquired directly from the artist, thence by descent"". The second Gaitonde, an oil on canvas painted in 1958 and also untitled, went for 842,500, realising the lower end of the estimate range of 800,000-1,200,000. This was its provenance: ""In the collection of Mr T Borden, an American merchant marine who was introduced to Gaitonde's paintings through Kumar Gallery, Calcutta, and acquired several of the artist's works from the late-1950s to early-1960s. Gifted to a private American Collection, circa 1970. Gifted to the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery of St. Lawrence University, Canton, New York, by the above. Christie's London, 11 June 2013."" Buyers new to Gaitonde were given a brief account of the artist by the auction house. Gaitonde ""was not a prolific painter, completing only five or six deeply considered canvases a year. For the artist, the physical act of painting his canvases was meticulous and precise, but it was the formulation of the concept and the incubation of the painting as an idea in his own consciousness that absorbed most of his attention and time. ""An uncompromising artist of great integrity, Gaitonde distanced himself from anything he deemed superfluous to the contemplative rigour he believed his art required. ""Following a 1964 trip to New York on a Rockefeller Fund Fellowship, where Gaitonde experienced the works of several Abstract Expressionist and Conceptual artists first hand, his style began to evolve. Over the next decade, his paintings explored the relationships between form, light and colour in a diligent, yet sophisticated manner. ""This painting from 1975 showcases Gaitonde as painter and philosopher at the zenith of this exploration. Completed shortly after his move to Delhi, this work represents a mature, confident and resolved vocabulary and is testament to the artist's technical mastery of form, light and colour. Scrupulously manipulating pigments, the artist coordinated their convergences and reactions on the canvas with precision, leaving nothing to chance. The multi-layered result of this process illuminates Gaitonde's deep interest in the methodology of painting itself."" There is also a note on Gaitonde's friendship, stretching 50 years, with fellow artist and writer Ram Kumar who helped him financially when this was most needed: ""Kumar bought this painting from Gaitonde at an exhibition in Delhi in the mid-1970s. After Kumar's first choice of paintings from the show was requested by Tom Keehn, their friend and the American representative of the Rockefeller Fund in India, he gave it up and picked this luminous canvas from 1975. For more than forty years, Ram Kumar proudly hung this painting in his home, a mark of the high regards in which he held Gaitonde, and his deep respect for the latter's artistic integrity and uncompromising dedication to his work."" ""Gaitonde and Ram Kumar first met in Bombay in the early 1950s through the artist and gallerist Bal Chhabda, who was a common friend. Although Kumar was living in Delhi following his return from France, he frequently travelled to Bombay to exhibit his work at the Alliance Franaise, once even moving his family to the city for six months in 1954. Gaitonde, too, would travel to Delhi for his exhibitions at Kumar Art Gallery, and the two continued to meet, developing a close friendship based on mutual respect that would last till Gaitonde passed away in 2001. ""Over the next two decades the two artists met frequently, even though they lived in different cities, often along with others like Tyeb Mehta, Krishen Khanna and Maqbool Fida Husain. ""When Gaitonde moved to a barsati in the Jangpura neighbourhood of Delhi in 1972, the two became neighbours as well. At least once a week, Kumar would stop by Gaitonde's house on his way to buy groceries in the evening.... Often, the two would go to the cinema together or to the India International Centre to watch obscure French films. ""Along with his wife Vimla, Kumar took great care of Gaitonde in Delhi. Gaitonde was very fond of Vimla, although he categorically forbade her to clean his messy flat. Every day, she would ensure a box of dal would be sent to him from the Kumar household so that he had soft food to eat given his stubborn refusal to get dentures! ""Over the many years of their friendship Ram Kumar also made sure Gaitonde was financially stable when he needed it the most."""

Both the elephants had entered the human settlement near the Karanji forest reserve and died after coming in contact with a low-tension wire near a garden of Srikshetra ashram last night. Villagers spotted the carcass around 6am today. ""The two elephants of 10 and 15 years of age, respectively, died due to electrocution after they came in contact with an low-hanging electric wire of a farm house near the ashram,"" said Cuttack divisional forest officer Sudarshan Patra. Usually, elephants are spotted at the village under Tangi-Choudwar block as they frequently enter the human settlement in search of food and water from the reserved forest near a mountain. ""The electricity department should take urgent measures to raise the height of the wires, so that such mishaps can be avoided,"" said Kedar Sahu, a villager. On March 20, an elephant and a calf were electrocuted at Dihasahi village in Choudwar adjoining the Athagarh forest. They died after coming in a contact with a live wire drawn up near a farmland to prevent incursion of jumbos. Sources said the March incident took place as high-tension wires were used in the garb of solar fencing, which the forest department had put up to protect farmland from entry of wild animals. Senior forest officials said a detailed probe would be conducted to ascertain whether the deaths were the fallout of an accident or deliberate electrocution. ""A case under the Wildlife Protection Act will be registered against those who will be found guilty if it would be a case of deliberate electrocution,"" Patra said. In another development, a herd of 18 elephants, including eight tuskers and four calves, has damaged 10 houses and crops in Balasore. The affected villages are Sukruli, Khiching, Pandarsil, Gambhariapal, Chadheibhola, Sarukanta and so on. The jumbos broke a window of the Medhamundi Primary School and ate the rice stored for midday meal. In Khiching, the herd has crushed the entrance gate of the works department's inspection bungalow.# Karanjia divisional forest officer Prasanna Kumar Behera said they warned villagers not to approach or irritate the jumbos. Villagers have also been advised not store handia, an alcoholic drink, he said. ""At times they turn aggressive. Efforts are on to drive them out with the help of local volunteers by traditional means,"" Behera said. Additional reporting by Sibdas Kundu"

In Kokrajhar district, over 6,500 people from 17 villages are taking shelter in relief camps. Under Kachugaon block in Gossaigaon sub-division, 5,002 people from 12 villages are taking shelter in make-shift camps. Similarly, 1,577 people from five affected villages are taking shelter at# relief camps built# along the roadside. The rising water level of major rivers - Sankosh, Sormanga, Gongia - and their tributaries have breached# many embankments in the district. The PWD blacktop road in the Charagaon area by Longa river via Umangar has been completely eroded by at least half a kilometre. In Chirang, 64 villages - 29 under Sidli revenue circle and 35 under Bijni circle - were affected by the floods with 13,045 people still taking shelter in 12 relief camps under Sildi circle while 16,954 people are housed at 10 relief camps under Bijni revenue circle. Altogether 68 houses under Sildi, seven under Bijni, four roads, a bridge and a school were damaged in the floods. The All Bodo Students Union (Absu) has appealed to the district administration as well as the district disaster management authorities to make a proper survey of the affected areas and provide adequate relief material and rehabilitation to those who are affected. General secretary of Absu Kokrajhar district committee Nion Mushahary said the people of North Patgaon (63 families) have been living in relief camps for the past seven days but are provided only 9kg rice, 1kg dal, a mosquito net, a bottle of Phenyl, half a litre of mustard oil, a blanket and an umbrella per family but are not provided with any medical facilities. He also said the affected people of Banglajhora (34 families), living in the relief camp for the past eight days, were not given mosquito nets or blankets and many affected people of New Banglajhora, Kashibari and west Banglajhora were not provided anything except 10kg rice and 1kg dal per family.

58fef3817be9e0420db29e95,The jail that sparked many a story,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160619/jsp/bihar/story_92019.jsp,2016-06-19,"I stop at Purnea to meet Girindranath Jha, a journalist, who has returned to his ailing father and begun farming. I read his blogs and Facebook posts on harvesting potatoes, the impact of the westerly wind - pachiya - on fruits, the joy of seeing rice saplings sprout, the significance of green fields and running rivers, all intermingled with his own fiction and research on the writings of Phaniswarnath Renu, one of the greatest modern socialist writers from Bihar. We decide to start by visiting the Purnea Jail. My father had been a political prisoner there as a 25-year-old in 1957 with the Maharaja of Vizianagram Vijay Gajapati Raju, Loknath Joshi, Kalikaprasad Singh, Sarju Mishra and about 95 other socialist leaders. They were all part of a pan-Indian movement to remove English from official use. My father used to describe the room where 65 prisoners were jailed with one open toilet between them, the mess, the courtyard where they did yoga, the tree that had thousands of bats hanging from it... As we drove to the jail we stopped at the Indubhushan library, started by the father of Satinath Bhaduri, a socialist writer who wrote the great novels Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas about India's freedom struggle against the British. Professor Partha Chatterjee, whose writing and teaching have helped to decolonise the humanities, was informed by the subaltern characters in Dhorai Charit Manas in writing The Politics of the Governed. The writer (top) in front of the Purnea central jail where her father was a political prisoner in 1957. Pictures by Sudhanshu Bhaduri was born in Purnea and went to jail in Bhagalpur, Giri reminiscences, and Renu was born in a village in Araria and went to jail in Purnea. Bhaduri was Renu's guru. Both were influenced by the Indian National Congress and later the Congress Socialist Party. The characters in Jagori and Dhorai Charit Manas describe the jail in Purnea as does Renu. We reach the jail and meet the kind-hearted jailor, who does not let us inside the actual prison, but we are allowed to peep in from the outside and visit the room with an open toilet that my father occupied. It is disused. The jail is clean, there is a garden and the prisoners are allowed to pursue cultural activities. Indians have done better than the British in the treatment of prisoners. Bihar has gone one step ahead. National Crime Records Bureau data reveal that Chhattisgarh and the Union territories are arresting increasing number of people, whereas the numbers of those arrested in Bihar are going down. I had read recently that Sweden has closed down its prisons because they do not have anyone to arrest. They have chosen to use the funds to invest in people instead. Perhaps, the socialist government in Bihar is going to follow its socialist partner's path. Purnea was the first district to be created by the British in 1771, one of the worst exploited and thus the worst hit by the Bengal Famine. Timber contracts to those in service of the British Raj ended up turning this area, once called Puran Aranya (Total Forest), into a swamp, that generated one of the cruellest cholera outbreaks in human history. As a result, Purnea became the centre of resistance and intellectual ferment. Its young men and women were delegates to the Indian National Congress, attended rallies, spun the charka, went to jail, wrote pamphlets and books. Purnea became a literary centre. Today it is one of the big education centres of north Bihar. The disused rooms in the jail could easily be turned into a museum on the role that Purnea played in India's independence struggle. It would be a striking way to remind the next generation of their hard won independence. Over lunch at Sanjha Chullah it is evident that Giri will carry on the legacy of Purnea's literati. Like Renu his writings are both reportage and fiction. His newest book, Ishq me Maatisona, has been published by Rajkamal. I then go to Gulabh Bagh, one of the most notorious red-light areas in north Bihar, situated near the largest grain depot in eastern India and on a highway. Truckers used to routinely buy little girls here and the traffickers would provide a constant supply of poor, low caste children from nearby villages. To my pleasant surprise, I heard from a young girl, Roshanara, on her way back from school, that a female police officer, Kim Sharma, has arrested many of the kingpins and things were much better here. Roshanara adds, ""One more push and investment in the girls and women here could make this a non-red light area."" I leave, thinking that perhaps, we are too hasty in saying nothing has been achieved in 60 years. We have forgotten what once was. The legacy of zamindari and the Raj are vanishing. Two days ago, women won more than half the seats in the Purnea municipality.

Picture by Pradip Sanyal I had never thought that I would be the daughter-in-law of a daitapati family. I am happy that I am the wife of a daitapati, a servitor who is considered so close to Lord Jagannath. My father-in-law Haladhar Das Mohapatra is the chief servitor of Lord Balabhadra, the elder brother of Lord Jagannath. I work with TCS as a software engineer and I see husbands and wives coming together to office. But I never felt different. In fact, I am delighted when I see my husband wearing a gamucha (towel) and going to the temple barefoot to do the seva of the Trinity. God has been kind to me and I feel privileged to be the wife of someone who is a family member of Lord Jagannath. With the Lord's grace, I will become the mother of a daitapati... whether it's boy or a girl. I got married to Jagdish barely four months before Nabakalebar began last year. It was a love marriage and both our families agreed to the match. When I stepped into his house, I thought I would have to keep my head covered with a pallu and follow the traditions that a daughter-in-law is supposed to observe in an orthodox family. Nothing of that sort happened. I was encouraged to pursue my career. I got married to Jagdish barely four months before Nabakalebar began last year. It was a love marriage and both our families agreed to the match. When I stepped into his house, I thought I would have to keep my head covered with a pallu and follow the traditions that a daughter-in-law is supposed to observe in an orthodox family. Nothing of that sort happened. I was encouraged to pursue my career. The process of car festival has begun, and I follow a strict regime. From the day the Trinity moves fall sick (moves to anasara griha for hibernation), I have to eat only mahaprasad. My husband either comes with it or sends the mahaparasad to my Bhubaneswar residence every day. If for some reason the mahaprasad does not come, I have to go without food. I bring water from my home with a mixture of nirmalya (dry cooked rice offered to the deities) in it. I have taken leave and will be in Puri during the festival. However, I never go to the temple with my husband. I go to the shrine either with my mother-in-law or with other women. My wish is that I should set an example in our daitapati families. I want to prove that one can work in an office and also simultaneously do the seva of the Trinity. I am lucky that I have been the part of a family where everyone is broadminded. It's my brother-in-law who argues in support of my continuing with my job. When colleagues at my workplace ask me for the phone number of my husband so that they can talk to him, I feel a sense of pride. Lord Jagannath has given me an identity that is more important than anything else. This identity is my passport to the outer world. I recall how I was told to maintain celibacy during the car festival. Even though my marriage was only four months old during Nabakalebar, I was asked both by my mother-in-law and also my mother not to speak to my husband even on phone. Sometimes, it was irritating that I was not allowed to talk to my husband for nearly two months. However, with the passage of time, I continued to learn all the intricacies involved in it. I had heard a lot of about the rituals associated with the Jagannath culture. My father-in-law Haladhar Das Mohapatra, who is like a god to me - although he speaks little with others - shared a lot with me about Jagannath culture and how daitapatis should behave. My mother-in-law has taught me what to do during the car festival. It's a great learning process. Before I got married, I had got the opportunity to work in South Africa. My bonding with God is as strong as that of any devotee. I have learnt it from my mother. Perhaps it is my love for Lord Jagannath that has brought me to this daitapati family. I am yet to become a mother. I will be happier if my son were to become the servitor of Lord Jagannath rather than a scientist of Nasa. If I become the mother of a girl child, she will certainly be a great devotee of Lord Jagannath and have the opportunity to learn about the culture of Lord Jagannath. Though there is a common feeling that servitors are mostly illiterate, I can say that with the passage of time, they are now the most educated, most learned. Sometimes, I feel upset when people pass unfeeling remarks about them. They don't realise how dedicated the daitapatis are. They are aware that they cannot make mistakes while serving Lord Jagannath. If they do so, they will be severely punished. AS TOLD TO SUBHASHISH MOHANTY"

The grain processing machinery manufacturing companies, which includes national as well as international ones, will exhibit the latest technology which can be beneficial to farmers and grain mill traders. Bihar is an agrarian economy and as the state has a good production of paddy, wheat and maize, the grain processing machinery manufacturing companies aim to target farmers and grain mill traders, as there is no big grain processing unit. Surinder Gupta, the chairman of Business Empire, the unit which is organising the exhibition, said: ""In absence of big grain processing units in the state, the wheat and paddy produced in the state are processed in other states especially at Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Due to processing of grain in other states, the farmer as well as mill owners suffer losses."" The idea behind holding the exhibition is to showcase the latest technology in grain processing so that farmers and mill owners can introduce new techniques. The paddy, after going through various process in mills such as de-stoning, whitening, polishing, colour sorting, the rice is recovered which after packaging is sent to markets. Manish Sahay, director of Bihar Enterprises Association, said: ""The rice mills operating in district as Rohtas, Sasaram, Kaimur and Buxar have middle level rice mill processing unit. The mills are inferior to ones in Punjab and Haryana, as they hardly go for colour sorting. The technique is used to remove black colour from paddy. Sahay said the idea is that farmers and grain mill owner will know about the new technologies which can be beneficial to them, thus improving the quality of whole processed grain. The average cost of installing grain processing unit (middle level) is around Rs 30 to 40 lakh. The organisers claimed that with introduction of new technology, not only will there be improvement in qualities of processed grain but also there will be increase in production. Sahay said: ""The modern machines not only increase the output of processed grain, but also takes less time in processing than normal machines."" Similarly, the exhibition will also have wheat and maize processing machines. As the Kosi region leads in maize production, in absence of advanced grain processing unit, the farmers are left with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower rates. The modern maize milling machine can help the farmers get various kinds of corn products, such as cornflour and others. The exhibition will be inaugurated by industries minister Jai Kumar Singh. At the exhibition, farmers and interested mill owners booking machines will also get discounts."

Picture by Bijoy Kumar Sharma Dhubri, June 28: The community that has been for years engaged in cutting, engraving and sharpening stone sil pata (flat stones) used in every household for grinding spices, is in dire straits. Nearly 3,000 families of Dhubri district who originally belong to the fishing community and are under the Scheduled Caste category, are facing a bleak future. Once fishing was their right, but they lost it many years ago and the traditional sil pata cutting job is vanishing fast owing to invasion of markets by packet spices and availability of spice-grinding machines. Ramkrishna Choudhury, 50, a fisherman and stone-cutter of the Bahadurtary area along the bank of the Brahmaputra in ward 11 of Dhubri town, said fishing in the river has become very difficult for lack of funds. ""For fishing you need a boat, a good net and two or three fishermen. But we cannot afford these as it requires funds ranging between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1 lakh which people of our community can ill afford. As a result, fishing was taken over by other communities living in numerous sar villages,"" Choudhury said while sharpening and engraving a sil pata a few days back. Asked how much they earn in a day, another man from the community, Pratap Choudhury, said they normally charge Rs 40 to Rs 50 depending on the size of sil pata and earn Rs 150 to Rs 180 but that too not regularly. ""With this meagre amount I have to support my family of five. My two sons and a daughter - all school dropouts and my wife have to work to meet the requirements. This year, a boy of our community passed HSLC for the first time from this area. We are very happy and proud of him,"" Pratap said, while sitting on his tiny hired boat on the Brahmaputra at Panchughat. Male members of these impoverished community at times shift to stone-cutting but they earn a meagre amount. Though there are ample schemes for the socio-economic uplift of the SC community, there seems to be none to address their problems. Bhola Choudhury and Mantu Choudhury recounted getting a bicycle and a box nearly 20 years back to sell small fish. However, they receive rice and kerosene regularly through fair price shops, Choudhury said. Subal Chandra Das, a veteran activist, campaigning for the uplift of the SC community, alleged government apathy towards the all-round development of the community. He said there is a ministry of social justice and empowerment which oversees interests of the SCs. ""There are several examples that funds for schemes, meant for the community, were diverted. Can you think of a community living in knee-deep water in makeshift sheds for decades! Several crores sanctioned was spent elsewhere,"" Das said. Das said there was also no effort by teachers of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan to enrol children at the primary level though there are schools nearby."

(Kundan Yolmo) June 21: Opposition trade union leaders in north Bengal's tea gardens have joined their legislators in rejecting state labour minister Malay Ghatak's statement in the Assembly today that there are ""no closed tea gardens, no deaths due to malnutrition and no suicides in the gardens of north Bengal"". The minister gave the reply in response to a written question by Biswanath Choudhuri of the RSP. Choudhuri asked Ghatak about the number of closed tea gardens in the state at present, what assistance was being given to the affected labourers, how many deaths had occurred till April 30, 2016, because of malnutrition, and how many labourers had committed suicides in the gardens. In response, Ghatak said: ""There are no closed tea gardens, no deaths due to malnutrition and no suicides have occurred."" He, however, added that six gardens were under lockout for one to three years and they were being given assistance under various state and central schemes. The minister later named the six gardens under lockout. They are Redbank, Surendranagar, Dharanipur, Bandapani, Dheklapara and Madhu. While Redbank, Surendranagar and Dharanipur were abandoned by the management without notice, orders suspending work were issued in the other three gardens. While the work was suspended in Bandapani in 2013, in Dheklapara and Madhu, the orders were issued in 2005 and 2014, respectively. So, the minister's statement is not completely correct. For lockout, the management of the respective garden has to issue an order to the effect and inform the administration. Opposition trade unions said the minister ""was misleading the House"". The Intuc-affiliated National Union for Plantation Workers' joint general secretary, Manikumar Darnal, said the minister should have done his homework. ""The minister apparently does not know that the state government is giving rice and wheat to closed and inoperative tea gardens. The food minister recently visited the inoperative Duncan gardens...the minister (Ghatak) has insulted the workers of the closed gardens. We strongly protest the statement."" John Barla, a tribal leader and a representative of the Joint Forum, an umbrella organisation of 24 tea trade unions, except INTTUC, said he should seek forgiveness from the workers of the closed gardens. ""How can the labour minister say that not a single garden is closed? He should seek forgiveness from the workers. Seven gardens in Alipurduar of the Duncan Group are inoperative. There are two more in Jalpaiguri (other than the estates mentioned as locked out ones by the minister) that are inactive - Manabari and Kumlai."" Jiaur Alam, Citu leader and joint action committee member, sought to refute Ghatak's claim that there were no deaths from malnutrition in tea gardens. ""According to a survey by the joint action committee, 313 workers of gardens in Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar have died in the last one year and 123 of them passed away because of malnutrition and starvation,"" Alam said. Minister Ghatak, however, claimed that a scrutiny of the cases had revealed that the deaths were because of ""natural causes, like cerebral attack, cirrhosis, asthma, heart attack and pneumonia"". RSP MLA Choudhuri later said: ""We cannot accept the minister's statement. At one time, tea production was the highest in Bengal. But now, the lackadaisical attitude of the state government has not helped in opening the gardens."""
58fef4ac7be9e0420db2a06d,"River changes course in Chirang, wreaks havoc",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160729/jsp/northeast/story_99403.jsp,2016-07-29,"Floodwaters flow through Khungkrajhora village in Chirang district on Thursday. Telegraph picture Kokrajhar, July 28: The Makra river has changed course in Chirang district of Assam over the past few days, charting a course of destruction in the area, following incessant rain in the Himalayan foothills. The Makra, which flows downstream from Bhutan, broke its embankment at Narayanpur village in Bijni tehsil, north of Koilamoila, soon after entering north Chirang and merged with another river, the Asatpukha, which flows through the plains. At Khungkrajhora, the two rivers merged with a small irrigation canal, Gorsighot, which passes through the village. Over 40 villages were submerged as the water started flowing through houses, paddy fields and road. As the river gained in width, the banks of the canal caved in at many places. The river not only washed away houses in several villages like Khungkrajhora, Gobdapara, Boldi, Ambari, Makgragami, Durgapur, Subhaijhar, Malipara, Ledoara, Udalguri, Charagaon, Kathalguri, Dhologaon, Gobdapara, Subhaijhar and Choto Amguri but also damaged several acres of land. Since agriculture is the primary source of income for the residents of the area, the worst part of the calamity is the accumulation of silt, which affects the fertility of land. Eighty per cent of the water from the Makra is now flowing through the irrigation canal. As a result, the canal is overflowing and villages are getting flooded. The current is such that it appears improbably that anything can be done until the water recedes, said D. Basumatary, a local resident who works for the welfare of villagers in the area. S. Narzary, a farmer of Khungkrajhora, said, My jute cultivation was ready for harvesting. Now it is all gone.Another villager said, Only three weeks ago I had planted rice saplings on my eight bighas of land. It is completely destroyed. Everything we did this year is washed away, all gone. Floodwaters from Makra have taken away everything, said another. This is not the first time the Makra has wreaked havoc in the area. Similar disasters had occurred in 2012 and in 2002. The genesis of the crisis lies in the 1984 flood, which changed the course of the river. In 2002, the river broke its embankment and started flowing through villages. With help from the government, thousands of villagers got together and repaired the embankment after which the river started flowing through the main course. But with heavy rain in the hills, the river changed its course again on Tuesday. The people of the area expressed displeasure that the BTC and state governments did not take necessary measures over the years to tackle the problem by taming the river. The schemes taken up normally are of Rs 10-12 lakh only, which is merely an eyewash. We want proper measures to be taken up so that people dont suffer at frequent intervals, a local youth said. The affected people are now taking shelter in nearby schools."

About a third of the total lead of 22,038 votes that Manoj Tigga of the BJP managed in Madarihat against Trinamul's Padam Lama came from these seven gardens whose voters are now unemployed garden labourers. The BJP also led in Bundapani, a tea garden whose lease was cancelled by the state government in 2014 and which has since been shut. The contrast is stark because Trinamul for the first time secured four of the five seats in the Dooars tea belt in the Assembly elections. Madarihat has the most number of closed tea gardens in the Dooars. Tigga said Mamata Banerjee's dole politics ""has been summarily rejected by workers residing in the eight tea estates"". The seven gardens acquired by the Centre were owned by the Duncans Goenka group. Bundapani is not owned by Duncans. ""The residents in the closed gardens have banked on the Centre after its prompt decision to acquire the tea estates to scout for new investors who can reopen them. Even workers of the closed Bundapani tea estate have expressed confidence in our party,"" Tigga said. ""Unlike other tea estates in the Dooars, where initiatives such as distribution of food grains at subsidised rates, health care facilities and welfare schemes of the Centre and state have helped Trinamul, the tea population in the closed gardens has proved to be the exception,"" a political observer said. ""They may have voted the BJP to drive home the point that they want a permanent solution. They want their gardens to reopen and do not believe in thriving on relief."" While workers and their families in closed gardens got benefits from the same central and state schemes as in the open gardens, there was one crucial difference. Under the central subsidised grain scheme, the closed or acquired gardens, which had no private owners, got rice at Rs 2 a kilo. But in functioning tea estates, workers got the same rice at 45 paise a kilo. The state government had said that the difference in price of Rs 1.55 would have to be borne by private garden owners. As the eight gardens had no owners, they did not get the benefit of the double subsidy. Before the elections, tea unions and workers had pointed out that the unemployed garden hands who needed cheaper grains the most had to pay more for rice, while those with jobs were getting the state's added benefit. Padam Lama, the Trinamul candidate of Madarihat seat, said organisational weakness was the principal reason for his defeat. ""It is true that we do not have an adequate trade union base in these gardens. There were some organisational weaknesses which is why we could not reach out to each and every resident of these eight gardens and some other gardens in the Madarihat block,"" Lama said. ""But people are aware of the initiatives taken by the state to prevent malnutrition and starvation among unemployed workers and their families. That is why, despite not having any trade union, we came second in terms of the number of votes."" The vote count in these eight tea gardens has also proved to be a setback for the RSP. The Madarihat block, in fact the entire brew belt of Alipurduar district, was known to be a stronghold of the RSP even after 2011. In 2011, the RSP won the seat. This year, however, the party came third in terms of vote count in these tea gardens and also in the entire Assembly segment. ""Other than Huntapara, RSP has come third in the remaining seven closed tea gardens. This proves that its tea trade union front UTUC could not take workers into confidence. The primary reason is that none of the tea trade unions, whether affiliated to the UTUC, Citu or Intuc, could bring in votes for their parties or for candidates of the Left-Congress alliance this time. Workers have started differentiating among trade unions and political parties and have thus voted either the BJP or Trinamul across Dooars,"" a senior trade union leader based in Jalpaiguri said. ""It is surely a warning for trade union leaders. Like Trinamul, which is concerned about the BJP's victory in Madarihat, trade unions must realise that they will have to work for workers' rights and privileges or else the tea population might shun them,"" the trade union leader added. The poll data also shows that the BJP has secured a margin of 8,642 votes - including Bundapani - over Trinamul in these tea estates. ""The total winning margin of the BJP candidate is 22,038 votes, of which a lead of 8,642 votes has come from only the 40 booths located in these eight gardens. This is a clear indicator that the voters here are not satisfied with the RSP and Trinamul,"" a political observer said. Kumar Kujur, the previous MLA of Madarihat, said they could not take into confidence the workers and their families of the eight gardens. ""Despite regular campaigns, we could not take them into confidence for some reason or the other. We will surely discuss with party leaders and trade union leaders this debacle and how we can overcome it,"" Kujur said. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY AVIJIT SINHA IN SILIGURI"

Rice and wheat are given to financially backward families at subsidised rates under the scheme. Gurung told the media in Darjeeling that the people should see through the designs of the state government and totally reject the AAY scheme. ""The distribution of the AAY cards is nothing but a conspiracy on the part of the state government to show that the people in the hills are refugees and gypsies without a land of their own. This is a sinister bid to undermine the demand for Gorkhaland,"" he said. The AAY was introduced by the NDA government under prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in 2000. Families having AAY cards are given rice at Rs 3 per kg and wheat at Rs 2 per kg. The scheme initially targeted the five per cent of the population who couldn't have two square meals a day. It now also covers BPL households headed by widows, terminally ill persons, disabled persons or persons aged above 60 years without assured means of subsistence or societal support. The identification of AAY families and issuing the distinctive ration cards is the responsibility of the state government. In the hills, though, the entire population has been brought under the scheme. ""(The) entire population has been treated as AAY considering various criteria primarily that the hills don't produce food grains and almost entire population has to buy food grains from that brought from outside. Due to this, prices are somewhat higher than they are outside. More than 80 per cent ration cards have been distributed and allocation will be based on these cards only,"" said Anurag Srivastava, the Darjeeling district magistrate. Srivastava also said the hills were flooded with bogus ration cards and henceforth, only the digital cards would be entertained. The DM stressed that those who didn't want to lift ration could forgo it, but old cards would not be used in any case. On widespread complaints that the digital cards had lot of errors, he said a robust mechanism was in place ""to correct any erroneous data or change/correct ration dealer and this is being done within 15 days of application""."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, May 29: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today fired the first broadside against the five-day old BJP-led government in Assam, calling it ""fascist"" for not allowing them to stage a demonstration against alleged anomalies in the public distribution system (PDS). Talking to reporters here this morning, KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi said they had requested the Kamrup metro administration for permission to hold the demonstration in front of the supply department office here tomorrow but it was turned down. ""Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal is acting like a fascist, like Narendra Modi. We are calling off the demonstration because we don't want to defy the government when it is still in a honeymoon period after winning the elections with a huge mandate and not because we are afraid of police,"" he said. Akhil said they would request the administration for the second time and even third time. ""If we are not given permission even after that we will go ahead with our protest programme,"" he said. ""Not giving us the permission would also mean that Sonowal endorses the malpractices in the PDS. It seems that he is becoming arrogant because of the BJP's landslide victory in the Assembly polls."" The last time Akhil hit out at the BJP was on April 2, just ahead of the Assembly elections, when he had listed 10 reasons why people should not vote for the party. Akhil Gogoi speaks in Guwahati on Sunday.Picture by UB Photos ""Both the Congress and the BJP are corrupt. If the Congress is a python, BJP is an anaconda, which can even eat a python. People should realise how dangerous the BJP is,"" he had said then. Akhil's appeal, however, found little resonance among the voters who gave the BJP 60 of the 85 seats the party had contested and its allies - AGP, Bodoland People's Front and organisations of Tiwa and Rabha communities - another 26 seats that together added up to a two-third majority in the 126-member House. Instead, it was Akhil who suffered after some of his close aides alleged that he was ""dictatorial"" and left the KMSS. His attack on the BJP government comes at a time when the ruling alliance is still heady from the landslide victory and its legislators being felicitated across the state. Sonowal himself was accorded a warm welcome when he visited his native Dibrugarh district today for the first time after becoming chief minister. The KMSS leader said rice, which was meant to be distributed at Rs 2 per kg, was being sold for Rs 4 under the PDS in the state. He also alleged that under the Food Security Scheme the beneficiaries are supposed to get 5kg of rice every month. But in reality they are receiving only 3kg to 4kg. ""So, there is a huge scam in the PDS and Food Security Scheme to the tune of crores of rupees. The KMSS has been highlighting this so that genuine beneficiaries are not deprived of the benefits,"" he added. Akhil said the new government must show its commitment to keep its promise of a graft-free Assam by allowing the KMSS to carry out its democratic movement and stop all anomalies in the PDS. The KMSS also attacked the government on the issue of price rise of essential commodities. ""Though the new government has launched a crackdown on illegal toll gates in the state, there is no respite for the common people from price rise. Soon after the BJP government took charge, prices of essential commodities have gone up,"" Akhil said."

58fef85b7be9e0420db2a665,The rot in Indian agricultural policies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/opinion/story_87563.jsp,2016-05-26,"Every aspect of Indian economic policies is influenced by all-pervading government control. Many times, they are also subject to massive leakages due to inefficiencies and corruption (for example, bogus ration cards, rotting grains and corrupt procurement in the public distribution system). The poor state of industrial development, inability to increase domestic defence production in spite of massive imports, diversion of government revenues from taxes on minerals, mismatch between demand for agricultural products and their production, and so on, are some examples. India has massive unemployment and underemployment. More are seeking fresh employment each year, consumption levels are low, and there are many poor people. Yet, growth in production of physical goods from agriculture and industry has, in five years since 2011, been modest. At constant prices, agriculture grew annually from 2011 in per cent at 1.5, 4.2, -9.2 and 1.1. Over these years, industry grew in per cent at 3.6, 5.0, 5.9, and 7.3; manufacturing at 6.0, 5.6, 5.5 and 9.5. There is heavy pressure of population on land. The average size of land holding was 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and 1.15 in 2010-11. India has more arable land than China. Indeed it has the second-most arable land in the world. But it has very low productivity of crops per acre. When one takes paddy, as one example, and on comparing with China, India remains far behind. This is so for other crops as well and as compared to most Southeast Asian countries. A good reason for the low productivity is the growing fragmentation of holdings and their decline in size. The high population pressure on small land holdings is on account of high rural poverty. Alleviation requires consolidation of land holdings by leasing, urbanization and the acquisition of rural lands for the purpose with adequate compensation. This will also reduce this pressure. Consumption habits are changing at all levels. Rice consumption per person per month in rural India was estimated at 5.98 kilogramme in 2011-12 compared to 6.38 kg in 2004-05 - a fall of 0.4 kg in seven years. In urban India, the fall in rice consumption between these two periods was 0.2 kg per person per month - from 4.71 kg to 4.49 kg per capita. A high proportion was taken at subsidized prices from the public distribution system. Per capita consumption of wheat in 2011-12 showed a slight rise since 2004-05 of about 0.1 kg per person per month in rural areas and a fall of 0.35 kg in urban areas. As with rice, the share of PDS purchase in wheat consumption has increased considerably, from 824 grammes to 901 gm in the urban sector. At the same time, and in contrast, 69 gm in the rural sector and 57 gm in the urban sector were contributed by split gram, whole gram, pea and besan bought at rising market prices. The four pulses - arhar, moong, masur and urd - also rose. So did consumption of vegetables, eggs and fruits. All these have seen rising prices and no price support to consumers. Minimum support prices for cereals are increased almost every year and have been the same as procurement prices. But retail prices were not raised similarly. There is also government interference in the agricultural markets which cause the farmer to lose the margins made by middlemen. India has stimulated the production of cereals when the demand was dropping, while growing for other non-subsidized items. Rural households bought the cheap PDS grains and sold their own produce for government stocks, which are at unsustainably high levels without adequate storage. They might as well have been given free to the malnourished rural poor. Productivity remained low because of falling land holdings. Improved seeds were not easily available. Genetic modification of food grains was prevented by environmentalists with no evidence of ill-effects. (Research has shown no ill-effects on humans; in some cases, there might be resistance to plant resistance.) Fertilizers are subsidized, benefiting manufacturers and big farmers. Subsidies are relatively more for urea, leading to a mismatch in fertilizer use and inadequate productivity. Water availability has been shrinking as lakes and rivers become polluted and groundwater levels are used excessively. Per-capita availability of fresh water has declined sharply, from 3,000 cubic metres to 1,123 cubic metres over the past 50 years versus the global average of 6,000 cubic metres. India needs to make judicious use of surface water and groundwater. Dams on rivers have robbed some of them of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. Urban effluents have also destroyed the potability of river water. Fifty five per cent of India's total water supply is now groundwater. This has reduced levels across much of India. Growing water-intensive crops and using techniques like flooding for paddy have further depleted groundwater. Over 60 per cent of irrigation comes from groundwater. Nearly 30 per cent of urban water supply and 70 per cent of rural water supply come from groundwater. We need a rational water policy and less populism. Massive subsidies on equipment and electricity required to mine groundwater have accentuated its use to the financial detriment of the power sector. Free or heavily subsidized flat rate electricity tariffs helped bring the Green Revolution. They have now become the norm. The result is indiscriminate use of groundwater. Each of the issues mentioned is the result of government policies or their absence. Land legislation encourages fragmentation of holdings. There is little encouragement for leasing. Land acquisition for urban areas and for factories has been a corrupt business, and there is little incentive for many farmers to give up their land and move away. Government procurement policies and the public distribution system have stimulated rising production of rice and wheat. Little has been done to help production, storage and marketing of other items like vegetables, pulses, fruits and eggs (such as cold storages, improved varieties, and so on). There is little sign of a rational water policy: indeed, it is the opposite. Electricity tariffs encourage a rise in the use of groundwater. There is no policy on groundwater. Neither is there a limit on what water-intensive crops can be grown with it. There is no concerted recharging of groundwater. State governments follow irrational water-pricing policies. Cleaning up river and lake water so that it is available to supplement water supply in case of drought is uncommon. Little is being done to spread better agricultural practices and scientific developments that benefit farmers. Agricultural productivity can be increased even on small holdings, but there is little attempt, except by non-governmental organizations, to disseminate these practices. In Israel, these have reduced the use of water. There are vineyards producing good wine in the Negev desert. Groundwater use is not metered in India as it should be. Fertilizer subsidies do not benefit the small farmer. Rational policies, which ensure that subsidies reach the farmer and do not encourage unbalanced use of fertilizers, are urgently needed. Environmental agitations against genetically modified seeds should be countered by scientific evidence so that more productive seeds can be used. Agricultural policies have developed into a messy package. They need a thorough overhaul. Our political masters are unable to even think of it.
