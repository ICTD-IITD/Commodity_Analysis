""Bhagalpur is considered the rice bowl where the variety is produced in abundance. We decided to refine the variety without adding anything new after some farmers said their products had lost its original essence,"" said BAU extension education director R.K. Sohane. He said the samples were collected from Katarni growers in different parts of Bhagalpur. Mankesh Kumar, an assistant professor-cum-scientist at the university, said: ""We have managed to restore the seed's quality and are now researching to improve the variety's other features such as increasing its sustainability, making it suitable for all conditions, etc,"" he said. ""We have already applied for a geographical indication registration and asked the state government to launch the new variety. It will take around two years to complete the entire process."" The head of the plant reproduction department, P.K. Singh, said around 160kg seeds have been distributed among the district agriculture officers of Bhagalpur, Banka and Munger and a few farmers. ""Our main intention is to check the productivity of the upgraded seeds,"" Singh said. Mohammad Nizam, a Katarni farmer at Jagdishpur, recalled how the quality had started deteriorating around 50-60 years back. ""We are hopeful that the refined seeds will bring back the variety's original essence. However, we can be sure about the seed's quality of only after the first harvest,"" said Nizam. The demand for Katarni chura (flattened rice) and curd goes up every year during Makar Sankranti."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, May 16: The housing and urban development department has decided to monitor Aahar cheap meal outlets in the city and across the state to ensure quality. To this end, the department will shortly install a central monitoring mechanism that will be supported and maintained by experts of the Orissa Computer Application Centre (OCAC). The OCAC officials will install the system at the office of the housing and urban development department in the state secretariat here. In order to ensure the standards of various parameters are met, CCTV cameras have been installed in the Aahar outlets. Moreover, it has also been decided to install a central monitoring mechanism at the housing and urban development for web monitoring of the Aahar outlets, said the housing and urban development department in a letter to the OCAC general manager. Earlier officials stationed at every outlet monitored the proceedings through the CCTV camera feed. The present plan would enable the officials sitting at the secretariat keep a close watch on all the Aahar outlets. The state government has recently opened 110 new Aahar outlets in all districts of the state, including one in Bhubaneswar that took the number of centres in the city to five. An official of the housing and urban development department said experts of the OCAC would be deputed at the departments office to monitor the outlets live. This will help ensure quality of food as well as avoid untoward incidents and corruption in and around the outlets, said the official. The Aahar outlets in the city operate at Capital Hospital, Master Canteen Square, Kalpana Square, Mancheswar, near Nayapalli Durga Mandap, Sum Hospital, Unit-II, Baramunda Bus Stand and Chandrasekharpur. The scheme, which runs with the support of corporate social responsibility fund, benefits nearly 9,000 persons every day in the city by providing them staple Odia food such as rice and dalma at Rs 5. Each Aahar outlet provides 1,000 meals to the people every day from 11am to 3pm. The city already had four outlets, which was benefiting nearly 4,000 people on a daily basis. With the new outlets, the number of beneficiaries every day has increased to 9,000, said another official of the department. The housing and urban development department earlier this year had also asked officials of the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation to form a society to monitor activities under the cheap meal scheme in the city. The civic body had then formed the City Aahar Society to take care of the scheme. The society keeps an eye on the requirements at various Aahar outlets in the city, while the central monitoring mechanism of the housing and urban development department will monitor the quality of food served across the state. This is a good move by the state government and will help the administration check corruption at the outlets, said Janani Maharana, a schoolteacher."

Asha lives in a tiny brick house in Khasherbheri village.Pictures by Bishwarup Dutta No party other than Trinamul can enter these villages, declares a young man standing at the meeting point of Beraberi, Khasherbheri and Bajemelia villages, under a tree with a poster on the SUCI candidate. The SUCI was part of the Singur protests before their takeover by Mamata Banerjee. ""The CPM will be beaten up,"" the young man adds. Whether the youth means business or not, the villages under three panchayat areas, Gopalnagar, Beraberi and KGD (Kamarkundu, Gopalnagar, Daluigachha), which were most affected by land taken forcibly from anichhuk (unwilling) farmers to build the Tata's Nano factory, is still a Trinamul bastion. This is Ground Zero of Mamata Banerjee's ""paribartan"" in probably more than one sense. It is remarkable what goes unremarked: Didi's abandonment of Singur. After driving the Tatas out of the proposed factory here and walking into Writers', Mamata has hardly visited Singur. Saturday's meeting was only an election campaign. After becoming chief minister she also said the Singur legal case could take between five and 50 years, which looked like she was washing her hands of the issue after she had promised the unwilling farmers that she would return their land. But Singur is not angry enough, not with her. Many of the ""unwilling"" farmers who lost their land, refused compensation and threw in their lot with Mamata, are still with Mamata. Not only because their anger against the CPM cadre who assaulted and humiliated them is still on the boil, but also because of something more tangible: Didi's event management and the Rs 2,000 and 16kg of rice package issued by her government and disbursed by local Trinamul leaders. What the package of money and rice is doing to neighbourly relations, not to say families, is another story. It is raising questions about who is entitled to be a victim and how much. "" Shahid parivars"" or martyr families dot the Singur villages affected by the loss of land. Krishna Bag, a well-known woman in Beraberi village, home to most protesting villagers, is from one such. Krishna became a face of the protests for having been jailed with her toddler. On September 25, 2006, Krishna was among 2,000-odd protesters who thronged the BDO office demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were taken from the ""unwilling"" farmers without consent be returned. Krishna's husband's family had lost three bighas to the Tata factory. It was their livelihood. With Krishna was her younger daughter Payel, a two-year-old then. But the police did not spare her or her child. After being beaten up severely, Krishna, with Payel, was thrown into the lock-up and then sent to Chandernagore jail for three days, with 23 other women. ""The cadre would enter our homes and beat us up,"" remembers Krishna. ""We had to see our land being turned into concrete, into drains."" The next year, Krishna's father-in-law, Haradhan Bag, unable to cope with the loss of land, hanged himself. Krishna's husband Arun, who used to work on the land that yielded several crops, including potatoes, jute, rice and vegetables, is a carpenter now like many of his neighbours who lost their land, commuting to Calcutta daily for Rs 200 a day. Krishna, diagnosed with low haemoglobin levels, was recently hospitalised. Her elder daughter Anamika, a college student now, had to give up her dream of studying in an art college. It has been 10 years and things have gone from bad to worse. But Krishna still looks up to Mamata Banerjee. She meets the chief minister two times every year, once during July 21, the annual Martyr's Day, when Krishna and Payel are on display on stage as Singur victims, and once before the Pujas when they are given money, a few thousands, and clothes. If they do not turn up, Didi sends over the Puja clothes meant for Payel to their one-storey concrete house in Beraberi. On every occasion, Didi talks to Krishna. Krishna feels she is in touch with Didi. But Didi possibly does not know something. Her compensation for the martyr's family has split it. Neither Krishna, not her family members, speaks to one of Arun's closest relatives who has claimed the mantle of "" shahid"" and is regarded by Krishna's family as having taken several lakhs that Didi apparently issued to the family. ""I am sure Didi doesn't know where the money is going. Do you think I should tell her?"" Krishna asks. If the CPM should learn that no one forgets losing land under duress, Didi should know that she cannot make everyone happy with dole politics. Asha Patra is the widow of another "" shahid"", Shankar Patra. She lives in a tiny brick house in Khasherbheri village, next to Beraberi. Shankar hanged himself in 2008 after the small shop he ran became a part of the land for the small-car factory. Frail and slow in her movements, Asha cries as she speaks, but her eyes remain alert. She, too, attends the two annual Trinamul events and is given the clothes and money. But she wonders why, if she is a martyr's widow, she is not entitled to the monthly package of Rs 2,000 and 16kg rice, especially when she is almost starving. The Trinamul government sanctioned the package to individuals affected by the Tata factory protests in Singur, as to others in other parts of Bengal, shortly after coming to power. Official records are not available readily, but local Trinamul sources say about 3,400 individuals are getting the money and rice in Singur every month: 2,500 ""unwilling"" farmers, who did not want to give their land, 300 bargadars and 600 farm labourers, or the families of such persons. Asha is not one of the 3,400 beneficiaries, because her son's name was taken down by local Trinamul leaders. She discloses with some difficulty that her son, a grille mechanic, keeps all that he gets, but in families like hers, which do not enjoy the blessings of the party, no one can claim to be a victim. But many close to the party can. ""You have to see what is going on,"" she adds. It seems that the dole given by the Mamata government has benefited some more than others. A few feet away stands the prosperous household of Shonali Das, an attractive articulate homemaker with long black hair streaming down her back as her skin glows from the golden yellow of her tant sari. A well-tended tulsi mancha stands near the entrance. Her family enjoys the support of the local Trinamul. She bursts into anger when she remembers the CPM cadres. ""They would wait outside, watching. They dragged me out by my hair out of this room when I was seven-months pregnant,"" she says. "" Jomi amader ma (the land is our mother). We will never forget,"" she says, her eyes flashing with anger. But Didi has provided adequate compensation to her family, Shonali says. ""Not everyone could be included, but five adult members of my family get the victims' package, including me,"" says Shonali. It means Rs 10,000 per month and 80kg rice. Why does she get the package? ""I don't know,"" she says, and asks Tapas Das, a neighbour. ""Because you are a farm labourer,"" says Tapas. ""I am a farm labourer?"" asks Shonali and doubles up in laughter. Tapas's family, which lives next door, is another "" shahid parivar"". His brother Prashanta, who was a ""very good farmer"" and knew each of his plants, killed himself after the 4.5 bighas owned by the family went inside factory land. This family gets six packages: Rs 12,000 per month and 96kg rice. Tapas says all the rice is used up by the household. The Trinamul candidate from Singur, former minister Rabindranath Bhattacharya who is known as Mastermoshai, is confident that he will win. But so is the CPM, which is fielding Rabin Deb. Local CPM leaders point out that Becharam Manna, who is the Trinamul candidate in the adjacent Haripal, practically runs the panchayats in Singur (15 belonging to Trinamul, one to the CPM), and is Bhattacharya's sworn rival. He can do more harm to Bhattacharya's prospects than good. Besides, they point out, that Singur is not restricted to those three panchayats: there are 13 others in the constituency, where the disaffected are many and they want industry. They also claim that the number of ""unwilling"" farmers has been exaggerated greatly by Trinamul: there were 562 of them, nowhere near the 3,400 on the Trinamul's records who are being given the compensation. ""People have realised they have made a mistake. Singur now is hungering for industry,"" says Amar Chandra, CPM zonal committee member, Singur. ""Outside the affected villages, the rest of Singur is like the rest of Bengal."""
58fefa2a7be9e0420db2a932,Hiccups in online foodgrain allotment,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160628/jsp/northeast/story_93629.jsp,2016-06-28,"Guwahati, June 27: The online process to transfer foodgrain to wholesalers or ration shops under the National Food Security Act, 2013, in Assam has failed to take off because of technical glitches even six months after the act was implemented in the state. Sources said the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which was in charge of providing software support to implement the scheme, could not develop a foolproof application through which the allotment of foodgrain would be made. In technical terms, the centre has not done its ""security audit"" to the application, Supply Allocation Order Generation. The application is also known as FEAST module. ""The state government is deeply concerned about it. The act was implemented in Assam in December last year. According to it (the act), online allotment of foodgrain should be done to bring transparency to the system. But we are stuck as the NIC is yet to do its security audit. We have written several times to the NIC to do the security audit,"" said the source. Rajesh Prasad, commissioner and secretary of the food and civil supplies department of the state, took up the matter with Vrinda Sarup, secretary to the Union ministry of food and public distribution, this month. He told Sarup that the issue has persisted even after the state chief secretary wrote to the director-general of NIC in October last year and took up the matter with the NIC after two months and in May again this year. The source said the state government will not be able to submit utilisation certificates against the funds allotted for these works if the security audit is not done. Prasad had requested for personal intervention of Sarup in the issue, stating that the new BJP-led government in the state has set up a target to implement the online allocation of foodgrain under the act in its 100-day action plan. However, the Assam state unit of NIC brushed aside the complaint of the state government. Sources in the NIC said it had tried online allocation of foodgrain for three consecutive months starting December last year but failed as the data provided by the state government on some topics like wholesalers was wrong. The NIC even wrote to the state government to correct the data at its earliest. Under the act, Assam gets around 1.3 lakh tonnes of rice every month to be distributed among the beneficiaries through public distribution shops at Rs 3 per kg. Unlike other states, Assam does not distribute wheat as it is primarily a rice-eating state. Under the National Food Security Act, people whose income is more than Rs 1 lakh per annum are not entitled to hold ration cards. Assam food and civil supplies minister Rihon Daimari recently requested people whose annual income is over Rs 1 lakh to surrender their ration cards. ""The minister made the appeal so that the benefits of the act reach the actual beneficiaries. But it is difficult to detect illegal possessors of ration cards,"" said an official of the state food and civil supplies department. The UPA government notified the Act on September 10, 2013. The Assam government had planned to implement the act in September 2014 but because of some problems it could do so only last year. Around 2.4 crore people get rice under the act in the state."

""Farmers have been growing a variety of crops in Jharkhand since time immemorial amidst droughts and floods. Despite rapid and sudden climatic changes, farmers have relied on traditional knowledge, handed down to them by their forefathers, to successfully fend for themselves and their families. BAU needs to rediscover the strength of tribal farming practices and indigenous technical knowledge being in practiced for centuries and blend it with modern scientific knowledge to get the desired results,"" the vice chancellor said today while inaugurating a two-day Khariff Research Council Meeting on the campus. He advised the scientists to focus on the location-specific problems of Jharkhand, while formulating agriculture research plans so that food and nutritional security can be ensured in the state. Speaking on the occasion, A.K. Singh, the vice chancellor of Bihar Agricultural University, Sabour, Bhagalpur, stressed on identifying discipline-wise thrust areas of the institution for targeted efforts. ""Scientists' assessment must be based on externally funded projects earned by them. The quality of work done by BAU scientists is very good but it doesn't systematically address the state's requirements. All technologies released by the institution should find place in practices,"" he added. Eminent veterinary scientist and former technical director of HARVET, Germany, S.N. Singh pointed out that the problems of rural employment, could be solved if , in addition to agriculture, equal stress was granted to animal husbandry. ""Scientific animal breeding, nutrition and healthcare are the keys to development of the rural sector,"" he said. R.P. Singh, director of extension education, BAU, stressed that soil scientists, water technologists and forestry experts should join hands to address the issues of soil erosion, soil acidity, biodiversity conservation and water management plaguing the state. Outlining the research highlights of Kharif, 2015, director of research D.K. Singh Dron said six varieties of rice and one each of linseed and chicken were released by the central varietal release committee while five varieties of finger millet, soybean, groundnut and gram were in the pipeline. ""The productivity level of pulses and oilseeds in Jharkhand has gone above the national average. However, on meat, milk, egg and fodder production fronts, the state was highly deficient for which scientists were required to give that extra push without any further loss of time,"" he added."

Picture by Suman Tamang Darjeeling, Aug. 12: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today demanded that since the state government had decided to bring the entire population in the Darjeeling hills under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana, the Mamata Banerjee administration declare the region a backward area and provide other benefits. The Morcha, however, said the state government would not do so and the hidden agenda of covering the entire hills under the AAY was to cut down on the foodgrains it had promised the people of the region before the Assembly elections. Under the AAY being implemented by the Centre through state governments, a financially backward family is entitled to 35kg of foodgrains at Rs 2 per kg a month. The Morcha had assigned members of the partys Study Forum to find out the real motives of the state government in implementing the AAY in the entire hills. D.K. Pradhan, convener of the Study Forum, today said: According to a notification issued by the directorate of district distribution, procurement & supply, food supplies department (memo no: 335(19) FMR/IIS-01/16) dated January 22, 2016, the hill population was included in Hill PDS category. As per the HPDS provisions, 11kg of foodgrains would be distributed per person per month in the entire hills. The provision in the notification reads: The existing population in the hill will now be allotted 6 kg of rice and 5 kg of fortified atta per heard per month @ Rs 2.00 per kg in both cases. According to Pradhan, the 11kg of foodgrains were to be drawn under the Centres National Food Security Act and the special scheme of the state government. The January 22 notification regarding hills reads: The entire population of the hill subdivision will be treated as NFSA plus state special package of for hill (NFSA-Hill) and allocation of 2 kg of rice and 3 kg of atta will be given from NFSA quota. The balance amount of 4 kg of rice and 2 kg of atta will be given as top up over and above the NFSA quota and the expenditure will be borne by the Govt. of West Bengal. Accounts shall be maintained accordingly. After the Assembly elections, Pradhan alleged, the state had decided to implement only the AAY under the National Food Security Act in the entire hills so that it didnt have to bear the additional expenditure of 4kg of rice and 2kg of atta.Under the AAY, a backward family is entitled to 15kg of rice and 20kg of fortified atta at Rs 2 per kg per month. This basically means that a family of four and above will now be getting less amount of foodgrains than what the state government promised. According to the special package announced before the Assembly elections, a hill family of five is entitled to 55kg of foodgrains. The hidden agenda of getting the hill population under the AAY is to ensure that the state government does not have to bear the additional cost of supplying 6kg of foodgrains per person a month, said Pradhan. The Morcha central committee member said it was fine for the Morcha if the state provided 35kg of foodgrains to a family under the AAY and the remaining 6kg per head per month. We also demand that since the hills have been brought under the AAY, which is for the financially backward families, the state declare the hills a backward area and give benefits for the backward region like exemption from income tax, subsides in transport, fuel, gas connections and electricity, said Pradhan."

Telegraph picture Three young men from Patna have launched a start-up that offers better rates than regular middlemen to farmers for their produce. Farmanze, the company started three months ago by IIM-Lucknow alumnus Sumit Kumar (26), Banaras Hindu University alumnus Ankit Chandra (24), and chartered accountant Vineet Agrawal (26), has tied up with more than 500 farmers in nine districts: Patna, Ara, Gaya, Buxar, Nawada, Jehanabad, Lakhisarai, Begusarai and Sasaram. The company buys the farmers' produce and supplies it to 15 supermarkets including 9 to 9 and S Mart, 40 grocery stores and a few restaurants in Patna. ""There are four to five middlemen involved from the farm to the market,"" said Ankit. ""The Nawada farmers with whom we tied up first for marketing their sonachura rice were getting Rs 25 to 27 for per kg of rice but we gave them Rs 35 to 38. We sold the rice at Rs 45 per kg in the market, and kept the surplus. We also take care of cleaning, packaging and transportation (of the produce)."" He said a farmer's earning from an acre's produce has gone up from around Rs 20,000 to Rs 40,000. ""Farmanze initially tied up with 15 farmers of Warsaliganj of Nawada district and another 24 farmers from Sasaram district,"" said Sumit. ""At Sasaram, we found middleman had exploited farmers to a great extent. There were many who wanted to give up the farming of the Sasaram katarni rice as it was not giving them much profit. The farmers were selling the rice at Rs 18 per kg but from us they get Rs 25 per kg. The (regular) middleman misguides the farmers by saying that their produce is not up to the mark. Farmers are thus in a way forced to sell their produce at a low cost by middlemen."" It was not easy for Farmanze to gain the trust of the farmers, who initially were weary of another bunch of middlemen. ""At every village, we make it a point to go with a known person of that village who can help us break the ice with the farmers,"" said Vineet. Ankit added: ""It is only because of our transparency that we have been able to collaborate with more than 500 farmers in just three months."" Farmers who have tied up with Farmanze seemed happy. Gopal Kumar, from Lai village around 40km southwest of Patna, said rice for which he got Rs 16 to Rs 17 per kg, he now receives Rs 24 per kg. ""Fifteen people from our village have collaborated with the company,"" said Gopal. ""We are very happy as our profit margin has increased."" Pankaj Kumar, from Usri around 100km southeast of Patna, said the farmers from his village were not getting sellers for sonachura rice for the last two years. ""We could sell the rice only at Rs 25 to Rs 28 per kg but after collaborating with Farmanze, we got Rs 34 per kg for the same variety,"" Pankaj said."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, May 9: Politics took the centre stage on Akshay Tritiya as the BJD and the two major Opposition parties vied with each other to woo farmers while aiming verbal barbs at rivals. Akshay Tritya marks the onset of farming activities in the state and is considered an important festival for farmers. While the BJD made a tacit attempt to project the states official programme on the occasion as its own, the BJP sought to hijack the programme organised by the Centre at the Cuttack-based National Rice Research Institute (NRRI) graced by Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. The keen competition among the BJD and the BJP to corner glory was evident from the flood of banners and posters featuring their prominent leaders, including chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Union ministers Radha Mohan Singh and Dhermendra Pradhan, in and around the respective venues, where their programmes were held. While Singh, who addressed a public meeting in the company of Pradhan and some state BJP leaders at Kandarpur in Cuttack close to NRRI, launched a special mobile application for farmers, Naveen inaugurated the direct benefit transfer scheme at Lakshminarayanpur near Pipili where the state-level Akshay Tritiya programme was held. Ramesh Rout, a farmer of Laxminarayanpur, became the first beneficiary of the scheme under which the amount of agriculture subsidy would be transferred directly to the bank accounts of farmers. The rivalry between the BJD and the BJP acquired an edge as the outspoken agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy, who happens to be the MLA from Pipli, taunted the saffron party for being a copycat and organising a programme to mark Akshay Tritiya by following the example of Naveen. He alleged that the BJP had used the resources of the petroleum and natural gas ministry, headed by Dharmendra Pradhan, for the purpose. The BJP is following the Naveen Patnaik government in celebrating Akshay Tritya. Money from the oil sector is being used for the purpose. But they should remember that a thousand needles cannot make a shovel, said Maharathy at Lakshminarayanpur, quoting an Odia proverb. This drew a sharp retort from Pradhan, who, while addressing the gathering at NRRI in Cuttack, said: Given a chance, the BJD would even seek to monopolise the annual rath yatra of Lord Jagannath in Puri and claim it as its own. Pradhan was also engaged in verbal jousting with BJDs Cuttack MP Bhartruhari Mahatab at the Union government-organised programme at the NRRI. Mahatab was the first to take a dig at the Union minister, who, he said, was more active in Odisha despite being a member of Parliament from Bihar. We expect to see more of him in Odisha in the coming days, said Mahtab, obviously hinting at the political ambitions of Pradhan in the state despite his Rajya Sabha membership from Bihar. Pradhan retorted citing the example of the Mahabharats Ekalabya, who, despite the refusal of Guru Dronacharya to train him in archery (in this case the allusion was to Odisha not sending him to Parliament), went on to become a great archer by his sheer dedication. I know he (Mahatab) has taken a subtle dig at me. But he should know that history still remembers Ekalabya. He also took a dig at Naveen by saying that he could speak in Odia. State Congress president Prasad Harichandan, who took part in the party-organised Akshay Tritiya programme at a village in Balianta block on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar, lashed out at both the BJD and the BJP for ignoring the plight of farmers, who were committing suicide across the state."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, May 9: Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh today launched a mobile application for farmers on the occasion of Akshay Tritiya here. The App - riceXpert - has been developed by scientists of National Rice Research Institute (NRRI) to provide real-time information to farmers about problems related to crops and cultivation. ""The App will be a handy tool for farmers across the country to get crucial information on cultivation and other issues, including selecting the right fertiliser and necessary soil tests,"" Singh said. Singh was speaking at a farmers' fair at NRRI in the presence of Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan, Cuttack's BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab and Indian Council of Agricultural Research director general Trilochan Mohapatra, among others. ""The farmers need Android-based smartphones to download the App that will provide information on different issues, including pest control, ecology-specific rice varieties, nutrient deficiency and other farming tools,"" said NRRI director A.K. Nayak. After downloading the App from Google Play, a farmer needs to upload a picture of any problem , including pest, disease, their cure and ways to manage nutrients in different varieties of soil. As soon as a query is received, an expert panel consisting of agricultural scientists will respond with necessary remedial measures. An SMS will then be sent to the farmer within 24 hours, said Nayak. NRRI scientists said though the App has been launched in English, a farmer can send any queries in the interactive application in any regional language. Nayak said there were plans to introduce the App in Hindi and other regional languages shortly. While addressing the farmers, Singh highlighted the achievements of the Narendra Modi government in addressing their basic problems. The government has launched a soil health card scheme to provide crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and fertilisers required for farms, making it possible for them to increase productivity, he said. ""We have asked state governments to expedite the process and make necessary proposals as we have targeted to set up at least 200 markets for procurement of farmers' produce by 2017 and 550 markets in different parts of the country by 2018,"" Singh said. Despite drought-like conditions in various parts of the country, the Union minister expressed hope of a surplus production this year. He said the Union government had targeted improvement in farm productivity through the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna by starting 89 special irrigation projects in the country. It aims to irrigate fields of every farmer and improve efficiency of water use to provide more crop per drop through proper water conservation techniques. Singh also congratulated the NRRI scientists for developing the App and the world's first high-protein rice variety CR Dhan 210."
58feffec7be9e0420db2b1ea,Strait is the gate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/opinion/story_96266.jsp,2016-07-13,"If the prime minister, Narendra Modi, had been aware of a closely held secret of how the nuclear deal with the United States of America came about, he may not have persisted in pushing for India's membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group at this stage. Such a push has triggered an avoidable domestic controversy and generated uncertainties abroad about India's standing in the world. If Rajnath Singh, said to be the most superstitious of Modi's cabinet colleagues, had been told by at least one of his numerous astrologers that any year ending in 6 is a bad one for India for taking new diplomatic initiatives in, he would have persuaded the external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj, to somehow prevail upon the prime minister not to stake too much on NSG membership this year. If S. Jaishankar, who has done more than most diplomats to end India's long nuclear winter, had time off his virtually round-the-clock foreign secretary's schedule to reflect in hindsight on some of the impressive landmarks of his career, he may have resisted the push to go for NSG membership now mostly by people with political clout but with little understanding of strategic issues. The India-US nuclear deal was exclusively a George W. Bush initiative that few others in the US president's administration or in the American political establishment of that time wanted. The state department was unenthusiastic about it. There was little support, in the beginning, in either chamber of US Congress for the deal. A rare exception was Condoleezza Rice, who had left her White House job as national security adviser shortly before the deal was announced in July, 2005, to become secretary of state. She went along with Bush on the deal with India. Some say Bush went along with Rice on the offer to end New Delhi's nuclear isolation. But even for the US president and his secretary of state 11 years ago, the nuclear deal, as originally conceived, was a way to freeze, roll back and eventually eliminate India's nuclear programme. In return, India would be offered trade in nuclear weapons and technology and access to nuclear power to meet the country's energy shortages which were slowing down economic growth. The first draft of the nuclear agreement, handed to Shyam Saran, then the foreign secretary, by the the under secretary of state for political affairs at that time, Nicholas Burns, in London a few weeks after the announcement of the deal envisaged a formal commitment by India that it would not test nuclear weapons any more. The restrictive clauses in that draft were exclusively reported by this newspaper within days after the draft was exchanged in London, causing furore in Parliament and outside. When Manmohan Singh was in Washington again, two Indian diplomats were asked to conduct a survey on the support in the US Senate for the deal. Such support was crucial for its passage on Capitol Hill. The survey revealed that only 20 of the Senate's 100 members were supporting their president's nuclear deal with India. For New Delhi's negotiators, the most alarming aspect of the survey was that Hillary Clinton, who then headed the Senate India Caucus, was one of the senators who were opposed to the deal. The story of how Clinton was converted into being a supporter of the deal by Indians and Indian Americans working together cannot be revealed because such an exposure is fraught with the risk of a defamation suit. The full story could still somewhat damage Clinton's current bid to return to the White House as its tenant after 16 years. It took full two years of difficult and complex negotiations for New Delhi and Washington to finalize the text of a bilateral agreement that would create the structure of the nuclear deal. Even so, when the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, addressed a press conference on July 27, 2007, along with the foreign secretary and the chairman of the atomic energy commission, his opening words were, ""We are happy to inform you that the governments of India and the United States of America have finalized the text of the bilateral agreement for cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy."" That was it. The nuclear deal with the US was for ""cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy"", notwithstanding the spin for domestic opinion within India that the US had recognized India as a nuclear weapons State. In its pursuit of NSG membership, the current political dispensation in New Delhi forgot that India had not moved an inch beyond that position. Events in Seoul last month needlessly resurrected a reality, forgotten - or perhaps overlooked since the Indo-US nuclear deal - that India is not a de jure nuclear weapons State, that the world expects New Delhi to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and conform to the comprehensive test ban treaty even if it refuses to sign the latter. Often in the past, when India's de jure status within the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture has been brought up, both the United Progressive Alliance government and the current National Democratic Alliance have skirted the issue. The NSG's decision to shut its doors on India proves the common reality that neither the UPA nor the NDA wants to confront: macho declarations that India is a nuclear weapons State and that it is not looking for any certificate to that effect from anyone are mere bravado. If successive political dispensations in New Delhi actually believe that such chest-thumping will change ground realities, they ought not have to go to NSG or anywhere else to validate India's nuclear status or to seek the approval of the global consensual non-proliferation architecture. The verdict in Seoul was that India cannot have the cake and eat it too. There is a way out, though. That way out was not chosen because Modi is unaware of a crucial secret of how the Indo-US nuclear deal came about. On July 18, 2005, after extensive consultations between Indian and American diplomats over the joint statement in Washington by Manmohan Singh and Bush, a final draft was given to the Indian side by the Americans. A very senior Indian diplomat then quietly changed a word in the final draft in the second paragraph relating to ""India's plans to develop its civilian nuclear energy programme"". Without telling the US side, he changed the prescription relating to India ""signing and adhering to the Additional Protocol"" of the International Atomic Energy Agency. When the joint statement was approved by Bush and Singh and released, India's requirement became ""signing and adhering to an Additional Protocol"" because this perspicacious diplomat replaced the word ""the"" with ""an"". The American side did not notice the change, but they were now committed to the new formulation. Without that change, India would have been in the same situation with the IAEA on the nuclear deal as it finds itself today in the NSG. With the new joint commitment in hand, when the time came in 2009 to finalize matters with the IAEA, India insisted that it would not sign ""the"" additional protocol, which applied to signatories of the NPT that could not legally possess nuclear weapons or weapons materials under international treaty obligations. India signed ""an"" additional protocol, which was different from the NPT model. It was created to suit New Delhi's special needs. It was because of the uniqueness of India's ""an"" additional protocol that although it was signed in Vienna on May 15, 2009, it took another five years and two months for the IAEA to bring it into force. It is reasonable to assume that Jaishankar knows about this episode. If the perspicacious diplomat who made the change told this columnist about it on the night of July 18, 2005, during celebrations in the Indian camp as Singh triumphally concluded his Washington visit, it is highly unlikely that he would not have told Jaishankar, who was then the joint secretary in charge of the Americas and a key member of the prime minister's delegation. The moral of the story is that there is no straight path into the NSG, and Modi and his team must fashion tactics similar to what India employed in the White House on the nuclear deal. In conclusion, the curse of the years ending in 6 on Indian diplomacy needs to be explained. In 1996, India was routed by Japan and humiliated in its effort to enter the United Nations security council. In 2006, the government in New Delhi nearly fell on account of diplomacy: the effort to operationalize the Indo-US nuclear deal. Ten years hence, in 2016, India lost its bid to join the NSG. Rajnath Singh ought to have been told about this long shadow that falls on Indian diplomacy every 10 years. [email protected]"

And now one word about that friendship itself - here, here, I am proud indeed and can hold up my head without shame for I have a gift to give... And so when you told me you needed my friendship my heart leapt up for joy."" - Letter from C.F. Andrews to Rabindranath Tagore, December 7, 1913 Rabindranath Tagore: A Mind Staring into Infinity is a splendid tribute to and grateful acknowledgement of Tagore's multifaceted creative genius and many-sided actual engagement. It begins with an excellent essay written by Mandakranta Bose on Tagore's deep and lasting Vaishnav connection and ends with a short but fruitful essay on Tagore the painter-artist written by Raman Siva Kumar. In between these two encomiums are placed seven academic essays titled, ""Santiniketan's Place in India's Nationalist History: As Gleaned from the Letters of Andrews, Tagore and Gandhi""; ""Recovery of the Self: Rural Welfare and Rabindranath Tagore""; ""The Prince's Progress: Tagore, Tasher Desh and Revisionist Mythmaking""; ""Tagore's Educational Model and its Relation with the New School Movement""; ""The Itinerant Traveller: Tagore and America""; ""Tagore and Western Modernity: Towards an Analytical Understanding"" and ""Tagore and Dance and Rabindranath as Painter"". Each and every article is well-researched and sensitively written and, altogether, these essays construct the varied and multilayered persona of Tagore, who could concentrate fruitfully on rural welfare, nationalist movement and the evolution of Tagorian or Rabindrik dance at the same moment. Without decrying the other essays, I confess that I am particularly drawn to the essay of Uma Dasgupta who has explored the fascinating triangular relationship involving Tagore, Gandhi and Andrews; to the essay of Sobhonlal Datta Gupta who has analysed the relationship between Tagore and Western modernity; to Mandakranta Bose's essay emphasizing the Vaishnav idiom in Tagore's creativity and to Raman Siva Kumar's essay on the evolution of Tagore as painter. In a revealing letter written to Brajendranath Seal, dated October 31, 1921, Tagore stated, ""Vaishnava literature and the Upanishads have mingled to form my mental climate. They have mixed like the nitrogen and oxygen in the air."" Nevertheless, there appears to be a distinction and difference between the responses to Vaishnav creativity and to the Upanishads. While the Upanishads nurtured and constructed his profound spiritual dimension, Vaishnav literature from Jayadev's Gitagobinda to Vidyapati and Chandidas acted as a source of deathless inspiration of essentially secular though sacred creativity. Indeed, the relation between Jayadev and Tagore was deep and abiding, and the essayist has explored this flowering relationship with subtle finesse. One could of course argue that, particularly in Tagore's case, it is impossible to separate spiritualism from creativity. The two constellate together like nitrogen and oxygen. This argument is basically correct but, at the same time, the lover and the humanist in Tagore regarded Radha and Krishna as full-blooded human figures who cross through several phases of Vaishnav love beginning from abhisar and ending in bhavsanmmelan, like two actual lovers buffeted by contrary emotions. Perhaps, this is not unexpected because Tagore regarded the entire Bhakti movement, of which Vaishnav lyricism is an integral part, as basically an aesthetic emotion. In the words of Mandakranta Bose, ""Rabindranath's emphasis on the exclusive influence of metre notwithstanding, the aesthetic of bhakti acts as one of the prime determinants of his poetic identity."" Ultimately, in the final analysis, the secular and the sacred, the creative and the spiritual merge to form - as Raymond Williams would say - one, indivisible ""structure of feeling"". The fervent translation of Kabir's dohas by Tagore and the aesthetically electrifying Bhanusingher Padavali are then two sides of the same coin. It is this same spiritual and aesthetic credo, which ardently aspired for the comprehensive flourishing of the community and the nation and for the harmonious perfection of their indispensable component, the human being, that guided him to question Western modernity and castigate nationalism as it was preached and practised in the Twenties of the last century, in no uncertain terms. He found that the prevailing nationalism at that point of time was immoral, warmongering and ugly. But does this unqualified condemnation imply that Tagore was opposed to nationalism and patriotism per se? The answer to this query is simple - one needs to go through the songs of ""Swadesh"" in Gitabitan to realize how strong and pervasive was his attachment to his country, India. Emphasizing this important aspect of his personality, Sovonlal Datta Gupta in his masterly critical essay wrote, ""He [Tagore] made it clear that, while in the West, the focus was on state, power and individual, in India the accent was on samaj, dharma and social accountability."" In fact, he loved his country as intensely as Gandhi and he never failed to differentiate aggressive Western and Japanese nationalism from swadesh prem, deshbhakti and swadesh chetana. In short, he was a patriot par excellence and his love for his country and its people inspired him to write a song like, "" Nai nai bhay hobe hobe joy khule jabe ei dwar/ Jani jani tor bandhandor chire jabe bare bar."" (""Be not afraid, victory is assured, this door will open/ I know, I know this bondage will tear itself time and again."") If one wishes to have a genuine account of Tagore's love for the motherland, one needs to read the last section of his epic, Gora, especially the last four pages, where he declares eloquently that love in this context implies love for every single downtrodden and castaway inhabiting the country. No better account of Tagorian nationalism is available. The last four pages of Gora say it all and with such emotional conviction: ""Today I am an Indian. There is no conflict among Hindus, Muslims and Christians in my heart. Today each and every caste and religion is my own. The rice of all is my rice"". It is this same unsullied love for the single human being, exploited and persecuted, and for the country, which is nothing more than a sum total of such human beings, that erased the distance among Gandhi, Andrews and Tagore. A close triangular relationship of love and admiration draws the three together with Andrews often acting as the intermediary between the other two Olympians. He had to explicate what Gandhi genuinely meant to Tagore and vice versa. Tagore was intensely moved by Gandhi's and Andrews's work in South Africa and in his letter to Andrews dated February 9, 1914, he wrote, ""We are waiting for you knowing that you are coming back to us with your heart full of the wisdom of death and the tender strength of sorrow."" He even wrote an inspiring song to honour Andrews and referred to the relentless struggle in South Africa as the ""steep ascent of manhood, not through the bloody path of violence but that of dignified patience and heroic self-renunciation"". Last but not the least, Raman Siva Kumar's essay on Tagore the painter, in spite of its brevity, has ably stressed the unique aspects in Tagore's painting. Like William Blake, the Pre-Raphaelites and Gnter Grass, Tagore also emerged as an independent painter and he himself, like the others, underlined the difference between words on the one hand and lines as well as figures, on the other. He observed, ""All kinds of poetic works die with language. In a way paintings are more enduring. The difference between what is grasped by the eyes and what is grasped by the language lies in this."" The essayist has drawn our attention to one, perhaps, faulty judgment that tries to link Tagore the artist with the Expressionists. The truth is simple - Tagore the painter does not belong to any specific school. As the author notes, ""If there is darkness in his paintings there is also playfulness in them and unlike the Expressionists, with whom he is often compared, he did not cease to feel a deep empathy with nature and man even in his darkest moment."" Not only to the essays discussed but also to others I shall return again to have a complete picture of that phenomenal spirit and activist. In particular, I shall return to Uma Dasgupta's essay that celebrates the relationship involving Tagore, Andrews and Gandhi. Their letters written to one another reveal another world that is sublime, ethical and poetic."
58ff00207be9e0420db2b239,Lankan Tamil refugees duped with Aussie dream,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160620/jsp/nation/story_92216.jsp,2016-06-20,"Chennai, June 19: A foiled illegal immigration bid has highlighted how Sri Lankan Tamil refugees languishing in Tamil Nadu's government camps continue to be duped by racketeers with promises of a better life in Australia. The 28 refugees intercepted by state coastal police on June 2 while being driven to their waiting boat were the lucky ones. Had they been able to sail, past experience suggests they could well have perished in the high seas in their crummy boats or been locked up in refugee detention centres on islands off the Australian coast. A senior police officer said the local and Lankan agents of a human trafficking ring exploit the refugees' reluctance to return to Sri Lanka and their desire to escape the poor living conditions in their Tamil Nadu camps. Activists working with refugees said the agents lure the refugees with offers of a sea trip to Australia at Rs 1 lakh per head. They are told that asylum is a certainty once they reach the transit camps on Australia's Christmas Island. On June 2, the group of 28 from four refugee camps were caught while on their way to the Pulicat Lake, a lagoon between Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, in two vans with a bike-borne escort. They had been told they would be posing as tourists taking a boat ride on the lake before being shifted to a vessel on the coast, which would eventually drop them at Christmas Island. The coastal police arrested the van drivers and the escort - allegedly an agent - along with the 13 male refugees. The women and children were sent back to their camps. ""We suspect some agents collect the money and tip the police off while transporting them to the pick-up point,"" said S.C. Chandrahasan of OfERR, an organisation that works for the rehabilitation of the Lankan Tamil refugees living in government camps in the state. The racket began in 2002 with most of the Australia trips by Tamil refugees happening from Sri Lanka itself. Some 200 of them died when their boats capsized. Another 1,600 reached Christmas Island only to be sent to detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea under an arrangement these countries have with Canberra. The Australian government claims it has sent back some people. The racket reached the refugee camps in Tamil Nadu in 2008 but most of the 400 or so who have attempted to leave the country so far have been caught before sailing or intercepted off Malaysia or the Andamans. These refugees are usually warned and sent back to their camp after being kept in a police station for a few days. No prosecutions have happened. Only a couple of agents have been arrested but they have jumped bail. Chandrahasan said the attempted trips to Australia had fallen sharply thanks to increased vigil by the Indian coast guard and the state coastal police. He added that his organisation and the Australian government had warned the refugees they were not welcome in Australia. Still, some get tempted. ""There is no way that people who attempt to travel to Australia by boat will be allowed to settle in Australia,"" Sean Kelly, the Australian vice-consul, recently told reporters in Chennai. ""Anyone who does survive the journey will be intercepted and transferred to regional processing centres in Nauru and the Manus Island in Papua New Guinea."" Chandrahasan said the Papua government had recently announced that it would close its refugee camp on Manus Island under orders from the country's topmost court. ""So, the fate of the 1,200 refugees in the camp has become even more uncertain,"" he said. Some 102,055 Lankan Tamil refugees live in 107 government camps across the state. Each refugee family is provided a dole, 20kg rice a month, ration cards to buy essentials and free education up to Class XII. Many refugees who came to Tamil Nadu in the 1990s have studied here, got married and had children. On the other hand, the camps at Nauru and Papua have basic amenities but none is allowed to venture outside. The one on Manus Island is virtually cut off from the local population. Although the ethnic conflict ended in 2009, many are reluctant to return home, unsure they can earn a livelihood there. The Indian arm of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has helped the voluntary repatriation of about 12,500 Lankan refugees between 2002 and 2014. This year, 315 have returned home so far. A senior officer said the police had foiled at least half-a-dozen attempts to smuggle Tamil refugees out of the country in the past four years. The DMK and the AIADMK have been demanding the Centre grant citizenship to the refugees who want to live in India. But Delhi has balked at the suggestion fearing similar demands from Assam, where the status of Bangladeshi immigrants remains a contentious issue."

The industry has also tried to convey the need for a comprehensive policy for the sector.In a meeting with Bengal labour minister Moloy Ghatak, ahead of the state budget, members of the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) sought administrative support on stamp duty waiver on land registration and the settlement of dispute regarding land revenue payment.""The meeting with the labour minister was primarily to apprise him of the present situation of the industry, the problems related to raw jute availability and the lack of procurement orders in the mills,""an IJMA member said.""We have also informed the minister that the industry is geared up to meet the requirements of the state for packing rice and potato using jute bags based on good estimates of raw jute in the next crop year. Issues related to wage settlement have also been brought to his notice.""Jute mills in the state have to compete with imports from Bangladesh and Nepal as well as used jute bags. There is a gradual dilution in orders in spite of the compulsory Jute Packaging Act (JPM 1987).""There is growing uncertainty on account of dilution of procurement under the JPM act. The reservation for packing has been diluted from 100 per cent to 90 per cent for food grains and 20 per cent for sugar,"" the member said."

(PTI) Guwahati, July 27: The flood situation in Assam remained grim today with 16.68 lakh people affected in 21 districts as the surging waters of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries inundated more areas. The floodwaters have claimed five persons since yesterday while two world heritage sites, the Kaziranga and Manas national parks, remained submerged. Dabal Mili, 8, was washed away by the surging waters of Boginadi in Lakhimpur district yesterday. In Dhubri district, the body of Wazed Ali, 50, of Jhagrarpar village, who had gone missing yesterday while fishing in floodwaters, was recovered last night. A one-and-a-half year old baby drowned at Bilasipara last night. In Chirang district, ailing Jogesh Roy, 55, and Naba Roy, 24, who were marooned, died for want of medical treatment. The army, NDRF and the SDRF today rushed to Majuli to evacuate people from flood-affected areas. More than a lakh people in 110 villages have been displaced there. Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal also rushed to Majuli to take stock of the situation. He wrote to chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia, recommending departmental action against 11 officials (of different departments like education, agriculture and veterinary) posted on the island for leaving without intimation or permission from the sub-divisional administration. Vittal told The Telegraph over phone from Majuli this evening that the officials were not found on duty at a time when the island was in the grip of severe floods. He said he had received complaints that these officials, including engineers, leave Majuli every weekend without informing or taking the approval of the sub-divisional administration, which is compulsory. He also directed Majuli sub-divisional officer (civil) Narsing Pawar to issue showcause notices to nine other officials for not attending flood-review meetings in the past few days in Majuli. He has issued a directive that no government employee posted in Majuli can leave station till August 15. In Golaghat district, the Brahmaputra breached the Halodhibari-Besamara embankment near Bongaon last evening. Punya Saikia, a resident, said the houses of 14 families were washed away. They somehow managed to save their lives. ""About 15,000 people took shelter on the embankment. The only food they got was flat rice and jaggery. Till 11 this morning, no one from the administration had visited the site. My house is also flooded and all my clothes and other articles have got damaged,"" he said, adding that those stranded on the other side of the embankment had not got any relief. In Dhubri district, more than three lakh people, including those in urban areas, reeled under floods as the water level of the Brahmaputra showed a rising trend. Of these, about one lakh people remained trapped in floodwaters despite rescue operations by the SDRF and the NDRF, administration sources said. A senior official of Dhubri district said the situation was likely to remain critical for the next 24 hours with more areas getting inundated. ""Floodwaters in Dhubri are heading towards the highest level (30.36m) recorded in 1988. It is predicted to cross 30m, which will be a matter of great concern,"" Dhubri additional deputy commissioner Debojit Khanikar said. An official of Dhubri division water resource department said the danger level of the Brahmaputra is 28.62m but it is flowing above 1.16m in Dhubri with a rising trend. In Dhubri town, all shops downed shutters following inundation and private schools and institutions remained closed. Nearly 30,000 people marooned in the town demanded relief materials. The situation, however, improved slightly in the lower Assam districts of Kokrajhar and Chirang with water levels of major river receding fast, though many areas remain submerged forcing people to stay in relief camps. In some flood-affected areas of Chirang, the administration started rescue and relief operations today with the help of NDRF. Though the water level of the Aie and its tributaries receded, the low-lying and riverine areas remained submerged. Two medical teams have been sent to Sidli and Bijni revenue circles. Nine relief camps in Sidli and four in Bijni have been set up. In Kokrajhar, 15,000 people in about 50 villages have been affected by the rising waters of the Sankosh, the Sormanga and the Gongia. Altogether 9,526 people are taking shelter in 11 relief camps."

Picture by Bhola Prasad Great haste makes great waste, Benjamin Franklin once said. East Singhbhum on Thursday showed how. In a rush to obey a Supreme Court order to drought-prone states on providing midday meals even during summer vacations in schools, the district education department rustled up can-loads of khichdi without ensuring attendance in the locked campuses. The result was obvious - no takers in most schools and a handful in some. A manager of the centralised kitchen, run at Ramdas Bhatta community centre by Iskcon Food Relief Foundation in collaboration with Tata Steel urban services, said they supplied khichdi made of rice and split pulses to as many as 308 schools in Jamshedpur and its outskirts. In most cases, the midday meal vans returned loaded. ""We had suspected low attendance during vacation and had cooked lesser amount of khichdi than we usually do. Yet, the meal was surplus. Food van driver said in most schools there were no students and grade-IV staff collected meals. Some schools were under lock and key,"" the kitchen manager said, requesting anonymity. This correspondent visited three schools between 8.30am and 9.15am. In two, attendance was nil while the third school saw a bunch of 10 students against a total strength of 199. "" Hum ko teacher ne aaj subah bulaya tha iss liye hum khana khane aayein hain. Baki log ka pata nahin (Principal Nisha Vani had called me this morning, so I came to have my midday meal.

Eighth grader Sonali Jaiswal (13) of the same school pitched in, ""The principal called my neighbour to inform me. Ten of us have come among 199 students."" At Sri Surat Sarvajanik Gujarati Madhya Vidyalaya, there was no one to open the gate. The food van honked for a while before an elderly woman came out to collect the khichdi. ""I have been asked to collect the meals. I am just following orders,"" said the woman who identified herself as Vimala. Similarly, at Rajasthan Vidya Mandir at Aambagan in Sakchi, there were no students and the food was collected by a grade-IV employee who lives on the school campus. That the entire summer midday meal execution plan has been botched up by the state and district authorities reflected in the words of principal Sheela Kumari of Rajasthan Vidya Mandir. ""We got to know of the midday meal supply only yesterday (Wednesday). We did not get time to personally inform students. We should have been told at least a week in advance,"" the principal said. District superintendent of education Inder Bhusan Singh conceded hasty execution. ""A state notification was issued through media yesterday and today (Thursday) was the first day of serving meals.

Picture by Gautam Dey A good cause will now reach a wider market. Women who learn to make items of daily use to become self-sufficient at Disha, the training centre of ACC Ltd, Sindri, will now get help from Marwari Mahila Samiti, Dhanbad, to market their products. On Monday, Marwari Mahila Samiti (Dhanbad) president Anita Mishra and other members visited the training centre at the Sindri-based Projects and Development India Limited (PDIL) campus to explore the possibility of marketing the products made by the rural women associated with Disha. At present, 88 women from the cement plant's adjoining villages, including Simatand, Kushberia and Shitalpur, learn to stitch, make jute craft items, puffed rice (muri) and phenyl and grind spices. Director of Disha, Ranjit Kumar said the visiting team was impressed with training arrangements at their centre and product quality. ""For starters, they (Marwari Mahila Samiti) assured us of giving a free stall during the upcoming Anand Mela, the largest handicraft fair in the district, that would be held at Siddhi Vinayak hotel on July 23 and 24,"" Disha director Kumar said. Talking about the centre, Kumar said it was a corporate social responsibility of the cement plant. ""We are helping rural women to be self-employed with the help of Jharcraft and local trainers. However, we do face difficulty in marketing the finished items. That's why we approached Marwari Mahila Samiti, which regularly organises fairs,"" he said. On her part, president of Marwari Mahila Samiti president Mishra said they would be happy to give a stall for free at Anand Mela. ""Normally, we charge a price for stall space. But, we will allot a stall free for the sale of Disha products. We'd also love to continue our engagement with them,"" she said. Disha director Kumar said that ACC established the centre in a two-room rented accommodation at PDIL campus. Raw materials like cloth, rice and 10 sewing machines were provided by the cement company to start the centre around a year ago. Selection of women for different skill-based training was made on the basis of interest shown by women during the initial awareness programmeconducted by the local NGO. Before starting the centre Disha carried out a survey in nearby villages with help of NGO Lok Kalyan Parishad to find out if women were interested in learning job skills."

Picture by Main Uddin Chisti Dinhata Settlement Camp (Cooch Behar), May 4: Naresh Burman, who eked out a living by practising as a quack at Dashiarchora, an Indian enclave in Bangladesh, is now a day wage worker in Dinhata. Md. Mafizuddin owned a four-and-a-half bigha plot at Dashiarchora and used to till the land. But after India and Bangladesh exchanged enclaves last year and Mafizuddin chose to live in India, he has been without income. Both Burman and Mafizuddin stay at the enclave settlement camp in Cooch Behar's Dinhata and present the grim picture of the uncertainties they are sucked into. But political leaders make a beeline for the camp to seek votes and promise to settle their problems. ""We only get 30kg of rice a month from the state government. When we stepped into the Indian mainland, we were told that every day, each family would receive Rs 88 for buying vegetables and other food. Till date, we have not received the money. As I could not sell the land in the enclave, I don't have money at hand. It is tough to run a family of six,"" says Mafizuddin, sitting in front of a hut which has been provided to his family by the government at Dinhata. ""The 30kg rice does not last for a month. I was a prominent farmer in my village but now, I have to look for a day wage work. Some days, I get work, while on other days, I have to sit idle."" Following the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) between India and Bangladesh, 922 Indians residing in the enclaves in Bangladesh, crossed the border and entered India. Of them, over 350 who make up 58 families stay at the settlement camp in Dinhata. Most of the Bangladeshis who stayed in the enclaves in India have opted to stay back. They are now Indian citizens. ""In total, 9,776 fresh voters have been enlisted in five Assembly constituencies in Cooch Behar district. They are residents of erstwhile enclaves and would be voting for the first time,"" said an official of Cooch Behar district administration. Dinhata constituency has the highest number of enclave dwellers (5,486) as voters. ""We have no idea of the way polls are fought in India. We have seen elections in Bangladesh over the years. We don't know the political parties in India and their agendas. Most of us only know that it is because of two leaders, Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee, that we could return to our homeland,"" Burman said. ""However, what bothers us here is lack of employment opportunities or financial assistance from the government to run our families. I have studied till Class XII and was a palli chikitsak (rural medical practitioner/quack) at Dashiarchora. I am not accustomed to the work in a field or a construction site. It is indeed a crisis for us."" Asked which political parties Narendra Modi and Mamata Banerjee represented, he took some time before uttering the names of the BJP and Trinamul. Cooch Behar district goes to polls tomorrow, along with some other constituencies in the rest of Bengal. Addressing a public meeting in Dinhata on Tuesday, Mamata assured the former enclave dwellers of all help. ""Around 9,000 to 10,000 voters have increased. All your problems would be resolved. The government has done everything and will do some more. If Udayan wins....it will largely help. You needn't worry. Whatever we had promised when you came here....all those commitments would be met. After the elections, I will look into those pending issues,"" she said. "" Chhitmohol er keu achen (Anybody from the enclaves is here)?,"" Mamata asked and there was no response. Trinamul has fielded Udayan Guha in Dinhata. Those who have come from Bangladesh have been provided with two-room huts, electricity, common toilet blocks and drinking water. Their children have been admitted to nearby primary and high schools. But no specific employment opportunity or financial assistance has been given to them. ""It is disappointing that even though they had come here last year, no initiative was taken to provide any sort of employment to the men and women,"" Akshay Thakur, the Forward Bloc candidate of Dinhata, said. ""It is unlikely that any of these people will vote for Trinamul. Nothing has been done for the erstwhile Bangladeshi residents who have stayed back in India and are citizens of this country now."" Political observers say there is a close contest in Dinhata. ""There are fresh voters in four other Assembly constituencies of the district but the numbers are not so high there unlike Dinhata where the figure is above 5,000. There is a close contest between Trinamul and the Bloc,"" said an observer. Additional reporting by Main Uddin Chisti"

(Hardeep Singh) Misfortune never arrives alone, they say. Sanjay Sao for one would agree. The chole-bhature vendor from Karamtoli, Ranchi, lost his years-long savings for his sister's illness in a freak fire at their rented home on Sunday morning. Although urban development minister C.P. Singh, after visiting the spot, has promised ""full support"" so that Sao can treat his sister Kunti who suffers from a rare bone disease that shrinks her body, the 27-year-old vendor cannot help but rue the one cardinal mistake he made that cost him his Rs 50,000 savings, besides jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh belonging to his wife. Firemen suspect that an explosion triggered the blaze and that the explosion occurred because the kerosene stove was left burning too close to a cooking gas cylinder. Sao conceded that his negligence had put him in trouble. ""I shouldn't have left the stove burning... But then, rice was boiling in a pot and I thought I could buy a few things from the neighbourhood grocer in the meantime,"" he said. Landlady Reeta Singh was the first to notice the fire. She sought help from local residents to control the blaze before the fire brigade arrived. Fortunately, the vendor's family members - wife Debanti, daughter Preeti Kumari (5), sons Sachin (3) and Luvkush (1), elderly mother and sister Kunti (25) - were away in their native village. ""Sanjay (Sao), a native of Misraul in Tandwa, Chatra, has been my tenant since January. He is hardworking; sells chole-bhature in the city; and pays the rent on time. The incident is unfortunate,"" Reeta said. On Kunti's condition, Sao said her bone ailment didn't allow her to stand straight and her body was shrinking for years now. ""I had saved this money for her treatment,"" he said with the charred currency in his hands. Minister Singh stepped in and said, ""The vendor will be given proper support to continue his business and treatment of his sister."" Lalpur thana OC Ramod Kumar Singh said the family was fortunate to have survived the fire. ""The flames had leaped 20ft high through the asbestos roof. It could have been worse for the vendor."" A neighbour agreed and said the rented house was a tinderbox. ""Several litres of kerosene and other inflammable items were there in the room. It could have been an inferno."""

58ff0c027be9e0420db2be09,Minister's farm jab at Nitish govt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160615/jsp/bihar/story_91205.jsp,2016-06-15,"Radha Mohan Singh Patna, June 14: Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh today accused the Nitish Kumar government of failing to spend central funds and not paying attention towards developing integrated market systems for better remuneration to farmers. ""Bihar's agriculture growth rate has fallen much over the past few years in comparison to 13-15 per cent the growth observed during the seven years while the state had NDA government. The state rubbed shoulders with Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat,"" Radha Mohan said. As per gross state domestic product in agriculture and allied sector data made public by the central government, Bihar's agriculture growth rate was 16.7 per cent in 2010-11, 12.51 per cent in 2011-12 and 8.75 per cent in 2012-13 but witnessed a sharp decline to -10.06 per cent in 2013-14. However, Radha Mohan expressed happiness over recovery in the country's agriculture growth rate and said that though it had dropped to -1.2 per cent in the third quarter of financial year 2015-16, it bounced back to 2.3 per cent in the fourth or last quarter. ""It has been due to hard work of farmers and the steps taken by the central government over the last two years, which have now started giving results,"" he added. The Union minister added that though the Narendra Modi government had kept Bihar at the centre of the efforts to bring a ""second green revolution"" in the country with focus on the eastern part of the country, the state has been lax in developing integrated market systems to help farmers get better price for their produce. Interacting with media persons across the country via video-conferencing from New Delhi, Radha Mohan said the central government is trying to develop an integrated market system or ""national agriculture market"" for buying selling of agricultural produce in the country, where a farmer can get to know the current rate of his produce, the price being offered by buyers, compare it with other parts of the country and take appropriate decision accordingly. ""Altogether, 17 states have sent detailed proposals passed the laws needed integrated market system for agriculture. Proposals by other states are in the pipeline but Bihar is nowhere. It is yet to send a proposal to the Centre,"" he added. The Union minister revealed that online agriculture trading platform was coming up fast in the country and 27,000 farmers have already joined it. Hitting out further at the Nitish government, Radha Mohan, who hails from East Champaran district and won the Lok Sabha elections from there, said it had been unable to spend funds provided to implement and strengthen National Food Security Mission, which was launched in 2007 to strengthen production and productivity of wheat, rice and pulses. The Union minister reeled off data as to how Bihar was unable to spend Rs 41 crore out of total Rs 93 crore provided under the mission during 2015-16. Earlier, the state had been unable to spend Rs 37 core and Rs 21 crore, during the financial years 2014-15 and 2013-14, respectively. ""The latest figures for the first two months of the current fiscal 2016-17 show that Bihar is still lagging behind in expenditure on the mission front,"" he said."

Pictures by Ruchira Gupta We enter a world of trees dripping with mangoes in Muzaffarpur. Lychee season is over and we are in the middle of the mango season in Bihar. Muzaffarpur is known as the Lychee Kingdom. Two varieties are famous, China and Shahi, available from May to June. Its cultivation covers a farm area of about 8,000 hectares with a production of about 75,000 tonnes of lychee every year. Kranti Prakash, a local farmer, believes that the lychee is a gift from China in exchange for the gift of Buddhism from Bihar. ""That is why one of our main lychee varieties is called China."" He grows lychee, rice, mustard, bananas, squash and three varieties of mangoes - Malda, Bambaiya and Langda - on his land. He also has four kathal trees. The whole district is lush. Rice-fields, sugar-cane fields, banana groves, guava trees, grass for thatching and making ropes, and vegetables. Bihar has become the largest producer of vegetables - potatoes, onions, eggplants, and cauliflower. It is also the third largest producer of pineapple. All Bihar's rice varieties - Katika, Jagar, Satthi (ready in 60 days), Sonachur, Hathia Jhulan, Jaswa, Kasaunjih, Bakol, Tulsimanjari, Badshabhog, Laldhari, Darmi, Jagar, Kessore, Selha, Kamod, Katani, Ladaura, Mircha - are grown by farmers in the district in spite of the pressure of the markets. Mill owners tend to buy only two varieties and government agencies as well as loan companies keep pushing the high yielding variety. ""We have edible soil, that is the best variety of soil. It comes from Nepal in the Budi Gandak river every year,"" says Kranti Prakash. When I see this abundance and prosperity, I cannot understand why Bihar is poor and why so many Biharis are malnourished. Kranti explains: because of lack of amenities for the cultivator. ""If we keep promoting the high-yielding variety seeds, we will lose our diversity,"" says Kranti. He adds that he keeps back a sack of Sonachur every year to re-grow. ""If the market has its way, this will disappear."" He is also apprehensive of the micro-credit companies driving the market of the high-yielding variety seed, chemical fertilisers, and irrigation systems catering to corporate farming. ""We have a top-down approach to farming. For example a dam has been made near my village. This will lead to malaria for all and my own village is going to go under water,"" he said. I feel sad. I love the diversity of Bihar. I can get a variety of vegetables here that we cannot find in a US supermarket. Fruits are still flavourful because they are not genetically modified. The variety of rice is a part of my life as is the variety of mangoes. I eat different rice for chuda and different rice for a pilaf. I hardly touch the ubiquitous Basmati. I have been tasting different mangoes since I started the Safarnama. Bambaiya came first, then the Dasheri, Kishen Bhog and Zardalu and now my all-time favourite, Langda. I will be gone by the time Fazli, Neelum and Chausa are available in full force. It won't matter that I won't be here for the Bathua in late September, I will get the pickle made from it. It would be a pity if Basmati is the only rice left in the world, Shahi the only lychee and Alphonso the only mango. It would also be a pity if corporate farming destroyed the small landholdings with their rice-fields, vegetable patches and banana groves, a way of life that is the backbone of the country that I know.

The chief minister will hand over cheques to many of the farmers who had not accepted compensation to protest land acquisition The dais on Durgapur Expressway. Picture by Pradip Sanyal MEETING VENUE On the Calcutta-Durgapur flank of Durgapur Expressway, in front of the main gate of the abandoned Nano project area. WHY HERE This is the spot where Mamata had set up a stage in August 2008 to protest the land acquisition. THE STAGE A 2km stretch of the Durgapur-bound flank from Calcutta has been taken up to build the two-tier stage for Singur Divas. The median divider has also been taken up to create space for the crowd. More than 1.5 lakh people are expected to be present. TRAFFIC Around the meeting venue, the Calcutta-bound flank of Durgapur Expressway has been divided with iron barricades to allow two-way movement of vehicles. The expressway is used by around 30,000 vehicles daily. TIME Mamata is expected to arrive around 4pm. Senior party leaders will come before that. Around 600 unwilling farmers who have applied for compensation will reach the venue by noon. Police said the rally would begin at 4pm and continue till 6pm. It will take at least an hour for the vehicles that will bring participants to disperse. The stage is unlikely to be dismantled on Wednesday. CROWD MANAGEMENT The police said Trinamul supporters would start arriving from 11am. The crowd will be allowed to sit on the road, covered with tarpaulin. Special invitees will be provided green chairs. DIVERSION The police have decided that till 11am, normal vehicular movement will be allowed, although at a slow pace, near the venue because one flank has been taken up by the stage.  After 11am, goods vehicles from Calcutta will be diverted to Delhi Road, which runs parallel to Durgapur Expressway, from Dankuni, 20km from the rally venue.  The vehicles can return to Durgapur Expressway from the Maheswarpur crossing, 10km from the venue, or continue on Delhi Road.  Calcutta-bound goods vehicles will have to take the diversion to Delhi Road from the Maheswarpur intersection. They can return to the expressway from Dankuni.  Private cars and other modes of transport other than goods vehicles will be allowed to use Durgapur Expressway till it is possible. If the crowd swells, cars from Calcutta will have to switch to Delhi Road from Ratanpur More, 3km ahead of the meeting venue.  Cars from Durgapur will have to take the diversion from the Maheswarpur intersection. Report by Kinsuk Basu Singur, Sept. 13: On a September night a decade ago, Dilip Samanta was inside the Singur BDO's office with Mamata Banerjee and many other land protesters demanding that the 400 fertile acres that were acquired ""forcibly"" from farmers be returned. Police had switched off the lights on the premises and lathicharged the 1,200-odd protesters, Dilip said. He had taken blows and fallen down. His motorbike was allegedly seized and kept in the police station for three days. When Dilip walks up to the Singur Divas stage to receive his compensation cheque from Mamata tomorrow, it will be one of his ""biggest moments of triumph"". Dilip, whose 14 bighas are part of the land that is supposed to be returned to the owners in keeping with a Supreme Court order, said: ""I will carry green abir with me. When Mamata Banerjee hands me the cheque, I will throw it in the air. It will be Holi for me and my family and for several others like me."" Dilip, the eldest of three brothers, has taken several loans from a farmers' cooperative society to cultivate potato and rice on the 8 bighas that had not been acquired. The accrued loan amount that he is yet to return is Rs 1.4 lakh. ""I am not sure of the amount I will receive tomorrow. But it won't be less than Rs 26 lakh. We have calculated,"" said Dilip, whose son is a government employee and daughter is married. ""Before the acquisition, we used to grow our own rice. Now, we have to depend on the Rs 2 a kilo rice the government provides,"" he added. Dilip will have to share the compensation amount with his brothers, Sushanta and Jayanta. The priorities of the Samantas are to repair their crumbling house, arrange for the marriage of Sushanta's eldest daughter Riya, a college student, and ensure that Jayanta's school-going daughters, Titli and Tania, do not face any hurdles to their education. ""If the land is made fit for cultivation, we will be able to make a turnaround. We had to sell ornaments to get my daughter married,"" Dilip said. He said when his name would be called tomorrow, he would run up the stairs to the dais. ""The fight to get back our land has finally yielded results,"" he said."

The meeting, which will discuss how to contain prices, will include even vegetable and poultry wholesalers who are not under the purview of essential commodities. CMO sources told The Telegraph that chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia and the commissioner, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, Rajesh Prasad, have initiated a slew of measures, including the formation of a task force/enforcement team in the 34 districts of the state, involving an executive magistrate, a representative of urban local bodies and two representatives from the supply department. The sources said as part of the ongoing drive, the food and civil supplies commissioner has convened a meeting at the circuit house here tomorrow. Even those dealing in items which are not notified as essential items have been invited to participate in the meeting. The move comes in the wake of reports that traders and retailers are charging exorbitant rates to recover the amount they had spent as donation to political parties in the recently concluded Assembly elections. However, chief minister Tarun Gogoi, having resumed office after a bout of illness, had sought a report from the chief secretary on the allegations and an action-taken report which, sources said, was submitted yesterday. ""The prices of essentials items such pulses, mustard oil, gram, peas, rice vegetable and poultry have risen but vegetable and poultry do not fall under notified essential items. Wholesalers dealing in these items, besides representatives of the agriculture and veterinary departments, have also been asked to participate and suggest ways to contain the prices of these items,"" a source said. Representatives from the railways and petroleum sector, which look after the transportation of food and petroleum products respectively, have also been invited to participate in the meeting, besides the chambers of commerce, wholesalers and retailers. ""Only a collective effort can contain prices in a consumer state like Assam. We are looking at what is fuelling the rise. Alertness and prompt action against those indulging in unfair practices can also contain price rise,"" an official said. Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu had directed all circle officers, inspectors and sub-inspectors of the food and civil supplies and consumer affairs departments to visit the licensed wholesale and retail outlets and submit a report on the stock of pulses and mustard oil, along with their prices, to the administration.

58ff0d5d7be9e0420db2bfff,BJD wants rice pledge in writing,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160514/jsp/odisha/story_85569.jsp,2016-05-14,"Naveen Patnaik Bhubaneswar, May 13: The BJD will go ahead with its proposed agitation tomorrow demanding allocation of more rice to the state from the Centre despite an assurance from the Union food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan that this would be done from June. However, the BJD is not in a mood to trust the words of the minister, it insists on a written communication from Paswan's ministry assuring more rice to Odisha. BJD spokesperson Pratap Kesari Deb said: ""The Union minister, who had earlier regretted not being able to meet the state's demand, has been quoted in the media as saying that he would provide more rice to the state. However, even 72 hours after his statement in the media there is no official communication in this regard to the state. We welcome the statement of Paswan, but we need an official order."" Deb said that the BJD was fighting for the state's cause and would be happy to withdraw its agitation if the Centre actually sends more rice to the state. ""But let them communicate this to the state government in writing officially,"" he added. In March last, Paswan in a response to a letter from chief minister Naveen Patnaik seeking more rice had said: ""If a higher quantity of rice is allocated to the states and Union territories, it will not only increase the subsidy burden of the Centre, but also create an imbalance in wheat-rice stock in the central pool. Therefore, it is regretted that your request for increasing the ratio of rice and wheat to 85.12:14.18 cannot be agreed to."" Ram Vilas Paswan However, despite repeated demands, the Centre is yet to allot a higher quota of rice to the state. The state food and supplies minister Sanjay Das Burma had in the Odisha Assembly accused the Centre of sending more wheat to the state instead of rice under the pressure of wheat lobby. BJD MPs had also met Paswan in Delhi and taken up the issue with him. Later, in a bid to ensure that the BJD did not take political mileage from the issue and project it as Central neglect of the state, senior BJP leader and Union minister for petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan also met Paswan and urged him to give the state more rice. Both Pradhan and Paswan had requested the state government to refrain from politicising the issue. Under the proposed rice wheat ratio, the state had sought 27,904 tonnes of rice per month in excess of the allocation made under the food security act. The Centre has been providing 99,660 tonnes of rice against the state's requirement of 1.48 lakh tonnes. The BJD is worried because the Centre's move threatens its popular Re 1-a-kg scheme. The Naveen Patnaik government had introduced a scheme to provide 25kg rice to BPL families at Rs 2 a kg shortly before the Assembly polls in 2009. The move paid rich political dividends. Ahead of the 2014 general elections, the state government had brought down the price of the rice to Re 1 and the move clicked with the party winning 117 of the 147 Assembly seats in the state and 20 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats. The state government had to restructure the scheme after the Food Security Act came into existence in November last year. Odisha was one the last states to implement the act under which an individual is entitled to either 5kg of rice or 5kg of wheat or both wheat and rice according to the beneficiary's requirement. But Odisha being as rice consuming state, it wants more rice than wheat."
58ff0d747be9e0420db2c023,Labour pangs,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160505/jsp/opinion/story_83771.jsp,2016-05-05,"Labour Day got just two mentions in Communist China's official newspaper. On April 29, President Xi was quoted as having asked workers to ""realize their dreams through honest work on International Workers' Day"". The second report was on the celebration of this most important day for communists by the most powerful communist party in the world. 'Models' were felicitated. Not model workers, but model entrepreneurs and model companies! But workers were not forgotten. These worthies were told to treat their workers well. There were many mentions of May Day in the official China Daily - that is the May Day holiday. Now shrunk from a week to three days, it's still seen as an occasion for mass travel; hence, a boost to the economy. Ironically, many workers don't get a holiday on May 1. A few days before Labour Day, a 14-year-old labourer lost his life. Wang Pan had started working in a lingerie manufacturing factory in Foshan, an industrial hub in Guangdong province, just a month before he died. There was no apparent cause of death - he went to sleep and just didn't wake up. This was Wang's first foray into the city. He'd accompanied his mother back to Foshan after she'd come home for the Chinese New Year. Though the workload was not much, she said, her son often worked 11 to 12 hours a day. He would come home and play computer games, rarely stepping out. She used to have a tough time waking him up for work. The minimum working age in China is 16. Wang's death prompted the Foshan authorities to launch a campaign against child labour, warning of ""serious punishment"" for those who violated laws. Hard work Admitting they had employed an under-age labourer, Wang's employers paid his mother 1,50,000 yuan in compensation, reported China Daily. There was no mention of any punishment for having violated the law. Three years back, an almost identical death took place in Dongguan, another industrial city in Guangdong province. That labourer, too, was just 14, had also started work after the Chinese New Year, and had worked barely two months when he died. Like Wang, he worked long hours, and spent his spare time in internet cafes or playing games on his phone. Like Wang, he was found dead when his co-workers called him at 7 am on their way to work from their dormitory. Liufu Zong, who tested computer motherboards in a Taiwan-owned factory that made parts for Asus computers, had dropped out of school at 12 to help his father sustain their family. After two years of working in the village, he and his friends decided to try their luck in Dongguan. The labour agency that got him the job gave him a fake ID card of an 18 year old. His father would call him every night, asking if the work was exhausting. Yes, very, his son would reply. His lunch was always rice and vegetables for 3.5 yuan. Without overtime, his monthly wages were just 1,300 yuan; extra hours fetched him 3,000. The worried father asked him to leave the job. Instead, the boy sent back 500 yuan from his first salary. The factory tried to ascribe Liufu's death to his lifestyle after work, and offered a compensation of 20,000 yuan. The father, who was not allowed by them inside the place where his son had worked, threatened to sue them. Perhaps the company hiked its offer, for there was no news about it getting punished. An international petition by change.org to Asus to intervene yielded no response. Factory work in China can be hell. Bored of being a shop assistant, this diarist's friend, just 21, joined a Japanese factory, only to flee in a fortnight, forfeiting half her salary. Her spare time was spent sleeping, recovering from exhaustion. How long could 14-year-olds, fresh from the village, last?"
58ff133a7be9e0413616236c,Fuelling air pollution through crop burning,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579215/fuelling-air-pollution-through-crop.html,2016-11-03,"Geeta Anand, November 04, 2016, International New York Times 23:14 ISTFarmers in Haryana, Punjab continue to burn leftover straw to make room for the winter wheat cropDesperate to reduce the pollution that has made New Delhis air quality among the worst in the world, the city has banned private cars for two-week periods and campaigned to reduce its ubiquitous fireworks during holiday celebrations.But one thing India has not seriously tried could make the most difference: curtailing the fires set to rice fields by hundreds of thousands of farmers in the nearby states of Punjab and Haryana, where much of the nations wheat and rice is grown.Although environmental court  the National Green Tribunal - told the government last year to stop farmers from burning the straw left over from their rice harvests, Nasa satellite images in recent weeks have shown virtually no abatement. Farmers are continuing to burn most of the leftover straw  an estimated 32 million tonnes  to make room to plant their winter wheat crop.While fireworks associated with the Diwali holidays were blamed for a particularly bad smog problem in recent days, smoke from the crop fires blowing across the northern plains into New Delhi accounts for about one-quarter of the most dangerous air pollution in the winter months. In the growing metropolis of nearly 20 million people, pollution soared well above hazardous levels in the past week.Farmers 100 miles north in Punjab were well aware that they were contaminating the capitals air, they said in interviews, and were willing to consider other ways to dispose of the excess straw, but could not afford the options offered by the government. We are smart, and we have adopted new technology in the past, said Jaswant Singh, 53, as he watched a fire sweep across a 20-acre field near his village, Maulviwala, about 140 miles northwest of New Delhi.He planned to set his own 7 1/2-acre rice paddy ablaze in a couple of days, he said, because we cant afford to pay for the new technology ourselves. The air was thick with smoke that evening as I drove the two hours back to Punjabs capital, Chandigarh, after spending several hours with Singh and other farmers. The smoke made it hard to see, slowing traffic to a crawl, and breathing was difficult. My lungs hurt with each breath, even though I have never had respiratory problems.The smoke rising from the fires visible on farms on either side of the road would most likely reach Delhi in another week, depending on the winds strength and direction. Farmers began burning their fields two weeks ago, and levels of the smallest particles, called PM 2.5 and believed to pose the greatest health risk, were already soaring.On Monday night, levels of these particles in one Delhi neighbourhood reached 688 micrograms per cubic metre, more than 10 times the healthy limit set by the Union government, the Delhi Pollution Control Committees website said. In every neighbourhood where air quality data was available, particle levels were at least four times the limit, putting most areas in the hazardous range by Indian standards, which are more lenient than those set by the World Health Organisation.Asked how they could keep burning their crop remnants knowing they were causing health problems in New Delhi, Singh and other farmers said they were deeply concerned, especially because their families also suffered from the ill effects of the smoke. But still, they said, they could not afford to dispose of the material any other way.In theory, as is often the case in India, it should be relatively easy to stop the burning. The government is promoting a seeder that can be mounted on a tractor and used to plant wheat without the need to dispose of the straw left after the rice harvest.But Singh and others I spoke to said they could not afford the $1,900 cost of the most widely available brand, Happy Seeder. That is as much as some farmers earn from their entire rice harvest, they said. And they are reluctant to incur more debt, having already taken out loans for their daughters marriages and past equipment purchases.To encourage farmers to use the seeders, the government is offering to pay half the cost. Yet it has money for only a tiny fraction of the farmers, said Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environmental Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority, which was set up by the Supreme Court of India in 1998. Another alternative to crop burning, Lal and the farmers said, would be to create a market for the excess straw. So far, seven power plants that generate electricity from straw have been built in Punjab, and six more are on the drawing board.Lacking in willBut together, all 13 would consume only 1.5 million of the 20 million tonnes of straw produced in Punjab every year, or less than 10%, said Polash Mukerjee, a researcher at the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi research and advocacy group, who also assists Lals environmental authority. That is not enough to create a market for the straw, so it would still cost farmers far more to gather it and bring it to the plant than to burn it in their fields.If the government paid me for my straw, Id stop burning it today, said Shabaz Singh, 32, who grows 25 acres of rice and wheat in Maulviwala. The burning of crops was outlawed some time ago. But, like many laws in India, it is widely ignored.Certainly, none of the farmers feared being hit with fines that are supposed to range from $38 to $225. If the government wants to stop it, it can stop it, said Harjinder Singh, a father of two school-age children from Duttal village, who was the only farmer I met on my visit who said he did not intend to burn his crop. But the government lacks the will to do so.Singh and his brother, Narinder Singh, 38, were riding on a tractor pulling the Happy Seeder device when I stopped by their 12-acre farm last week. They used a government subsidy to cover half of the cost of the device, and paid about $950 themselves. It has worked well for them in the three years since they bought it, the brothers said. Not only did they avoid burning their straw, they said, but their yields of both wheat and rice went up, suggesting that leaving the straw on the ground instead of burning it was improving the fertility of the soil.Mukerjee said he believed many more farmers would adopt the Happy Seeder machines if the government made subsidies more widely available. But so far, neither the Central nor the state governments have committed the money, he and Lal said.The Punjab government told Lals environmental authority that providing all Punjab farmers with Happy Seeder machines would cost about $1.5 billion. In real terms, the government hasnt created any alternatives for the farmers, Mukerjee said."
58ff13ac7be9e041361623a4,Man creates oxygen parlour in his apartment,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/534203/man-creates-oxygen-parlour-his.html,2016-03-13,"Man creates oxygen parlour in his apartmentR Sathyanarayana in Chennai, March 13, 2016 2:30 ISTEnvironmentalist M B Nirmal stays in a high-rise apartment in Koyambedu, which has been declared one of the most polluted areas in Chennai by the State Pollution Control Board.The tag did not deter him. Evironmentalist in him spurred him to take up some green activity in his apartment. The result: he has more than 1,700 plants, including bamboo shoots and vegetable and medicinal plants. These give his house a garden look.Exnora founder Nirmal has nurtured thousands of plants in his 12th floor apartment. Garden can be created everywhere, including your home store room or even in the balcony, Nirmal says. Except his bedroom and a small portion of his kitchen, the entire space, including veranda and terrace, have plants. Since plant produces more oxygen, it is better to avoid that in your bedroom, he says.When I came to this apartment, neighbours initially challenged that plants will not grow as the place has high levels of pollution. However, I proved them that plants can be grown anywhere provided there is good sunlight, 74-year-old Nirmal, who started his house gardening a few years back, said.In his house, one can find plants in handmade jar carved out of thermocol, flowers in wooden bowls and freshly planted crotons in pots. Nirmal also uses bamboo poles for planting. Bamboo can be horizontally placed from a rod fixed to the wall. Now the poles can be filled with soil and with that we can grow small flowering plants in them, he said. His living room too has plenty of plants, including those with medicinal properties. My living room is an oxygen parlour for me, he said.Gardens help to cool the house, he claimed. Nirmal's garden venture could be classified into earthen pot garden, pipe garden, tray garden, bag garden, drum garden and tyre garden. Even canvas shoes could be seen filled with mud and saplings in them.According to him, sufficient sunlight and tailor-made space are necessary to start garden at home. Keep the plants near windows or in the balcony where some sunlight will fall on the plants during the course of the day, particularly in the morning or in the evening, he said.Right plantsHowever, he said that there are some plants that can grow even in shade. Handsome hosta will grow in shade areas, he said adding a few others need just little sunlight. Right plants have to be picked for the right spots, he said. For example shrubs or hedge plants should be planted on both sides of the entrance of the house, he added.Nirmal said if sufficient sunlight is not entering the house, most of the potted plants have to be kept outside (terrace).Highlighting the benefits of the terrace garden, Nirmal said it will keep the house cool. The electricity consumed for operating a fan and an air-conditioner will be reduced. It will also calm you down, he claimed. Whenever I see my terrace garden, my mind becomes calm, Nirmal said. Besides decorative plants, he has grown vegetables such as brinjal, ladys finger, tomatoes, chillies, greens and radish on his balcony.The environmentalist claimed that his flat is zero water waste flat. Even the water we use to wash our rice and vegetables go into the plants, because they are full of nutrients, he said. We also prepare our own organic fertiliser to feed the plants. For Nirmal, water is the most precious commodity and the second basic necessity after air. It should not be wasted and plants do not ask you for potable water, he said.Advising people to use sky space even if they live in a small apartment, he said that waste milk trays, which can he hanged, can be transformed into plant growing area. Disposable tyres can be stacked up to hold enough soil to grow plants, he said. Nirmal's 900 sq ft sky farm has over 50 medicinal plants, which he calls green pharmacy.We want people, especially youngsters to know that techniques like these exist and implement them in their houses, he said. More than 200 houses in the city have already taken up the activity.People from other states too have evinced interest in doing this, he claimed. On the advantages of sky gardening, he said people will tend to use the kitchen waste for compost and slowly sewage treatment will also be brought about for water supply. Nirmal's another advice is that greening the outside walls and compound will serve as a barrier against dust and polluted air.Now, Nirmal's garden has turned into a small tourist spot with students from various schools visiting every day. Young students are very much interested in knowing about each and every plant. They are spending almost two to three hours during their visit, he said.Exnora, which was founded by Nirmal, is a broad-based non-governmental organisation focusing on mobilising and empowering communities to participate in preserving nature and preventing environmental degradation, thereby improving the quality of life.The 16-year-old movement has spread and covered many parts of India. There are about 5,000 such Civic Exnoras in Chennai city and in the various Districts of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala and a few other states, covering about 30,000 streets and settlements."
58ff14667be9e0420db2c52d,'There's a real sort of vibe & buzz about Calcutta',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160919/jsp/calcutta/story_108960.jsp,2016-09-19,"BRUCE BUCKNELL is here as the new British deputy high commissioner. He spoke to Chandreyee Chatterjee of Metro about Calcutta, cricket, culture and... cows! Welcome to Calcutta. Have you ever been to Calcutta before? Not before I arrived two months ago. I have been to India though. I did the usual British tourist thing. I went to Delhi, Agra, Jaipur and Udaipur with my wife and sister. That was just over 18 months ago actually. And here I am back again. Did you know then that you would be coming to Calcutta? Nope, I had no idea. We have a system within our foreign service of bidding for jobs and I bid for this job well over a year ago, but after I had been to India. I wanted to come to India. Did you talk to anyone before you came over to Calcutta? I spoke to my predecessor (Scott Furssedonn-Wood) and my predecessor's predecessor (Sanjay Wadhwani). Sanjay and I were in the same school many years ago. Sanjay was very enthusiastic about his time here and Scott was enthusiastic as well. I had a good chat about various aspects, about what to expect and the delights of being in Calcutta and then also the fact that I cover quite a big part of India, so there is a lot of variety. What have been your first impressions of Calcutta? Well I have been here for a couple of months but I haven't been in Calcutta the whole time. We have a very interesting induction programme in which I have spent a week in UP and a slightly shorter time in Mumbai, which can't be more different from covering Calcutta and 13 states and one Union Territory. But I think it is really useful to see the other parts of India, to provide some sort of baseline for assessing Bengal with the other states. I've met lots of people so far. The point of the job of course is that we are supposed to get out there. This is our mentality, and this is a phrase that we've been using a lot - 'Global Britain'. But in the first instance it is getting out and seeing and looking and talking to people. The point about India of course is that it is very voluble. There are a lot of people you've got to listen to. There are some impressions (about Calcutta), but I want to take my time. I don't want to jump to conclusions. Your blog says that the British embassy in Belarus, when your were ambassador, was on Karl Marx Street. What was your reaction when you found out that your Calcutta address would be Ho Chi Minh Sarani? My reaction? Well what can I say?! Have you been to Vietnam? You should go to Vietnam. Vietnam is fascinating. This is a country that until about 20 years ago couldn't feed itself. But now it is one of the major rice exporters of South East Asia. Which just shows what can be done in transforming a country. All that is a long time after Ho Chi Minh but he was obviously a national leader in Vietnam. But of course the reason why this street was named Ho Chi Minh was I can see a little bit of political point scoring by the then regional government but we should take these with a touch of humour. You've also said in your blog that the contrast between Belarus and Calcutta couldn't be starker. Can you highlight some of them for us? That was partly seasons, I left in the middle of winter, I've arrived in the middle of monsoon. But the starkness is in just the sheer number of people. This is a tropical country as opposed to a continental one. There are so many differences. People in that part of the world, the Belarusians, are not particularly expressive, here, particularly in Bengal, they are very expressive, which is a very different culture to deal with. London and Calcutta share a lot of similarities, an extensive riverfront, architecture.... Any similarities that you've noticed? Good question, but I find it a little bit early to say. What I would say is London is one of the greatest cities of the world. Calcutta is a great city.... This is a place that clearly has had better times but it is very dynamic in terms of its intellectual capital and the people and the vibrant culture, all the talk and chatter and that Bengali thing, which is part of the reason why I am happy to be here. There is a real sort of vibe and buzz about the place. But the thing that you clearly have to do is to channel that. All these creative people, what are they doing? It is just that Calcutta seems to have lost its drive. India is developing, as I have just seen in Mumbai, I think the trick for Calcutta is to get that sense of identity and focus and to use the talents. Next year will be the India-UK year of culture coinciding with India's 70 years of Independence and one of things we'll be looking at is the Puja to think for inspiration for next year. What will be your main focus as the deputy high commissioner in the city and Eastern India? Well the first focus will be to get to know the region. I cover a large swathe of area and I'll soon be travelling to some of the other states. So that's a key priority. I don't want to rush into setting out priorities but there will be two particular aspects I'd like to talk about. First of all is this sense of collaboration and partnership. We have this history, we have a lot of common interests, and we have a lot of affinities. I hope to go and look at Eden Gardens and enjoy the cricket tour that's coming up. I'd like to find out how the Indians enjoy beating the English at cricket (laughs). There is sport and cricket, but there is more than that. I want to look at the broader aspects of this partnership. We are very open for collaboration.... We have all sorts of scholarship programmes, fellowship programmes like Chevening. We also have research links with India through the Newton Bhabha programme. I would definitely be looking forward to talking to young people and going to universities. One of the areas is perhaps the fact that there is great heritage in the city but there aren't that many visitors. So it is not just Jaipur and Agra, it is also Bengal and Calcutta. There are lots of jewels that I didn't know like the Victoria monument. There are all sorts of aspects that we could actually do more of in the future. How does UK industry perceive the business climate in Bengal today? Bengal hasn't always had a positive image.... You are absolutely right. I think that is a bit of an issue but that's an issue not just for me but for everybody who lives and works in this part of India. As I said earlier, it's the perception. There is always a lag with perception isn't there? You think the perception is foggy London, it's the one I was constantly coming against in Belarus, well actually that was from the 1950s due to the burning coal, London used to be terribly foggy. I think there is that sort of perception back here. Some British companies are invested here - British Telecom, who have taken advantage of outsourcing here. So yes, there is a challenge. Yes there may not be as much obvious interest but Calcutta is a centre/entry point and if there is a bit more investment in infrastructure there is a great possibility to improve the connectivity with and through Bangladesh and beyond. But these aren't things that will happen overnight. But in the mean time, just to see the development of places like Salt Lake, New Town and Sector V... that is changing. Obviously a key focus for my organisation is to promote trade between Britain and India. It is no secret, we are here to sell to India, Indians want to sell to us. It is a two-way flow. And exactly the same with investments. We'll be looking to support that as much as possible. Our mutual prosperity is obviously of great interest to both sides. Coming to your Twitter bio... you've said one of your interest areas is cricket.... Your favourite all-time and current English cricketers? Well I grew up, I was left-handed, when David Gower was playing. He was effortless, very stylish. I don't intend to fly planes like he did but I used to think I was like David Gower! I could hardly hit the ball off the square, but that was me. He was great to watch, he was graceful. I will put my foot in it completely now by saying that of the Indian batsman I've watched, it was Sunil Gavaskar. I mean I grew up seeing him bat. He was just very neat and tidy for such a small man and he played those West Indian bowlers. He was great. Of this generation, I think Rahul Dravid. He was so elegant. He got the elbow up and played so neatly. Right now I think Virat Kohli is the player. There are two of them actually. Kohli and Joe Root. Then there is young Kane Williamson. I haven't actually seen Williamson but Root and Kohli, they play, it's not slog cricket. Kohli's scored more fours on the ground playing 20:20, he doesn't hit sixes, he hits fours. That's what it is. I am somewhat traditionalist in that respect. While on Kohli vs Williamson, will you be watching the India-Zealand Test match at Eden Gardens from September 30? Well I am not in town on September 30 but I will try and catch a bit of the match later if can slip out of office for a bit. Team England is going to Bangladesh in October. Will you be hopping over for it? Well I would like to but the issue would be just time. I mean it is my first three months. If I can take leave I will go. But, you know, I have to do my job (shrugs and laughs). Don't you follow football? I love football. I love a lot of sports. I am slightly amazed by how much interest there is in English football here. I think this season in going to be fascinating. Leicester City winning last year, that was fantastic.... I would have loved to have gone to a Calcutta Derby (East Bengal vs Mohun Bagan). Unfortunately their games are mid-week and mid-afternoon. There is ISL. Atletico de Kolkata.... We gave the world football and when was the last time we won a trophy? Everybody seems happy and that's fine! Which is your team? Well my team... well, I am again a traditionalist. I was born just outside a town called Redding in Southern England and it has had three seasons in the Premier League. It has done very well, partly because of the wealth of the town. I don't have one set team. I'd say I'd prefer Leicester to win again, of course. The other interest area you've mentioned in your Twitter bio is cows... have you caught the irony of being in a country where cow politics is at its peak? I know. You know I wrote that before cow politics came to the fore. That's purely because I'm a farmer's son. I grew up with cows. My father was a farmer, my grandfather was a farmer, my great-grandfather was a farmer. So I grew up with cows. It's just a part of my past. I have gone to extent that I can even tell you roughly what the cow population is in India and what it is in Britain. I think it is one cow for 10 people, roughly in India, and one for every 50 in Britain. I'll write about cows in the future. I am going to discover how much milk you get from cows in India as compared to Britain! What are you looking forward to doing here when you are not being the deputy high commissioner? Well I need to get fit, so I am trying to lose weight. I am definitely going to travel around. We have lots of things to visit. I have got to go and touch the turf at Eden Gardens and cross-examine the groundsman I hope! I am going I hope very soon to Bhubaneswar and I am looking forward to seeing the temples there. There are lots of things; it is so big, so vast, and so diverse. Then there is the Northeast which is another world of places to visit. It is a pretty full agenda really and I am delighted to be here. What is your message for Bruce Bucknell? Tell [email protected]"

58ff152e7be9e0420db2c655,Pest attack on paddy farms,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/northeast/story_107864.jsp,2016-09-13,"Guwahati, Sept. 12: A pest attack on paddy crops in Assam has left the farmers and the state government worried.Agriculture minister Atul Bora today said altogether 17,418 hectares of land under winter paddy or sali rice (grown between June/July and November/December) cultivation across 10 districts have been destroyed by caterpillars in the past few days.The paddy-swarming caterpillar, Spodoptera mauritia, is a moth belonging to the Noctuidae family.""It is a matter of serious concern for us as it may affect the crop yield and quality of rice. I have instructed our officials to rush to the affected areas and take all necessary steps to control pests within the next 24 hours,"" said Bora while expressing concern that the attack was gradually taking an epidemic form.He said the districts affected by the pest attack are Sivasagar (2,800 hectares), Jorhat (1,200 ha), Golaghat (6,671 ha), Majuli (200 ha), Lakhimpur (300 ha), Kokrajhar (300 ha), Dhubri (27 ha), Barpeta (550 ha), Nalbari (370 ha) and Dibrugarh (5,000 ha).""We are providing farmers with pesticides suggested by experts from the Assam Agricultural University and teams of agriculture scientists, including entomologist and pathologists, have been sent to the affected areas,"" Bora said.The minister had also asked the officials of the agriculture department to visit the affected areas.""Any staff of the agriculture department found to be negligent in duty would be dealt with sternly,"" he said.""This morning I spoke to the vice-chancellor of Assam Agricultural University, K.M.

58ff15737be9e0420db2c6b1,The Rajan legacy,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160906/jsp/opinion/story_106430.jsp,2016-09-06,"U lundu kozhukattai is a savoury rice flour dumpling stuffed with a spicy mixture of urad dal. Most bankers, except possibly those hailing from Madhya Pradesh, are unlikely to know of its existence. That may soon change, however, because a food company in Bangalore has decided to introduce this dish from Madhya Pradesh, the state where Raghuram Rajan was born, on its menu as a tribute to the Reserve Bank of India governor whose term has come to an end on September 4. ""He has touched the lives of commoners and entrepreneurs like us in a positive way,"" remarked one of the founders of the company. It is safe to place quite a large bet that this is the most unique tribute ever received by a central bank governor. Having said that, perhaps it is not completely unexpected because no central banker has become quite as famous amongst the lay public as Raghuram Rajan. Of course, Rajan has had more than his fair share of critics. His frank views on the economy, often contradicting important functionaries in the government, have raised several ministerial eyebrows. He has even had the temerity to question the wisdom or rationale underlying the prime minister's slogan of ""Make in India"" by pointing out that it was too late for India to be a global hub. He argued, instead, that the effort should be to ""Make for India"" since the domestic market itself was so large. Perhaps the comment which turned out to be the most controversial was his remark that the Indian economy was a one-eyed king in the land of the blind. He was trying to deflate the euphoria generated by the fact that the Indian economy was the fastest growing in the world by pointing out that virtually all major economies were in a near recessionary situation. He has also pointed out that the flattering comparison of our superior growth rate with that of China was misleading since the size of the Chinese economy is so much bigger than that of ours. His frankness on these and several other issues was partly responsible for his harshest critic - Subramanian Swamy - calling into question Rajan's sense of patriotism. Of course, the passage of time will help the dust to settle down. The layperson will probably not remember him at all. But economists and professional bankers will typically compare him with governors who have come before him as well as those who follow him. What are the major issues and policy decisions during his tenure that they take into account when they make their comparisons? How will they rate him? Rajan took charge as the RBI governor at a time when the rupee was facing its stiffest challenge after 1991. It was truly a case of baptism by fire. The apprehension that the West could launch military strikes against Syria had caused crude oil prices to shoot up and also spooked investors across the world. The external value of the rupee plummeted to 69 rupees to the dollar while the Bombay Sensex also crashed. There were fears that there would be a run on the rupee. Of course, Rajan, by virtue of being the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, was well aware of the turmoil in the foreign exchange market. His predecessor and he worked jointly to calm the foreign exchange market in India. Rajan announced measures such as opening a foreign exchange swap window to oil companies, providing dollars by a forward agreement. Essentially, this took the demand for dollars of the oil companies out of the foreign exchange market. The RBI also allowed commercial banks to raise tier-II bonds from overseas markets and swap them with the RBI. These measures went a long way in resolving the crisis, and the external value of the rupee gradually moved upwards. The RBI during Rajan's tenure as governor has built up a formidable stock of foreign exchange reserves - there is little doubt that shoring up the strength of the rupee has been an important contribution of Rajan. But, perhaps the efforts to improve the strength of the banking system as a whole has been Rajan's most important contribution. He has been instrumental in focusing attention on the need for banks to reduce the proportion of non-performing assets in their portfolio. During the course of the last three years, the RBI has introduced a number of policy measures aimed at helping banks to clean up their balance sheets. An early initiative was the creation of a data base of all loans above five crore rupees, thus enabling banks to identify early warning signs of distress in a borrower such as habitual late payments to a segment of lenders. The RBI also took steps to prevent banks from restructuring bad projects without calling them NPAs, thereby forcing banks to explicitly recognize losses. Banks were also allowed to replace weak promoters by converting debt into equity. Overall, these and other measures created a sort of arbitration system resembling an out-of-court bankruptcy settlement. Rajan has also worked closely with the government to build up a well-articulated monetary policy framework. Inflation targeting has now been formalized, and the RBI will now work to keep inflation based on the consumer price index at 4 per cent, with a band of two percentage points on both sides. This relatively large interval will provide the necessary flexibility to work with short-run issues. A monetary policy committee will now be constituted to decide policy rates. While this will rob future governors of dictatorial powers to set rates, it will also ensure that the government of the day (and future Subramanian Swamys?) cannot put undue pressure on the governor. This will ensure greater autonomy for the RBI. Another important aspect of the monetary policy framework was to move towards a new liquidity framework that will mitigate some structural difficulties. Rajan earned the label of an ""inflation hawk"" because his interest rate policy has given overwhelming primacy to curbing inflationary pressures rather than to promote growth, even when the external environment facing the Indian economy has been quite hostile. Several economists - and certainly officials in the finance ministry - will argue that he erred on the side of caution by refusing to lower the interest rate regime even during times when prices seemed to be relatively stable. Rajan's own defence is that there was sufficient liquidity in the banking system, and that the effective constraint on increased lending to industry was the disinclination of public sector banks to lend to infrastructure projects because of the high proportion of NPAs in their existing balance sheets. Time - and more careful analysis - will tell which side is right. Some reports suggest that the government was not particularly happy with his frank comments as well as his refusal to implement a lower interest rate regime. This may well be the reason why he did not get an extension. Rajan himself has given some credence to this by hinting that he was not averse to continuing in office. There is no doubt that he has done wonders during his short innings, leaving behind a record that will be very hard to emulate. The author is professor of economics, Ashoka University"
58ff16517be9e041361624e4,Should we be  scared of butter?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579038/should-we-scared-butter.html,2016-11-02,"Should we be scared of butter?Jane E Brody, Nov 03, 2016, International New York Times 22:37 ISTUnless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, there's no reason to cut butter or ice creamIs butter, along with other sources of saturated fats, back on the table, as many have recently claimed? It is. Just not in the quantities the meat, dairy and fast-food industries might have you ingest.Unless you have a medical condition that dictates otherwise, theres no reason to cut anything  not butter, ice cream or Porterhouse steak  completely from your diet as long as you mainly eat plant-based food (vegetables, fruits and whole grains), lean animal protein and fish and dont go overboard on foods rich in saturated fats that can cause harm in excess.Thats the conclusion of the best available evidence Ive reviewed for maximising the health of body and brain and enjoying a long life. The unending controversies about a wholesome diet provide much fodder for this column.An extensively researched book by science writer Nina Teicholz (The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet), published in 2014, has raised serious questions about the evidence that nearly 40 years ago prompted the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs to recommend that Americans follow a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol to curb what was then a runaway epidemic of heart and other cardiovascular diseases.Those recommendations spawned an outpouring of low-fat and fat-free processed foods that replaced the maligned fats with carbohydrates, primarily sugars and refined starches, which the body treats like sugar.A result: Heart attacks and coronary deaths are way down (thanks largely to the decline in smoking and use of cholesterol-lowering medications along with dietary changes), but obesity and Type 2 diabetes have soared. So what should we do? Cut back on carbs and go back to eating lots of high-fat meats and dairy products? Not if you value your health. The task now is to appreciate the effects that different nutrients have on the body and adopt a rational and enjoyable diet that takes both health benefits and risks into account.Upon reviewing the newest reports, Dr Boris Hansel, a French endocrinologist-nutritionist who specialises in obesity management, wrote in a Medscape commentary: Butter is one of the foods with the highest saturated fat content, and consuming it on a regular basis promotes an increase in blood cholesterol levels.But, he added, It should be considered a pleasure food for those who are fond of it, provided it is consumed in moderate amounts and not consumed in addition to other foods that are high in saturated fatty acids.At the same time, a lot more attention should be paid to the overconsumption of simple and refined carbohydrates  the sugary drinks, desserts, pastries and snacks, as well as white bread, white rice and potatoes  that promote obesity and now threaten to reverse the decades-long decline in cardiovascular disease.Not all fats and not all carbohydrates are created equal, Dr Frank Hu, the senior author of a recent report on saturated fats, told me. The types of fats and carbohydrates are more important than the quantity.Hu is a professor of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard T H Chan School of Public Health and a member of the nations Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee that last year recommended a diet lower in red and processed meat, which have been linked to heart disease and cancer.Saturated fat is still bad for heart disease risk, Hu told the Nutrition Action Healthletter, published by the Centre for Science in the Public Interest, a public advocacy group.Evidence from studies on thousands of people shows that if you replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, you reduce your risk of heart disease. If you replace saturated fat with refined carbs, you dont reduce your risk. Studies that seem to exonerate saturated fats often fail to compare their effects with the appropriate nutrients, Hu said in an interview.Furthermore, he claims that, heart risk aside, diets low in saturated fats do not prevent premature death have now been refuted by a huge observational study published online in July in JAMA Internal Medicine.With Dr Dong D Wang in Hus department as first author, this study of 83,349 female nurses followed for 32 years and 42,884 male health professionals followed for 26 years found that both total death rates and deaths from specific diseases like heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer and dementia were reduced among those consuming the least amount of saturated and trans fats, replacing them with polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats.Simply substituting 5% of calories from saturated fats with the equivalent amount of polyunsaturated fats reduced total deaths by 27%, and replacing saturates with monounsaturates (from foods like olive and canola oil, nuts and avocados) reduced deaths by 13%. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish also modestly lowered total mortality, the researchers found.Saturated fatsHowever, when saturated fats were consumed in place of carbohydrates, there was no significant drop in cardiovascular death rates and slightly higher death rates from cancer.Wang and colleagues wrote that this finding was not surprising because the major sources of carbohydrates in a typical Western diet are highly processed foods with large amounts of refined starch and sugar that can raise the risk of cardiovascular disease independent of saturated fats.For the various diseases with death rates linked to diets high in saturated fats, chronic inflammation is believed to be a main underlying cause. Chronic low-grade inflammation promotes atherosclerosis, leading to cholesterol-clogged arteries and setting the stage for heart attacks and strokes. The same process affects arteries in the brain and can result in vascular dementia, a common cause of memory loss.On the other hand, a Mediterranean-style diet rich in olive oil and nuts but relatively low in saturated fats not only protects the heart but also has been shown to improve cognitive function and may reduce the risk of Alzheimers disease, according to a report from Barcelona last year.Diets rich in red meat and processed meats have repeatedly been linked to an increased risk of developing colon cancer. And an ongoing study of young nurses under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health is exploring evidence that higher intakes of saturated fats (as well as too many simple carbohydrates) can raise the risk of premenopausal breast cancer.All saturated fats are not alike, which is good news for chocolate lovers. Stearic acid, the saturated fat in dark chocolate, does not raise unhealthy cholesterol. And theres room for an occasional indulgence  if you eat healthfully most of the time."
58ff17117be9e04136162544,Barter system still alive in Assam,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524765/barter-system-still-alive-assam.html,2016-01-23,"Ratnadip Choudhury in Morigaon (Assam), January 24, 2016 0:02 ISTPeople from hilly regions come to plains : Three-day annual fair is held in Morigaon districtSeptuagenarian Ramsing Ingti was advised by doctors some five years ago not to trek hill ranges as he had cardiac problems. But this advisory could not stop him from continuing with a one-day trek down the hills of Karbi Anglong in Assam to the plains of Morigaon, adjacent to the mighty Brahmaputra, carrying a headload of home-grown vegetables and country fowl and meet his friend Bidyanath Bordoloi from Nagaon.Bidyanath, a 64-year-old farmer, is a proud father of two doctors, but he is still rooted in traditional organic rice farming and come every winter he waits anxiously for Ingti to exchange his home-grown paddy with what Ingti brings. In this way Bordoloi and Ingti are keeping their friendship alive and are proud being part of centuries-old tradition in Assam where people from the hills and plains get together once a year and buy and sell their commoditiesbarter trade without any monetary transaction.Like Ingti and Bordoloi, thousands of people from across Assam and neighbouring Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have been part of this tradition of seamless cashless transaction for three days every year at Joon Beel Mela, an annual barter fair in Assam, that dates back to the reign of the Ahom Kings and has reference in royal documents of the 15th century.I have been coming here since childhood with my father. I have known Bordoloi and many others through this fair. It is like a pilgrimage for me. And I will keep coming to Joon Beel Mela till I die. It is far beyond buying and selling stuff on barter, which has been our age-old transaction system when there was no currency. We must keep tradition alive, pass on the knowledge of traditional cashless transaction to the next generation, build communal bonhomie and above all making friends, said Ingti as he entered the mela.A week after Magh Bihu, a wetland locally known as Joon Beel (moon shaped wetland) in the nondescript village of Dayang Belguri in Morigaon district, some 90 km from Guwahati, becomes a major attraction for people as tribals attend the annual fair. In this fair, for ages the hill people have been carrying headloads of home-grown items and exchange with us. We give them rice, jaggery, woollen and lentils. This is perhaps the worlds oldest barter trading system which is till alive. But the government is taking no initiative to keep it up and running, Bordoloi laments.This year, the three-day fair concluded on January 23. Being held on the banks of a wetland, the fair starts with community fishing. In the Joon Beel, indigenous fishing equipment are used and people from different communities fish together in the wetland and later partake in eating food together.The fair is unique and important in many respects. Assam has seen many bloody ethnic riots and conflicts. Unity has always suffered badly in the multi-ethnic society yet people have fought and lived together. Joon Beel Mela acts as a melting pot of ethnicity with people from different communities of the hills of the northeast meeting the dwellers of the vast plains, exchanging their goods only through barter and it strengthens the bond of ethnic bonhomie. This fair is a legacy of Gova Raja, the Tiwa community king who started this fair where the ground rules of getting any item is that there is no use of money, only barter.It is one event in Assam where tribals and non-tribals, hills dwellers and plains settlers will rub shoulders and enjoy the annual cock fight which is also part of the fair. Though there is a pressure from the government to keep the cock fight out of the ambit of the fair, this time, the events were held.In the remote hills, we have to pay a lot of money to get essential items even today. Thus this traditional fair is life-saver for us. I have seen my parents exchange goods through barter in this fair. After marriage I have kept the tradition going. Here, we collect stocks in barter so there are no worries of inflation, said Madhab Rabha, who came from Sonapur.It is not just people from rural and remote areas who come to the fair. Even people from urban settlements, including Guwahati, flock to the fair to enjoy the essence of cashless trading. The ado for many is that this fair had remained confined to the northeast.The Tiwa head inaugurates the fair and also collects tax from the tribals as it used to be decades ago. This was the time when the kings of the erstwhile Gova kingdom took stock of their people, their regime and discussed matters with general public. The fair always ends with a traditional durbar held by the titular Gova Raja. This time even Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi attended the durbar as a special guest.The Assam government has also chipped in to promote the unique fair. It now gives annual royal allowance for the 19 customary kings from different communities under the erstwhile Gova kingdom of Assam. The old-trade system might not be pertinent today but the fact remains that here you can see there is no fight over any deal because money is not involved, said Jor Singh Bordoloi, a prominent elder of the Tiwa community.Perhaps, it is time the Assam Government promotes Joon Beel Mela as a state event to build bridges of communal harmony."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Sept. 8: The state government has decided to ensure availability of all agricultural products under one roof by setting up a vegetable wholesale trading centre and an agriculture mall at Patrapada on the outskirts of the city. The decision to set up the facility was taken at a meeting on August 11 under the chairmanship of agriculture minister Pradeep Maharathy. Plans are afoot to move the Unit-I market retail shops selling pulses, rice and wheat to Patrapada, 17km away. The government has approved the Bhubaneswar Development Authority's proposal for both the trading centre and the mall. The directorate of horticulture has been asked to prepare a detailed project report within a month. The Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA) has earmarked 10 acres of land for the wholesale trading centre of which one acre has been allotted for the mall. The land is at present under the possession of the Odisha Forest Development Corporation and the forest and environment department. The horticulture department will shortly transfer the land to the BDA. Once the detailed project report is approved and land acquired, the development authority aims to start construction of the wholesale trading centre as well as the agriculture mall immediately. A BDA official said that once the detailed project report is prepared and land is taken over from the Odisha Forest Development Corporation and the forest and environment department, work on the project would start immediately. The work is slated to be complete within six months. The wholesale trading centre will have facilities such as cold storage, roads, banking, post office and other basic amenities. According to agriculture department sources, facilities for storage of produce of farmers from 30 districts will be developed separately so that the farmers or farmers' organisations can display and sell their products. They will be able to avail the facilities of the cold chain system. The land allotted to the director of horticulture at Unit-I, Bapuji Nagar, adjacent to quarter No. VII-9 will be used to set up a floriculture, fruits and vegetable market. However, the pulses and riceretail outlets at Unit-I market will be moved to the agriculture mall at Patrapada. Vegetable traders of Unit-I market said the move to set up the agriculture mall at Patrapada would benefit farmers. ""Farmers will be able to store their produce in the cold storage facility at Patrapada and sell them at Unit-I market. Lack of cold storage has always been a concern for farmers,"" said Gangadhar Swain, 54, a vegetable seller. Vegetable farmer Sambhu Behera, 46, said the proposal to set up cold storage facilities at the agriculture mall would benefit all vendors like him. On the move to set up facilities for sale of vegetables at the Patrapada mall, he said those who have been selling their produce at Unit-I market would not be affected. ""Patrapada is on the outskirts, while Unit-I market is in the heart of the city. It helps small farmers to sell their produce at Unit-I,"" he added. Odisha Byabasayi Mahasangha general secretary Sudhakar Panda said the move to shift the Unit-I market's retail outlets selling commodities such as rice and pulses, to Patrapada would affect retail traders. ""The Unit-I market is important because of its location. Patrapada is on the outskirts of the city and the shift will affect the traders' interests,"" he said. More than 20,000 people are directly and indirectly related to retail trade at Unit-I market, he added. Panda said the state government was yet to discuss the matter with the Odisha Byabasayi Mahasangha. ""We will put forward our views during a meeting with the state government officials shortly,"" he said."

Pictures by Amit Datta Singur, Aug. 31: Ranju Malik, who says she could be 85, is the matriarch who presides over a family of nine spread over four generations and almost nothing else. This afternoon, with only a few minutes to go before the Supreme Court's judgment, the family, residents of Khaserbheri village in Singur, gathers desultorily in the narrow front passage of their one-storey home that leads to two rooms inside. Ranju, seated on a plastic chair, says she will speak. Her grandson's wife Rita Shee, a pretty young woman, and Rita's two sons, Rajesh, 18, and Rakesh, 17, stand near her. ""We had about 1.5 to 2 bighas,"" says Ranju. ""We lost everything to the factory."" Ranju's family was one of the onichhuk (unwilling) farmers whose land was forcibly taken away for the Tata's proposed Nano factory and who did not accept compensation. Mamata Banerjee had given their anger the shape of the Singur movement. But neither Ranju, nor any member of her family shows much interest in the verdict that is imminent. Because they seem crushed still by the impact of what happened after the Tata takeover. ""We did not have to buy rice and vegetables, including potatoes, as we got them from our fields, and sold the surplus,"" says Ranju, whose husband and two sons were farmers. Her husband also worked at a jute mill in Serampore. Then suddenly the land was taken away. Everything collapsed. ""My husband fell ill,"" says Ranju. ""The only thing he would say was jomi, jomi, jomi (land). He developed cancer. It was because of this,"" says Ranju, tears rolling down her wrinkled face. Her sons' lives changed. From farmers, they became daily labourers. Her grandson's sons, Rajesh and Rakesh, stopped going to school. Rajesh is working as a carpenter's apprentice and Rakesh is looking for similar work, getting about Rs 500 to Rs 700 every week. Their sister, Sumana, is a student of Class IX. She has been able to continue her studies to a great extent because of the bicycle given by ""Didi"", Mamata Banerjee. ""It is thanks to Didi that we have been able to live,"" says Rita, referring to the 16kg rice and Rs 2,000 allotted as compensation by the state to the ""victims"" of the acquisition. The family only switches on the TV in a room inside after some prodding. As the news breaks with the historic judgment, the family sits motionless. Rita smiles faintly when she hears the family will get the land back. ""We will wait,"" she says. Outside, the rejoicing with green abir is about to start."

Picture by Pradip Sanyal Singur, Sept. 14: Mamata Banerjee today announced a dole of Rs 10,000 each to the families of Singur farmers for cultivation of land when they get it back from the government, remembering to reach out to her core constituency on a day she sent an invite to industry. ""I have decided the government will give Rs 10,000 to each family to help them buy equipment and other items connected to farming. With this amount, many farmers can even hire big equipment required for agriculture,"" Mamata said at the Singur Divas rally. ""We will also organise training sessions for farmers and a demonstration centre to equip them with better farming techniques."" Mamata said the government would return the land in keeping with the Supreme Court directive. ""It will be up to the farmers to decide what they want to do (with the land). The government will offer full cooperation to those willing to return to farming,"" the chief minister said before rolling out a list of sops for farmers, who were the foot soldiers of the anti-land acquisition movement that propelled her to power. Mamata said a ""hiring centre"" would be set up to provide loans of up to Rs 24 lakh to farmers. She said the agriculture department would build tube wells inside the plant area and iterated that cultivable land would be returned. Rally participant celebrate. Picture by Sanat Kr Sinha Government sources said land for the Tata Nano factory had been acquired from 13,491 farmers. Of them, 2,639 farmers owning 157 acres had refused to accept compensation to protest acquisition. The amount announced by the chief minister today for the 13,491 farmers is over and above the compensation the farmers had received or will receive. In 2006, the then Left government had acquired 997.11 acres in Singur for the Tata Motors project and paid a total compensation of Rs 90.87 crore. The land had been acquired in five mouzas - Beraberi, Khasherbheri, Singherbheri, Gopalnagar and Bajemelia. Today, around 800 ""unwilling"" farmers - those who had refused compensation at the time of the acquisition - received cheques, with the chief minister handing out the first few. Many farmers said they were happy that the government was offering money for cultivation as the compensation amount was not much for those who owned small plots. ""We had a 3-cottah plot. The compensation I received is meagre,"" said 65-year-old Promila Khara of Bajemelia, minutes after walking off the stage with her cheque. The cheque, issued by the Hooghly treasury, is for Rs 5,016. Promila has three sons - Ranjit, a farmer, Asit, a carpenter in Calcutta, and Chiranjit, who does odd jobs in Singur. ""It would have been difficult with this small amount. Now that the government is offering some more money, it will be of great help,"" she smiled. Tararani Das of Bajemelia, who received Rs 4,851, said: ""Our family will have to decide how to resume cultivation once our land is handed back to us and the government gives the Rs 10,000 the chief minister promised."" Tararani's family has eight members. Mamata announced the government would continue to give rice at Rs 2 a kg to the families of the ""unwilling"" farmers in Singur ""till the time the land is ready for farming"". She had earlier said the dole would be given till November. Some of the farmers, however, wondered whether the land they are supposed to get back would be cultivable. ""Factory sheds stand on my 14 cottahs. Even after the land is returned, I am not sure if it would be fit for cultivation,"" said Ashok Ghosh of Gopalnagar."

Official figures released by the central water commission (CWC) said the water level was dipping by a centimetre every hour at both Digha Ghat and Gandhi Ghat. On Monday morning, the water level at Digha Ghat was 51.77m. and had dipped to 5.19m at 3pm. The danger level is 50.45m at Digha Ghat and 48.60 m at Gandhi Ghat. But the CWC official also said the water level would rise at places like Buxar, Munger, Kahelgaon, Sahebganj and Farakka on Tuesday. An official said because of the rise in Ganga level in Khagaria district, water rose over a 4km stretch of the embankment, damaging it at two places. Engineers have been rushed for repairs. Other rivers flowing above the danger level include Punpun, Ghaghara, Budhi Gandak and Kosi. Special secretary of disaster management department Anirudh Kumar said 1,39,330 people have been evacuated. He said 162 relief camps are being run in flood-affected districts, where 1,05,000 people are taking shelter. Anirudh said adequate number of state disaster response force (SDRF) and national disaster response force (NDRF) teams have been deputed to the flood-affected areas to rescue people. The CWC official said water discharge from the Indrapuri barrage over the Sone increased from 2.5 lakh cusec at 6am to 3.8 lakh cusec at 2pm. With the riverine locality flooded, many have come to Patna in search of relief. The district administration is trying to provide them and their cattle food and shelter. However, The Telegraph saw a contrast when it visited two relief camps being run by the district administration. One such relief camp is at the Bihar Vidyapeeth campus where over 500 people are staying after water entered their houses. Rice-dal and mixed vegetable (potato and soyabean) was being served to inmates of the relief camp being monitored by Patna Sadar executive magistrate Rajeev Mohan Sahay and deputy collector Atul Verma. Bind Toli resident Umesh Choudhary (32) praised the district administration for providing them food and shelter. ""Yesterday we were served khichdi and today we are getting dal, rice and vegetable,"" Choudhary said. ""Many more people are on the way. Our area is badly affected, water has damaged my house too."" People in the relief camps also demanded that the administration allow them to take the beaten rice and jaggery given to them for distribution among people. But the official said the relief material would be given only at the camp and those who receive will not be allowed to carry it outside. A medical team was also deputed at the relief camp and arrangement to provide important medicines made. But the condition at another relief camp at B.N. Collegiate Inter School, 4 km from the Bihar Vidyapeeth campus, was a study in contrast. Around 2pm, cooking was yet to start and no arrangements had been made, even though the district magistrate had announced measures on Sunday. Cows, buffaloes, calves and goats are scattered at the camp. Complete mismanagement was evident camp and people complained that they were not getting food. ""The authorities brought us here last (Sunday) evening, but they didn't provide us food, but for some beaten rice and jaggery. We want dal and rice, but the process of cooking is yet to start,"" said Ram Janam Mahto, an inmate at the relief camp. A veterinary doctor was also there at the school premises. The Patna civil surgeon's office on Monday formed two more mobile medical units in the district in addition to 24 units already working. ""Each team is equipped with a doctor, an auxiliary nurse midwife and medicines,"" said Patna civil surgeon G.S. Singh. The teams were also providing aid in the various relief camps.

Today, the district administration held awareness campaigns at St Joseph's College (North Point), Darjeeling Government College and Southfield College, along with Chowrasta and Motor Stand, to ""dispel wrong information"" and highlight the provisions of the National Food Security Act. Sources in the administration said similar programmes would be held in Kursoeng and Kalimpong subdivision but added that no such campaigns had been planned for Siliguri subdivision ""as of now"". A senior administrative official said: ""We are trying to disseminate correct information and dispel wrong information that is being circulated. Apart from disseminating information on the Food Security Act, we are also trying to educate people about the ban on smoking in public places."" Explaining the need to start campaigns only in the hills, the official said: ""In the hills, the PDS (public distribution system) has been different. While the pan-Bengal campaign in different media is expected to cover Siliguri subdivision, we thought it was necessary to go to the hill people directly and inform them about the details of the Food Security Act. If the need arises, such a campaign will also be undertaken in Siliguri subdivision."" The Morcha had accused the state of trying to prove that the hill people were landless to allegedly ""dilute"" the statehood demand and assigned the party's Study Forum with the task of ""finding out the real motives"" of the government in implementing AAY in the hills. Later, the forum had said the ""hidden agenda"" of the state to include the population of the region under the AAY was to cut down on the foodgrain that the ruling Trinamul had promised before the Assembly elections. Under the AAY, a family is entitled to 35kg of foodgrain (15kg of rice and 20kg of fortified atta) at Rs 2 per kg a month. The Morcha had claimed that state had announced 11kg of foodgrain per person per month before the Assembly polls, of which 6kg was to come from the state government. D.K. Pradhan, a Study Forum member, had alleged that the state was not willing to bear the additional expenditure of the 4kg rice and 2kg atta, and therefore decided to bring the entire hill population under the AAY so that the supply came from the Centre. Pradhan had said a notification issued by the directorate of district distribution, procurement & supply, food supplies department on January 22, 2016, said the hill population would be allotted 6 kg of rice and 5 kg of fortified atta per head per month at Rs 2 a kg. According to Pradhan, the 11kg foodgrains were to be drawn under the Centre's National Food Security Act and the special scheme of the state government. He said: ""A family of four and above will now get less. According a special package announced just before the state assembly elections, a hill family of five is entitled to 55 kg of foodgrains. The hidden agenda behind getting the hill population under the AAY is to ensure that the state does not have to bear the additional cost as then they are having to pay for 6 kg of foodgrains per family per month."" The Morcha central committee member said it was fine for the hill party if the state provided 35kg of foodgrains to a family under the AAY and the remaining 6kg per head per month. The AAY has become a much talked about issue in the hills after Bhupendra Pradhan, popular as Pradip Pradhan, while joining Trinamul in Kurseong on Sunday, criticised the Morcha for trying to oppose the scheme. Earlier this month, the Morcha had demanded that since the state government had decided to include the entire population in the Darjeeling hills under the AAY, the Mamata Banerjee administration declare the region a ""backward area"" and provide other benefits meant for the category, like exemption from income tax, subsides in transport, fuel, gas connections and electricity. Pradhan removed The GTA Sabha on Friday removed Bhupendra Pradhan as the chairman of the GTA Sabha during a meeting held at the Gorkha Rangamanch Bhavan in Darjeeling. Lopsang Yolmo, the vice-chairman of the GTA Sabha, said: ""The majority of the members passed a resolution and removed Bhupendra Pradhan as the chairman."" The three Trinamul-nominated GTA Sabha members, Durga Kharel, Milan Dukpa and Satish Dukpa, did not attend the meeting."

It is late afternoon and customers are already arriving. He is a prosperous man, compared to the Singur average, with a spacious concrete house, shining white in the sun. A fridge stands at one end of the long verandah. Sacks of potatoes lie on the floor, as do coils of golden jute. He buys them from farmers and sells them in the market. He has been made more prosperous by the Supreme Court judgment. But it was the Tata's land acquisition that made him prosperous in the first place. Ali, 62, a thin, wiry man, owned about a bigha and 6 cottahs land with his siblings. A CPM sympathiser, he had convinced his two brothers and three sisters to sell the land to the Tatas. He got Rs 84,000 for it. But he and his friends, soon after the land was acquired, started a ""syndicate"", a word that resonates differently these days, to supply construction materials. It proved very lucrative. ""In the two years that the factory was being set up, between 2006 and 2008, I made about Rs 4 lakh,"" says Ali. His mudhouse became the shining white house. His two elder daughters were married off well; he is now looking for a groom for his youngest daughter, Shoukina Khatun, a smiling girl who has just been taken off school. ""Marriage is the destiny for Muslim girls because we don't get jobs,"" says Nasima Begum, her mother, in a matter-of-fact way. ""I had reasoned that I would earn more if I sold my land off. I was right,"" says Ali. ""It would create more jobs here and more business than anyone could think of."" He had dreams for his son. But after trouble started, his son went away to Uttarakhand to start his own jewellery shop. ""It is good that we are getting our land back,"" says Ali. ""I am happy because we will get our land back, but I am happier because I think now that compensation will stop,"" adds Nasima. She is referring to Mamata Banerjee's compensation to the khet majurs (farm labourers), who did not own land, and did not work, but get Rs 2,000 and 16kg rice every month. Ali looks at another possibility. ""The land taken over by the factory is no longer irrigable. Roads, bridges, drains have been built. I still think a factory is a better idea."""

In the absence of a rolling staircase, he was forced to emerge through a door in the belly of the plane that he usually uses only on high-security trips. (Reuters picture) Hangzhou, China, Sept. 4: Air Force One had a bumpy landing in Hangzhou on Saturday, but it was nothing compared with what happened after the plane rolled to a stop. As the reporters who travelled to the Group of 20 summit meeting with President Barack Obama from Hawaii piled out and walked under the wing to record his arrival, we were abruptly met by a line of bright blue tape, held taut by security guards. In six years of covering the White House, I had never seen a foreign host prevent the news media from watching Obama disembark. When a White House staff member protested to a Chinese security official that this was not normal protocol, the official shouted: ""This is our country."" In another departure from protocol, there was no rolling staircase for Obama to descend in view of the television cameras. Instead, he emerged from a door in the belly of the plane that he usually uses only on high-security trips, like those to Afghanistan. Witnessing the scene, Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser, looked baffled and annoyed. Joined by her deputy, Benjamin J. Rhodes, she ducked under the rope to make her way closer to the President. The two were immediately stopped by the same Chinese official, who angrily challenged them. Asked later what happened, a diplomatic Rice replied: ""They did things that weren't anticipated."" There were further surprises. At the West Lake State House, where Obama met President Xi Jinping, White House aides, protocol officers and Secret Service agents got into a series of shouting matches over how many Americans should be allowed into the building before Obama's arrival. There were fears the confrontation would become physical. ""Calm down, please,"" an American official said, according to a pool report. A Chinese foreign ministry official said, ""Stop, please,"" adding, ""There are reporters there."" To some in Obama's delegation, it was reminiscent of the rough treatment he received on his first trip to China, in 2009. Then the Chinese refused to broadcast on state television a town-hall-style meeting; packed the hall with Communist Party loyalists; and censored an interview he gave to a Chinese publication. At the time, many viewed the treatment as a metaphor for a rising power flexing its muscles with a young President from a superpower in decline. In later visits, the White House has pushed the Chinese for better news media access - with some success. In November 2014, the Chinese agreed to have Xi take questions at a news conference with Obama in the Great Hall of the People. When I asked Xi about the Chinese government's refusal to renew visas for foreign correspondents, including some from The New York Times, he offered a curt lecture. When one's car breaks down, he said, ""perhaps we need to get off the car and see where the problem lies"". On this trip, there was little threat of reporters making trouble. China has placed tight restrictions on foreign news media coverage of the entire summit meeting. When Xi took Obama on a leisurely stroll after dinner on Saturday, Chinese security cut the number of American journalists allowed to witness it to three from the original six, then ultimately to a single reporter. ""This is our arrangement,"" a Chinese official explained to his American counterpart, according to a pool report. ""Your arrangement keeps changing,"" the American replied. Asked on Sunday about the conflict, Obama noted that it was not the first time there had been tension with the Chinese over security and news media access during his travels here. This time, he said, ""the seams are showing a little more than usual"". But Obama said it had no bearing on the broader relationship. ""I wouldn't over-crank the significance of it,"" he said."

Excise commissioner Rakesh Kumar today told The Telegraph that his department is working to get a draft policy on heritage liquor ready by November. He hoped the products would be ready to hit the stores by January 2017. ""We are working on the draft policy on heritage liquor. We have asked all districts to submit reports on traditional brews prevalent in their areas before next Wednesday. In a two-day meeting, beginning next Wednesday, discussions will be held based on those reports,"" Kumar said. The districts have been asked to mention the historical and cultural story behind the brews, their ingredients, manufacturing process, local names, cost-benefit analysis if produced commercially and demand on a daily and monthly basis. The BJP-led government had promised in its first budget in June to promote traditional beverages of different indigenous communities of the state considering their huge demand, medicinal value and tourism potential. ""Such products will be promoted as licensed items to be sold in permitted shops and establishments. These products can beat feni of Goa, heritage wine of Rajasthan, vodka of Russia and many other brands,"" the budget report had mentioned. Numerous communities in Assam have their traditional alcoholic beverages. The Rabhas have their choko and makham, the Bodos their jou, Dimasas have the judima, Misings have the apong, Ahoms the laupani and Karbis have the hor, to name a few. Despite their high demand, they were not promoted by earlier governments. Of late, these beverages have become an integral part of traditional food festivals held across the state. Rice is the main ingredient in most of the beverages. Kumar said if launched properly, the heritage beverages will earn more revenue for the government's coffers than Indian made foreign liquor. Besides, he said, it will open employment opportunities for a large number of people. ""It is a very important project. We are working day and night to implement it. The draft policy will be ready by November 30 and the product will be available in the market from January next year,"" he said. Kumar said besides other resource persons and experts, they were keeping in touch with the state science and technology department. He said quality control would be one of the major challenges in introducing heritage liquor. ""Every community also uses its beverage in religious ceremonies. So, we will have to be very careful. Any mistake will hurt the sentiments of the communities,"" said Pranjal Borah, joint commissioner of the excise department. The government has formed a committee that will visit Rajasthan to see how it has succeeded in marketing and promoting its traditional beverage. Kumar said local self-help groups and groups of entrepreneurs will be involved in producing the heritage liquor. ""We are hopeful that the initiative will make the traditional beverages available for people in a uniform standard. There will be a huge demand among the people,"" said Sailendra Pandey, the public relations officer of the excise department."

Prabhat Bezboruah, vice-chairman of Tea Research Association, said the industry ""is passing through yet another crisis due to a decline in both price and crop in the current year. This is coupled with increase in labour costs and practically all other input prices"". He said in the absence of restructuring, the tea industry was becoming unsustainable and the best option was to nationalise the set-up. Painting a grim scenario, Bezboruah said climate change had distorted the rainfall pattern in Assam with the entire year's quota being deposited in the first seven months while August onwards it becomes unseasonably dry. ""Temperature of 39 degrees Celsius, at which level the tea bush shuts down, is common nowadays. If the weather continues in this line, tea yields will show a dramatic decline,"" he added. He further said major blenders and packers were resorting to blend rationalisation, which means buying cheaper teas for the blend to bring its average cost down. ""Hence we see a scenario where low-priced teas, such as those from south India and Cachar, are up in price by Rs 10 to Rs 22 per kg whereas high quality Assam teas are down by Rs 30 to Rs 50. This trend does not augur well for the industry, as it sends a signal that quality does not pay,"" he said. Amitabh Barooah, who runs Kolakota tea estate near Sonari in Sivasagar district and is a member of the Assam Tea Planters' Association, said with the increase in wages of labourers, staff and sub-staff, there is simultaneous increase in bonus and leave wage, which increases cost of production. Besides, he said, tea estates now have to give ration, which was earlier subsidised by the government, increasing cost of production. ""Earlier, we used to pay about Rs 8 for a kg of rice and Rs 10-12 for a kg of flour but now we pay about Rs 20 and Rs 23 respectively when buying from the open market. This has increased costs tremendously."" Labourers buy this rice and flour for 50 paise each. In West Bengal, Bezboruah said, the government supplies foodgrain to each garden at Rs 3 per kilo and designates the manager to distribute the agreed quantum to workers. ""When the industry visited former chief minister of Assam Tarun Gogoi to cite this glaring inequality between Assam and Bengal, he dismissed it,"" Bezboruah said. The TRA vice-chairman said it was proving difficult to get sufficient workers at the current wage level. ""Unless wages increase is linked with productivity, the industry can hardly bear any further load, as each rupee increase in wages results in a 60 paise increase in cost of production in a typical garden. At the current productivity level of 2.2kg per manday, the industry is clearly unsustainable unless drastic restructuring is done,"" he added. North Eastern Tea Association adviser Bidyanand Barkakoty, affirming that the industry was in dire straits this year, said most buyers and packagers of tea had not maintained a stock this year and there was a possibility of prices rising in September as the overall shortfall in production in August could be 20-25 per cent. A supplier of green leaf said its prices had come down to Rs 17-18 compared to last year when it was Rs 19-20. ""In the absence of coordinated steps to revamp the industry from within, by the labour unions and the government, perhaps the best solution would be for the government to nationalise the entire industry. This will solve the problems that the industry constantly faces in Assam,"" Bezboruah said."

58ff1f2b7be9e0420db2cfea,River of discontent where 'cusec' is a call for war,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160913/jsp/nation/story_107927.jsp,2016-09-13,"A woman takes her child from a Karnataka Sangha school in Chennaion Monday. (PTI) Chennai, Sept. 12: Just say ""Cauvery"", and you could end up hitting a raw nerve in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The two states have been fighting for centuries for their share of water from the river, which feeds the rice bowls of both. While less water has been flowing down the river - for both climatic and man-made reasons - the size of the area it irrigates has been increasing in both states, particularly in Karnataka. A tribunal award in 2007 that instructed Karnataka to release 192 thousand million cubic feet (tmcft) of water to Tamil Nadu in a normal year has aggravated the dispute (it's not yet settled how much the release should be in distress years). When Karnataka has a poor southwest monsoon, like this year, things turn especially tricky as the water stored in its reservoirs is just enough for drinking and not for irrigation. So when the Supreme Court on September 5 directed the state to release 15,000 cusec water every day till September 15 to Tamil Nadu (about 1.3tmcft per day), furious farmers and pro-Kannada outfits in Karnataka directed their anger against the rulers of both states. Today, the top court revised the award to 12,000 cusec a day till September 20. In Tamil Nadu, every small legal victory on the Cauvery (or Mullaperiyar, in the case of Kerala) is flaunted by the ruling AIADMK as yet another feather in Amma's cap. This further provokes the pro-Kannada groups in Karnataka, who see their government as the loser in the duel in spite of controlling all the dams that store the Cauvery's waters. So the easy targets of their anger are vehicles from Tamil Nadu, Tamil films, eateries with distinct Tamil names and the Tamils living in large numbers in Bangalore and Kolar district. As interstate road transport grinds to a halt, trade and the movement of people are hit. While the arrival of tomatoes and onions in Tamil Nadu dwindle, the farmers growing them in Karnataka stare at losses because of the consequent glut. Similarly, milk and eggs from Tamil Nadu stop moving to Karnataka, the tensions thus hitting both states economically. In Tamil Nadu, the Cauvery dispute feeds into the rivalry between the two Dravidian parties to prove which of them is the greater protector of Tamil interests. So the verbal duel between the DMK and the AIADMK grows to its shrillest, with each accusing the other of not doing enough to get Tamil Nadu its share of the water. The two parties often send separate delegations to Delhi to fight the state's case, in contrast to the unity displayed by Karnataka parties. It is in this context that fringe Tamil groups try to grab their brief moments of fame by attacking vehicles from Karnataka or businesses run by Kannadigas. Although they claim that their attacks are aimed at deterring violence against Tamilians, such incidents in these days of 24-hour television news have exactly the opposite effect. ""It was only after New Woodlands (a hotel owned by a family with Karnataka roots) was attacked in Chennai early today that the Adayar Ananda Bhavan in Bangalore (part of a chain of restaurants with Chennai-based owners) got vandalised,"" a senior police officer said. Even when the monsoon is not playing truant, the Cauvery remains a sore spot as Karnataka wants to build one more dam at Mekadattu, 110km from Bangalore, to feed its capital's growing drinking water needs. Tamil Nadu sees it as another plea to deprive it of its tribunal-stipulated share of water. One solution mooted to decrease the two states' dependence on the Cauvery is to link the peninsular rivers starting from Mahanadi in Odisha down to the Vaigai in southern Tamil Nadu. With Tamil Nadu already locked in water wars with three neighbouring states - including Andhra Pradesh -however, that proposal may never take off. Farmers in the Cauvery delta have been slowly resorting to alternative crops that need less water compared with rice. This could create another kind of dependence on other states - for rice - by lowering rice production in Tamil Nadu. ""Even in a good year, the water flow along the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu is hampered by the huge pits created on the riverbed by reckless sand mining. The irrigation channels are not desilted, either, to take the water to the tail-end areas,"" an agricultural scientist said. ""We should address these issues with greater sincerity, too, while we demand our share of the water."""

58ff1f407be9e0420db2d004,"BJP, BJD fight over central cooking gas project in Odisha",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160825/jsp/odisha/story_104222.jsp,2016-08-25,"Union minister Jual Oram (second from right) with beneficiaries (standing behind) of the Ujjwala scheme in Rourkela recently. Picture by Uttam Kumar Pal Bhubaneswar, Aug. 24: A game of political one-upmanship is on in the state, as the BJD and the BJP have locked horns over the implementation of Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), which aims at providing free LPG connections to poor women. The tussle is reminiscent of the ones over distribution of cheap rice and execution of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana (PMSY) where both claimed credit for the schemes. Harking back to the war over the Re 1 rice scheme that benefits around 52 lakh people, the tug-of-war over PMUY with around 30 lakh target beneficiaries in the state is being seen as significant in terms of vote-bank politics with both parties having launched preparations for the big battle in 2019. Things came to a head last week with BJD activists allegedly disrupting PMUY implementation meetings where BJP leaders had been invited to do the honours. With the organisers being forced to cancel one of these programmes at Balanga in Nimapara on August 9 following alleged vandalism by ruling party workers, secretary, Union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, K.D. Tripathy, has shot off a letter to chief secretary Aditya Prasad Padhi urging him to ensure cooperation from district authorities in the implementation of the scheme. Sources said immediate provocation for violence at Balanga was the presence of state BJP women's wing chief Prabhati Parida and her colleague Pinki Pradhan as chief guests at the PMUY programme. This was followed by a similar incident at Athgarh where alleged BJD activists were angry at the BJP effort to run away with credit for the scheme. This led to a ruckus that left the organisers shaken. BJD spokesperson and Nimapara MLA Samir Dash sought to justify the anger of his party workers. ""We have no objection to the implementation of the scheme. But, we are against the BJP trying to extract political mileage out of it. It has been turned into a party scheme,"" he said. Hitting out at the BJP, he alleged that the party was using the scheme to provide LPG connections to its party workers. ""They are providing connections first to their party workers. Besides, there is no attempt to involve local MPs and MLAs in the meetings organised for free distribution of connections. What else is this if not politics?"" asked Dash. The scheme has been spawning controversies since its launch in Sambalpur on June 20. BJD leaders, including Sambalpur MP Nagendra Pradhan, boycotted the event as local MLA Raseswari Panigrahy was not invited. It was seen as a deliberate omission on the part of the BJP, which is out to make political capital out of the central scheme. However, state BJP spokesperson, Sajjan Sharma described alleged violence by BJD activists at PMUY programmes as panic reaction and a sign of frustration in the ruling party. ""This is happening because now they are unable to appropriate credit for central programmes. They are feeling frustrated,"" he said. This is not the first time that the two parties have clashed over a central scheme. One of their biggest showdowns was over the Re.1 rice scheme for which the BJD had been taking credit since the days of UPA government. The party, which never once did acknowledge the fact that the rice it was distributing among the beneficiaries was heavily subsidised by the Centre, earned rich political dividends from it in the elections. Political analysts pointed out, ""While there was no resistance to BJD's blatant attempt at grabbing credit for the scheme during the UPA regime, the scenario changed drastically with NDA coming to power and BJP leaders in Odisha launching a campaign in the state to sensitize people about Centre's contribution to the cheap rice scheme. The party also sought to expose the ruling BJD's covert attempt to project 108 ambulance service under the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and Pradhan Mantri Sadak Yojana (PMSY) as its own with an eye to the vote-bank."" ""We are ensuring that they do not hoodwink people by making false claims. No wonder their frustration level is rising,"" said BJP spokesperson, Sajjan Sharma."

Telegraph picture They can weave magic with bamboo, palm leaf and kanshi grass but lack the marketing spiel to woo buyers, prompting XLRI, Jamshedpur, to its rescue. Some 300 Sabars, part of the traditional hunter-gatherer tribe in East Singhbhum forests once classified under primitive tribes and now renamed particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTG), work with a Delhi NGO, Ambalika, in its Seraikela-Kharsawan branch, making fruit baskets, pen stands, flower vases, wall clocks and designer hats. Now, 24 students of B-school XLRI, as part of a social project, have come together to help Sabar weavers and craftspersons how to tactically market their products. ""We make decorative and useful items but they hardly sell,"" admitted Raj Patel, the in-charge of NGO Ambalika. ""Though the NGO gives us the platform to take part in national trade fairs and have a little bit of presence in Dilli Haat, New Delhi, we don't have the know-how to market products,"" Patel said. In East Singhbhum, most Sabar people live in twig-and-hay huts on forests fringes and eke out a bare minimum livelihood by selling wood they laboriously collect at dirt-cheap rates. For most Sabars, a meal of boiled rice is a luxury. Many still subsist on boiled roots. Extremely poor, their ignorance and a natural shyness keeps most out of the loop of government welfare schemes. In this scenario, Sabar artisans of Nimdih block in Seraikela-Kharsawan, who are associated with Ambalika are lucky. They get Rs 135 per day apart from food and conveyance. But, Suchitra Sinha, currently director, Dr Ram Dayal Munda Tribal Welfare Research Institute, actively involved in uplifting the Sabars since 1998, wanted them to aim bigger. It was Sinha who approached XLRI to chip in and help the Sabars market their wares smarter. Now, 24 members of Social Initiative Group for Managerial Assistance (Sigma), a student society of XLRI, are working on a plan to make Ambalika and its artisans succeed. The B-school students have created three teams, each looking after a special field. One team looks after online marketing, exploring collaborations with e-commerce websites and studying consumer behaviour for handicraft products. The second team is taking care of offline or retail marketing and building a local connect while the third team works on training the Sabars to enhance their presentation skills. ""We are working on this project for the last one month,"" said Akhil Reddy, a Sigma member and second-year business management student of XLRI. ""Tribal people are shy. They make beautiful products but lack communication skills. In fact, when Sabar craftsmen from Ambalika had put up a stall in our own XLRI event Valhalla, we'd seen they lacked basic skills to attract customers and only answered when asked,"" he said. He added every business, service or product needed marketing to be sustainable. ""We are sure results would show now that our marketing acumen has been added to the skills of the Sabars. It's a great challenge to bite our teeth into."""

""The people of Rayagada are still forced to eat mango kernel for their survival because they do not get rice and other food grains from the public distribution system,"" said Congress chief whip Tara Prasad Bahinipati, who led the protest. Bahinipati, who belongs to undivided Koraput district under which Rayagada falls, had visited the village of the victims in Kashipur area on Sunday. He asked the district administration to rise to the occasion to provide food to the people. ""Otherwise, we will be forced to intensify our agitation,"" he said. Two persons - identified as Ranjan Majhi and Shiva Majhi - died and six fell severely ill at Sipijodi village in Kashipur block allegedly after consuming the gruel made of mango kernel. However, the district administration maintained that the deaths had been caused by other reasons. Sub-collector Muralidhar Swain, who led a fact-finding team to the village yesterday, said: ""The two deaths were caused by some other reason. While the 13-year-old Ranjan Kumar Majhi died from fever, Shiva Majhi might have been a victim of heart stroke or some other ailment."" Allegation of death due to consumption of mango kernel has surfaced after 15 years. In 2001, 20 persons had died at Panasguda and Bilamal villages in Kashipur, allegedly due to consumption of mango kernel. The Opposition political partiers had described these as ""starvation deaths"". Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had denied starvation. However, he had admitted these deaths due to ""food poisoning and diseases"". Following the hue and cry, a host of welfare and development schemes were initiated in the region. With the issue resurfacing, the Opposition Congress and BJP are trying their best to appropriate the issue.

58ff20807be9e0420db2d1b8,Bengal part of Patanjali's Rs 50000cr vision,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160912/jsp/business/story_107615.jsp,2016-09-12,"Haridwar, Sept. 11: Yoga guru Ramdev plans to invest Rs 3,000-5,000 crore to set up half-a-dozen plants across the country to manufacture Patanjali ayurvedic medicines and consumer food products. The company is also scouting for a site in Bengal to set up a rice-based food products plant. ""I plan to set up six plants as we cannot meet demands from our mother plant at Haridwar. In the east, I have identified Guwahati for an ayurvedic plant. I am also looking to set up a plant in Bengal to produce rice-based fast moving consumer goods, rice bran oil, packaged rice and more,"" Ramdev told The Telegraph. Ramdev claims that the Patanjali brand will have a turnover of about Rs 10,000 crore by the end of this fiscal and grow into a Rs 50,000-crore business empire in the next five years. The saffron-robed yoga guru has zeroed in on Guwahati, Jammu, Indore, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh for the plants. ""Till now, we have funded our own expansion. We are a zero-debt operation. Now, we will take loan from banks,"" he said. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd, founded by Ramdev and his friend Acharya Balkrishna on the outskirts of Haridwar in 2006, has become one of the country's fastest-growing companies, producing a host of ayurvedic drugs as well as fast-moving consumer goods, including flour, rice, honey and children's health drink. It sells over 800 products. The Patanjali group, which has been witnessing frenzied sales, has started hiring business professionals from multinationals. Rivals such as HLL, ITC and advertising giant Mudra have been tapped for talent. ""Many nationalist-minded people working for MNCs want to join us,"" Ramdev said. He said the plant in Bengal would be set up to produce rice products and rice bran oil. ""We will be setting up units to produce refined oil without a chemical process. We will use the old process (kachi ghani) to refine oil. Processing of refined oil using chemicals, which MNCs do, is very harmful and can lead to ailments,"" Ramdev said. The plant in Assam will manufacture FMCG products to cater to the demand from the east and the Northeast. Patanjali Ayurved has reported a Rs 5,000-crore turnover in March 2016, up from Rs 450 crore in 2012, an eleven-fold growth in less than four years. ""We are building a chain of factories to support our network. We are also investing significantly in research and will run the whole gamut of stringent testing to check the safety of our products,"" said Ramdev. The impressive growth has come on the back of a well-knit team. Overhead costs have been kept low. Also, free-air time has helped to push sales. According to a research by Edelweiss, Patanjali's strength lies in pricing and low ad-spend. Its products are priced at about 15-30 per cent discount to competition, while its ad spend in the initial years were negligible compared with 12-18 per cent of sales for rivals. However, in the second phase of market penetration, Patanjali has seen a massive surge in print and points of sales advertisements, which analysts estimate to be worth about Rs 300 crore annually. Edelweiss said the company's growth was being driven by its largest-selling products, such as cow ghee (about Rs 1,200 crore in 2015-16), followed by toothpaste Dant Kanti and hair oil Kesh Kanti. Besides Patanjali noodles, it plans to introduce products such as Dant Kanti Advance, sugar-free chyawanprash, PowerVita, Seabuck thorn dietary supplement and powdered hair dye."
58ff20d17be9e0420db2d22b,Brothers at Arms,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160914/jsp/opinion/story_107954.jsp,2016-09-14,"FIRED OVER WATER: Buses of a Tamil Nadu-based company torched in Bangalore by Kannada activists over the Cauvery water issueLet me explain the Cauvery dispute with a domestic example. Imagine two brothers residing in a one-storey ancestral house, one brother on each floor. Next, imagine a rain-fed tank on the roof in which water is stored. It is let down to both houses by a pipe. When the tank is overfull, its water is allowed to flow down without any check. At other times, there is a tap with the brother on the first floor, to shut off supply. Also imagine that the brother on the ground floor gets some separate water from another source, which cannot be pumped up to the first floor. If you were asked to determine fair usage of water between them, in the heights of water scarcity, would you force the brother on the top floor to let down stored water to the man below without ascertaining if he has enough drinking water for himself? Can the brother below, who has a separate unshared source of water, insist on the tank being emptied for his convenience? This, in substance, is the problem between the two brotherly states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The Cauvery arises in Karnataka. Its flow is fed by rainfall of the southwest monsoon, in the catchment areas of Coorg and Mysore districts. It flows east and downwards to Tamil Nadu and finally joins the Bay of Bengal. It is a deficit river basin, because the water in the river is not sufficient for the water-intensive crops of rice and sugarcane cultivated in the area. Also, the river is not sufficient as the main source of drinking water to the ever-burgeoning city of Bangalore. The upper riparian state, Karnataka, has one monsoon and two crops which are rain and irrigation-fed. Tamil Nadu has the benefit of two monsoons and its farmers raise three crops, samba, kuruvai and thaladi. The main difficulty arises during the samba sowing season of August to September, when Tamil farmers look to water being released by the states irrigation department from its Mettur dam. Tamil Nadu, in turn, does not release water unless it receives water from upstream Karnataka. In a bad monsoon year, when it has not rained in the catchment areas of south Karnataka, the dams in Karnataka dry up or are not full to capacity. Remember that water in Karnataka dams has to suffice its citizens for the whole year. This includes drinking water and domestic requirements of the Bangalore urban agglomeration. In moments of distress, the chief minister of Karnataka has to contemplate, a parched Bangalore in the ensuing summer months of April and May versus drying crops in the neighbouring states Thanjavur delta. There have been moments of crisis, when chief ministers, especially from the Mysore area, have contemplated resignation rather than letting down the Karnataka populace. Chief minister Siddharamaiah also hails from the same region. However, years of distress are not frequent and happen about once in every 10 years. Curiously whenever the situation has got out of hand  in 1992, 2002 or 2016  Tamil Nadu has had the same CM. It does not help that she was born in Mandya, the heart of Karnatakas Cauvery belt. Her imperiousness doesnt help the situation either. Long before Arvind Kejriwal, she was the first chief minister to sit on a dharna, in 1992 at Marina Beach to protest against the Centres handling of the issue. Her governments binary logic often results in a pound of flesh being demanded from both the Union government and the state government of Karnataka, when it comes to Cauvery water. Distress management requires tact and statesmanship on both sides. Sadly, what citizens get to see is brinkmanship, zero sum games and politicking from both camps. It is against this backdrop, that distress years simultaneously see appeals to the Supreme Court and violence on the streets of Bangalore and Chennai. This violence is totally deplorable and counterproductive. The Delhi-centric media, displays a certain schadenfreude when the southern states are seen as no better than the northern jungle raj. When the capital city of Indias software revolution is paralysed by mob violence, it is all too easy to assume complicity of the state.But the media narrative seems to have gone overboard in condemning only one side. Karnataka loses on perception as an intransigent upper riparian state, that starves its neighbours and lets loose violence. What the media doesnt realise is that water usage fights are so volatile that they are predicted to lead to wars between countries in the future. Stoking a volatile narrative, only hastens a sense of victimhood. In this situation the national medias demonising of Karnataka, and calling for pellet guns and Presidents rule is doing no service to the nation. Karnataka also suffers at the Centre, because election after election, its 28 MPs are split amongst different parties. Tamil Nadus 40 MPs are often elected in one-party sweeps, all from the AIADMK or all from the DMK alternately. A strong block of 40 MPs carry a huge clout which splintered factions cant match. Even so, central governments stay out of distress management as long as they can, because they do not want to antagonise either state. In the past the Supreme Court has passed orders asking the Centre to intervene and work out a solution under the aegis of the prime minister. We are back to that stage again, where the Centre has to act. The Centre cannot indefinitely sit on its hands. It is time for an effective basin management of the water deficit Cauvery basin, especially in the years of distress. Both technical and economic solutions for distress need to be found. These include greater storage facilities in downstream Tamil Nadu and a change in cropping patterns, away from rice and sugarcane. Karnataka needs to have better management of its drinking water and domestic needs. While a permanent solution may take some work and time, violence is no solution, especially when it targets the powerless.

Call PMO,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160826/jsp/northeast/story_104443.jsp,2016-08-26,"Letters to ModiJorhat, Aug. 25: Jorhat is turning towards the Prime Minister's Office to get personal, social or economic work done. For years Ankur Gupta, BJP commissioner of ward 6 under Jorhat Municipal Board, has been trying to get births and deaths registered online in the state, it has now come to fruition. Prashanta Kumar Bordoloi, head of the department civil engineering department of Kaziranga University, moved the PMO against the National Highway of India Development Corporation Limited's lackadaisical attitude towards a lack of drainage system, which was destroying tea and paddy farms on either side of the under-construction four lane highway. Pradeep Kumar Patni Jain, a small savings postal agent, dashed off two letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi complaining about the inordinate delay in receiving passport for his minor daughter and about his apprehensions that postal agents would be dispensed with following the conversion of post offices into post banks. In response to the first letter he got the passport within 10 days from the passport office at Guwahati and in second case, he received a letter forwarded by the finance ministry, which stated that for the time being there were no such proposals. Jorhat Municipal Board ward commission Gupta had handed over a memorandum on various issues, including the tedious process of getting births and deaths certificates, to the Prime minister during his visit to Jorhat in March. ""The action taken was quick. The Union ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation on the PMO's reference wrote a letter to the joint secretary to the government of Assam, urban development department regarding a representation received from me in this regard on April 18,"" he said. On August 5, that the chairperson of Jorhat Municiapl Board received a letter that from joint director health services, Jorhat, that the director health services, Assam, would conduct a training on CRS software for online registration of births and deaths at the urban health centre in Jorhat district. Therefore, infrastructure facilities like computer, printer with Internet connectivity should be made available. ""The process has started and hope that it will be implemented soon all over the state,"" Gupta said. Bordoloi's letter to the Prime Minister stated: The four-laning of NH 37 is going on from Nagaon to Upper Assam districts, which is passing through the tea and rice bowl of Assam. Sir, Assam tea and paddy are raised side-by-side on the flat alluvial terrain of the Brahmaputra of which tea is a dry foot crop. The precondition of raising tea is the land should have water table below the root zone of the crop, which is 1.0m. To lower the water table, tea estates install a drainage system, of which main drain is minimum 1.5m deep. In the four-laning project, the National Highway Authority is placing culverts just at the land bed level, which needs lowering by another 1.0m to alleviate drainage congestion through rectification of the culvert placing across the four-lane highway under construction. Otherwise, high bed level of the culverts will invite doom for the tea industry."" ""As soon as they received the letter, I got a visit from an National Highway of India Development Corporation Limited engineer and we found a solution in which the corporation has agreed to make drains on either side, which would flow into nearby rivers or rivulets. Earlier I had written an article on this, approached our MPs but nobody bothered. I am happy that the PMO is taking such a serious note of the people's complaints at the ground level,"" he said. Jain said he had applied for the passport for his daughter Ridhi at a camp in Jorhat. ""For more than seven months my status on the passport office website acknowledged that the documents had been received. I sent several emails to them but there was no response. I sent a letter to the Prime Minister by speed post and in two days time I got a call from the passport office and the process was initiated for my daughter. Within 10 days I received the passport,"" he said."

58ff22567be9e0420db2d453,Good monsoon signal for crops,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161002/jsp/nation/story_111442.jsp,2016-10-02,"New Delhi, Oct. 1: The countrywide monsoon rainfall this season was three per cent below average instead of the predicted six per cent above average, but it was distributed well enough to promise good crop yields, scientists said. An end-of-season analysis by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) shows that the quantum of the all-India rainfall was about 97 per cent of the long-period average. It also reveals that 27 of the countrys 35 meteorological subdivisions received normal or excess rainfall this monsoon season, which ended yesterday. Senior meteorologists said the nine-point deviation of the actual rainfall from the predicted figure was not significant. But, they added, it highlighted once again the limitations of the long-range forecast the IMD issues every year before the start of the monsoon. Weather scientists who specialise in crop-related forecasts, however, said the overall rainfall figure was usually not as important as how the rain was distributed. Whether it is six per cent above average or three per cent below average is not important; what is important is that it was very well distributed this year, Gautam Saha, professor of agricultural meteorology at the Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyala in Bengal, told The Telegraph. The IMD analysis shows that eastern and northeastern India experienced the greatest departure from the long-period average, with rainfall 11 per cent below normal. The rainfall was five per cent below average in northwestern India, and eight per cent below in the southern peninsula. (See chart) But crop scientists view the monsoons behaviour as favourable. The Union agriculture ministry has said it expects the areas under cultivation and the yields of most kharif crops to be higher as a result of the favourable monsoon rainfall.The ministry estimates that rice production this year would be a record 93.88 million tonnes, beating the 92.78 million tonnes of 2011-12. Crop yield forecasters have predicted a record 19.3 million tonnes of maize and a record kharif pulse crop of 8.7 million tonnes, more than 3 million tonnes higher than last year. However, the ministry estimates a sugarcane crop of 305 million tonnes, about 46 million tonnes lower than last year. These estimates will be revised in the coming months as the actual production figures come in from the states. Weather scientists say the gap between predicted and actual rainfall should not surprise. Over the past two decades, the actual rainfall has deviated up to eight points higher or lower than the forecast, with the lowest deviations being four points lower or higher. The number given out by the long-range forecast is primarily intended to guide policy  it does not predict rainfall performance in the states, regions or districts, which is what determines the impact of rainfall, a senior weather scientist said. The long-range forecast has for over 130 years relied on inferences based on statistical relationships between monsoon rainfall and other weather parameters such as the snow cover, ocean temperatures and air pressures elsewhere in the world. The IMD is now preparing to improve its long-range forecasts through the use of computer-based simulations, called dynamic models, of the worlds weather. These dynamic models will give more information about how rain will be distributed in time and space through the monsoon season, said Madhavan Rajeevan, a secretary in the earth sciences ministry who is leading a mission to improve models to forecast the monsoon. Were hoping to release a long-range forecast based on dynamic models next year, Rajeevan told this newspaper.We will not abandon the statistical approach of issuing long-range forecasts but will add dynamic models into the forecasting process. Weather scientists from across the country will begin a two-day brainstorming session in Pune on Monday to discuss strategies for arriving at long-range forecasts by combining the traditional statistical models with the computer-simulation-driven models."

File photo Mamata takes oath in May. File photoWhen the Trinamool Congress first came to power in 2011, the mandate was against the Left. This time, the sweep was for incumbent Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. And the guests at her swearing-in nearly 100 days ago  from Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad to Farooq Abdullah  showed her ambitions are now national.In this regime, Mamata has looked more confident, if quieter  something that has helped prevent controversies. For instance, after the Park Street gangrape she had issued statements about the victim which drew widespread criticism, but this time a similar incident in Salt Lake hasnt drawn a statement.Her restraint is widely being interpreted as a sign of a maturity in a leader eyeing the national stage. One objective has been already achieved; her TMC has been recognised as a national party. Her close aide Mukul Roy is helping furthering the national plans, having gone to Tripura ahead of a rally that Mamata addressed last month.At home, Mamata has striven to hold on to her base and gain a foothold in North Bengal. She has drawn key leader Pradeep Pradhan away from Gorkha Mukti Morcha.More and more members of the Congress and the CPM are joining us practically every day, and of their own accord, TMC MP Saugata Roy told The Indian Express.CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra said the TMC in its second term is even worse than it was in the first term, in terms of violence against our workers and even in terms of buying elected representatives over from all non-TMC parties. She is trying to eliminate the Opposition altogether from the polling booth, Mishra said.He accused Mamata of sweeping vital issues under the carpet. Whether its farmer suicides or starvation deaths in tea gardens or teacher recruitment, Saradha or Narada, the CM behaves as if nothing had happened.Saugata Roy said Mamatas most important change has been the cleanup of her party and the crackdown on the syndicate raj. The purge came amid allegations of corruption and the release of the Narada tapes, and the crackdown on July 18 saw 11,000 arrests in 24 hours, mostly TMC workers. On July 31, the police arrested TMC councillor Anindya Chattopadhyay after a conversation between Mamata and Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina revealed that he had been trying to extort money from Hasinas relatives. Roy said, This according to me is the biggest thing that she is doing There are strongmen in the party and there is a little bit of corruption at the lower levels She is clamping down.Political analyst Ranabir Samaddar agreed this was Mamatas strongest move. The second biggest, he felt, is her stand on debt to the Centre. She has been more aggressive in taking the Centre on, more confident Over 70 per cent of the states revenues are consumed by this debt, Samaddar said.Mamata has spoken about the Centres unilateral undermining of federalism and has raised the issue of restructuring debt with the PM. The government paid a debt of Rs 33,067 crore last year, which is likely to rise to Rs 36,869 crore this year. Also, 80 million-odd people will continue to get rice at Rs 2 per kg, even as state subsidy on foodgrains has risen 12 times from 2010 to 2016.This is why she has been making a huge push for foreign investment. When she travels for Mother Teresas canonisation, she will meet investors in Rome as well as Munich.She knows the problem lies in the states image and these perceptions need to be changed for investment to come in, said Professor Avirook Sarkar of ISI. Nobody wants to come to Bengal. This is why she is cracking down on syndicates and remedying the law-and-order situation.Udayan Bandopadhyay, professor of political science at Bangabashi College, said TMC members have been interfering in the healthcare system. While she has been clamping down on syndicates, party members have entered governing bodies and committees in universities and colleges, they are vitiating the atmosphere here The party feels they need to be in every nook and corner, that the state is their inheritance.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The speakers stressed the need for a compassionate hearing of the voices of the Kashmiri people instead of drowning their grievances in anti-Pakistan hysteria and jingoistic sloganeering. Documentary filmmaker from Kashmir Sanjay Kak said: ""I feel there is sannata (silence) on Kashmir despite so much noise. Nobody is willing to understand the nature of the Kashmir problem. There is no attempt to listen to the Kashmiri people, to understand what they feel. They are screaming for attention."" Kak lamented that the mainstream media explained Kashmir as an Indo-Pakistan problem, ignoring the humanitarian crisis in the state. ""We can see Islamabad from Delhi, not the people who are saying something to us in Kashmir. The verbal firecrackers in television studios lit up the borders; the lives of Kashmiri remain in the dark. India needs to listen to Kashmiris,"" Kak said. Editor of Rising Kashmir Shujaat Bukhari echoed the sentiment. ""I recently went to a conference where very few people knew Kashmir was under curfew for 32 days in a row. One person said Kashmiris live on central doles, getting rice for Rs 3 per kg. We don't know where from such information come. Kashmir of 2016 is in a very bad shape; it is not the Kashmir of 2008 or 2012,"" he said. He described restoration of normalcy in the state as a big challenge but hoped the situation could be salvaged. Journalist Prem Shakar Jha expressed the fear that the state was slipping out of hand and felt only an out-of-box solution could work. He argued that it was fallacious to see Kashmir as a communal problem. ""I met Hizbul boys and even they didn't talk of Hindu-Muslim; they only pointed out what promises India didn't fulfil. The Kashmir problem is about true democracy, not religion,"" he said. Another veteran journalist and Kashmir interlocutor Kuldeep Nayar, said the current problem was exceptional as the old separatist leaders had lost credibility and the alienated youth had come to the forefront of protest. Nayar said these youth only want freedom. ""The best option is autonomy; strengthening Article 370. The dilution of Article 370 had created all the problems. The terms on which J&K came to India in 1947 should be honoured."" They were speaking at the launch of Kashmir - Virasat aur Siyasat, authored by journalist Urmilesh."

We can vote. But what do we eat?Thursday will have 9,776 residents of erstwhile enclaves voting for the first time in Cooch Behar. Asgar Ali believes it will also be his last time, and tempers his delight with cynicism.It took them 15 days to give us our election cards, he said. There are mistakes. Men have been listed as women and names have been spelled wrong. We got the voter cards. But where are our ration cards? Where is the kerosene we were promised?At each of her 200 rallies, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has highlighted the implementation of the Land Boundary Agreement under which Bangladesh and India exchanged 162 adversely held enclaves on August 1, 2015. A total 14,864 residents of 51 Bangladeshi enclaves became Indian citizens. At Madhya Moshaldanga, there is talk of redemption and eager discussions about politics. But after Mamatas rally Tuesday, anger too is setting in.She said she has been giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to all residents of enclaves. Thats a lie, said Jaynal Abedin, 24, Alis grandson. We havent even got 200 gm rice at that price, let alone a kilogram. Those in the camps who have come from Bangladesh and are being hosted by the Indian government, they are the ones getting free rice.Mamata conceded in her speech Tuesday that there are demands even in the enclaves and if re-elected she promised to deal with all demands. But its this growing discontent that the Opposition is eager to play on. The 9,776 new voters are spread across five constituencies, the highest number concentrated in Dinhata at 5,486. The Forward Blocs Akshay Thakur has accused the BJP-led central government and the Trinamool Congress of betraying the residents of enclaves while TMC candidate Udayan Guha, who switched from the Forward Bloc, credited Mamata with rescuing those who lived in these enclaves.Who cares what they say, Asgar Ali said. Let me explain something. I have seen a lot of things and I dont always remember all of it but I do remember one night, when I had to plough an entire field by myself because I had vowed I would do so. He mused: We were promised rice, kerosene, electricity and roads. If an election card can be made in a fortnight, why not the rest? Its like a game where everyone is lying and cheating. I am going to vote, it has always been my dream. But I dont think I will live to see the enclave change, he said.Change, however slow, is happening in the enclave.

On Sunday, Bora had said spodoptera mauritia, also known as paddy swarming caterpillars, had destroyed winter paddy or sali rice on 17,418 hectares of land in 10 districts of the state - Sivasagar, Jorhat, Golaghat, Majuli, Lakhimpur, Kokrajhar, Dhubri, Barpeta, Nalbari and Dibrugarh. Sali rice is grown between June/July and November/December. Today, he said the number of districts has risen to 22 and the total sali crop area affected is 30,204 hectares. The new districts affected are Charaideo, Darrang, Mancachar, Goalpara, Nagaon, Morigaon, Kamrup (metro), Kamrup (East), Kamrup, Sonitpur, Biswanath Chariali and Dhemaji. ""Our personnel are working on the ground and we have adequate stock of pesticides,"" Bora added. The joint director of the agriculture department said spodoptera mauritia were ""most dangerous as they can destroy crops overnight"". In a warning to personnel who adopt a casual approach, Bora said, ""We have suspended one official from Golaghat and will not hesitate to act against those who do not attend distress calls from farmers. The chief minister is monitoring the situation."" Asked about the cause of the pest attack, he said, ""Such pest attacks usually occur in the post-flood period."" Yesterday, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal had directed deputy commissioners to distribute pesticides and carry out spraying. The three pesticides being used are chloropyriphos, malathion and quinalphos, Barman said."

Modi said when the NDA government was in power, the state government had carried out the relief work in a much better way by deputing special district magistrates and in-charge ministers to oversee the relief work. ""But this time, nothing has been done,"" he said. The former deputy chief minister on the sidelines of his weekly janata durbar said: ""The state government is handling the flood situation very poorly. The victims are not getting the relief material and on the other hand chief minister Nitish Kumar is on flood tourism."" The attack from the BJP camp came at a time when JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh spoke on banning the entry of Union ministers from Bihar in the state. Singh on Tuesday said: ""The seven Union ministers from Bihar have no concern for the flood victims in the state. The Union ministers visit the flood-affected areas in Bihar to have meals with the affected people, take selfies and get clicked by photojournalists."" Reacting to Singh's statement, state BJP spokesperson and former MLA, Sanjay Singh Tiger, said Bihar is not the fiefdom of any individual. ""The Union ministers visiting Bihar have their influence in their constituency and they have won the elections with a huge margin,"" said Tiger. The war of words between the BJP and the JDU leadership escalated after the visit of Union ministers, including Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, to flood-prone districts of Bihar. Prasad who was in Bihar two days back visited several flood-affected areas in Patna and Vaishali districts and found that though food was served to them at the relief camps, those stuck in villages were not getting grains and were forced to live on flattened rice and jaggery. The Union law and information technology minister after visiting several villages in Punadih panchayats of Patna sadar stated there was no fodder to feed cattle in animal camps and in villages. He said the Centre will provide all kinds of help to Bihar to deal with the flood situation asking the state government to submit a memorandum at the earliest on the damages caused by the flood in the state. Apart from Prasad, Union minister of food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan also visited the flood-affected areas in Vaishali and blamed the state government for the poor supply of relief materials to the victims. According to the minister, 22 teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) comprising 1,000 personnel, including 767 rescuers, were working with 71 boats and the personnel have rescued more than 27,000 people."

Majhi had to walk 16km carrying his wife's body because the Kalahandi district headquarters hospital at Bhawanipatna denied him a hearse, as he had no money to pay for it. A petition has sought intervention for registration of a criminal case and ""fair investigation"" into the cause of death of Daana's wife on August 24 and alleged atrocity that had followed on him and his family, violating the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Rights activist Subash Mohapatra, who filed the petition yesterday, has also sought compensation for the victim's family under rules framed in the Act. In his petition, Mohapatra has alleged that though he had filed a complaint about the incident at the Bhawanipatna town police station, the officer in-charge had registered it on August 28 but did not follow it up with investigation. Mohapatra alleged in his petition that the state home department had also ignored his petition for investigation into the incident on the plea: ""This matter does not relate to home department as this matter comes under the health department"". ""The victim family was deprived, denied (service) and harassed by public authorities including the collector, sub-collector, CDMO, BDO, nurse, and security staff. Therefore, the police and home department were requested to take them to the court of justice by taking legal action, along with compensation according to the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and rules framed under it,"" Mohapatra said. According to the petition, Daana's wife was a daily labourer and used to support the family financially. Therefore, according to rules framed under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Rules, the government is expected to pay at least Rs 8,25,000 as compensation. But till date, the state government has failed to comply with the provision. ""While the family of the deceased woman was supposed to perform third day ritual ( Dibi Utha) on August 26, the block development officer of Thuamul Rampur took Daana Majhi and his 12-year-old daughter in his van and presented them before the sub-collector for inquiry. Denying the family to perform third day rituals in the name of investigation violated their religious rights and rituals,"" the petition states. Reports said Daana had so far got Rs 30,000 and a sack of rice from the district administration of Kalahandi and promises of admission in residential tribal school for his three daughters. Daana has also been assured a pucca house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna and inclusion under the National Family Benefit Scheme."

The court also instructed Karnataka to release 6,000 cusecs every day from tomorrow till September 27, the next date of hearing, twice the amount the Cauvery Supervisory Committee had yesterday ordered to be released till September 30. The board (CWMB) - part of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal's February 2007 final award - will be the ultimate arbitrator in any dispute between the neighbours. Its formation should have been the natural corollary after the award was notified in the Union gazette in February 2013 following a Supreme Court order. Over three years on, it has taken a similar order to clear the way for forming the board after the UPA government and its successor NDA regime had both dragged their feet, calculating the political costs in Karnataka. The Congress and the BJP both have high stakes in the upper riparian state. But once the board is formed, any further wrangling by Karnataka would become difficult. ""Apparently, the Supreme Court was irritated by both these states knocking on its door whenever there is a dispute since the tribunal had clearly outlined how any dispute would be settled by the CWMB. That is the reason the court decided to give the final push towards forming the board,"" said a former advocate general in Tamil Nadu. A retired chief engineer in the public works department said the board's ""full-time job"" would be to monitor rainfall in the catchment areas and storage in dams in both states and arrive at a reasonable amount to be released to save crops either side of the border. ""So, it will be difficult for Karnataka to invent excuses."" The court's order raised temperatures in Karnataka. Farmers in the state's Cauvery basin region resumed their agitation by blocking roads while another group tried to lay siege to chief minister P.C. Siddaramaiah's official residence. Police detained the protesters, including Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, a farmers' organisation. G. Madegowda, who heads the Cauvery Hitharakshana Samiti, a body that fights for the rights of farmers in the Karnataka side of the Cauvery basin, said: ""There is no point in forming any committee or board as we don't have enough water."" In Mandya, around 100km from Bangalore, Janata Dal Secular Lok Sabha MP C.S. Puttaraju handed in his papers in protest against the court's order. Karnataka home minister G. Parameshwar said the government was yet to take a call on whether to challenge the order. A meeting of the council of ministers has been scheduled tomorrow. Across the border in Tamil Nadu, farmers in the Cauvery delta region were expectedly happy. ""Now that the Tamil Nadu government has opened the Mettur dam, we hope to get adequate water to plant rice seedlings and prepare them for transplant as the first step towards the long-term Samba crop,"" said P.K. Deivasigmani, president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers' Federation. ""The CWMB should address any future dispute between the two states but how it will stand up to Karnataka's intransigence and the militant mood among its farmers remains to be seen.""

He also issued instructions to the agriculture officers in the districts bearing the brunt of the pest attacks to personally supervise the exercise.He also asked the deputy commissioners to personally monitor and carry out field verification in their respective districts, the statement said.The Assam agriculture department has set up a control room at the agriculture directorate in Guwahati to help farmers control the attack of pests.

58ff26467be9e0420db2d9bf,Confiscation idea 'absurd',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160828/jsp/bihar/story_104870.jsp,2016-08-28,"Palm trees in Gopalganj's Khajurbanni. The administration has confiscated around 150 trees in the locality. Picture by Rakesh K. Singh Patna, Aug. 27: Senior officials in the environment and forest department and experts in forestry have dubbed the excise department's move to confiscate around 150 palm trees in Khajurbanni as ""absurd"". Forests department officials claimed that there is no legal recourse to cut the palm trees or to take them into custody. Legal experts said the trees would have to be constantly monitored after confiscation as done in case of confiscation of immovable properties. However, senior officials in the forest department said it was not possible to deploy forest protection force or police for every palm tree. Besides, the confiscated palm trees cannot be cut by the forests department as they don't fall under the reserve forest area, which are governed under Indian Forest Act, 1972. Forestry experts, on the other hand, claimed that by this logic the state government may one day start confiscating rice fields, which are used for manufacturing hadiya (country liquor), sugarcane in north Bihar used for producing molasses, grapes and, a variety of other plant and tree species, which can produce alcohol upon fermentation. ""This is an unprecedented case. The Indian Forest Act does not give any power to divisional forest officers to confiscate trees. We do not have any clue how to take standing trees into custody even if they have been confiscated by the district administration,"" said a senior official in the forests department. Some 150 palm trees, spread over an area of about one acre at Khajurbanni, around 180km northwest of Patna, were ""confiscated"" by the Gopalganj district administration on Thursday under sections 68 (A) and 68 (C) of the Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 and subsequently handed over to the forests department for further action. Gopalganj divisional forest officer (DFO) B. Prasad had later told The Telegraph that he would seek guidelines from senior officials of the environment and forest department before taking any action, as it was a complex issue. Experts, however, claimed that the confiscated palm trees would be like an albatross around the forest department's neck. ""If the district administration has confiscated the palm trees by following due procedure and handed them over to forests department thereafter, it has been a mere act of passing the buck. Now I don't think the forests department has the powers to either cut trees or do anything else with them, as they are not situated inside protected forest land. Thus, the forest department would now be required to keep a close eye on the trees and ensure they are not used for making toddy,"" said Sudhir Kumar Jha, a retired IPS officer of the 1960 batch. Legal experts claimed that the owner of the land (on which the palm trees are located) can file a confiscation case in the court of the DFO. Otherwise, the forests department would be required to look after the trees. ""Though certain provisions of CrPC give power to the district administration to even seize standing crops, those provisions do not apply in this case. Here, the owner can either file a confiscation case in the court of the DFO, seeking release of the trees,or the DFO would have to look after them to ensure that they are not misused again to make toddy,"" said Ravi Parmar, a practising advocate at Patna High Court. Forestry experts claimed that the move to confiscate palm trees is not only absurd but also against the forestation schemes of the state government. ""Going by the logic that palm trees can be used to produce toddy, the state government would soon say that they would confiscate rice fields as fermented rice is also used for making hadiya (countryside liquor),"" said Rakesh Singh, a Delhi-based wildlife and environment expert. ""Then, they would say that they would either confiscate large sugarcane fields in north Bihar or ban its cultivation, as it is used in manufacturing molasses,"" Rakesh said. ""Thereafter, they would say that they would not allow grapes in Bihar as it is also used for making wine and other liquor."" Rakesh added: ""There are numerous plant species, which produce alcohol upon fermentation. If the state starts confiscating all such plants and trees, then all efforts of the Nitish Kumar-led government to increase the green cover in Bihar would be futile."""

Telegraph picture Imphal, Oct. 3: Union human resource development minister, Prakash Javadekar, today announced that the BJP will bring out a ""complete balance sheet"" on the development programmes taken up by the Centre for Manipur against the ""failure"" of the Okram Ibobi Singh government. Javadekar paid a day-long visit to the city today to attend the BJP state executive meeting held today. The meeting reviewed the political situation and chalked out a strategy for the Assembly election, likely to be held in February. ""We will come out with a complete balance sheet on the achievements of the NDA government and inaptitude of the state government in the coming days. Please wait for that,"" the minister told reporters after the state executive meeting. He said the BJP is set to ""expose"" the state government with complete facts and figures. ""Manipur is ready for a political regime change. People are happy with two schemes of the NDA government. There is no longer a shortage in the supply of cooking gas and we also give gas subsidies. This is a 100 per cent success story. Similarly people are happy that they can now get rice at Rs 3 per kg. The state government has no role to play in these two schemes,"" Javadekar said. He, however, said there are complaints that the state government has not provided rice to some places though the Centre has been providing enough to implement the National Food Security Act. ""Neighbouring Assam has undergone a change of government. People in Assam are happy now. People in Manipur will be happy if there is a regime change after the state Assembly elections,"" he said. The minister said because of the NDA government's Act East policy, policy, relations between India and Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan have improved. He also said the problem of cooking gas shortage in Tripura has been resolved after getting a supply from Bangladesh. Reacting to chief minister Ibobi Singh's recent remarks - that though several Union ministers regularly visit Manipur, no economic package has been given by the Centre for the state - Javadekar said he would continue to visit Manipur regularly and each time he would highlight what the Centre had done for Manipur. Responding to a question on the bad condition of the Imphal-Jiribam highway (National Highway 37), he said tender for repairs had been already floated. He alleged that the state government was not cooperating with the Centre on the latter's efforts to develop the highway. He said the Centre will fulfil its election promise of improving the highway. On the ""surgical strike"" inside Pakistan, Javadekar said the strike was a clear and tough message that India would not tolerate terrorist activities. India got widespread support from other countries for the counter-terrorism strike."

Taking strong exception to the denial of ration to the HIV positive siblings, the rights body asked the administration to prevent recurrence of such events. The direction comes after The Telegraph published a news report ""PDS rice denied to HIV+ children"" on its March 17 edition. Earlier, the Odisha Human Rights Commission had issued a similar direction for the compliance of an action-taken report. A retailer had denied ration under the government's food distribution system to the siblings because of the fear of contracting the disease. The incident had created a furore across the state. Kendrapara collector Debendra Prasad Das said: ""An administrative inquiry has already been conducted into the alleged ill-treatment to the HIV positive orphan siblings. The accused PDS stockist has already been removed. We will appraise the human rights watchdog of the measures initiated by the administration to protect the rights of the siblings."" Sub-divisional police officer Purna Chandra Pradhan said: ""The local police are probing into the incident. We will submit a compliance report as directed by the NHRC."" ""The government agencies need to reflect in their reports the action taken to sensitise and educate the people with regard to misconceptions about HIV positive people. The government agencies concerned need to initiate more vigorous and stringent steps to fight the situation in the larger interest of protecting the human rights of persons afflicted with HIV/AIDS,"" said social activist Biswapriya Kanungo. The infected siblings had lost their parents to the same disease in 2005. Moved by their plight, former President APJ Abdul Kalam had dispatched a draft of Rs 20,000 in June 2005 and also spurred the local administration to help out the siblings."

The BJP members told Sadhu that several villages had raised apprehensions over rice and sugar meant for them being siphoning off. ""The matter is very serious as it concerns the poor for whom the rice is essential. In the absence of a fair price dealer, the vigilance committee had taken up the onus of distributing the PDS material to the beneficiaries. However they seem more intent on depriving the beneficiaries than actually helping,"" said Bachu Marak, president of the BJP unit. The villagers alleged that three kg of rice were given to each individual instead of five kg as alloted under the act. A family with six members, entitled to get 30kg of rice, is given 18kg per month, the BJP delegates told Sadhu. The deputy commissioner assured them that strict action would be taken against those found guilty. ""We will inquire into the matter and take necessary action against the people who are responsible,"" he said. The BJP members also sought inclusion of genuine beneficiaries who have been denied NFSA cards. ""Many genuine beneficiaries have been deprived of the scheme while government employees, big businessmen and well-to-do people have been made beneficiaries. This is absolutely wrong and we urge those who are not eligible to surrender their cards so that people with genuine problems can benefit,"" the BJP president said.

58ff26f67be9e0420db2dab6,"Modi follows Atal lead, on Zimbabwe",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160821/jsp/nation/story_103609.jsp,2016-08-21,"New Delhi, Aug. 20: Last October, Prime Minister Narendra Modi helped Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe regain his footing after the nonagenarian leader stumbled in New Delhi. Ten months later, Modi is helping Mugabe, an outcast in many capitals, battle his biggest domestic crisis in a decade. India has committed $1 million and 500 tonnes of rice to Zimbabwe as it faces a crippling drought that has left five million people with food shortages in a country that was once considered the bread basket of Africa. The Modi government's decision represents a repeat of a move by the previous BJP-led government under then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee to supply food aid in 2003, when Zimbabwe last faced a major famine. Modi's return to a Vajpayee legacy comes at a time sections of India's political establishment, including Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, have urged him to follow the former Prime Minister in adopting a softer approach to a crisis in the state. Over 60 people have died in clashes between protesters and security forces in Kashmir, which Vajpayee had famously described as needing a dose of ""insaniyat"" (humanitarianism). But while Modi is yet to adopt Vajpayee's approach to Kashmir, India's ambassador in Harare, R. Masakui, earlier this month drove down to the Zimbabwe foreign ministry and handed Mugabe's chief secretary Mishek Sibanda a $1 million cheque. Masakui also promised 500 tonnes of rice that will be shipped into Zimbabwe from India. ""This is a continuation of one of India's pillars of development assistance to Africa,"" Ruchita Beri, Africa expert and senior fellow at the New Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, told The Telegraph. ""We've usually been fairly regular in our support during humanitarian crises in Africa, and Zimbabwe has been an example earlier too."" The grant and the rice represent a drop in the ocean for Mugabe's government, which said in February it needs $1.5 billion worth of aid from domestic and foreign charities and friendly countries to ride out the famine triggered by the drought. The drought was brought on by the El Nino effect, and has also affected other neighbouring countries including Malawi, Zambia and South Africa - though Zimbabwe has been worst hit. But India's aid assistance to Africa has never been only about volume, officials said. Instead, it is about political and diplomatic signalling. India contributed $10 million in December 2014 to a UN fund to fight the Ebola crisis in West Africa, and another $2 million for the procurement of protective gear for emergency and medical workers involved in the battle against the killer virus. The UN had set a target of $ 5.4 billion for the Ebola fund, which it met. And even during Vajpayee's time, India's aid to Zimbabwe in 2003 wasn't huge. Then, India avoided any financial assistance, but shipped 50,000 tonnes of rice to Zimbabwe. The aid however signals support for a beleaguered ally at a time it needs it, and crucially, comes without any overt strings attached - unlike with the West. Mugabe has already repeatedly declared that he will turn down aid even during the drought from Europe and the US if it comes with conditions - such as a request to allow gay marriages or dilute controversial programmes introduced by the Zimbabwe leader. With Mugabe, Modi has also built a personal connect that seemed unlikely when the 92-year-old Zimbabwe leader visited New Delhi last October for the third edition of the India Africa Forum Summit. Mugabe hails from a period of non-aligned leaders, shares a torrid relationship with the West and has long held the Nehru Gandhi family in India in high esteem - traits Modi is usually uncomfortable with. At a photo-opportunity on the eve of the Africa summit, Mugabe was the one African leader - among 41 - who refused to wear a special kurta like the ones Modi wears that were designed for the visitors. But the following day, as Mugabe walked up to the stage at New Delhi's Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, venue for the meet, for another group photo, he stumbled. Modi, who was watching, rushed to hold the Zimbabwe leader, whose aides too came forward. The Indian Prime Minister then walked Mugabe onto the stage, hand-in-hand. Modi later gushed about Mugabe's leadership. And a few months later, the Zimbabwe leader became one of the few serving heads of state or government to agree to join Modi on a stage in New Delhi for a controversial cultural extravaganza organised by the Art of Living spiritual group. Mugabe eventually pulled out only because of diplomatic protocol, after his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee withdrew because of alleged illegalities in the manner in which the Art of Living procured permissions to hold the event on the banks of the Yamuna."
58ff27947be9e0420db2db8f,Paswan warns 'errant' states,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161004/jsp/northeast/story_111757.jsp,2016-10-04,"Ram Vilas Paswan Shillong, Oct. 3: Union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan today warned states that diverted food grains meant for the beneficiaries. Paswan was here for a meeting with officials of the Food Corporation of India (FCI). He also chaired a meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti Baithak at the state convention centre here. He pushed for computerisation of the public distribution system and implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) scheme. Tomorrow he will hold a review meeting in Guwahati on issues related to digitisation of public distribution system. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Paswan said 18 states have already implemented end-to-end computerisation and other states have been urged to adopt this system. ""We want all states to implement end-to-end computerisation to improve the distribution of food grains to the public but no deadline has been given to them,"" he said. He said of 36 states and Union territories, 34 have already implemented the National Food Security Act, where Aadhar card was also put in place. He, however, said in a few states, including Meghalaya, Aadhar card could not be implemented because the Registrar General of India has cited some problems. In Meghalaya, he said, of over 29 lakh population according to 2011 census, altogether 21,46,000 beneficiaries have been included under the food security act, which included 77 per cent in rural and 50.5 per cent in urban areas. On leakage of foodgrains meant for the public under the act, the minister admitted that there have been complaints that foodgrains did not reach the beneficiaries. ""The FCI procured, stored and transferred the foodgrains to the respective states. It is the duty of the state governments to ensure that the items are distributed to the people. It is a fact that there have been complaints that foodgrains did not reach the beneficiaries, and those distributed to them were of poor quality. Moreover, the states lift 100 per cent of foodgrains allotted to them every month. Therefore, if ration is not distributed, the beneficiaries should also file a case under the act,"" he said. On the implementation of DBT scheme to curb pilferage of foodgrains in the targeted public distribution system (TPDS), the minister said the states should opt for DBT so that subsidy is credited to bank accounts and allows the beneficiaries to buy foodgrains from the market. According to Paswan, in the Northeast, earlier some problems were cited such as shortage of electricity, lack of banking facilities, besides hilly terrain, in the implementation of DBT. However, when pointed out that DBT is being implemented in the hill states in schemes like MGNREGA, the minister left it to states to decide. To a question on the number of states, including from the Northeast, that are entitled for subsidised pulses, the minister said the Centre allotted subsidised pulses to the states that have asked for it. He said there was no demand from Meghalaya for pulses, only rice and wheat. ""Under NFSA, we are giving every month 12,281 metric tonnes of rice to Meghalaya which includes 524 metric tonnes for Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) beneficiaries and 10,276 metric tonnes for Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries. We also allotted 1,481 metric tonnes of rice under tied-over for (non-NFSA) beneficiaries,"" the minister said. The minister revealed that 2,386 metric tonnes of wheat was also given to Meghalaya every month. When asked to rate the implementation of TPDS by the states in the Northeast, the minister and the officials said some states were progressing well. ""We want the states to properly implement for the benefit of the people and we are not hammering the failures because it may affect the consumers."" The minister hoped that the proposed amendment of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 would be passed in Parliament soon, so that the rights of over 125 lakh consumers in the country would be further protected. He said the proposed bill would have consumer protection authority to investigate consumer protection issues, besides three consumers' courts at the district, state and national levels. ""After 30 years, there is no change in the act. Now we will introduce the bill in Parliament for its passage."""

The same rice is served to hundreds of flood victims amid unhygienic conditions. Picture by Ranjeet Kumar Dey Chura (beaten rice) and jaggery for breakfast, and watery dal and vegetable curry for lunch and dinner - that's what the more than 600 people living in the flood relief camp set up at BN Collegiate School are surviving on. The food here is perhaps the worst among the 35 relief camps in Patna district that flood affected people across the state have thronged to. ""Why can't they serve us proper meals? We are not demanding chicken or mutton - just proper dal, rice and vegetables,"" said Ramji Rai, one of the people at the camp. Valmiki Rai (55), a resident of Sabbalpur diara now living at the camp, said: ""We are neither expecting nor demanding a rich meal but they should at least not serve us poor quality dal and vegetables. If we complain to the cooking in-charge, he might abuse us. So we stay silent."" Another camp inmate, Lalita Devi who was with her two children, said: ""We cannot raise our voice as they may stop feeding us and our children. So, it is better to be quiet and eat whatever they are serving us."" At the Bihar Vidyapeeth relief camp, where Patna district magistrate Sanjay Kumar Agarwal ate lunch on Wednesday, the story was different. Even disaster management minister Chandrashekhar had meals at the relief camp in Sonepur on Tuesday. Chief minister Nitish Kumar on Thursday visited several relief camps and inspected the services there. But no dignitary has bothered to visit the BN Collegiate School camp. When The Telegraph visited the relief camp on Thursday, lunch had just begun. The dal being served resembled one only in colour; the curry was equally watery. Asked about it, Shakeel Ahmad, Patna Sadar block agriculture officer who is in-charge of food at the camp, declared: ""The dal is accumulated at the bottom of the pot. Those serving the meal have not mixed it properly."" Rakesh Kumar, a clerk at Patna Sadar, interjected: ""No sir, we are serving very good food."""

(Express Photo) Ehasan first showed signs of the infection in May this year and quickly developed resistance to all the drugs in three months. (Express Photo)Months after the announcement of Bedaquiline drug initiation to treat extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) cases, the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) finally kickstarted with its first patient in Mumbai, a Dharavi resident. This patient is the first of 100 patients expected to undergo the medication.Until now, only Chennai and Guwahati have put patients on the Bedaquiline regime  considered a miracle drug in fighting TB. Bedaquiline was introduced in response to the World Health Organizations call in 2012 to work on anti-TB medication at a time when the bacteria was increasingly becoming resistant to drugs.The XDR patient, 20-year-old Mohammad Ehasan, is currently admitted at Sewri TB Hospital and has been put on advanced category five treatment. Apart from showing resistance to all first and second-line drugs, he is also resistant to Isoniazid, which is used to treat extremely drug-resistant cases.The beginning of Bedaquiline medication will be a boost in the fight against the bacterial infection which has caused a rising incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) and XDR cases in Mumbai. According to health experts, thousands are in need of this drug although it is being rolled out selectively for extreme cases of TB.Ehasan first showed signs of the infection in May this year and quickly developed resistance to all the drugs in three months. He first went to a private physician in Dharavi. When his coughing and vomiting fit did not end, he visited Sion Hospital and initiated treatment for normal TB infection on June 21. A culture test later showed he was resistant to almost all drugs. On July 26, he was admitted at Sewri TB hospital.In the first week of August, the Drug Resistance TB Committee chose him as the first Bedaquiline candidate after carefully testing him for any heart or diabetic problems.The frail man, with a mask on his face at all times, does not understand the disease he is battling, nor does his family. Ehasan has three younger brothers, one sister and parents to take care of in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. He lived in a small godown in Dharavi and as a tailor made Rs 300 per day before he fell ill.He is the only earning member. With him ill, his old father is going to farms to earn for the family, said his uncle Sameer ur Rehman. According to him, no one in the family has suffered from TB or knows about the disease.Watch Video: Whats making newsWhile Bedaquiline counselling is necessary to each patient undergoing the six-month regime, Ehasan claims he was only told that a new drug will be added to his medicines. I do not know much about what pills I have to take, he said. His diet comprises banana, milk, rice and daal in the hospital. To help strengthen immunity, he is given food every few hours.The hospital and Drug Resistant TB committee will monitor his health for two weeks to see how he responds to Bedaquiline, of which a small dose is administered to him daily at 1 pm.Following that, he will be discharged and asked to visit a DOT center in Dharavi for his daily dose. Daksha Shah said the process of selecting appropriate patients for Bedaquiline will require several checks which is why a delay has been observed. On August 8, The Indian Express had reported how Bedaquiline delay was forcing an extremely drug-resistant patient to look for other options.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: August 11, 2016 11:26 am"
58ff2f5e7be9e0420db2e1dc,Cong UP hope: bread-butter issues,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161021/jsp/nation/story_114707.jsp,2016-10-21,"New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Congress is praying for a normal election in Uttar Pradesh without any unwarranted ""surgical"" intervention from the BJP's spin doctors. Aware that the BJP had found a ""talking point"" with last month's surgical strikes - the anti-terror army action across the Line of Control - the leadership is working on shifting the focus to everyday issues like rural distress and unemployment. Party leaders realise that the mix of religiosity and patriotism by re-igniting the Ram temple hope along with the anti-Pakistan hysteria could curtail the impact of Rahul Gandhi's recent kisan yatra in the poll-bound heartland state. They also know that the party's nuanced approach on nationalism and religion would evaporate in the heat of raw jingoism; hence the prayer for a normal bread-and-butter discourse. Yesterday, the party's communications chief, Randeep Surjewala, dwelt on issues like alarming economic indicators and job losses in a series of tweets. Among the questions he asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the promise of two crore jobs a year when the unemployment rate was at a five-year peak, the manufacturing sector's performance being the worst in five years, industrial growth, soaring prices of eatables and the grim outlook for bank credit. A couple of days ago he had held an elaborate briefing on the BJP government's refusal to pay even the minimum support price (MSP) for rice in Haryana. ""We don't want Pakistan or a Ram temple to dominate the political discourse. We see them as artificial diversions as the Modi government has failed to deliver on the lofty promises made during the last parliamentary elections,"" a senior leader from Uttar Pradesh told The Telegraph. ""The BJP knows that issues like cow slaughter, love jihad and minority appeasement have lost their efficacy, so the same agenda is being presented in a new packaging."" Another leader said: ""We are going to villages as part of the Rahul Sandesh Yatra. When we explain to farmers Rahul Gandhi's promise to write off loans and halve electricity bills, the only question we face is, 'Won't betray us like Modi did, will you?' This clearly reflects that the farmers are angry with Modi for not fulfilling his promise of giving MSP plus 50 per cent profit. That created a huge opening for us."" This leader claimed the loan-waiver promise had created a wave and farmers, cutting across caste lines, were itching to punish the BJP. ""Other issues that angered the ordinary people were prices of pulses and vegetables, lack of employment and the general perception about the (BJP's 2014 promise of) achchhe din (good days) ahead being a hoax. We got unexpected support throughout the state. But suddenly this diversion has come in the form of chest-thumping about the surgical strikes,"" he said. The Congress has been focusing on farmer-related issues and Modi's failure to deliver on his promises. While party vice-president Rahul did it during his kisan yatra, other leaders are pursuing it in the ongoing Sandesh Yatra. From November 1, a "" vidhan sabha yatra"" is scheduled to begin to spread the same message. The Congress hopes to bolster its campaign next month with the entry of Priyanka Gandhi who too, party sources said, would focus on Modi's ""false promises"". Assembly elections are due early next year in Uttar Pradesh. Party leaders, who didn't have many tears to shed for former Uttar Pradesh unit chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi who defected to the BJP today, saw her reference to Rahul's "" khoon ki dalali"" statement as a reflection of a carefully crafted strategy. Rahul had earlier this month accused Modi of indulging in political exploitation of the sacrifices of soldiers. Sources said Bahuguna was feeding the ""war hysteria"" by referring to the Congress's stand on the surgical strikes as the reason for switching camps, when the primary reason was the trust deficit the Nehru-Gandhi family had developed after her brother Vijay Bahuguna tried to dislodge the Uttarakhand government. Raj Babbar, who heads the state Congress, said the ""BJP is making an army of traitors"" who were attacking Rahul because he was trying to demolish the little fiefs within the party."

He doubled as Finance minister following resignation of K M Mani last year, over charges in the bar bribery scam. Chandys two hours-and-54-minutes speech on Friday was also the longest budget speech in the history of the House.Chandy also criticised the Centre over its directionless development policies in the wake of scrapping of the Planning Commission. Niti Ayog which came into being as a replacement is clueless on its responsibilities.The ministers have been expressing individual views but there is no clarity on development goals, Chandy said.The chief minister pitched the budget as a mix of implemented programmes and a proposed plan of action, sending out a message of confidence barely two months ahead of a change in government.He stressed on the governments focus on development and listed Vizhinjam International Seaport, Kochi Metro, Kannur International Airport and Kochi Smart City among its achievements.The budget featured a slew of welfare measures  among them are free rice for BPL/AAY families, Rs 500 crore earmarked for the governments fixed-price scheme to ensure rubber farmers Rs 150 per kg and insurance cover for about 30 lakh beneficiaries of social security pension schemes.The government also proposes to work along with banks on a programme for waivers and discount on educational loans availed by students from economically backward families.DH News Service"

Express photoWITH A sprawling industrial area on one side and high-rises on the other, residents of the twin villages of Khairane-Bonkode in Navi Mumbai seem stuck in time. Not much remains of the villages which locals claim are over 200 years old, but residents continue to identify themselves as villagers, even as the neighbourhood has turned metropolitan.Both the villages probably had a population of not more than 2,000 persons. Today, the number has surged to about 30,000, says Munawwar Patel, a resident of Khairane village. He says that though there are many who have migrated into the area, the original residents have continued to remain rooted to their village.The original occupants of the villages, he says, came from three communities  Konkani Muslims, Agris and Kolis  who lived in harmony. Local lore goes that the villages made their contribution to the Indian freedom struggle, but their efforts did not get documented and hence remain unrecognised.Residents also claim that these two villages are the few in Navi Mumbai whose original inhabitants belong to the Muslim community.The land on which the buildings stand today used to be open fields, where the members of the Konkani and Agri community farmed. The Koli community was involved in fishing, Patel says.Villagers claim that land under rice cultivation, as well as other areas belonging to them, were eventually taken over by the City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited (CIDCO) in 1972 to develop Navi Mumbai. Our land was forcefully taken over. Many promises were made to us  that basic amenities would be brought to our village, including a hospital, an open ground, jobs, sewage facility. Most of the promises have not been fulfilled. For most villagers, their only source of income remains the rent from homes they managed to built from the inadequate compensation they had received then, says a villager, not wishing to be named.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Delhi businessmen Suresh Sharma and Kapil Sharma landed at Patna airport on Friday evening. Then began their horror odyssey that ended early on Wednesday when a police team took on the captors in the Kajra forest located in the hilly and difficult terrain of Lakhisarai district. The brothers - sons of a prominent Delhi businessman - were confined to an open jungle and given one meal consisting of puffed rice (murhi) and water. Their hands were tied, their mouth and eyes were covered by bandage so they couldn't escape. The two were regularly beaten up. Kapil Sharma (27), the younger brother, recounts his ordeal to Roshan Kumar of The Telegraph. On October 10, my elder brother Suresh Sharma received a call on his mobile from an unknown number. The caller identified himself as Gopal and claimed he had got Suresh's number from an engineer known to the Sharma family. The caller stated that there is a contract work for our company at Haveli Kharagpur (Munger district). Our family is in the business of supplying manpower to different construction companies. Suresh was surprised on receiving the offer as our company had no experience of working in Bihar. My brother informed me and other family members about the offer. My father Babulal Sharma and my two other brothers (Vinod Sharma and Kumar Sharma) were sceptical. On October 16 and 17, this ""Gopal"" again called, stating that their company director (no name was given) would be coming to Bihar from Mumbai on October 21 and they have fixed a meeting between him and Suresh. The meeting was for construction of a polytechnic institute at Haveli Kharagpur. My brother agreed to inspect the project site along with me. We were sent tickets for GoAir Flight G8 149 from New Delhi to Patna. Before the flight took off from Delhi, my brother received a message on his mobile mentioning the name of the driver, Ajit, and his mobile number. Our flight landed at Patna around 6.10pm. Ajit (age around 25), who was waiting for us in a TUV 300 vehicle, informed us it will take an hour to reach the destination. I did not know where we were going, but the driver kept saying we will reach our destination soon. On the way, Ajit stopped at some dhaba (place not known) for tea and snacks. At that time neither my brother nor me had any inkling about their plan. After travelling for nearly two-and-a-half hours, the driver stopped his vehicle in an isolated area. Around seven to eight persons dragged Suresh and me out of the vehicle, tied our hands, covered our eyes and mouth with a piece of cloth and asked us to board another vehicle (a Scorpio). In the meantime, Ajit left the spot in his vehicle. After moving for 30 minutes, we reached a place that was a dense forest. Our abductors beat us and told us that we have been kidnapped. (The Sharma brothers bear injury marks on their chest, hands and back.) After some time, a person named Gopal reached the spot. He identified himself to be a Naxalite leader and said we have been abducted by Maoists. While Gopal was threatening us, my father incidentally called on Suresh's mobile. The abductors immediately snatched Suresh's mobile and asked us to inform our father that we have been kidnapped. Gopal fixed Rs 5 crore for our release. The abductors later took our mobile, gold chain and purse containing some cash and credit card. For the next two days, Suresh and I were confined to a single room and given one meal. Two days later, on Sunday night, Gopal again visited us and made a call to our father. This time the ransom amount was reduced to Rs 4 crore. On the same night we were shifted to another location, this time it was an open field inside a thick forest. For the next two days, we were confined to the field; it was a harrowing experience as we were asked to sleep on grass. We are guarded by seven persons, including two women. The abductors regularly beat us and exerted pressure on us for ransom. On Tuesday night, we noticed some movement in the forest and heard the sound of gunfire. Our abductors informed us that some rival Naxalite groups have attacked. The captors discussed among themselves shifting us to another location; some of them also talked of killing us. We panicked and prayed to God. Soon, we again heard the sound of gunfire. This time, our captors, sensing that we might escape, tried to inject some drugs into us, possibly to make us unconscious. Suresh and I tried to prevent them from injecting drugs. Amid all this, I noticed the glare of the parabomb (a type of balloon used by security forces to provide light cover to them). I was now sure that the encounter was not between Naxalite groups, but that security forces had come for our rescue as such techniques are used by the army and police only. Soon the gunfight intensified. As security forces outnumbered the abductors, the kidnappers planned to escape. Before leaving the spot, one of the abductors again advised his fellow captors to kill us, but the others refused. By dawn, the firing from security forces intensified; the abductors left the spot, leaving us behind. As the abductors left the spot, we cried for help, finally we were rescued by security. Our five-day ordeal had finally come to an end, thanks to security forces led by Manu Maharaaj. (Kapil thanked the security forces for rescuing them but vowed never to return to Bihar again.)"

(AFP) Oct. 13: King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, who took the throne of the kingdom once known as Siam shortly after World War II and held it for more than 70 years, establishing himself as a revered personification of Thai nationhood, died today in Bangkok. He was 88 and one of the longest-reigning monarchs in history. The royal palace said today that he died at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok, but it did not give a cause or further details. King Bhumibol, politically influential and highly revered, was a unifying figure in a deeply polarised country, and his death casts a pall of uncertainty across Thailand. The military junta, which seized power in a coup two years ago, derives its authority from the king. The king's heir apparent, Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, is seen by many as a jet-setting playboy and not held in the same regard as his father. And the king's death raises questions about the future of the monarchy itself. King Bhumibol spent most of his final years in a hospital, ensconced in a special suite. His portrait hung in almost every shop, and as his health declined, billboards proclaimed ""Long Live the King"", signalling widespread anxiety about a future without him. In response, he openly fretted that the people should feel so insecure. Thais came to see this Buddhist king as a father figure wholly dedicated to their welfare, and as the embodiment of stability in a country where political leadership rose and fell through decades of military coups. His death ends a reign that few monarchs have matched for longevity. Queen Elizabeth II, by comparison, has ruled Britain for more than 64 years. With King Bhumibol's death, she becomes the world's longest-reigning monarch. King Bhumibol (many Thais pronounce it poo-me-pon) was an accidental monarch, thrust onto the throne at 18 by the violent death of his older brother in 1946. He fully embraced the role of national patriarch, upholding the world of traditional Thailand, where hierarchy, deference and loyalty were guiding principles. Western stereotypes of his country irked him. (He disdained the Broadway musical The King and I, with its roots in his grandfather's court.) And, like a stern father, he was quick to chastise his fellow Thais when he saw the need. In the king's book The Story of Tongdaeng (2002), about a street dog he had adopted, the message - there was always a message in his writings - was that affluent Thais should stop buying expensive foreign breeds when there were so many local strays to save. The book was a Thai bestseller. If he was a people's king, Bhumibol was a quiet and somewhat aloof one. He was a man of a sober, serious mien, often isolated in his palaces, protected by the most stringent of lse-majest laws, which effectively prevent almost any public discussion of the royal family. But he had a worldly bent. Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father was a student at Harvard at the time, he was educated in Switzerland, spoke impeccable English and French, composed music, played jazz on the clarinet and saxophone, took up photography, painted, wrote and spent hours in a greenhouse at his Chitrlada Palace in Bangkok. Once he had returned from Europe, however, he stayed put. Never interested in a jet-set life, he stopped travelling abroad, saying there was too much to do at home. He was content to trudge through croplands in distant provinces in an open-neck shirt and sport coat, tending to the many development projects he encouraged and oversaw: his milk-pasteurising plants, dams that watered rice fields, factories that recycled sugar-cane stalks and water hyacinths into fuel, and countless others.

Senior leader Sushil Kumar Modi said: ""The government has abolished subsidies for investors. Incentives on land/shed for small and micro units at 50 per cent of the cost of investment and 28 per cent for large, medium and mega projects have been done away in the new industrial policy."" The cabinet gave nod to the new industrial policy this August and some of the other provisions that have been cut in the new policy include captive power generation subsidy, project report incentive, VAT and entry tax. His attack at the government on the sidelines of his janata durbar in Patna follows chief minister Nitish Kumar's demand for an all-inclusive central development policy to provide ""special help"" for growth of poor and less developed states. Speaking at the 72nd annual function of Bihar Industries Association on Monday, Nitish had maintained that the Centre's support was needed for the state's development. He asked industrialists to keep demanding special status tag for Bihar. ""Under the capital subsidy, potential investors used to get 20 per cent subsidy on plant and machinery according to the state's industrial policy 2011-16,"" Modi, once Nitish's deputy, said. ""But in the new industrial policy, all such subsidies have been abolished."" The BJP leader claimed that as Bihar is an agrarian society, maximum subsidies are given in agro industries. In the food processing sector, he claimed, industries used to get 35 per cent subsidy of which 60 per cent was provided before setting up the industries and the rest after. But all that has been done away with. Owing to 35 per cent subsidy given to the food processing industry, there was substantial investment in rice mills, pulse mills and cold storage. But the new industrial policy will put a full stop to new investment and investors have to claim subsidy on land after they pay for it. Echoing Modi's views, industrialist Satyajit Singh said: ""In the old industrial policy, it was easy for an investor to set up a factory as he used to get 35 per cent subsidy from the government and the bank would give 40 per cent of the amount as loan. But, now all such subsides have been abolished and the government is following a post-production reimbursement model (claiming subsidy after payment)."""

Mallick made the announcement at a function organised on the occasion of World Food Day at Dinabandhu Mancha here this morning. ""There are some tea estates in north Bengal, which are either closed or ailing. There are also estates which have the history of being closed by the managements at regular intervals on some pretext or the other. In total, we have identified 44 gardens where we will open ration shops,"" he said. He said the north Bengal development department would spend around Rs 8 lakh to set up each ration shop in the 44 gardens. ""To ensure that workers and their families get consistent supply of food grains from the state, it has been decided that we will run the ration shops. In fact, today we inaugurated five ration shops in four tea plantations, all located in the Dooars,"" said Mallick. Of the 44 estates, 13 are in Jalpaiguri district, 21 are in Alipurduar district, while the remaining 10 are in Darjeeling district. The ration shops which started functioning today are located in the closed Redbank and Surendranagar gardens, and in the ailing Kanthalguri and Dalmore plantations. In Kanthalguri, two shops have been opened. As the Centre launched the National Food Security Scheme and the state introduced ""Khadyasathi"" under which a family will receive 35kg of rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg, the distribution of foodgrains in tea gardens was mostly handed over to the respective management or self-help groups. ""However, a practical problem cropped up in closed and sick tea gardens which have no management at all or lack the capacity to distribute foodgrains. Also, in the case of sick and closed tea estates, there are irregularities in foodgrain distribution. That is why the department has decided to run the ration shops on its own in those gardens,"" an administrative source said. Mallick said the food department would distribute foodgrains free among street dwellers. The scheme will be initially implemented for street dwellers in Calcutta."
58ff37e17be9e0420db2e927,BJP rains yellow rice to pull crowds,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/nation/story_114986.jsp,2016-10-22,"Narendra Modi Lucknow, Oct. 21: If the surgical strikes cannot pull the crowds to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in Mahoba, the BJP is hoping its ""cereal strike"" will. BJP workers are distributing packets of yellow rice among Hindu households in the Bundelkhand region's Mahoba, Hamirpur, Banda, Chitrakoot, Lalitpur, Jhansi and Jalaun districts to encourage people to make Monday's rally a success. Yellow rice - rice dipped in a solution of turmeric and dried - is considered auspicious and is an essential ingredient of pujas. In north India, yellow rice is often offered to women when they set off on a journey. ""We realised that many people were not too excited about the surgical strikes (last month's anti-terrorist action by the army across the Line of Control),"" a senior BJP politician in Lucknow said, asking not to be named. ""But we have succeeded in striking an instant chord with people by distributing the yellow rice."" Led by Om Prakash Tiwari, chief of the BJP's Mahoba unit, over a dozen party activists visited the town's Kadipur, Narupur, Gandhi Nagar, Sattipur and Dal Bangla neighbourhoods yesterday, carrying the yellow rice door to door. They were accompanied by a band playing drums and trumpets. Party sources said they had skipped the Muslim-dominated Chahasiyapur, Mataniyapur and Fatipura localities. ""We tell the people about the Modi government's achievements, including the surgical strikes, and then offer them the yellow rice, which is our way of inviting them,"" local media reports quoted Tiwari as saying. The senior Lucknow-based BJP politician who spoke to this newspaper said the decision to distribute yellow rice was taken two days ago at a meeting presided over by state BJP general secretary Swatantra Dev Singh. ""It was decided that yellow rice would be a good bet to ensure the success of the rally, which will kick off the 2017 Assembly election campaign,"" said the politician, who has been asked to camp in Mahoba and monitor the door-to-door contact programme. He said similar contact programmes were going on in other districts of the region. ""We are also holding public meetings at temples in every neighbourhood. Swatantra Dev Singh addressed one such meeting in the Hanuman temple at Srinagar village in Mahoba on Wednesday,"" he added. Singh also performed a bhumi pujan (earth worship) at the venue of Modi's rally. The BJP has little presence in Bundelkhand and won just one of the region's 19 Assembly seats in the 2012 elections. The Congress won four thanks to a focused campaign by Rahul Gandhi. The Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have seven seats each from the region. Uttar Pradesh is due to vote early next year."

Compiled by Shuchismita Chakraborty and Faryal Rumi Residents purchase crackers in Paschim Darwaza area of Patna City on Thursday after the district administration issued around 150 temporary licences two days ahead of Diwali. The locality is a hub of crackers in the city. For the past two weeks, the shops in the locality were closed after the administration cracked down on shops selling crackers without licences. Soon after the shops opened, residents thronged in large numbers to purchase their favourite crackers. Many small shop owners also visited the shops to make some profit in the last two days. Shops from Paschim Darwaza to the Chowk area were packed because of the Dhanteras crowd.

58ff38267be9e0420db2e986,7 Pak soldiers shot on Jammu border: BSF,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161022/jsp/nation/story_114979.jsp,2016-10-22,"New Delhi, Oct. 21: In a flare-up in the continuing series of ceasefire violations on the frontier in Jammu and Kashmir, India's border guard claimed this evening that it had killed seven Pakistani counterparts and a militant using small arms and mortars after one of its own was critically wounded by a sniper. India's Border Security Force took the unusual step of issuing a ""Press Note"" this evening to claim the kills of Pakistani Rangers and the militant in the Hira Nagar sector of Jammu. India recognises the frontier here as the International Boundary but Pakistan disputes it as a ""working boundary"". This is a stretch of about 20 kilometres just south of the Line of Control that runs northwards from Sangam near Akhnoor. Pakistan's Inter Services Public Relations spokesperson General Asim Bajwa denied the killings. ""Indians resorted to unprovoked fire/shelling on working bdry in Shakargarh sec toda. Pak Rangers befittingly responded. No loss on Pak side-1 (sic),"" he tweeted. The BSF statement said one of its troopers, Constable Gurnam Singh, was injured by a bullet. ""His condition is critical,"" it added. The constable is in a hospital in Jammu. BSF sources claimed they had intercepted radio chatter on the Pakistani side in which the Pakistan Rangers' Chak Saman post had reported that five of their men had been killed. They said the intense firing this morning after 9.30 followed the foiling of ""an audacious infiltration bid in the area of village Bobiyan of Hira Nagar sector in Jammu"" last evening. The BSF described its response as an ""aggressive offensive"". The BSF said it ""is on high alert all along the International Boundary and ready to foil any infiltration attempt"". The high alert was sounded in the wake of the September 18 killings of 19 Indian Army soldiers in Uri near the Line of Control and the September 29 ""surgical strikes"" the Indian Army claimed. The firing in Jammu is a sign of the cascading impact of that violence. But the BSF, which is under the Union home ministry, is not under the command of the army in the Jammu frontier though they maintain a close liaison. In times of hostilities in the past, the BSF has been placed under the command of the army. The Jammu frontier, which includes Sambha and Hiranagar sectors, saw intense shelling by both Pakistan and India on border outposts and villages in 2014. Villagers in India were evacuated then, as now. The entire frontier is not fenced because rivers run through the border from India to Pakistan. The region is mostly flat with tall elephant grass and rice paddies. IB alert The Intelligence Bureau has issued an alert saying six Lashkar terrorists, camping in Sukha Chak village in Pakistan, could cross over either through the Ujh river near Miniyari in Hiranagar sector or through Dinanagar sector in Punjab's Gurdaspur district."

58ff38d87be9e0420db2ea67,A day at the harbour,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161103/jsp/opinion/story_117017.jsp,2016-11-03,"Cinema, writing and photography come together, sometimes, to create for us the mysterious power of particular human faces. Through the experience of a face viewed, read about, shared and remembered, we may confront certain powerful emotions within ourselves - fears and desires that we could have scarcely managed, or dared, to put in words had the work not been done for us by others. For me, this has been the case with the faces of two extraordinary actors: Monica Vitti and Isabelle Huppert. Especially Vitti, as she appears in the early black-and-white films of Michelangelo Antonioni: L'avventura, La Notte, L'eclisse (The Adventure, The Night, The Eclipse, the Italian and English words attaching themselves somewhat differently to her face in each film), and then his journey into colour, The Red Desert (Il Deserto Rosso), all made in the early Sixties. On the one hand, there are the films - transcendently in the past, yet repeatedly watched (even stalked), fully or in fragments, in the vanished cinema-halls of my student years and now in the privacy of my home, thanks to YouTube and torrents. On the other hand, these films have haunted some of the writers and artists I follow: Coetzee (in Youth), Roni Horn and Anne Carson have made with Vitti's face, words and actions their own bodies of visual, fictional and poetic work, Horn having blurred the lines between image-making and writing with both Vitti and Huppert. Add to this what we, as viewers, readers and communicators, do with these primary and secondary materials, working them into our own and our friends' memories with our phones and laptops, making screenshots, putting clips and images on Instagram and Facebook, or as WhatsApp profile pictures, where they get interlaced with other images, usually photographs of 'real' people and places, or pages from books we happen to be reading, so that these faces become dramatis personae in our private image-repertoires and visual diaries. This is how their faces become our faces, their films become our films, our films become our friends' films, and how memory and art perform their secret ministries, through viewing and grabbing and thieving and sharing, and the subtitles and lines of poetry become parts of this work, as the faces pass into our fantasies and waking dreams, and, in turn, into other people's dreams and memories, into their perceptions of us. What a journey this is from the objectivity of photography towards the making of subjectivity and of complex emotions! This, for me, is the endless work of modernity, of our being both in time and out of time, the illicit and illegal devouring power of our eyes and our gadgets, and the transforming power of our minds and memories, at once acquisitive and generous, possessive and promiscuous, scrupulous and unscrupulous, restless, prodigious, and compulsively, compellingly and vitally useless. In her capacity for metaphysical boredom, what is Monica Vitti, as Antonioni captures her in these films, but the muse and presiding deity of the pointlessness of life itself, confounding the beautiful and the sublime, which Edmund Burke had wanted to keep so carefully apart? Three things were happening simultaneously in my life over the last weekend. I was watching Red Desert on my laptop, watching and making notes in preparation for a lecture on industrial photography. This was interrupted by a day trip I made by car with my friend and her daughter to Diamond Harbour, where, as a friend of my mother used to put it in her inimitable manner, the domestic help elopes with the driver, with tragic consequences. I was constantly making photographs, too, out of these two experiences and sharing them on Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp with friends and quasi-friends. And because of how these things were all happening in the interstices of one another, I woke up the next morning with this piece of writing going round and round in my head like an unforgettable dream. So I wrote it up, convinced that in the writing of it I would be able to grasp, if only for myself, the meaning of the life of certain images in the making of our selves in time. Once, on her way back home from a journalistic assignment, my friend had stopped briefly at a resort on Diamond Harbour. It was dusk, the place was deserted and the river was magical in the setting sun. So, that memory compelled her to take her daughter and me back to this resort for lunch on Saturday. We set out in her car in the morning, and by the time we reached, our nerves were wracked by the menace of the narrow road on which speeding buses and trucks kept coming at us as if with an intent to crush and kill. Children are free of the fear of death: her daughter first slept in the car and then played games on her mother's phone, unaware of the panic building up in us. We got there around noon. The sun was strong, the river dazzling and wide, but the people at the reception were unwelcoming towards visitors who came in small cars for the day and wouldn't let us walk or the child play on their lawns by the river. We tried the state-run tourist lodge next door. It looked desolate and sleazy, and was equally unwelcoming on hearing that we were not going to check in. We moved along to a hotel further down the road, where they were nicer at the desk with two dead clocks showing the time in London and New York. Their dining hall was walled off from any sort of view, so we persuaded them to lay a table for us in a passage with windows looking out on the lawn and a swimming pool at the back. We ate an overpriced and unremarkable lunch as the breeze blew in the stench of the fisheries nearby. The child quickly worked through her sandwiches and ran out to swing and slide. The hotel seemed deserted, but the light outside had turned golden, the rice was settling inside us, and the river shimmered just out of sight. We could have been in one of those silent towns in L'avventura, into which Vitti and her friend-turning-into-lover might have strayed flatly for a non-conversation and nothing else to do, a town through which empty trains pass from time to time. I took a picture on my phone of a bird with a long forked tail sitting absolutely still on a bare tree in the middle of a paddy field beyond the pool and whatsapped the photo to a friend in Milwaukee. She wrote back saying that it filled her with a yearning for the green-and-gold stillness of the afternoons of her childhood forty years ago, when they would stop at Diamond Harbour on the way to their ancestral village. At that time, there was just a dusty road, the river and the government lodge, then glittering and spruce. They would buy fish from the fishermen. On our way back, we were menaced again by the traffic and collapsed on our beds to sleep off the trauma of the journey and the anticlimax of the destination. After a strong cup of tea in the evening, I looked at the photograph of the bird again, and it reminded me of the villages in the illustrated Bengali books of my early years. It was always afternoon in those picture-book villages. My nerves were still a bit frayed, but already around that whatsapped and instagrammed image of the bird on the tree in the paddy field another memory of our day out had begun to form, at once cinema and photograph, fiction and truth - private, but made and relived with a number of other people. I sat down to watch Red Desert on my bed from where I had left off before setting out for Diamond Harbour. Monica Vitti is inside a shack on another harbour, suspended between land and sea, with her shallow friends, her cold and caring husband, and that tender-eyed visitor with his half-Italian and half-German name, played by Richard Harris. They are eating quail eggs, talking about aphrodisiacs, and trying to be lecherous. In the margins of the room, Vitti and Harris are quietly attracted to each other, held in an afternoon swirling with fog, into which a strange ship enters, sending out poops of alarm because of some medical emergency happening inside the vessel. That freezing red room, the people in which seem to be nervously on the brink of a stylish orgy, is also smouldering with an intricate web of wordless feeling. Antonioni makes us observe Vitti, her husband and their friends slowly and closely. But we are made to look at everything through Vitti's watchful and listless eyes as well. The camera records not only what is going on inside the room, but also an unspeakable story building up inside a supposedly sick woman's head. The director is pushing her friends, and us, towards a certain impatience with his heroine. We feel that we know what is wrong with this woman, but this knowledge keeps getting lost in the fog that gathers around her. She wants to be loved, to be desired, we tell ourselves, she wants attention - as her little boy does later in the film, when he pretends not to be able to use his legs to stand up and walk. He is his mother's rival in attention-seeking, and wants her to tell him a story. And the story that she does tell him becomes the lushly beautiful film within the film, about a girl on an island who spots a mysterious ship that seems to come towards her and then leaves her alone on her island. The child's malingering and his mother's storytelling - the film colludes with both to give us two opaque and interlocking accounts of what can only be shown and felt but never fully explained and understood, or diagnosed and cured. Perhaps Antonioni is showing us that we are all, sometimes beautifully but more often unregarded, caught between wanting everything and wishing not to want anything at all; caught, that is, between tutti and niente, two words that are used over and over again in the film. So we often end up doing to others what we fear would be done to us, pre-empting abandonment with abandonment. Harris and Vitti sense these twinned reflexes in each other inside the shack on the harbour, as the ships appear and disappear in the fog. The sickness of her fear of being left with nothing finds its mirror-image in his never-changing heart to leave without anything. As I watched Red Desert for the umpteenth time, I kept taking screen-shots and jotting down some of the subtitles. It occurred to me that some of the subtitles could make up a poem, which I called ""Foghorn"" at first, and then decided to call ""Via Alighieri"", after the poet, and the street in the film on which Vitti wants vaguely to set up a shop. Nothing in that poem was my own, of course: White forest/ In the red desert/ Nothing/ Everything/ Even the ashtrays./ Am I leaving you/ Or are you leaving me?/ I can't decide./ I never get enough./ Why do I always need other people?/ I don't know what to sell./ Does this ship take passengers?/ Will you be the same when I return?/ Will you be there when I return?/ I can never look for long at the sea/ And not lose interest in what happens on land."

Pictures by Snehamoy Chakraborty Purulia, Oct. 21: The Sabar community, the centrepiece of Mahasweta Devi's work, is not very well. Kajali Sabar and her husband Sarat make tea by boiling CTC tea leaves in water with salt. They cannot afford sugar. Kajali and Sarat live in Balakdih Sabar Tola, a village 36km from Purulia town. Around 12,000 Sabars live in Purulia's 164 Sabar tolas. The Sabars were never very well, the reason why Mahasweta Devi, the writer-activist who won the Magsaysay Award, stepped into their lives. British law had declared the Sabars a ""criminal"" tribe in 1872 and they had been ""decriminalised"" in independent India, but when Mahasweta Devi came in, they were still regarded as criminals, being arrested and tortured indiscriminately by police with a little help from other communities. Mahasweta Devi fought on behalf of the Sabars, questioning their ""criminality"", trying to lift them from utter poverty and alienation. They called her mother. At the Sabar Mela in Purulia in 1983, she was anointed ""Sabarer Ma"". She brought them hope - and livelihood. She began to market and sell their handicrafts. But it was short-lived. Her presence was withdrawn from their lives from the time she fell ill five or six years ago, and finally with her death this year on July 28. The Sabars are not picked up for every crime in the neighbourhood any more. But otherwise they are back to where Mahasweta Devi found them: utter poverty and alienation, nursing only a few habits picked up from their recent encounter with the world. Twenty years ago, a Sabar did not know tea. ""We saw people in nearby villages,"" says Sarat, in his late 50s, who makes his living by collecting wood from the forest. ""We can't afford sugar and wanting milk is pointless. We boil water with some tea and salt. It is our tea,"" says Kajali. Finding work is more difficult than finding milk. Says Mahadeb Sabar, a 60-year-old man who folded his hands in respect at the mention of Mahasweta Devi: ""When Ma came to us, we could earn about Rs 1,500 a week by selling our handicrafts. Now it is hard to earn Rs 400 a week from selling these."" In the absence of the projects Mahasweta Devi brought them, many Sabars are turning back to selling wood. This is not easy, as cutting trees is illegal without replantation, and Sabars are facing resistance from forest officials. In Bangthupi Sabar Tola, another Sabar village, Meghnad Sabar, a youth who passed Madhyamik in 2008, then stopped his education, became a labourer and married at 18. ""Two months in monsoon we work as farm labourers as all fields here are single-crop. The rest of the months we cut trees and sell in the markets in Kenda or Puncha blocks in Purulia. My daily income is about Rs 60,"" says Meghnad. ""We only eat once during the day,"" he says. The one proper meal they have is ""just phenabhat (starch rice) with salt"", he adds. Meghnad has a television set and a mobile phone, but neither works because he does not have the money to repair them. Mahasweta Devi, who had been visiting Jharkhand's Palamau tribal areas since the sixties, was introduced to the Sabars in the eighties by activist Gopi Ballabh Singh Deo, or ""Gopibabu"", a retired schoolteacher. Gopibabu, 82, who lives in Rajnowagarh village in Purulia, had already been working for the uplift of the Sabars for two decades. He founded the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti in 1968. The Sabars were ""decriminalised"" in 1952, but only in name. The police would allegedly conduct raids and torture them for every crime in their area. "" Ghorey ghumai murdhumsa, Chorey kate dhan. Jodi kaukey na pali to kheriya dhorey aan (The fat landlord sleeps and thieves cut off paddy from land. If no one can be caught, go catch a Sabar),"" the Sabars would say. The complaint that Sabars don't fit in persists, making it difficult for them to find work and even get state scheme benefits. Gopibabu is unable to speak because of his ill health. Prashanta Rakshit, the current director of the Paschim Banga Kheriya Sabar Kalyan Samiti, which has its head office in Rajnowagarh, says Gopibabu had acted as a shield for the tribe from the police, running from one place to another to protect the Sabars from the law-enforcers' torture. ""He is the pioneer of the movement for the Sabar tribe,"" says Rakshit. The 1983 Sabar Mela had been organised to bring together members of the tribe people on one platform so that they could fight together for their rights. Mahasweta Devi, who had already written Aranyer Adhikar (The rights of a forest), her novel on the tragic, brilliant life of Santhal leader Birsa Munda, was with them. Later she would write Byadhkanda (The book of the hunter), a historical novel about Kalketu, the founder of the Sabar tribe. It is a passionate appeal to preserve the Sabar world. ""It is not that the tragedy of our life ended as soon as our mother Mahasweta Devi promised to be with us,"" says Jaladhar Sabar, secretary of the Kheriya Sabar Samiti. As the tragedy of Chuni Kotal would prove soon. The first woman graduate among the Lodha Sabars, Chuni, who graduated in 1985, could not bear her harassment in the workplace, a cell made for the welfare of Sabars. She committed suicide in 1992. Mahasweta Devi had reported the incident to the police. ""But it was the beginning of a movement. Most important, we learnt to fight the police and the government,"" Jaladhar Sabar says. The custodial death of Budhon Soren in 1998 was another flashpoint. Budhon, from Akarhbaid village, was believed to have been beaten to death in police custody, but his death was shown as suicide. After the post-mortem, the Sabars kept his body at his home for further autopsy, tricking the police by burning a false pier. Mahasweta Devi filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court and a CBI probe was ordered. The case is still being heard. Mahasweta Devi marketed the Sabar handicrafts made traditionally with Kashi Ghas, leaves of date-palm trees and bamboo as far as she could in original ways. ""We began training camps. Within two years the Sabars, mainly women, started to make money. We used to buy handicrafts directly and our organisation sold it at different shops and fairs in Calcutta and Delhi,"" says Rakshit, who travelled with Mahasweta Devi to various countries. ""Didi (Mahasweta Devi) used to keep the handicrafts in her Calcutta home. She would tell visitors: 'I will give you an autograph if you buy one handicraft made by my Sabar daughters',"" Rakshit adds. Not that targeting Sabars ended following Mahasweta Devi's efforts. In 2003, Bhadra Sabar of Tilabani village under Boro police station was killed when villagers allegedly threw stones at him on charges of theft. The police and officials feel that a section of Sabar men were involved mainly in road robbery till one or two years ago. But as Jaladhar Sabar points out: ""The torture by the police has gone down. We will continue our fight to bring proper financial and social development to our people."" That is the big challenge. The Samiti gives legal help and still conducts training for Sabar people to make handicrafts and market these. But it is not enough. It is also clear that Mahasweta Devi's work model was not sustainable. Some other personalities who promised help have disappointed the Sabars. The Samiti members said that in the nineties, five schools opened in Sabar villages, but have closed down recently because of lack of funding. The villagers in Bangthupi and Akarhbaid said no teacher was willing to teach their children as no one can pay. Individuals and organisations who visited the Sabar villages because of Mahasweta Devi have left. Desperate, many Sabars ""upgraded"" their traditional practices into lucrative ones. Earlier the Sabars would make liquor from Mahua, but now they are using molasses and yeast to brew alcohol and sell it. In Bangthupi, a Class VI student was found making hooch in his house. This business makes his family more prosperous than others in the village. ""My left leg was cut off as it was burnt in an accident. I had no option other than selling hooch. I earn Rs 400 in three days,"" says Anil Sabar, the father of the Class VI student. Other Sabars are going the contemporary way: migrating. Sabar women have begun to go to Purulia to work as maids and a large number of young men are migrating to Gujarat, Mumbai or Bangalore to work as construction labourers. Kalyani Sabar from Balakdih village, who received handicrafts training for Mahasweta Devi's projects, has started working as a maid. She is happy. Kalyani is proud that she could spend Rs 4,000 on the last rites of her father and treat all villagers to lunch, comprising fish, chicken, vegetable curry and plenty of rice with aloo posto and chutney. ""I could afford the money only because I started work as a maid. I earn Rs 4,000 easily a month. My son Motilal works as a labourer in Purulia town,"" she says. At least 1,000 Sabar youths, mostly school dropouts, go to other states every year to work as construction labourers and return home with at least Rs 15,000 every four months or so. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has not been much of a help. Few job cards have been updated since 2008. ""I don't know how to get work under the scheme. No one calls us,"" says Uttor Sabar, 40. A district official from Purulia says the Sabar people had not been brought under the government project successfully because of their ""culture"". The Sabars, hunters and wood-gatheres, do not enjoy the kind of work possible under such a scheme, he adds. Same with government institutions. Sabars do not fit in. ""We have provided concrete houses to them under government schemes. Many of them are not concerned about bank accounts or documents, which we provided by going to their villages. We are trying to connect them with the mainstream with Aadhaar card facilities,"" says Ajay Sengupta, the block development officer of Puncha. One solution would be to give agricultural land, Rakshit feels. ""But it would take a special initiative from the government to provide agricultural land for a 'decriminalised' tribe like the Sabars."""

Picture by Animesh Sengupta From far, this one is like any other pandal. But, a closer look reveals the real mastery of the artisans, all from neighbouring Bengal. Comprising 11 members, the team from Egra in East Midnapore is now busy at Dhatkidih in Bistupur, giving finishing touches to the pandal that has been made from crushed rice husk. Known in the steel city for its attractive pandals, Sri Sri Durga Puja Committee, or the Thakkar Bappa Club as it is popularly known, has come up with yet another unique structure this year. ""The 50-feet pandal is of an imaginary temple. The structure is almost complete and will be handed over to the puja committee in the evening. We toiled really hard but are satisfied with the final look of the pandal,"" said chief artisan Kalaipado Pohera. Procured from farmers in Egra, the rice husk was crushed by the team before pasting them on sheets of thermocol. ""Over 600 kg of husk has been used for the pandal. Glue was uniformly applied on the thermocol for pasting the husk. Around 1,600 thermocol pieces, each measuring 3 feet x 1.5 feet with 15mm or 25mm thickness have been used to give the desired shape to the pandal,"" the 43-year-old artisan told The Telegraph. Over 240 pieces of 8feet x 4feet plywood have been used for hosting the thermocol, added Pohera, who has been making innovative and unique pandals for the past 22-years. ""Visitors will surely marvel at the pandal,"" he said as an after thought. A huge chandelier and lights along panels give gloss to the interiors. The grand look of the Puja betrays high spending, Rs 6 lakh, said sources. ""We paid Rs 8,000 to farmers for getting rice husk. The puja committee changed plans last minute and asked us for something unique,"" Pohera said, adding that they had stayed away from using any paint. This is the first time Pohera and his team are making a pandal out of rice husk. ""We have made pandals using different materials but the one here is a first for us. After all, we have to satisfy our customers."" Among the mediums Pohera's team has used to make pandals for the committee ever since it took over in 2006 are cement coat (2007), mat (2008) and coconut pulp (2012). They group will head for Bengal where it has made two pandals at Chandraban (Hooghly district) and Asansol, later on Thursday. Puja committee general secretary Sagar Mukhi said they were very happy with the work done by the Bengal artisans. ""Actually, we wanted to make a pandal with shards of broken glass. But the Kadma Rankini Mandir Puja Committee had made a similar pandal last year. We wanted to come up with something unique. This pandal will surely be one of the most attractive pandals in the city,"" he said. The idol, which has been made in Kadma, is scheduled to arrive Thursday evening after which it would be inaugurated by West Singhbhum BJP parliamentarian Laxman Gilua."

(Bhola Prasad) The wait has finally ended. Chhath, one of the biggest festivals of Jharkhand, got off to a joyful start in Jamshedpur on Friday with thousands of devotees getting ready to invoke the sun god. Considered to be one of the toughest festivals in Hindu religion with very strict rules to follow, Chhath is celebrated to offer thanks to the sun god and his consort, known as Chhath Maiya, for offering energy to the earth continuously and making the environment suitable for people to live. The first day of the four-day celebrations was marked by nahay-khay during which the vratis take a dip in the river, clean the house and have only one comprising rice and bottle gourd. These particular food items are consumed to purify the body before the actual rituals. Also, the wheat and rice to be used for prasad are cleaned and dried on this day. Nahay-khay will be followed by kharna on Saturday, when the devotees, mainly women of the households, will start fasting for 36 hours. They will offer their first arghya to the setting sun (sanjhiya) on Sunday evening. Fasting will come to an end with the second arghya to the rising sun (bihaniya) on Monday morning. ""It is a festival connected with purity and devotion to the sun god, who is considered as the source of life on this earth and regarded as a wish fulfiller. All preparations have been done and we started the rituals with a meal of lauki-bhat today (Friday),"" said Gayatri Devi of Baridih. Tripti Singh, a fitness trainer from Adityapur, said there were scientific reasons behind having bottle gourds on the first day of the festival. ""Firstly, it is a cold vegetable that does not let your body heat up. Secondly, vratis get their share of protein and carbohydrates from this meal that keep them going without being dehydrated for 36 hours,"" Singh added. East Singhbhum SSP Anoop T. Mathew issued a circular, restricting entry of heavy vehicles in Jamshedpur from 9am to 11pm on Saturday Also, all vehicles will be barred from entering the city from 9am on Sunday to 3pm on Monday."

Four decades ago, logging and theft of commercial timber and bamboo had denuded hills, depleted groundwaters and dried up streams around Nayagarh district, forcing people to migrate in droves, said Arjun Pradhan, 70, headman of Gunduribadi village. The crisis prompted the community to embark on a campaign to nurture their forest and restore the ecosystem, he said. ""What you see today as Nayagarh's democratic movement to sustain community forests resources and become self-reliant was born of necessity 40 years ago after six droughts in 10 years shattered its farm and forest-based livelihoods,"" Pradhan said. Today, the revitalised ecosystem provides water all year round, with a stream irrigating small farms even in mid-summer, when pond floors dry and crack in many parts of India. The conservation plan is so successful it has become a template for forestry across Odisha, Arjun Pradhan said. Now the tribal women who conserve the forest are fighting for legal ownership under India's 2006 Forest Rights Act (FRA) law, which recognises forest-dwellers' rights over their traditional lands and resources. Government data shows that between early 2008 and July 2016, out of a total 4.2 million claims for titles filed under the FRA, only 1.6 million, or a third, were awarded. Out of this figure, just 44,500 titles were given to communities or villages, out of a potential 170,000 villages. Progress in implementing the law has been slow as India, one of the world's fastest-growing economies, seeks land for industrial use and development projects, land experts said. Across Nayagarh, a total of 850 villages protect around 100,000 hectares (247,105 acres) of forestland. In 2015, Nayagarh's forest cover was 53 per cent of its total geographical area, more than twice that of India's 21.3 percent. In India, almost 150 million people in 170,000 villages live inside or on the fringes of forests, which they rely on for subsistence and income. There are just 27 households in Gunduribadi, owning barely a hectare (2.4 acres) of land each. But as rain falls on farms in the foothills of the village, it carries nutrient-rich humus from the forest, enriching the soil and adding to the bounty of crops and wild food. The soil is so packed with nutrients that each hectare provides around 6,500kg of rice each harvest, three times more than on farms near unprotected forests, locals say. The forest also provides a range of seasonal food for local families, as well as extra income from medicinal plants that can be sold at market. ""This forest is like an old friend that never fails to help us cope during droughts and bad crop years, saving us from starvation and (the need for) migration,"" Dami Nayak, a local woman aged 80, said. Another woman living in Gunduribadi, Janha Pradhan holds out a small harvest of sweet tuber, known locally as pichuli, which she collected on her morning patrol. For the 44-year-old widow on a meagre income, these wild yams are more nutritious than potatoes - and cost nothing. Such food is harvested carefully to nurture the forest. ""We never pull out the entire root but carefully cut out a portion and leave the remaining root beneath the soil to regrow,"" she said. The wild food includes bamboo shoots rich in protein, wild mushrooms, spine gourds and bean vines that proliferate on sturdy trees, as well as iron-rich spinach that wards off anaemia, a major health concern for rural women and children. While the women also obtain wood for fuel from the forest, they never chop the trees for firewood. ""On our morning patrol we break off dry branches and carry them home,"" said Kama Pradhan, 35. ""But we are selective, we know which species of wood does not give out harmful smoke."""

""But we are selective, we know which species of wood does not give out harmful smoke."" #Conservation is based on simple yet binding rules set by the village council, which permits villagers to collect dry shrub fuelwood, fodder and edible products sustainably, based on need. Felling trees needs permission, and taking axes into the forests is banned. Over the years, the plan has entailed sacrifices: as forests regenerated, goats were sold and banned for 10 years to stop them nibbling green shoots. The twice-daily meals of rice were cooked once to reduce fuelwood and let forests grow. A community policing system was introduced. Known as thengapali, it entails members of four families passing on the duty of forest patrol to four other families by placing sticks outside their homes at night. Gunduribadi's patrols say they are protecting benefits that are key to the future survival and wellbeing of the community. Despite protecting the forest with their lives - sometimes literally, when confrontations with gangs plundering timber or bamboo risk turning violent - most forest-dwelling communities lack legal recognition of land ownership. Activists say collective rights have been sidelined and that millions of forest-dwellers are still struggling with the complicated process of registering claims. They say that a 2015 law that outlines a framework for the use of compensatory afforestation funds shuts village councils out of the planning and implementation of afforestation. This will not only encourage the exploitation of community land, they say, but destroy the bio-diverse and climate-resilient forests that communities like Gunduribadi survive on."

58ff3d097be9e0420db2f008,Chhath at the crossroads,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161106/jsp/bihar/story_117672.jsp,2016-11-06,"Religiosity is on the streets. The roads are full of religious commerce. Crowd, an unmanageable crowd, overlapping the shops of various concerns, horn-blowing, smoke-emitting vehicles, packed plastic bags with items of religious rituals can be seen all over the streets. Interestingly, I noticed a thela that has chicken chilly written on it that has changed its business for some pious days and was now selling hawan samagri. Chhath geet (at times with DJ effect) played in the background. I could sense the sound of blowing horns and religious fervour entering my ears simultaneously. I found myself on a strange crossroads of tradition and modernity, religious spirituality and rituals, faith and commerce, Bhakti and bargain, Sun God and smoking vehicles depleting the ozone layer. I was compelled to interrogate and introspect, why we celebrate Chhath Puja? Whom do we worship? What is the procedure? Chhath is celebrated six days after Deepawali in the month of Karthik. It is a four-day procedure beginning from Nahay Khay. On this day the one who is to observe the fast usually takes a holy bath in a river, preferably in the Ganga or Kosi. After purification, they have boiled rice and water guard prepared in ghee and rock salt, once during the day. Manypeople use the Holy water of the Ganges to prepare the prasad. Next day is called Kharna. On this day, the person observing Chhath fasts for the whole day and eats once after sunset. The meal is that of kheer and puri. The purity measures are strictly taken care of. After this, they are set for a 36-hour fast. The third day is evening arghya. The person fasts for the whole day. The day is spent in preparing the offering of thekua, a sweet preparation of wheat flour, sugar and ghee. The preparation is arranged on bamboo baskets known as soop and daura. Other items in the basket include fruits, aarta made up of cotton, areca nut, clove, cardamom, turmeric, ginger etc. The person along with the family members goes to the bank of the river and offers arghya to the evening Sun. The prayer concludes the next day with offering of arghya to the morning Sun. The procedures take place while people present there sing the Chhath geet. These songs include the rituals, protocol, wishes and the prayers to the Sun God and Chhathi Mata. These songs are dedicated to Chhathi Mata as well as Sooraj (Sun) devta. The Sun is worshipped with the belief that it can heal many diseases. So, Chhath is observed toget an illness-free life. Moreover, the wishes are very material. The songs include the wishes for sons, daughters, their weddings and children. People pray for health as well as wealth and there is a direct prayer to the Sun God without any priestly intervention and mediation. There is no certainty regarding the history of this fast and also about who this Chhathi Mata is! Some people believe her to be the goddess of fertility whereas others think she is Shashthi Devi. But there is no authoritative record of the same. Many people observing this fast are unaware of any history or mythology of this but everyone tends to have faith inthis puja and also a belief that the wishes are fulfilled by observing this long fast. The God and the Goddess fulfil the wishes by being happy with the penitence. Purity and hygiene are of utmost importance in this puja. What is interesting is a strange amalgamation of the folk and the priestly. Some people trace it to the age of the Vedas; some trace it to the Ramayan whereas some think that the Mahabharat has the first reference to such a fast. But what is important is to notice its implication in the present. We are at an age and stage of globalisation where commerce is expanding internationally. Moreover, we are in a computer age of rationality and scientific temper. We are in a hurry to accept the new, the modern, the international and the multinational. In this race, there is always a threat of merging identities and thereby losing individual identities. This is a difficult situation where one wants to unburden oneself of the past in order to accept the new and at the same time mourn the loss with a sense of nostalgia. This feeling of nostalgia compels us to keep some reminiscence of the past in the form of a relic. I notice the same pattern in case of Chhath Puja, a ritual that takes place twice a year. There is no harm in following certain norms, observing a particular fast or having faith in a certain god but the problem lies in accepting it uncritically.This is the charm of a relic that one does not have to be critical of it. At times a sense of fear is instilled to keep the ritual going without much interrogation. This uncritical faith is termed Bhakti and thus the ritual gets repeated undisturbed by the passage of time. It is co-opted in the time we live in and that is what forms the crossroads. The puja appears to take place somewhere else for someone not among us. Theoretically, this is a worship of a very important element of nature but somehow the deification of this element makes it an alien phenomenon without a direct responsibility toward ecology. One tends to be particular about the ritualistic form of worship but this form of worship does not take any responsibility of ecological concern. One may feel proud of one's tradition that nature worship is alive even in rituals but one needs to be critical whether it is alive only in the form of a ritual. It is because of this uncritical faith that we find ourselves at the crossroads. Plastic bags pollute the environment whereas purity measures are strictly observed. The Sun God is worshipped and the number of patients with vitamin D deficiency is increasing remarkably. Pollution level is rising and so is insistence in the ritual. Should we not ask ourselves why doesnt our faith translate into an everyday behaviour? Why do we prefer four days of holiness? Most importantly why is nature worship not saving our nature? I think the answer to this relic form of Bhakti is a constantinterrogation. That might just help us to cross the crossroads."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Oct. 17: A PLFI area commander and eight members of his squad today shunned extremism in Ranchi, DGP D.K. Pandey using the surrender event to announce the department's plan to hire around 15,000 cops next year and augment infrastructure in the hinterland as part of the anti-rebel strategy. Area commander Lal Bihari Singh, alias Lalu, who carried a reward of Rs 2 lakh on his head, and his trusted lieutenant Jirga Lugun also handed over their .315 rifles and cartridges to the DGP in the presence of IG (operations) M.S. Bhatia during the event at the state police headquarters. The other seven rebels have been identified as Ganju Lugun, Birsa Lugun, Goma Lugun, Samu Lugun, Mitu Lugun, Sado Lugun and Achu Herenj - each carrying a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head and native of West Singhbhum. Police said Lalu and seven of his aides were aged between 18 and 22 years while Achu Herenj was only 15. ""You can see all of them are poor tribals. They were forced to take up arms at an age when they were unable to differentiate right and wrong,"" Pandey stressed. Most of them had joined the outfit three years ago under various compulsions. ""I was a Class V student in 2013, when PLFI area commander Amar Gudia had come to my village in Bandgaon. He threatened to eliminate my entire family if I did not join his fold,"" Herenj, youngest among the nine, said. A disillusioned Herenj, who was engaged in extortion, abduction and abuse of women, further said: ""I gradually realised our leaders talked about safeguarding the interests of the poor, but forcibly took away rice bags from PDS shops meant for BPL families. They didn't allow completion of any type of development work in remote villages."" IG Bhatia said the state police had scored a century in rebel surrenders. ""With today's surrenders, the total number of rebels who have given up arms so far has gone up to 108,"" he added. This year, 27 rebels have surrendered so far. Later, addressing the media, DGP Pandey said the police department would hire 15,000 personnel next year. The recruitment will be carried out to raise two women battalions, three IRB battalions and two PVTG battalions. Also, 2,500 ASIs and equal number of associate constables will be hired. Total 33 per cent of the jobs will be reserved for women. According to the DGP, the department have worked out extensive plans to improve basic amenities in remote areas, paving the way for mobile phone connectivity, banking services, apart from education and power supply. ""We have facilitated installation of 786 mobile phone towers in remote areas across the state. 125 such towers will soon provide 4G services, which will facilitate e-banking and ATM services in remote villages,"" he added."
58ff3f347be9e0420db2f239,Diplomacy blitz on summits,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161001/jsp/nation/story_111275.jsp,2016-10-01,"A jawan keeps guard from a bunker near the Pakistan border in Abdullian, southwest of Jammu,on Friday. (Reuters) New Delhi, Sept. 30: When national security adviser Ajit Doval spoke with his US counterpart Susan Rice on Wednesday night before India launched surgical strikes across the Line of Control, his focus wasn't limited to the impending attacks. For the Narendra Modi government, that conversation was equally critical to maintaining pressure on Islamabad after the strikes, in the lead-up to two key multilateral conclaves in Goa that New Delhi fears Pakistan may try to disrupt as payback. India's intense diplomatic campaign since just before Thursday morning's strikes is aimed largely at making it harder for Pakistan to use terrorist proxies for a major attack before the conclaves, two senior officials independently told The Telegraph. India's strategic establishment fears that Pakistan may try and force a deferment of the conclaves, which are together expected to witness the attendance of 10 heads of government or state and Myanmar foreign minister Aung San Suu Kyi. The Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) grouping and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) -- which consists of India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan -- are both to meet in Goa on October 15 and 16. A successful hosting of these summits by India days after effectively forcing a postponement of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit, scheduled for November in Islamabad, would intensify perceptions of Pakistan's growing isolation. Many Saarc members are also part of Bimstec. A major terror attack in India alone could force the deferment of the Goa summits. But such an attack would be difficult to go ahead with if the neighbourhood and the world's major nations lean on Pakistan to deescalate, officials here argued. The strategy appeared to be working this afternoon as Russia ---- whose President Vladimir Putin will hold annual summit talks with Prime Minister Modi in Goa next month apart from participating in the Brics meeting ---- today placed the onus on Pakistan to reduce tensions. And independently, Sri Lanka joined India, Bangladesh and Afghanistan in declaring it did not think ""the prevailing environment in the region"" was conducive for the Islamabad Saarc summit. ""Sri Lanka regrets that the prevailing environment in the region is not conducive for holding the 19th Saarc summit in Islamabad on 9th and 10th November, 2016,"" the country's foreign ministry said in a statement. ""Sri Lanka condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and stresses in this regard the need to deal with the issue of terrorism in the region in a decisive manner."" Nepal, the current Saarc chair, later in the evening formally postponed the summit but urged an early decision on fresh dates. It said that an ""indefinite"" postponement would hurt Saarc and asked ""the host"" ---- Pakistan --- to ensure a climate conducive for the summit. That Sri Lanka issued its statement after the announcement of the surgical strikes suggests that India has in its assessment insulated itself -- at least for now --- from global diplomatic criticism, though the major nations want a de-escalation of tensions in South Asia. Late in the evening, the Russian foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was ""concerned with the aggravation lately of the situation along the Line of Control between India and Pakistan"". The statement asked ""the parties"" to avoid any escalation of tensions but then made clear its principal message was aimed at Pakistan, to ensure it did not respond to the surgical strikes by allowing a terror attack on India. ""We stand for (a) decisive struggle against terrorism in all its manifestations,"" the statement said. ""We expect that the government of Pakistan should take effective steps in order to stop the activities of terrorist groups in the territory of the country."" Afghanistan's ambassador here, Shaida Mohammad Abdali, too has backed yesterday's cross-border strike. ""If terror groups exist without action, self-defence in the form of action we saw will continue,"" Abdali told journalists today. China was more balanced in its response, and said it was ""concerned about the tension and rivalry"" between India and Pakistan over the past few days. It said it had been in touch with both sides, ""urging them to exercise restraint"". Hours after the Indian army announced the surgical strikes yesterday, foreign secretary S. Jaishankar had met 25 foreign ambassadors and high commissioners --- from all the major nations and India's neighbourhood --- to brief them on the attack. India has argued that the strikes amount only to pre-emptive self-defence from specific terror attacks and were not aimed at challenging Pakistan's territorial integrity or sovereignty. India is also aware that among its friends, no one wields more influence over Pakistan than the US. Doval made it clear, during his conversation with Rice, that India was open to American assistance in prodding Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, specifically by curbing terror groups in the coming days and weeks, officials said. Keeping the US informed was important for a logistical reason too. A team of officials from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the US departments of state, homeland security and commerce were in New Delhi for the annual India-US cyber security dialogue, and it was important to assure Washington that India wasn't launching a military conflict. The US responded. America's ambassador to India, Richard Verma, who was in Washington, was asked to cancel his engagements there and rush back. A lecture on India-US ties that he was to deliver at the Woodrow Wilson Centre in Washington yesterday morning --- titled ""A Natural Alliance takes Shape"" --- was deferred due to ""unforeseen circumstances"", according to the organisers. Verma is now back in New Delhi. The co-chairs of the India Caucus in the US Senate, John Cornyn and Mark Warner, together wrote a letter to Prime Minister Modi after the strikes criticising ""Pakistan's use of terrorism as a pillar of its foreign policies towards Afghanistan and India"". The US state department too signalled to Pakistan, last evening Washington time, that it would not criticise India over the surgical strikes and that it expected Islamabad to combat terror groups on its soil. ""We've repeatedly expressed our concerns regarding the danger that terrorism poses to the region,"" state department spokesperson John Kirby said. ""And we all know that terrorism, in many ways, knows no border. We continue to urge actions to combat and delegitimise terrorist groups like LeT and the Haqqani Network, Jaish-e-Mohammad."" Kirby skirted questions whether India had informed the US about the strikes prior to their launch but did not deny the suggestion. After the Doval-Rice conversation, the White House had used almost the exact same words as Kirby to articulate its expectations from Pakistan. ""Ambassador Rice reiterated our expectation that Pakistan take effective action to combat and delegitimise United Nations-designated terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Muhammad and their affiliates,"" the White House had said. The words of support for India and the pressure on Pakistan to keep terror groups in check, articulated by the White House on Wednesday evening, have survived the surgical strikes."

Telegraph pictureAgartala, Oct. 9: Goddess Durga is worshipped as an incarnation of power. She also personifies love, affection, compassion and care. It is these qualities that inspire the more than a century-old Puja in the household of Bijay Debbarman, former chairman of Tripura Public Service Commission and deputy director-general of Archaeological Survey of India. ""The difference is in the appearance of the idols. Ma Durga stands with a benign smile and so do her children as if ready to shower love and compassion on devotees. The Mahishasura begs forgiveness from the Goddess with folded hands,"" said Debbarman at his residence in Krishna Nagar here. Unlike most other Pujas, there is no animal sacrifice. ""Since our Puja is celebrated in Vaishnavite style, we offer fruits, boiled rice and vegetable curry and rice to the Goddess. The rituals are performed strictly according to the scriptures,"" said Debbarman. He said his late grandfather Harachandra Debbarman started the Puja in 1899 when Radhakishore Manikya (1896-1909) was the king. The king himself came to visit our Puja, he recalled his father telling him. There was a gap in organising the Puja from 1912 to 1926. ""In 1927, my father Asit Debbarman, who was a doctor, restarted the Puja and it has been continuing till today,"" he said. He said the artisan who makes the idols at Durga Bari, makes them at his home as well. He said his sons will continue the Puja in his absence."

But in more modern times, it established itself as a famous trade and employment. Given its vast employment opportunities and trade activities, Lakshadweep was wholly depending on Mangaluru for its all requirements. However, now the trade between Lakshadweep and Old Port in Mangaluru has declined drastically. In the past, Mangaluru traders were exporting spices and coffee to Middle Eastern Countries, Africa and Mauritius through Old Port. The Old Port has a long history of being a commercial centre. There is a need to revive the past glory of the Old Port and fishing activities through Smart City Project, he stated.He said Mangaluru did not figure the first list of the Smart City Project as it failed to propose development based on a sector in the proposal. The revival of the Old Port and modernisation of fishing sector will also promote tourism in the region, he added.Lobo said the long-pending demand for a dedicated jetty for tourism and trade between Mangalore and Lakshadweep will soon be fulfilled with the state government and Lakshwadeep administration signing a memorandum of understanding. This will revive the trade relations with Mangaluru city. The jetty, to be constructed on the northern side of the Old Port in Bunder, will facilitate both tourists and traders who will export commodities to the island Union territory. The blue print of the project is ready. Lakshadweep administration will invest Rs 70 crore for the project. Apart from this, the Lakshadweep administration will take up dredging by six metre depth from estuary to the northern side of the Old Port, which in turn will help the fishermen in anchoring their boats in the Wharf, he noted."

The funds, being sanctioned by the government towards the repair of government school buildings, is too meagre, she added.Chaitrashri exhorted Chinnaswamy to bring the woes to the notice of the government and impress upon the authorities towards increasing the annual grants to address the problems faced at many levels.Chaitrashri, who also brought to the commissions notice that the maintenance grants for school buildings is also proving less, rued that the prevailing drought has worsened the situation. The deputy commissioner is directing the authorities to sink borewells at required places, utilising calamity relief fund. The government should declare support price for arecanut and onion crops, and develop roads in Malnad region, she added.She said earlier 30 kg of rice per month was being provided to eligible ration card holders. But it has now been reduced to 3 kpg.The newly introduced coupon system to avail ration under Public Distribution System (PDS) has caused more troubles than relief. Bhagyalakshmi bonds are not distributed in a regular manner, she stated.Honorarium hike soughtThe honorarium of Zilla and Gram Panchayat members should be revised, she demanded. Executive Officer of Tarikere Taluk Panchayat Gangadhar Murthy said the Panchayat can explore its commercial avenues by buiilding a commercial complex of 20 shops on the available space. It will ensure regular income to the local body, he added.The funds towards the maintenace of anganwadis and school buildings is inadequate, so also drinking water supply. The Panchayat is also finding it difficult to pay daily wagers as per the wages fixed by Labour Department, he said.Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R Ragapriya said the lack of staffers in Zilla Panchayat, Women and Child Development Department and also Education Department increased the work pressure on the employees. Such is the situation that, some of the officials lack information on Multi-village scheme and also professional skills. Such shortcomings should be addressed by starting a separate department, she demanded.At some places, there is a need to build residential quarters to accommodate district- and taluk-level officials, she said.In his address, Chinnaswamy said, even though there has been an increase in central grants up to 50%, the problems faced by the districts are also on upward mode. Owing to lack of rainfall, livestock are facing drinking water related problems.Chikkamagaluru and Hassan districts that come under Malnad region need special grants to take up road development works, he added.Chinaswamy suggested the Panchayat authorities to submit their grievances in the form of questionnaire to the Commission.Commission Member H D Amarnathan said a decision on collecting taxes in industrial areas will be taken after due consultation with Zilla Panchayat chief executive officer.He also informed the meeting that Central government is the decision-making authority and there is no provision to relax it."

The occasion is also marked by a thanksgiving mass for the blessing of a good harvest.As a tradition, the first corn from the field is brought to the altar in a procession and is blessed by the priest. The offertory procession included the statue of Mother Mary, sugarcane, vegetables, flowers, fruits and bread. The blessed ears of paddy corn and sugarcanes are then taken home by the people.In preparation to the feast, children bring flowers arranged in trays, and baskets to their respective churches and offer them to Mother Mary on the nine days preceding the feast.Hundreds of children had brought flowers from far away places to their respective churches in the coastal districts on Thursday morning. Although it was drizzling on Wednesday, the weather was pleasant on Thursday.Most of the parishes had arranged for distribution of sugarcane to children who had brought flowers to offer to Mary, while some distributed sweets. Some other parishes also distributed blessed payasam, in which the de-husked corns were powdered and mixed.As a part of celebrations, parishioners donated rice, vegetables and coconuts, among other things, and the same was distributed to the poor, besides to old age homes and orphanages, in the parish.Get togetherTraditionally, the feast was celebrated as a family function, with a ceremonial lunch, in which only vegetarian food was served. Up to 13 varieties of vegetarian dishes (usually only odd numbers) were prepared in such feasts. Now, however, a majority of the families limit the number of dishes to five to seven, but Catholics still avoid meat and alcohol on the day.The day is also an occasion for all the family members to unite. It is a convention that, if any member of the family cannot attend the celebrations, then the ear of paddy corn will be sent to him or her by post to faraway places like West Asian countries, US and Europe.As per tradition, after de-husking the corn and getting it blessed in the church, it is powdered and mixed with a dish made out of coconut milk and rice batter, and is partaken along with the lunch."

The mood was not as upbeat in Madurai and nearby areas, the hotbed of the bull taming sport, as joy following a Central government notification allowing it was short-lived due to the January 12 Apex Court ban staying Jallikattu and other sports involving the bovine.Joy had given way to anxiety following the ban with sport enthusiasts protesting in various parts of Madurai and nearby districts like Theni today.They also staged demonstrations with their bulls in tow even as police disallowed such protests. Yesterday, some people in these areas had tonsured their heads and blocked roads, demanding for the sport to be held.Social platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook were agog with messages on opinions for and against holding the sport.Prior to its ban by the UPA dispensation in 2011, Jallikattu was organised as a grand spectacle with the event in Alanganallur, Palamedu and Avaniyapuram in Madurai drawing huge crowds, including domestic and foreign audiences.Pongal also has its other share of politics, with arch-rivals DMK and AIADMK differing over celebrating the day as Tamil New Year.While the new year is traditionally celebrated in the Tamil month of 'Chithirai' (April), the M Karunanidhi-led DMK government revised the calendar in 2008 to celebrate it coinciding with Pongal, the first day of 'Thai' (January).However, Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa, who had opposed the move even as Opposition Leader then, reverted the celebtaring the festival in April soon after her party captured power in 2011.While the AIADMK chief refused to celebrate Tamil New year in January till DMK was defeated, her arch-rival however stuck to celebrating the first day of Thai as Tamil New Year and Pongal.Governor K Rosaiah, Jayalalithaa, Karunanidhi and other leaders also extended greetings to the people on Pongal."

If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued.People are dying  and you want to maintain cricket pitches, asked an over-excited TV anchor. But not as morally excited as the learned justices of the Bombay High Court who opined, as quoted in the media, that this entire thing of the utilisation of water for IPL matches needs to be thought over. The court also apparently asked the BCCI counsel whether cricket matches were more important than people or preserving water. An important question.Watch Video: Discussing The IPL Water ControversyThe first response to this question, especially by immoral thinking economists as well as those with a modicum of common sense, is to ask a related question  what alternative use is there for water, and what is its price? In the desert, water is worth a lot; and it is also worth a considerable amount in drought-prone areas. An average person consumes 150 litres of water per day or 54,000 litres per year. Assume that a sixth of the population of Maharashtra (around 20 million) has no access to any water for half a year  that is, Maharashtra needs to supply (transport) to the drought areas 540 billion litres of water. The IPL matches in Maharashtra are estimated to use six million litres of water for watering the grounds. But that is an estimate of a corrupt capitalist (and therefore, dishonest) BCCI  so let us double the stated amount. So the honourable justices, and the oh-so-moral NGO Loksatta Movement that brought the PIL against IPL, and our learned TV tripping (as in TRP) anchors believe that saving .002 per cent of water will alleviate the water misery of 20 million people. It is not for nothing that my column is called No Proof Required  moving the IPL will only provide water for 400 people for half a year.The Financial Express editorial, IPL vs Sugarcane (April 8) illustrates the utter stupidity of the position that fewer cricket matches in Maharashtra will solve the water shortage problem. If policymakers were serious about alleviating water shortages for the poor, they would first have to blame themselves for the stupidity, if not depravity, of the policies they have pursued. In particular, look at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. Maharashtra encourages the growing of sugarcane: In 2014-15, the estimated sugar output from Maharashtra was 10 billion kgs. Each kg of sugar uses 2,000 litres of water. In other words, the total water used for sugarcane cropping in the state was 20 trillion litres. You do the math. As the FE editorial hints, the savings from not having the IPL matches are not even a minuscule fraction of the water used by the sugarcane growers in Maharashtra. By creating a moral song and dance about the IPL, the immoral elite only proves to the world that it is intellectually dead.Neither drought nor poverty is new to Maharashtra. First and foremost, the responsibility of delivering the much-needed water to all its citizens (and not just the wealthy) lies with the state administration. What was the BJP in Maharashtra, in particular Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, doing for the past two years? Of course, doing nothing except banning beef and moralising about the need to say Bharat Mata ki Jai everywhere. What could have Fadnavis done? And, given that he has not done it, what can he do now? Basic water needs of humans (150 litres a day) can easily be transported to the drought-hit areas on a daily basis and expenses paid from all the taxes collected by the state. Then what is the problem? And why hasnt this solution been offered, and used as yet?The (non) agricultural policy of the Centre has distorted the food market for decades. The Punjab economy is in a mess because of too much rice production in the state. The Maharashtra economy is in a mess because of the production of too much sugarcane. According to the counsel for the trendsetting Loksatta Movement, the BCCI and the IPL have the means and resources to shift matches out of Maharashtra but the state government does not have the means, and/or the political desire, to transport water to its poor drought-hit citizens?The IPL-versus-water controversy raises a lot of non-sequitur issues, especially the contention that morality has anything to do with it. The need of the hour is to conserve water, and herewith some people who should be honoured for suggesting (moral) rules for water conservation. The top prize goes to Moralist # 1, Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, who has recently banned the sale and consumption of all alcohol (except foreign-made liquor) in Bihar. Note how far-sighted and water-saving this policy is. No beer will be sold, so less toilet water needed for flushing beer-induced piss.Moralist # 2 award goes to the ever- thoughtful and far-sighted Pahlaj Nihalani, the man in charge of the Central Board of Film Certification of India. Sensitive to the IPL-versus-drought conflict, he recently gave a U/A rating to The Jungle Book, a remake of a childrens film. The U/A rating means that children below the age of 12 have to be accompanied by an adult. His reason for the U/A rating (and I am not making this up) was that the 3D effects were too scary for children sitting alone. Note how very subtly Nihalani is helping the water cause. Fewer children screaming means less water is needed to calm them down afterwards, and this saved water can be directed to the Maharashtra farmers via the BCCI headquarters and the Bombay High Court, both of which are located in Mumbai.Herewith are some other Nitish-Nihalani (NN, which can also stand for No and No) type sensible policies to help lessen the need for water, and help farmers and ordinary people in the drought-hit areas of Maharashtra (and elsewhere):Recommended Policy # 1: Stop asking people to say Bharat Mata ki Jai. Think about it  500 million people not saying Bharat Mata ki Jai on a daily basis will save enough water, through reduced thirst, to flood Latur.Recommended Policy # 2 (which is not only recommended but practised in Fadnavis-land): Maharashtrians were asked to have a muted Holi celebration to save water. Of course, if Holi were not a Hindu festival, Holi would have been banned.Recommended Policy # 3: Fadnavis could help the poor citizens of his state, and improve governance if he removed the ban on the slaughter of old cows (above 16 years of age). Water consumption will go down. Although, as a Supreme Court (2005) judgment noted, doing so would mean that manure production will also go down  this was the primary reason why the honourable court banned the killing of all cows.Some questions remain: Why did the honourable court not throw out the morally juvenile petition of Loksatta? And why the argument that the IPL should pay for drought relief? What sense does that make?

From my side, I will raise voice about the problems of the district in the Parliament. All problems are highly visible - drinking water, lack of rural development, no facilities for farmer etc. How long will you kep on waiting for development? Is your throat not gone dry by drinking fluoride water? she asked.She charged that the government has committed a number of irregularities in the name of Yettinahole project. The irregularity in purchasing pipelines for the project runs into thosands of crores, she criticised.Karandlaje said the government has not ensured proper distribution of river water.She also criticised that the Congress-led state government has done injustice to the people by halting Bhagyalakshmi scheme meant for girls and incentive for milk production.The MP said the government which ambitious started the Annabhagya and gave 30 kg rice to poor has now limited it to only 3 kg. But the Union government is purchasing 1,67,000 metric tonnes of rice at 32 per kg and providing it to the state at Rs 3 per kg.Similarly, it is buying wheat 57,000 metric tonnes of wheat at Rs 22 per kg and giving to the state at Rs 2 per kg. All this foodgrain is going to other states illegally due to corrupt officials, she claimed.She said the Union government has provided Rs 1,520 crore for drought relief compensation. The state government should have added its share to this and provided compensation to the farmers affect ed by drought. But it has not done anything. The state government is not utilising the grants released by the Centre for rural development properly. Only a probe would unearth the truth, she remarked.Karandlaje said the then UPA government did not help her when she was the energy minister in the state. It did not even give us coal. We purchased electricity from other states and solved the problem. Now, the Centre itself has officially announced that the states can purchase power by paying the minimum amount. But the government is not ready to buy power. The farmers are suffering due to lack of will of the government, she criticised.She called upon the party workers to inform the common people about the governments indifferent attitude towards women, SC/STs and minorities.Minorities Morcha State President Abdul Azeem said the Congress is propagating among the minorities that BJP is a communal party. But the Yeddyurappa government worked for the welfare of all people, he praised.Begaluru Central MP P C Mohan predicted that BJP would come to power after the next Legislative Assembly election under the leadership of B S Yeddyurappa.Mohan called upon the party workers to work for the victory of the party.The BJP leaders handed over the party flag to the taluk BJP President B C Nandeesh on the occasion.MLC Veeraiah, District BJP President Dr Manjunath, Mahila Morcha President Jyothireddy and others were present on the occasion."

The residents can put their bio-degradable waste  including leftover rice  into the pipe installed for the purpose, along with soil to cover the layer.The residents have to dig three pits of one-and-a-half feet depth each  into one of which, the pipe should be inserted vertically. Initially, a solution of cow-dung and one-kg jaggery should be poured into the pipe, before putting bio-degradable waste such as vegetable waste, fish waste, and leftover food items into the pipe on a daily basis. The solution of cow-dung and jaggery helps in expediting the bacterial decomposition process. The pipe is to be filled with the waste in a month, and should be kept undisturbed for another 45 days.In the mean time, the household wastes can be filled into the second pipe. By the time the second pipe is filled, the first one can be taken out to clear the decomposed waste  which is an excellent manure  and third pipe can be used for filling the waste. As a result, manure can be generated throughout the year.Dry waste, however, is not generated daily at home. It can be disposed of once a week or once in 15 days.The pipe compost system is already popular in Kerala and is being implemented in Dakshina Kannada district as well.Clearing wasteUdupi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer Priyanka Mary Francis, who hails from Kerala, has already installed pipe composting method in her residence in Udupi and has been preparing manure.Waste disposal is a major challenge in urban areas, including Bengaluru. Without proper waste collection system in rural areas, the waste gets dumped beside the roads and vacant places. First, we should keep aside the notion that the garbage should be disposed effectively by the local bodies. We should try to get profit from the garbage generated at home. The demonstration on pipe composting has already been taken up at various gram panchayats in the district. Even the schools are being motivated through demonstration, said the official.She said there is a good response from the public wherever the demonstrations are conducted."

The farmers are distressed and finding it hard to cope with the situation and the debt has become an integral part of their lives. They do not have any other alternative than taking loans in case of crop loss, he claimed.Nayak said about 1,000 case of farmers suicide have been reported in the State.It is very disheartening and scary. If the issue is not addressed immediately, there may be a threat of mass suicide cases of farmers. Farmers have failed to pay back the loans they have availed and cooperative societies too are creating havoc in farmers lives, he observed.Earlier, inaugurating the programme, Kaniyur mutt seer Sri Vidyavallabha Theertha Swami said agriculture is facing severe drought in terms of manpower and financial aid. Youth are migrating to urban areas. Scarcity of labourers is haunting the occupation which is the main source of countrys GDP, he said.The seer said people behave ignorantly over struggles of farmers to grow paddy and other foodgrains.

Janardhana Poojary of the ruling party is pointing out that not many ministers in the Cabinet are capable.Former chief minister S M Krishna is also unhappy about the functioning of the government.CM thick-skinnedMLA K Venkatesh, during a public meeting, urged the chief minister to follow in the footsteps of former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, regarding the development. But, the government and the chief minister have turned thick-skinned and are not even responding to the protests by the opposition parties.People are watching. The Assembly bypolls are just a beginning. So, the BJP is hoping to get a majority in at least 15 districts in the Zilla and Taluk Panchayat elections. When BJP was in power in the State, it had a majority in 13 districts, he said.Describing the government as dormant, Puttaswamy said that Siddaramaiah was content with the launch of Anna Bhagya, which is mostly funded by the Centre.Siddaramaiah is taking credit for Central government scheme. The Centre is procuring rice at a cost of Rs 32 per kg and is providing it at Rs 3 per kg to the State government. Siddaramaiah is not even worried about how it is being implemented and its scams. In Karnataka, there are 1.34 crore families, out of which over a crore families possess BPL cards. Most of the BPL cards are deposited in the fair price shops and the rice meant for the poor are transacted only on paper and thus, misused by rice mill owners. The same rice comes into rotation in several cycles, generating huge funds for rice mill owners and middlemen, he said.The BJP government appointed PDOs (Panchayat Development Officer) for Gram Panchayats and provided 50 per cent reservations for women in the rural local bodies. Under Suvarna Grama Scheme, works on roads, lakes and temples were taken up. The GPs were strengthened with enhanced funds allocations. To help farmers in distress, loans were advanced to farmers at three per cent interest rate, for the first time in India. Crop loans worth Rs 3,600 crore were waived at one go. Under Suvarna Bhoomi scheme, Rs 10,000 seed money was provided to small farmers to initiate farm activities every year. Now, the Congress government has discontinued all pro-people programmes initiated by the BJP, but claims that it is the saviour of rural people in the wake of the ZP and TP polls, he said.S R Gopal Rao, Dattareya Shinde, Rajkumar and Venkataramana Shetty were present."

But, this year, the production of the nuts has increased while the price slumped due to the huge influx of coconut from South Asia and Southeast Asian nations, leaving the local farmers in trouble.According to the Horticulture department, the demand for coconuts has come down due to globalisation. It may be mentioned that large quantities of coconuts from Karnataka and Kerala are transported to North, especially Rajasthan for bakery products and others.Speaking to Deccan Herald, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene secretary Badagalapura Nagendra said, Due to globalisation, coconuts grown in other countries are being imported. Companies manufacturing coconut products are importing coconuts in large numbers from foreign countries.Change in lifestyle has also affected the demand for coconut oil, as it is believed that consuming coconut oil is harmful for health. Many people have shunned using fresh coconuts in food. Pure coconut oil has been replaced by other hair oils from multi-national companies.Coconut crop, grown on 25,250 hectares, last year, has increased to 25,700 hectare, this year. In addition, 60,000 coconut saplings have been distributed under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, say officials.Neera productionFarmers organisations have been seeking permission for Neera production, which has not been considered by the government so far. Kerala government has already permitted the growers there to tap Neera from the palms, Nagendra said.CFTRI offers technologyCentral Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) and Defence Food Research Laboratory in the city have tested and developed various processed products using coconuts. With CFTRI experts ready for the transfer of technologies (TOT), the farmers may contact experts and make use of the technology. Here are a few products that have been developed by the CFTRI:Virgin coconut oil: Virgin coconut oil is rich in lauric fatty acid and contains vitamin E. It has long shelf life compared to other vegetable oils, due to its anti-oxidant properties. It is used as a hair conditioner. It is also rich in magnesium, potassium calcium and iron, and prevents fungus and bacterial infection.Instant coconut rice mix: This is a ready to reconstitute spiced mix having coconut and rice flakes as major ingredients.Instant filling powder: Filling powder is a ready to reconstitute coconut-based product that can be used as a stuffing in many traditional sweet preparations.Coconut bites: It is a ready-to-eat snack having the characteristic flavour of fresh coconut. Variations in the taste can be made by using different flavours during product preparation.Other products are coconut milk powder, which can be used for sweet preparations in place of raw coconuts; coconut cheese, coconut paste, which can be used as a spread for sandwich, chapathi, dosas and others.For technology transfer and details, contact 0821-2514534, or visit www.cftri.com."

Officials and the contractors have been siphoning off the grants released by the government for the welfare of students, he said.The MLA said that the officials of the department were creating fictitious bills for purchase of eggs and fruits, whereas the children at the hostels are being served substandard food. They have joined hands with contractors in looting public money.However, the Joint Director of Social Welfare department, Dr Nagarajappa, said that the tendering process for supplies to hostels is conducted in Bengaluru and that he was no way concerned with the contractors.Enraged by his reply, Prakash said that he very well knew who the contractor was. I will expose you if you talk more. The tender for supply of food grains to hostels in the district has been awarded to NCCF and Krishna Traders. But, some people have illegally obtained the sub-contract and are providing supplies to the hostels. This sub-contractor is your relative, the MLA told the officer.Nagarajappa replied that it had become a routine to level allegations against officers in the district. He said that he was ready to face any punishment if the charges levelled by the MLA were established.On verge of closureIntervening in the discussion, another MLA S N Narayanaswamy said alleged large-scale irregularities in the hostels run by Social Welfare department. He said that children at the hostels were not being provided food even though it had been a month since they started functioning.There is neither cooking gas nor vegetables. Because of this lacuna, students are not coming to hostels. Hostels are on the verge of closure due to lack of students, the MLA added.Students plightHe said that moved by the plight of students he had purchased 10 sacks of rice for some hostels and appealed the contractors not to make money by snatching the food of children.A kilo of ragi costs Rs 20 in the open market. Similarly, an egg is sold at Rs 5 and tur dal at Rs 200 per kilo. But, the contractor, in the tender document, claims to supply ragi and tur dal at Rs 13 and Rs 113 per kilo respectively and an egg at Rs 3. Is it possible to supply these items at the prices which are 50% less than their market prices, he wanted to know.Taluk Panchayat president M Anjinappa alleged large-scale irregularities in purchase of beds, bedsheets, mosquito curtains and utensils for hostels. Officials have released funds for fictitious bills and the items mentioned in the bills have not been purchased at all. He said the fraud came to light during his recent visit to the hostels in Begli Hosahalli and Kembodi.DC visited hostelsVarthur Prakash, who intervened, said that the deputy commissioner too had visited the hostels and detected irregularities in the hostels. But, he has no courage to take action against the persons involved. How much time do you need to initiate action against people involved in this scam, he questioned.Zilla Panchayat member Shaheed Ahmed said that while only three-four students stay at the hostel in Andersonpet, the records maintained at the hostel put the number of students at 150.Lok Sabha member K H Muniyappa suggested that Zilla Panchayat members, municipal president and legislators should regularly visit the hostels in their constituencies.Meanwhile, Zilla Panchayat members R Narayanaswamy, Srinivas, Mahesh and Ashwini complained that the planning director was not considering their opinion while formulating action plan for development projects. They claimed that a proposal has been submitted to the government for developing such roads, the work on which has already been completed and bills paid. They demanded transfer of long-serving officials at the Zilla Panchayat.Zilla Panchayat president Geetha, vice-president Yashoda, legislator G Manjunath, Deputy Commissioner Dr K V Trilok Chandra and others were present at the meeting."

Born and raised in an agricultural family of Chitradurga, he has been growing traditional varieties of rice and millets since 1992. When he started out, he had no experience in marketing organic products. He came to Bengaluru along with friends in 1996 and tried to sell Gandhasale at Lalbagh, but people thought the rice old stock as it is an unpolished variety. Theertha came up with an idea to prepare the porridge. He made small pouches of the rice priced at Rs 10 each. After trying it, people appreciated the superior grade of the rice. Demand for the rice increased and the price, initially Rs 30 per kg, escalated to Rs 100 per kg. Teertha by now had learnt how to market his millets.Teertha has worked to preserve endangered varieties of paddy and participated in rice melas to exhibit his produce. He cultivates pulses using organic methods in his eight-acre farm in Bhadravati and 40-acre land in Chitradurga. The rice and millets, dehusked in mills, are packed for marketing at the home-based industry near Shivamogga.He said his family believed in the exclusive cultivation of rice and other pulses which form a major part of our diet. The paddy fields of his family stretched across 400 acres but barely a quarter of it remains now, as most of the land has been acquired for Bhadra reservoir. My father believed that agricultural land should be like a plate of meal where a large portion is for rice and a small portion for side dishes and betel nuts. I have been following the same till date, Ishwaran said. He has also authored a book on the significance of millets.An innovative cook himself, he has come up with new dishes prepared by millets, the number of which, crosses 50. The popular ones are: little millet laddu, kodo millet kesaribath, aralu hittu panaka, millet murukku, lavanga (clove) rice, millet mysuru pak, ragi sharbat and green chilly juice. He also invented ennegayi mix, tambli mix, horsegram kattu powder and holige mix which are a favourite with homemakers."

Be it making crib, decorating roofs/apartments with Christmas stars or making Kuswar (the traditional sweets made during Christmas season which include Nevryo, Kideo, Gulio, Kokkisan, Rice Laddu, Tukdi and of course, cakes), every Catholic family was busy in one or the other way.Many well-known bakeries made a brisk business and a number of shop owners had set up temporary bakeries (with shamiyana covering on top) by the roadside in many places in the city.Modernisation has dampened the spirit of many families as they have preferred to purchase the Kuswar items from bakeries than preparing them at home. Many bakeries sold gift packs ranging between Rs 300 and Rs 500.As a part of tradition, many Christians also exchanged the Kuswar with their brethren and distributed among the non-Christians."

The city has a dozen colleges that offer professional courses. It is turning into a fertile ground for knowledge-based industries.The state-run institutions in Kalpataru Nadu, however, have failed to provide quality higher education to the students belonging to economically backward classes. A few government schools and colleges are woefully short on infrastructure and quality of education.Empress Girls High School, a century-old institution, lacks classrooms. The institution, which offers high school and college education to the girls, is finding it tough to run both school and college education because of shortage of classrooms.The Empress College offers courses in Arts, Commerce and Science and it has to make do with just seven classrooms. The college has a good student strength and it needs at least 18 classrooms.Due to lack of classrooms, the college management has no option but to vacate the classrooms by 11 am when the school starts.The college development monitoring committee has not bothered to augment infrastructure in the college. The president of the committee City MLA should take necessary measure to improve the infrastructure of the century-old college, urge the lecturers of the college.I had given representations to the authorities concerned for adding classrooms to the college.The government had sanctioned Rs 1 crore for the development of the college and high school as part of centenary celebrations but joint director of the department Nagaraj didn't release the funds. Repeated pleas to the MP and MLA failed to elicit any response, laments Marulaiah, retired principal of Empress College.The students are made to cough Rs 70,000 to Rs 1 lakh as course fee for UG courses in private colleges.The students belonging to backward classes and those from the rural background cannot afford to pay such hefty fee and they depend on state-run colleges for their higher education. But they are being denied quality education due to the apathy of the officials and elected representatives, a lecturer on condition of anonymity told Deccan Herald.The story of Tumkur University Arts College is no different either. The classes for Arts and Commerce courses are taken in shifts due to lack of classrooms.With only seven classrooms available, the classes for Arts courses start as early as 8 am while Commerce classes begin at 12.30 pm. Spare a thought for the students who travel from rural areas.The tale of Government ITI College in the city is even worse. The college is being run from an abandoned rice mill.The government has sanctioned funds for the construction of college but it has yet to identify the land for the same.The college has a strength of over 400 students who were forced to sit in a godown under the sheets braving the scorching heat.How can you expect them to focus on the lessons or practicles, questions a teacher.Higher Education minister, who hails from the district, keep talking about setting up of a university for vocational skills training but he does not care to provide a suitable place for the Government ITI College, said S Raghavendra, CPM city unit president."
5903a68d7be9e02646bd6a90,India devises quick action plan to counter Pak attack,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/575292/india-devises-quick-action-plan.html,2016-10-11,"India devises quick action plan to counter Pak attackShekhar Iyer New Delhi, Oct 12, 2016, DHNS 1:10 ISTSpeed, skill and surprise is the formulaIndia is bracing for big retaliatory actions on orders from the deep state in Pakistan as a retribution for the Indian Armys surgical strike across the Line of Control on September 28-29, a top security official has said.Not just a step-up in the militant activity, as seen in Jammu and Kashmir in the past few days, but larger doses of fresh impetus for re-energising the separatist movement in the Valley and attacks on high-profile targets that show India is still vulnerable.But New Delhi expects that Islamabad, too, will have to factor in the cost of retaliation after what the Indian Army did to smash terrorist hideouts across the LoC and break the cycle of terror, the official told DH.Any misadventure by Pakistan-trained elements, he warned, will invite more devastating counter-strikes from India than hitherto. The top official spoke on the condition that he should not be named because of his sensitive role.Asked about the much-feared possibility of a nuclear strike by Pakistan, the official said, It may have the capability but it does not have the capacity to manage the cost of fallout after exercising that option. It wont do anything as stupid  because such an act will annihilate its very existence.Not just India, even other powers may not let Pakistan get away after exercising the option of first use.An assessment within the Indian security establishment is that Pakistan will attempt to retaliate through terror strikes that target high-profile persons and most visible Indian symbols and institutions even as citizens in its own country are questioning the wisdom of engaging terrorism as a tool against India, he said.The official said: We have devised a three-S formula to respond to any eventuality or threat originating from across the border. Speed, Skill and Surprise will form the fulcrum of the formula. The surgical strike showed those capabilities.So far, Pakistans approach has been guided by the military doctrine that terrorism is an affordable option in terms of low cost of manpower and money. Also, it knows it cannot fight an asymmetrical conventional war against India.Refusing to be drawn into any ongoing political debate about the similarity of surgical strikes done previously and now, the official said what has dramatically changed for Pakistan is that India is now unpredictable in its dealings, which makes it tough for its army brass to prepare a response or a counter-response.Pakistan realises now that terrorism is no longer a low-cost strategy. Our surgical strike has demolished that illusion. Secondly, terrorism in the name of Islam cannot be used to pressurise India to come to a negotiating table on Kashmir. Our position is clear: we will not compromise or negotiate on territorial claims in J&K, the official said. Nevertheless, New Delhi believes that Pakistan would still resort to a major strike in Jammu and Kashmir particularly, using their home-bred terrorists and not the Pakistan Army regulars. Indias response to such a strike will depend on the nature and scale of the attack. We are not interested in waging a war unless Pakistan is hell-bent on taking on the economic and military might of India. We need to focus till 2025 on building Indias national power through its economy and not engage in a war, the official said.However, India is assessing on a real-time basis Pakistans capacity to order terrorist attacks and other ways of fomenting trouble on five counts: intention, capacity, possibilities, probabilities, and opportunities. Possibilities are sky-high for them, but probabilities are much less as they are dependent on capacity and opportunities. Our surgical strike has dealt a blow to its capacity and our intelligence agencies are at work 24x7 to reduce opportunities for them to strike at us. No one can accuse us of war-mongering. But we will hit back and hard, the official said.Coupled with an aggressive diplomacy that has seen global powers cold-shoulder Pakistan, a proxy war by sending terrorists to India is no more acceptable to the world. In this context, the official said, Russia, China and the US have made it clear that they stood by New Delhis response within hours of the cross-LoC strikes.While China asked both sides to scale down tensions and resort to dialogue, the US and Russia, in separate statements, called on Pakistan to end terrorism originating from its soil. US National Security Adviser Susan Rice called on Pakistan to take effective action to combat and de-legitimise United Nations-designated terrorist individuals and entities, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Muhammad and their affiliates."
5903a9d27be9e02646bd6ce9,Govt mulls bonus for shifting to pulse sowing,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/557360/govt-mulls-bonus-shifting-pulse.html,2016-07-11,"Govt mulls bonus for shifting to pulse sowingNew Delhi, Jul 12, 2016, DHNS: 1:10 ISTThe government on Monday formed a high-level committee to explore if giving bonuses to farmers will boost the cultivation of pulses, and the possibility of tweaking minimum support price (MSP).The committee headed by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian will submit its report within two weeks.The decision was taken at a meeting to review the situation of the prices of food articles in the country with a special emphasis on pulses, which is selling as high as Rs 200 per kg. The meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and attended by Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu, besides other senior officials.The Consumer Affairs Ministry has called a meeting on Wednesday of the officials from the Intelligence Bureau, Department of Revenue Intelligence, Income Tax and the Directorate General of Foreign Trade to discuss and take measures on hoarding of pulses, if any, sources told DH.Further, on Wednesday, the inter-ministerial group on prices headed by Jaitley is expected to meet to decide ways to curb soaring prices of essential commodities.To encourage farmers to cultivate pulses, the government had in June increased the MSP of pulses along with a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal.While the Finance Ministry believes that increasing MSP for pulses can increase production and cool their prices, the governments think-tank Niti Aayog has a different view. It has raised doubts on the premise that increasing MSP alone can motivate farmers to cultivate pulses on a large scale.It would be a day dream to consider that higher price will increase production without technological breakthrough, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said recently. At one point of time, prices of pulses were almost at par with wheat and rice rates, but now they are six times higher, he said.The government has also decided to increase the buffer stock of the pulses to 20 lakh tonne this year from meagre 1.5 lakh tonne in its godowns at present.Further, to cool the prices in the retail market, the importers have also been asked to lift pulses stock within 45 days from the ports. Earlier, they could lift the stock within 90 days.Meanwhile, Paswan held states partially responsible for the rise in prices of pulses as they were reluctant to lift it from the central pool.Because of the lacklustre attitude of the state governments, the image of the central government is being tarnished. I am again appealing to all states to lift pulses from us. They have infrastructure for the solution, Paswan said after the meeting.The food minister also offered more pulses to the states at Rs 66 for tur, Rs 82 for urad for retail distribution not more than Rs 120 per kg. The Centre held a similar meeting on the price situation last month and had made an appeal to the states but to no avail."
5903c72e7be9e02646bd7d8c,Colleges rush to nurture future entrepreneurs,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522381/colleges-rush-nurture-future-entrepreneurs.html,2016-01-10,"Colleges rush to nurture future entrepreneursBy Natasha Singer, Jan 11, 2016, International New York Times 23:41 ISTThe original charter of Rice University, drafted in 1891, established a school here dedicated to the advancement of literature, science and art. These days, Rice seems equally dedicated to the advancement of the next Mark Zuckerberg.The university offers academic courses in entrepreneurship strategy and financing, extracurricular start-up workshops and a summer prog-ramme for students seeking to start companies.In August, Rice announced a multimillion-dollar entrepreneurship initiative to develop more courses and programmes in the subject. And administrators say they hope to erect an entrepreneurial centre to house classes and services supporting student projects.We want Rice to be one of the schools at the top of the list of schools that prospective students with entrepreneurial aspirations say would be a good place to realise their ambitions, said David W Leebron, Rices president. This is a nontrivial group of students, some of the smartest students, the most creative students.Ten years ago, it may have sufficed to offer a few entrepreneurship courses, workshops and clubs. But undergraduates, driven by a sullen job market and inspired by billion-dollar success narratives from Silicon Valley, now expect universities to teach them how to convert their ideas into business or nonprofit ventures.As a result, colleges  and elite institutions in particular  have become engaged in an innovation arms race. Harvard opened an Innovation Lab in 2011 that has helped start more than 75 companies. Last year, New York University founded a campus entrepreneurs lab, and this year, Northwestern University opened a student start-up centre, The Garage.Todays students are hungry to make an impact, and we have to be responsive, said Gordon Jones, the dean of a new College of Innovation and Design at Boise State University in Idaho and the former director of Harvards Innovation Lab. Yet campus entrepreneurship fever is encountering skepticism among some academics, who say that start-up programmes can lack rigor and a moral backbone.Even a few entrepreneurship educators say that some colleges and universities are simply parroting an innovate and disrupt Silicon Valley mindset and promoting narrow skill sets  like how to interview potential customers or pitch to possible investors  without encouraging students to tackle more complex problems.A lot of these universities want to get in the game and serve this up because its hot, Jones said. The ones that are doing it right are investing in resources that are of high calibre and equipping students to tackle problems of importance.In trying to develop rich entrepreneurial ecosystems, many institutions are following a playbook established years ago by Stanford University and MIT, which involves academic courses, practical experience and an extended alumni advisory network.Some universities are redoubling their efforts. Princeton, offers a variety of entrepreneurship courses. But, in a report released in May, a university advisory committee concluded that Princeton had fallen behind competing schools that had made major upgrades to their programmes.Among other issues, the report said, Princeton had allotted only 1,500 square feet for student incubator and accelerator programmes, whereas Cornell has 364,000; Penn 200,000; Berkeley 108,000; Harvard 30,000; Stanford 12,000; Yale 7,700; NYU 6,000; and Columbia 5,000.In November, Princeton celebrated the opening of a 10,000-square-foot Entrepreneurial Hub near campus. The university is also starting a summer internship programme in New York City so that students can spend time at young companies.Mung Chiang, the director of the Keller Centre for Innovation in Engineering Education at Princeton, said the university wanted to help students, faculty and alumni become more entrepreneurial in business, government, and nonprofit work. Its about broadening peoples mindsets and capabilities, Chiang said.The growth in campus entrepreneurship is clear, administrators say. In 1985, college campuses in the United States offered only about 250 courses in entrepreneurship, according to a recent report from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, which finances entrepreneurship education and training. In 2013, more than 400,000 students were taking such courses.The prospect of starting the next Snapchat or Instagram is one attraction for students. But in a tight job market, where young adults say they expect to change employers every few years, some undergraduates are signing up for start-up training in the hope of acquiring self-employment skills.To be honest, our generation is no longer interested in doing one thing for the rest of our lives, said Mijin Han, a senior at Rice with an English major and a business minor focused on entrepreneurship. Our generation is interested in learning different things, and, if the environment does not provide it, we want to jump out and take a risk.Funding ideasTo support the programmes, colleges and universities are raising money and seeking mentors among successful alumni and local business leaders. Some provide stipends for students participating in accelerator programmes or offer seed capital for their start-ups; others may negotiate revenue-sharing arrangements if graduate students want to commercialise ideas developed in university labs.Yet the quick start-up workshops offered on some campuses can seem at odds with the traditional premise of liberal arts schools to educate deliberative, critical thinkers.Real innovation is rooted in knowledge and durable concern and interest, not just I thought of something that nobody ever thought of before, said Jonathan Jacobs, who writes frequently about liberal education and is the chairman of the philosophy department at John Jay College of Criminal Justice of The City University of New York. Thats not educating people, frankly.That is one reason Rice administrators say they are consolidating and analysing current programmes before embarking on additional efforts. As part of that process, the university introduced an interdisciplinary forum last month to promote campus research, discussion and broader courses in entrepreneurship.Leebron, Rices president, described the initiative as part of an effort to improve the hands-on, project-based learning students are requesting. Theres no question that more people at the age of 18 are coming to universities saying, I have an idea; I think I can have an impact, he said. What are we going to do with these folks? How are we going to support them?"
5903cb637be9e02646bd8042,Budget needs  rural focus,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524394/budget-needs-rural-focus.html,2016-01-21,"Budget needs rural focusM V Sridhara, Jan 22, 2016, DHNS 23:10 ISTThis years budget is likely to be given a real rural orientation. This means allocations and spending directly favouring agriculture and rural areas will attract and encourage young people and promote productivity and incomes of villagers. Agricultural credit has witnessed a steady growth and had reached the Rs 6 lakh crore mark in 2013-14 with 12 crore Kisan Credit Cards, which is set to increase further.Materially, this should result in increasing fertility of soil and spread and optimisation of irrigation, overall production and diversification. We need to vastly augment production of fruit, vegetables, pulses and oilseeds, milk, meat and eggs. The latter are superior foods and are in sh-ort supply and the current bout of food inflation (notwithstanding negative wholesale price index inflation) adversely affecting the poor and middle classes, is caused due to the paucity of supplies of these commodities.Food grain production has risen from 51 million tonnes in 1951 to nearly 265 mt in 2013-14, more than a fivefold increase whereas population has incre-ased fourfold. This indicates that we have achieved quantitative progress and immunity against famines though we are rather faltering on the quality and nutrition access fronts.These tasks are closely cognate to other developmental tasks on hand. Despite the present manifest reservations on the part of governments political leaders, public opinion is strongly in favour of widening the scope and spread of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Schemes (MNREGS) activities.This has certainly contributed to reduce rural poverty and distress migration to urban misery; wages are linked policy-wise to the cost of living index; women have had firmer opportunities for incomes and to that extent, gained in freedom, choice and dignity amidst peers and their families. Nearly 13 crore people have risen above the poverty line till 2013-14.The MNREGS activities are focused on land levelling, rain water conservation, water body upgradation in the perspective of local micro topography, rural roads, greening of roadsides and fallow lands and hill slopes. These are rather rural infrastructure elements promoting livestock rearing and use of green and dung manure, all a boon to dry land farming and production of superior foods, much needed in the country.Complementary to these allo-cations and budgetary support, there is a need to concentrate on improving quality, material endowments and personnel in rural health centres, schools, colleges, polytechnics and ITIs. These will certainly and very soon enhance immunity, health, employability and incomes of village youth. In addition, since these measures will help employment and savings of villagers, their distress migration into cities and urban misery and social anonymity will be halted.These rural activities and supporting budgetary policy will be a wholesome way to control the growth of reckless urbanisation and the tragedy of sprawl. It will thus be easier to decentralise ec-onomic development by spreading industry and service sector operations in more centres; urbanisation of census towns will become real and substantive.Imbalance in irrigationInequality and imbalance in irrigation use is common and spreading in India. The tradition of growing irrigation-guzzling cereals like rice and wheat has spread, particularly in the command areas of large dams. And indefinite spread of irrigation is rather impossible in our country. We have to attempt a serious equitable sharing of irrigation facilities, at present as well as in future. Encouraging the raising of traditional minor millets like ragi, sorghum, jowar etc has to be recommenced in a big way.The quantum of irrigation water to raise unit quantity of crops has to be critiqued and minimum or optimum use has to be encouraged. Drip and sprinkler irrigation is quite known and has to be universalised all over. This technology transformation will certainly encourage mechanisation of agriculture and non-farm jobs too in rural areas. In its own way, these changes in agricultural practices and technology will tend to attract rural youth to undertake modern jobs in their own locations: a sort of in situ modernisation of rural youth.Use of modern equipment in agriculture and rural homes and augmenting warehousing, tran-sport and servicing facilities in villages will invest a new interest among youth in technical education. Training of post school youth in rural areas will become all important and entails founding of institutions and increased budgetary allocations and twe-aking of policies vis-a-vis rural India. The flow of service sector activities into villages will beco-me manifest: social and economic gap between villages and cities will witness a welcome decline."
