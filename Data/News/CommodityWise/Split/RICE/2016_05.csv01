Now the government has cleared three varieties of the khesari lentil, which can grow in dry or wet conditions.But the opposition Congress party, which is trying to pressure Modi over continuing rural hardship, said the government was playing with the health of unsuspecting Indians by allowing the cultivation of khesari.The varieties developed by Indian scientists, however, contain a lesser amount of a neurotoxin that can damage nerve tissues and weaken the legs of both humans and animals than previous varieties, said Narendra Pratap Singh, director of the state-run Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR).""The government thought if in a reasonable quantity it can be consumed then why not allow it, particularly when there's a crisis and we're importing pulses,"" said Singh.Despite the ban placed on the lentil in 1961, khesari is still eaten in eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh, mainly as a cheap source of protein for millions of poor people.""This is how the Modi government is tackling price rise - by lifting (the) ban on a pulse that's medically proven to cause paralysis,"" Congress party spokesman R P N Singh said on Twitter.The three varieties now allowed have been ready for the last 10 years and ""various experiments on animals have shown there are no adverse long-term effects if consumption is in reasonable quantity,"" IIPR's Singh said.Every year Indians consume about 22 million tonnes of lentils used to make a thick stew called dal, commonly taken with rice or flat bread across South Asia. About a fifth of the volume is imported from countries like Canada, Australia and Myanmar, which grow the legumes mainly to sell to India.Modi wants India to be self sufficient in lentils and last month approved a scheme to encourage greater cultivation of the legumes. Higher incentives for water-intensive crops like wheat and rice have made India a big grains producer at the cost of other key crops like lentils and oilseeds."

However, it still falls short of the demand by nearly three to four million tonnes, forcing the country to fall back on imports.The new versions of pulses being developed at the Kanpur-based institute include reduction of crop duration of moongbean from 75 to 55 days, lentil from 140 to 120 days and chickpea from 135 to 100 days.Varieties developedIt has also developed wilt-resistant varieties in chickpea, development of early maturing varieties in pigeonpea suitable for multiple cropping and green seeded variety of field pea for diversified food uses.The Centre is also promoting production of pulses in rice fallows and also popularising pulses cultivation in non-traditional area."

(source: AP) On the inaugural day of the CII Agrotech  a biennial event  experts also elaborated on the options available with farmers apart from stubble burning. (source: AP)Management of paddy stubble was among the much discussed topics on Sunday, the first day of CII Agrotech 2016. Experts from across the country and beyond emphasised that farmers should not be burning paddy stubble as it causes serious problems. On the inaugural day of the CII Agrotech  a biennial event  experts also elaborated on the options available with farmers apart from stubble burning. The theme of Sundays session was Challenges and Solutions for Comprehensive Straw Management.Dr Harminder Singh Sidhu, Senior Research Engineer, Borlaug Institute for South Asia (BISA), Ludhiana, said, The rice residue management can never be done in isolation. It has to be done in consonance with the principles of conservation management. The key criterion has to be no additional cost on the farmer.Head of Department for Agriculture and Bio-Energy, Federal Association of German Training Centres for Agricultural Engineering, Nienburg, Germany, Ulrich Lossie, said, The size of the stubble left after cutting must not be more than 10 cm and machines applied must be used properly for this to happen. Germany is using Strip Till, where animal excreta is used to manage the residue. As a rule, we need a chain of methods to manage straw and farmers education also plays a vital role.B S Dhillon, Vice Chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University, said, Earlier, people used to make ropes from the stubble but now 75 per cent of the stubble is burnt which is leading to serious problems. He added that a method titled, In-Situ on surface degradation, which involves spray application of a specific bacteria was under research.A number of farmers could be seen making queries at various stalls put up at Parade Ground in Sector 17 where various agriculture-related companies have displayed their products and technologies. A few of the companies had also put up stalls educating farmers on how to produce power from paddy stubble. One such company had already set up a first such plant in Punjabs Fazilka district where power is being produced by burning paddy stubble.We received more than 150 queries on Day One. Farmers are approaching us to inquire about how they can sell the stubble to us so that they do not have to burn it, said SP Yadav, representative of one of the companies taking part in Agrotech.Yadav told Indian Express that they were buying stubble from the farmers at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg and generating power. Stating that the residue of stubble is also being used as an organic fertiliser, he said they would soon set up similar plants in Haryana and other parts of Punjab.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Experts also made presentations on how renewable energy sources, such as use of tunnel drier by coconut, chilly and turmeric farmers, had made a difference.A CONFERENCE on Making Indian Agriculture Sustainable was held as part of CII Agro Tech 2016 in Chandigarh on Monday. Three major elements  natural resource management, climate smart agriculture and renewable energy  were discussed at separate sessions. A holistic view needs to be taken of the issue based on our agriculture system, where animals are also important. I have been driving my own car with biogas at IIT-Delhi for five years now. An experiment is on for use in two-wheelers as well. We are working towards a day when tractors will run on biogas, said professor VK Vijay, CRDT, IIT Delhi.Watch what else is making news:Climate-smart agriculture involves giving minute attention to operational details. Climate sensitive machinery and products are a great business opportunity and as a company, we are ready to tap the opportunity in the way we are strategising, said Ramesh Ramachandran, Sr V-P, strategy and precision farming FES, Mahindra and Mahindra.Another idea that emerged was global insurance as natural disasters could strike anywhere any time. We need a comprehensive set of policy actions and technology solutions to mitigate climate-related risks in agriculture to ensure true sustainability, said Vivek Bharati, lead, CII Core Group, on Ease of Doing Business.Experts also made presentations on how renewable energy sources, such as use of tunnel drier by coconut, chilly and turmeric farmers, had made a difference. CS Aulakh, senior agronomist, PAU, said, With farmers concentrating majorly on rice and wheat production, it has led to the reduction of other crops. We need to understand the healthy benefits of organic farming and execute it at the earliest.Gurmail Singh, a progressive farmer, said, The use of chemicals has adversely affected humans. It is not just bad for the present generation, but for future generations too. The use of food stuff produced by using poisonous chemicals has decreased sperm count in men, revealed a PGI research. We must get rid of chemicals and go organic way.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5904114d7be9e02646bdb783,"Feeding poor, underprivileged",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/574857/feeding-poor-underprivileged.html,2016-10-08,"Richa Banka in New Delhi, October 09, 2016 0:03 ISTModel works on hyper-local donation systemThe NGO has tied up with various agencies to serve excess foodAnkit Kawatra quit his management job and took an uncharted course which many would not have dared to. He embarked on an unplanned journey to provide food to underprivileged and hungry people. The last thing on his mind when he started his journey was a nomination for Young Leaders selected by the United Nations to meet their Sustainable Development Goals. He is proud that his name figured among the 17 youth this year.Kawatra, who was selected from 18,000 nominations received from 186 countries, started the NGO Feeding India two years back with a vision to distribute excess and leftover food from the Big Fat Indian weddings, events and 5-star hotels to solve the problem of hunger and malnutrition in the country.The idea struck him, when he was invited to one such wedding, where he saw a variety of leftover food, which could have easily served 5,000 people in a single night, was thrown directly in the bin.Working on a hyper-local donation system, Feeding India divides each city into various regions. The operations include three stakeholders--the donor, the shelter home on the beneficiary end and the volunteer conducting the activity. As soon as we receive acall from an individual, caterer, restaurant, corporate owner or any stakeholder organising an event with an estimated excess food for 50 people, the nearest volunteer or Hunger Hero is contacted to deliver the food to the shelter home.The volunteer reaches the destination, inspects the quality of food, loads it on the vehicle and transports it to shelter homes depending upon the need of the people staying there, said the founder of Feeding India.Keeping in view the health of the people, spicy food is not delivered to the shelter homes of old people. Similarly, food with nutritious value is donated to schools and NGOs which have students from the slum and government schools.One such NGO where Feeding India extends its services is Unnati which runs evening schools for students from slums, students from government schools and vocational training for girls. Our main concern has been hygienic food and this demand has been met by Feeding India. We are getting food from here since the past one year and never have we found that the food is inedible. We smell and taste the food before giving it to children.Also food with nutritious value comes for the students of the slum who otherwise could not have afforded it. These include rice, dal, chapattis, paneer, salad, raita for the main course along with Kulcha, Golgappas, cakes and juices in snacks, said Monika, Centre Co-ordinator of Unnati NGO.The initiative has received positive response from students who have been enjoying the food from Monday to Friday. We are very fortunate that we are eating this kind of food which otherwise we could not have afforded. The food is clean and we have had no complaint of food poisoning in summer, said Raj, a student at the Unnati NGO.The co-ordinator at this evening school claims that the number of students has increased after they started food with less students opting to migrate to other schools.The nutritious and a variety of food brightens the faces of the students, especially those from government schools who are bored of having the same porridge every day, Monika added.I love the food that Feeding India serves us. My school is very small and not recognised by the government. So we never used to get mid-day meals. There are many girls like me here whose parents are not very fond of the idea of going to school. But since the time Feeding India started serving us lunch and snacks daily basis, I have not faced any resistance from them. Over the last few months I have seen so many girls joining the school just because we get nutritious meals. The food keeps us energetic throughout the day and we can study without getting tired,eight-year-old Sushila, another student from the same NGO, said.A few NGOs and shelter homes that Feeding India helps include Maxvision Society, Khushi Rainbow Home for Girls, Kilkari Rainbow Home for Girls, Ummeed Aman Ghar for Boys to name a few.I remember an incident when I went to an old man who was around 70 years and was sleeping near a metro station. I went to him and gave him a plate full of rice and he was so glad to see the food that he held my hand like a child and told me that he has been looking for it since morning but had lost hope and was trying to sleep. That was a memorable experience in my life, said Prakhar, Feeding Indias Hunger Hero.Feeding India has partnership only with shelter homes which are open 24X7 so that they can donate the food at odd hours after collecting it from wedding functions.The undelivered food is stored in cold storage units to prevent it from going bad. This youth-run not-for-profit organisation claims to have created awareness on the issue of food wastage and hunger in the country. The NGO is informed about the event dates well in advance on their helpline numbers, via mobile application or an email.We have also partnered with many leading event planners and wedding organisers who encourage their clients to not waste food and call us for their parties. Some of these online websites include Weddingz.in, Wedmegood, Venuemonk, etc., said Kawatra.The NGO has its operations in 28 places, including all the metropolitan cities with over 2,000 well-trained volunteers. It has also received volunteering request from many other countries.Asked about their preparations for the coming wedding season, Kawatra says they have started a pilot project in Delhi with a rented vehicle which would move around the city collecting and distributing excess food from weddings. Kawatra has partnered with corporate offices, caterers, restaurants, event organisers for regular supply of excess food.We have partnered with restaurants/hotels--excessleftover food on fixed days of the week. Corporate offices donate excess food every day after lunch and dinner buffet in the cafeterias. We have collaborated with many 5-star hotels from where we pick-up food on a regular basis. One of these includes JW Marriott Mumbai Saharwhich is our regular donor, said Kawatra.The NGO claims to have picked up food from over 600 weddings last year across India, including the celebrity marriage of TV actress Sukhmani Sadana in Jaipur last year.Kawatra received global recognition for his leadership and contribution to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a set of 17 Goals to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice by 2030."

But within a few days, many get the longing for some good old oota, saapad or desi khana.Even in India, this longing for home food is not uncommon. Take Gujarati holiday makers who land up in southern hill-stations. Though presented with many pan-Indian veggie options, they pine for their own type of food. Cashing in on this, enterprising caterers put out displays announcing Saurastra and Rajkot thalis.It works the other way too. Westerners, after a few days of rice, rotis, veggies and curries, look forward to their kind of meal. Searching for steak houses, they zero in on their preferred meal. Once the grilled stuff on wooden plates and serrated knives arrives, there is delight in the eyes and before you can say asado, they have polished the plate clean.This brings to mind a young guest, Subramanian Iyer, who arrived one early morning in Hong Kong. When asked how the flight was, he didnt seem too enthusiastic. Ok, he mumbled. There was a snag in the flight kitchen. They didnt have curd-rice! So serious was he, that we changed the eating-out plan.Instead of taking him for a dim-sum lunch, we took him to Woodlands, Modi Road. With glee and obvious relish, he worked on the heaps of rice mixed with thick curd. This prompted the wife to innocently ask, So, when did you last have a home meal? The youngster pau-sed and said, Oh, aunty that was almost 24 hours ago, at home in Chennai!Are all south Indians like that? you might wonder. Not really. A week after the young mans visit, we were entertaining, or planning to entertain, a certain Mr Rao. The wife thoughtfully put together a welcome veggie dinner complete with curd-rice and payasam.Itll be a pleasant surprise, she said. After all, hes been away in Japan for months. Almost as soon as the middle-aged gentleman landed, we noted he wasnt exactly excited about the tastes of India. On the drive, this became apparent. He said he was enamored by Japanese culture, its refined people and work ethics. And oh, yes. Ive grown to liking Kyushu cuisine! he said. As we stared at him in disbelief, he continued dreamily, You know, yakimono, kibinago sashimi, tori I really love Japanese food!Then, out of the blue, he said, Before I fly back tonight to Bengaluru, let me show you what I mean. Theres a very good restaurant near here that serves excellent sashimi. Its not glitzy, yet its a hidden gem. But, I started only to be politely cut short by the genial big-made man who said, Come on, be a sport.With that, straight from the airport we went to a quaint little restaurant in Tsim Sha Tsui. This ambience reminds me of my Fukuoka land-lady. Ive spent months there, he said wistfully. Then, taking charge of the ordering, he soon had the table laden with sake and plates of colourful food  baby tuna, oysters, semi-fat tuna, burbot liver, sea urchins.As we eyed the nice looking but unfamiliar fare, the wife said, This looks yummy, picking up some tempura. Meanwhile, Mr Rao, in ecstasy, was holding up a raw baby octopus with chopsticks and said, Nothing quite like good home food, is there?!"

None of the taxis we hailed was willing to ferry us to our hotel stating that it was at a walking distance. Tired and sleepy, we started walking on the lonely footpath. My wife suddenly remembered that it was in Sydney that only a few weeks ago a Bengaluru girl had been killed and an Indian student had been assaulted by a stranger the previous year. Though I reassured her that nothing would happen to us, I too was nervous.As we slowly trudged along, a taxi stop-ped next to us. The driver asked me wh-ere we were headed. I told him the name of the hotel and, to my surprise, he asked us to hop in. With great unease, we boar-ded the taxi and within a few minutes we were in front of our hotel. When I tried to pay the driver, he refused to accept the fare stating that we were the guests of Australia. When we insisted on paying, he said, I could make out that you both were very tired and seeing you, I was reminded of my parents. While thanking him, I did feel a sense of guilt.Cut to late 1984. When many parts of North India were reeling under anti- Sikh sentiments, I had embarked on a trip there with my wife and small kid. We had been to Kausani in Uttarakhand to see the sunset on the Himalayas. As we were about to leave for Almora, we were told that due to a landslide, the road was closed. Forced to spend a night in Kausani, we went from hotel to hotel, repeatedly to be told that there is no room.Night had fallen. It was getting colder. My son was hungry and wailing. We were filled with panic. Accidentally, I saw a building with a sign board Army Mess. My wife suggested that we look for a room there. I told her that the mess was strictly meant for defence personnel and there was no point in trying. She did not take no for an answer and nudged me to take a chance. When we rang the bell, a burly Sardarji opened the door. I explained to him our situation. He said that he was a caretaker and not authorised to allot rooms. Moreover, civilians could not stay there. Our repeated entreaties made him relent and he gave us a room.As we went inside, we noticed that we were the only occupants there, filling us with anxiety. We firmly bolted the door and hit the bed as we were tired. At about 10 pm, there was a knock on the door. With great trepidation, I opened it to see the same Sardarji carrying a big tray containing rice and hot sambar. He placed it on the table saying, Knowing that you are Madrasis, I asked a jawan to prepare food for you. Enjoy, and left. That was the tastiest sambar I have ever eaten."

The 68-year-old woman, who is a shining example of care and compassion, takes care of more than 300 abandoned dogs at her own cost in Snehalaya Animal Shelter at Selvapuram Road in Coimbatore.I am finding secure homes for the stray, abandoned, abused animals that are on the streets, which include those that were injured in road accidents, says Geetha.She regrets that many people hit the dog with sticks, stones and machetes, and use iron rods or kill them with knives. Some heartless people even throw boiling water on dogs as well as poison them, she said. Geetha carries a bottle of antidote in her vehicle whenever she receives information that a dog is in distress on the street.Section 11 of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, as amended from time to time, provides that if any person beats, kicks, overrides, over-drives, over-loads, tortures or otherwise treats any animal so as to subject it to unnecessary pain or suffering, he shall be punishable with fine and/or imprisonment.Most people are unaware of this Act and that is why they indulge in such cruel activities, she said. Geetha is assisted by driver Balanwho is also an animal lover. We have a van designed for animal rescue. Balan and I would go around the city in the van. As soon as we get a call to rescue an injured animal, we rush to the spot regardless of what time it is. If the injury is severe, the animal is taken to a veterinary doctor before it is brought to this shelter home. She adds, When people go on transfer or relocate homes, they are unable to take their pets due to objection from the house owners or flat owners. We bring such animals and take care of them.Armed with four female workers, Geetha cooks different kinds of food every day for dogs. The dogs like boiled rice and vegetables with chicken, pork and fish toppings for taste. We bathe them regularly. We also ensure pure drinking water for them, Balan said.According to Balan, the animal shelter is cleaned and sanitised daily. Food and water bowls are cleaned regularly. ""A veterinarian visits once a week and new rescued dogs are examined for general health and well-being, he said. Dogs are socialised  new dogs' behaviour is assessed prior to showing them to potential adopters. Geetha's animal shelter has 30 good breed puppies, which are ready for adoption. Regularly, Geetha and her team, who hate calling them dogs, apply powder and medicine to deworm and keep them free from ticks and fleas. She calls them (dogs) her children.Over the years, Geetha has been able to get more dogs spayed and neutered. She provides antibiotics to sick dogs . Geetha's favourite is dog Kajol. Kajol's previous owner let him on the street, which is common in Tamil Nadu. Kajol was hit by a car and suffered injuries. Now, Kajol accompanies Geetha during her trips.A native of Kerala, Geetha's family moved to Coimbatore when she was a child. The idea of starting a shelter home for the abandoned dogs started when Geetha was just a child. I was born to parents who were not from the same caste, she recollects. This made it difficult for children in her family to accept her. Geetha also remembers how she was isolated by cousins.Her family owned more than 10 dogs then. Geetha spent most of her childhood playing with the dogs in the farm-land owned by her family. The dogs loved her unconditionally and literally filled up the gaps that her relatives could not.It was at that young age she developed a strong liking for dogs and she made up her mind that she will do something for them. Geetha, who was employed in Canara Bank, gave up the job due to a fire mishap. She started living with her pets.Geetha's two children--a son and a daughter-- are well settled and help her to get funds for the animal shelter. Besides, she earns interest on her deposits and retirement benefits, she said.I also receive some amount from animal lovers, she said. Since Snehalaya is currently operating from a rented premises, Geetha is seeking donations to buy a land and build a permanent shelter.Apart from donations, Snehalaya also accepts rice, biscuits, milk, shampoo, soap, chews, bites, powder, medicines, collar, chains/leashes, food bowls and other pet-related articles.The journey has, however, not been an easy one for Geetha. She has had to face a lot of hurdles in her path, right from finding a good landlord, friendly neighbours and well-wishers who are ready to do timely help in crucial times.Recently, noted writer and short film director Vijayanand in Tamil Nadu, produced a 25-minute short film -- Gnamali. This short movie was recorded live at Snehalaya shelter for abandoned dogs and it was released on World Stray Animals Day (April 4) this year. Geetha said that since this short-film went viral, the number of calls that she receives to rescue dogs has increased by several folds. My children keep me going and they make me happy, Geetha said. Animals have the right to livelihood in this beautiful world in their respective homes, she says."

A big banner outside a super bazaar caught my eye. Fabulous offer! 25% discount on rice, wheat and sugar! it read.I was intrigued. In this day and age when expenses are swirling like smoke from a heap of garbage set afire, the screaming banner appeared to be manna from heaven.I strode into the shop purposefully and asked for details. The offer was on 25kg wheat and rice bags and 10kg sugar bag. As I wasnt planning to open an eatery or to cater to a wedding party, I retreated, quite disappointed. A 5% discount on a kg would have helped, I thought ruefully.Flippancy aside, space is a constraint and storage poses a problem. And with the passing of time and the growth of technology, we have become soft. Even lifting not-so-heavy weights leads to aches and pains. This, in turn, entails medical expense, loss of time and a drop in productivity. Most of us prefer small packs even if it is at extra cost.Recently, I received a sipper with a ready-mix pack. I refused the free gift because the baby of the family is a sturdy, twenty one year-old! With a packet of jelly, I was offered a mould free. I wasnt impressed and took just the jelly. That the mould was horrendous in colour didnt endear it to buyers!Another time, when I picked up a bottle of Nescafe, the shop assistant favoured me with a shaker that accompanied it. I pretended to forget it and left it behind.The alert shop assistant came after me with it. I told him I didnt want it. He extolled its usefulness, right there in the middle of the busy road.Dodging traffic and dealing with the persistent shop assistant was, to say the least, a difficult task. Wanting to avoid drawing attention of passers-by, I took the wretched thing and stuffed it into my shopping bag.A similar experience awaited me when I picked up a box of cereal. Here is a bowl for you! said the fresh-faced, bright-eyed youngster who attended to me. It was done with the air of a conjuror! Meekly, I accepted the plastic eye-sore, even thanking him, as I didnt want to be subjected to another sales-pitch barrage!Needless to say, I discarded it, followed by the sipper, the shaker and the mould, though I am not sure if it was strictly in that order."

Siddhu anna is our middle-aged helper of swarthy skin, lean built and average height, who is busy most of the time with the upkeep and cleaning of the premises.The moment my son steps down from the school bus, he starts looking for Siddhu anna. If he fails to spot him, he starts calling out his name aloud. As soon as they catch each others glimpse, they initiate their tittle-tattle as if they have been separated for quite long. They both are then seen tittering and discussing their activities of the day.The flow of their conversation is worth watching. Sometimes, my son entices Siddhu anna to leave his work and play with him. Thus, in the evenings, both of them can be spotted playing hide and seek, cricket or football. My son also revels in assisting him in tasks as simple as watering the plants or raking the weeds.An intriguing part of their untrammelled conversations is that Siddhu anna cannot understand a single word in Hindi and my son cannot speak or understand a single word in Kannada. Yet, they both continue to chatter beautifully with each other in their respective languages. To me, as an observer, their conversations are quite captivating.On several occasions, I have myself tried to communicate with Siddhu anna but my attempts turn out to be a failure always. We both could never succeed in making each other understand what we wanted to convey even when we both used actions to interact.My sons other companion, whom I value a lot too, is Zeenat, a Muslim girl of a marriageable age. She had been our house maid for the past eight years until we changed our residence a few months ago. Ours is a devout Hindu family while she is a devout Muslim. Our religions, though poles apart, could never restrain my son and Zeenat from becoming the best of buddies. Chattering, giggling and playing together, they both were inseparable. Gradually, she became such an integral part of our family that we can never think of any festivity without her participation now  be it Ganesh Chatur-thi, Navratri, Dusshera or Deepavali.Every Raksha Bandhan, she would bring a rakhi for my son. Following the rituals, she would put vermillion and rice on his forehead, perform his aarti and tie the rakhi on his wrist. This year on Raksha Bandhan, I thought that Zeenat might not come as our new house is far from her place. But, I was pleasantly surprised when she arrived clad in a burqa, accompanied by her brother Shoaib, to tie my son a rakhi.I wonder why grown-ups, like small children, despite being better at communicating, cant develop strong, conditional relationships. Rather than being emollient, at times, we knowingly become insensitive to the feelings of others.We need to learn from children how to build relations. Their pure heart incontrovertibly takes precedence over petty issues of ego, self-respect, status, caste, clan, religion, region or language. Life is too short to complain or regret. We need to keep loving, caring and sharing like children do and, of course, keep counting our blessings, too!"

No wonder, James Joseph is called the jack man of Kerala. A series of incidents transformed an engineer into an entrepreneur with a social cause and its impact is interesting.James worked in the corporate sector for about 2 decades, held key positions, specifically marketing roles, in leading companies, and worked from cities in three different continents. But, no matter where he was and how sophisticated the life was, his passion for hometown was alive in him. When he was appointed as a director (executive engagement) of Microsoft in India, he decided to connect his passion and profession. He wanted to explore the possibilities of working for a corporate company from his native in Aluva in Ernakulam district of Kerala. Both the company and the family supported him to try out the idea.In May 2009, James started his new journey. For over three years, his work and life were in perfect sync and he could achieve better while working from his village. I worked for different companies in three continents, but achieved my career-best professional performance, at the global software giant Microsoft, from my village, says James.When he realised that people can return to their villages without sacrificing their career and even perform better while experiencing the peaceful environs of rural India, he decided to spread the message and launched a pioneering initiative, Professional Bharati.Through this startup, he has been encouraging professionals who grew up in villages and are working in cities to return to their roots. He points out to advantages from avoiding the traffic to stress-free life and a healthy environment. Also, they can facilitate the transformation of villages and work for social causes. To advocate the cause, he started the Come Home campaign on October 2, 2012.He has shared his experiences on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Youtube, Twitter and Facebook, he has also been writing for publications. He has been posting information about his activities in his blog ProfessionalBharati.com.After successfully working from the village for 3 years, which he considers the most peaceful and productive years of his career, James decided to write a book to spread the word. He took a break from his work for the purpose and as he was in the process of writing, the turn of events compelled him to work for the cause of the most neglected crop of the state  jackfruit.Though I cherished jackfruit in all its forms, specifically jackfruit meal  a unique tradition of Kerala, I never thought that I would be so much associated with the fruit, James said. While I was working on the book, unknowingly I was observing the jackfruit tree in the backyard, different stages of the fruit from tender to ripe and slowly realised that most of the fruits go waste not only in Kerala, but also in the entire country.Soon curiosity gave way to planning and action. Jackfruit, though known for its utility value, has been given the tag of a poor mans food. James decided to take it to larger cross-section of society and experiment with different dishes--both traditional and exotic. After research he realised that in certain areas the crop is popular as a vegetable and in most places it is used as a fruit. The arduous task of cutting the fruit kept it away from consumers. Thus he wanted to try it out in different recipes both as a vegetable and as a fruit.Whenever I had food with potato as base, I felt that jackfruit would be a better substitute for mashed potato both taste and health-wise, says James. His idea was to make jackfruit a universal vegetable and ensure that it replaces potato at least in places where it is grown.For the purpose, he contacted leading chefs with whom he had a good network. But convincing them took some time as they were reluctant to use it for three reasons--seasonal, messy to prepare and the strong aroma. Though it proved to be a task, he succeeded and the result was amazing. Chefs were fascinated to see the range of dishes that could be prepared using a jackfruit. This led to experimenting hundreds of dishes from jackfruits, both traditional and contemporary.He also launched jackfruit365 to sell freeze-dried ripe jackfruit and raw jackfruit. The venture solved two problems attached to jackfruit--seasonal and messy. The venture evoked overwhelming response. Soon he became the flagbearer for jackfruit in Kerala, also networking similar efforts.As the jackfruit initiative became popular more and more people expressed keenness to know more about the Come Home campaign too. All credit to the jackfruit campaign, a reputed publishing house like the Penguin Books India came forward to publish my first book  Gods Own Office. The book, which was released on October 2, 2014, narrates Jamess fascinating journey from the backwaters of Kerala to become an achiever in the corporate world and then treading the unique path of working for the corporate world out of his village.Here is a response from a professional - Reading God's Own Office gave me the courage to chuck up a full-time corporate role and return to Kozhikode. I've co-founded a boutique BPO, voice call centre and tax and financial advisory in Kozhikode.By the time he completed writing the book, James decided not to go back to corporate life and continue the jackfruit campaign and founded another start-up called Gods Own Food Solutions for the purpose. James had observed that the jackfruit meal of Kerala, where unripe jackfruit displaces rice and wheat, had resulted in hypoglycaemic incidents when taken with insulin.He also found that in many instances, where jackfruit when used instead of rice or wheat, has reversed the diabetes condition. He took this clue forward, worked with doctors, scientists, chefs and consumers. The recent study by Sydney Universitys Glycaemic Index Research Service has mentioned that the glycaemic load and carbohydrate content is the lowest in unripe jackfruit compared to rice and wheat and its high fibre content leads to low absorption of sugar."

They felt very bad and many regretted their mistakes. They were wondering how would they spend time inside the jail for years together. Now many learn new work and that could ensure better life outside the jail after their release. They take up organic cultivation inside the jail premises.The farming initiative inside the jail complex started a couple of years back, but organic cultivation was launched after A Murugesan took over as the Trichy Jail Superintendent in the middle of last year. Now, organic farming in the prison complex has yielded excellent results in rehabilitating inmates and also providing some financial assistance.Trichy prison complex is spread over 280 acres and 65 acres have been earmarked for farming. Apart from cultivation, the prisoners produce vermicompost and biodegradable waste which are used as natural fertilisers.Murugesan said kitchen waste and dry leaves are collected in a separate bin and crushed with an organic waste crusher, a small tool used for smashing.After crushing, the waste is converted to solid paste. About 20 kg of organic waste yields about 2 kg of solid paste and it is mixed with lime powder and saw dust. After three weeks, the solid paste becomes manure and can be used for gardening, the jail official said.Most of the prisoners had experience in agricultural activities and their knowledge is being effectively used inside the jail, says Murugesan.Accordingly, 75 prisoners are divided into 3 teams and engaged in organic farming. In January 2016, the prisoners cultivated sugarcane for the Pongal festival season. Though it is a tedious work, they produced good quality sugarcane, Murugesan said. Sugarcane was sold at 25 % less than the market price. Out of the profits earned, 25 % share is given to the labourers, he said.Organic farming experts assist and regularly monitor the green project. As a result, acres of fallow land have been converted into productive land and vegetables are grown. Most of it is consumed in the jail and excess is sold through prison bazaars. The prison holds gardening classes and this year it has engaged the inmates in classes related to gardening and sustainability.The idea to engage them in organic farming was born out of the growing popularity of vegetables and fruits produced in a natural way without use of chemicals. Such vegetables and other agricultural products are in huge demand in the market. In the prison, 65 acres of land has been divided into 3 different units. Paddy is grown in one portion and vegetables and onion and potato in other two sections.The prison official said like last year, ADT-39 high quality variety paddy will be planted even this season and only organic manure will be used.Last year we produced 4,000 kg good rice. The rice was sold in the prison bazaar run by a group of convicts, Murugesan said. Now, brinjal and tomatoes have been grown this year and a good quantity is sold in the market regularly.Initially, buyers were reluctant to purchase vegetables cultivated inside the prison. However, when jail officials advertised that vegetables will be sold at 25 % less than the market price, people started queuing up every day to purchase the fresh vegetables.He claimed that vegetables are sold out in a couple of hours. Now we get very good response from the buyers at market also, the official said.Besides brinjal and tomatoes, coconut, banana, mango, jackfruit and lemon are grown. As we have adopted rain water harvesting method in and around the prison complex, we do not face water scarcity throughout the year, Murugesan said. The prison has two wells to meet the water requirement.The inmates are gearing up for cultivation of onion and garlic. As onion prices fluctuate every year, we stock it and save a lot of money, the jail superintendent said.The jail inmates are happy with their work. After their breakfast, the inmates work in the field. They forget everything and their work gives them a lot of satisfaction, Murugesan said. They are engaged for about 6 to 7 hours in farming activities.The initiative is aimed at giving convicts a chance to reform and rehabilitate. Prisoners released early for good conduct have an opportunity to utilise the experience to lead a decent life outside the jail. In addition, the skill provides inmates with satisfying work, marketable talent and fresh food to eat, he said.Sources said that prisoners, on their release, get assistance from the government. In many instances, loans and marketing facilities are arranged for the released prisoners.After their release, more than 20 inmates have started their own farming business with the help of the local authorities, a jail official said. We also help the ex-prisoners to open their own bank accounts if required, he added.Murugesan said the jail management is also taking measures for apiculture and poultry in the future."
590425f07be9e02646bdc6e5,Iran influence seen in oil production cut,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/584259/iran-influence-seen-oil-production.html,2016-12-01,"Iran influence seen in oil production cutBy Stanley Reed and Clifford Krauss, Dec 02, 2016, International New York Times 23:38 ISTIran is trying to reclaim the global market share and the clout in Opec that it lost under nuclear sanctionsAfter years of trying fruitlessly to prop up energy markets, the Opec on Wednesday finally reached a consensus on production cuts, sending oil prices soaring. The problem is, the euphoria in the markets may not last.With prices still at less than half the levels of two years ago, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed this fall to lower collective production.But it could not figure out how to spread the cuts among the countries.The path to consensus has been complicated by Saudi Arabia and Iran, whose longstanding mutual enmity encompasses religious, political and economic competition. When it comes to oil, Saudi Arabia, Opecs top producer, has fought to maintain its market share while Iran has worked to protect its nascent comeback as a power broker in the cartel, a role it lost in recent years under Western sanctions tied to its nuclear programme.They overcame their differences on Wednesday, with Opec deciding to cut production next year by about 4.5% or 1.2 million barrels a day. It will be the first cut in eight years. With the prospect of less pumping, oil prices, which began rising earlier in the day in anticipation of the deal, were up more than 8%, to nearly $50 a barrel. Rising prices could lift the troubled economies of oil-dependent nations like Nigeria and Venezuela, and bolster the fortunes of smaller US energy producers that have been shaken by the weakness.The deal shows that the weight and resilience of Opec is still there and will continue to be, Qatar Energy Minister Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada, said at a news conference on Wednesday. The market optimism, though, may soon be tempered.The deal, which is to last six months starting in January, is contingent on the cooperation of non-Opec countries, most notably Russia. While Russia agreed to participate, Moscow is notoriously difficult to predict. And its reported 3,00,000 barrels-per-day cut is only a trickle in its total output.A recent production frenzy creates another wild card for the deal. While Saudi Arabia and Iran have vocally supported higher prices, their national oil companies have been making deals in Asia and filling tankers as quickly as possible. Saudi production has increased to well over 10 million barrels a day, while reductions in domestic consumption have left more available for export. Iran, relieved of nuclear sanctions, has gone on its own selling spree in India and started production in new oil and gas fields.Other Opec countries have followed, increasing production in recent months. The race to pump more is taking several of the cartels largest members to the brink of their production capacity. The intense competition makes Opecs new plan less meaningful  part of the piece of the industry dynamics that means the price increase could prove temporary.The size of the cut is fairly trivial in a 96-million-barrel-a-day marketplace that remains oversupplied. Should prices rise in the next few weeks, the US shale producers are very likely to drill and complete more wells, which would add supply to the global market. And, if history is any guide, even a modest agreement can be breached by cheating. If higher prices bring higher output, prices will not remain up for long, said Jim Krane, a West Asia energy analyst at Rice University. It wont be long before were back where we started.Two months ago, the cartel surprised world energy markets by agreeing in principle to trim production. The move by Opec signalled a significant change of course for Saudi Arabia, which had allowed oil prices to collapse to try to undercut higher-cost Western players. But the cartels words and actions did not initially dovetail. The production and export frenzy in Iran has been accompanied by increased activity across much of Opec.Iran is trying to reclaim the global market share, and the clout in Opec, that it lost in recent years under nuclear sanctions. Saudi Arabia and other West Asian and African producers took advantage of Irans troubles by raising production to serve its old customers. Iran once threatened a retaliatory naval blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, the critical Persian Gulf choke point, a move that could have paralysed the economies of Saudi Arabia, its neighbouring allies and much of Asia and inflamed geopolitical tensions.Now Iran is coming back fast. Since many sanctions were lifted in January, Irans crude oil production has risen nearly a third, to about 3.7 million barrels a day.Having achieved the goal of returning to pre-sanctions levels, Iranian officials want to take production capacity higher still, toward 4.8 million barrels a day by 2021.Irans influence in Opec, and indeed in the region, has been growing since the lifting of nuclear-related international sanctions, said Bhushan Bahree, an Opec analyst at IHS Markit, a research company.Ultimate successIrans ultimate success at recovering its old glory is uncertain. During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to rip up the nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by the Obama administration and other world powers. And even if other countries do not follow Trumps lead, persistently low oil prices could deter foreign investment. There is a lot of uncertainty, said Homayoun Falakshahi, an Iran analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy.The Saudi-Iranian rivalry has complicated the negotiations. Some energy analysts say the Saudis pushed the idea of a cut, in part thinking that Iran had reached its production limits and would not be able to fight for supremacy in the Asian markets for long. In the days before the Opec meeting, Iran tried to negotiate an exemption from any cut.The competition extends beyond markets. Saudi Arabia and Iran are also playing an increasingly deadly political game, battling for power in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in West Asia. The specifics of the ultimate Opec deal give both Saudi Arabia and Iran reasonable room, adding to the doubt about whether the cuts will have much teeth.Saudi Arabia is taking a considerable hit, agreeing to cut by 4,86,000 barrels a day, the largest chunk of the total deal. But the Saudis would normally cut substantially in winter, when they burn less oil to generate electric power for air-conditioning. Iran faces a ceiling about 1,00,000 barrels a day, higher than what analysts estimate it is now producing.Adherence to the deal is also not a given. Three big and reliable Persian Gulf producers  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates  account for more than 60% of the cuts. But the rest come from other producers who may not adhere as closely to their limits. This is a great headline number, said Jamie Webster, a fellow at the Columbia University Centre on Global Energy Policy, who was observing the meeting."
5904269e7be9e02646bdc75c,They serve devotees with a smile in freezing cold,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/540924/they-serve-devotees-smile-freezing.html,2016-04-17,"They serve devotees with a smile in freezing coldR Mohan Babu, Baltal (J and K)April 17, 2016 1:10 ISTHundreds of volunteers from different parts of the country are gearing up for their annual service. Most would cringe at the thought of the serving devotees coming to the annual Amarnath Yatra in cold conditions for nearly 50 days. They are gearing up mentally and physically to serve over three lakh devotees who are expected to throng the Amarnath cave shrine from across the country in July and August.They work tirelessly and silently and make supreme sacrifice braving harsh conditions with the sole aim of serving pilgrims coming for Amarnath Yatra from different parts of the country.They serve Amarnath Yatris with piping hot foodranging from south Indian idli and dosa to paranthas and various mouth-watering dishes in temporary structures. They brave extreme cold conditions as temperature dips to around 5 degree celsius, sometimes even below in the morning.But they are on their feet to serve pilgrims from morning till late in the night.They have smile on their faces throughout and welcome pilgrims and urge upon them to partake food.Announcements regularly blare across the camps with thousands of temporary tents, urging pilgrims to come and eat in their langars. They also impress upon pilgrims not to waste food. They have a point as transporting food articles is a challenging job.Tents spread over some 3,000 square feet are effectively used for cooking and serving food. Neatly washed plates are given to pilgrims for eating food. It is very systematic as the plates have to be left in a particular place for volunteers to pick them, clean and keep ready for other pilgrims. The system mostly works on the lines of langars in Gurudwaras.It is because of people like Guruswamys and Mahenders that thousands of pilgrims feel comfortable and complete the arduous journey either by foot or doli or horseback and feel a sense of fulfilment.Langar is a free kitchen concept of Sikhs followed in Gurudwaras where food is served to people irrespective of caste and creed.With no hotel around in Baltal base camp, pilgrims have to rely on langars. Nearly 30 langars are set up every year. Free food is a pleasant surprise for pilgrims, who will have to shell out anywhere between Rs 30 and 50 for a bucket of hot water.Langars fill the void and pilgrims really have a choice to feast on. As most of the pilgrims stay for at least a couple of days to complete the pilgrimage, they generally visit at least half a dozen langars. With no other eatery around, they would literally indulge themselves in tickling their taste buds with a variety of food. It could range from three or four types of sweets to variety of rice and dessert in the form of kheer or badam milk. Even purified water is served to pilgrims free of charge.Guruswamy, a priest from Hyderabad, has been doing it for some years now and he finds satisfaction serving people. He is a livewire personality and always on the move. Keeping tabs on cooking in the kitchen to welcoming pilgrims with a smile and folded hands. Last year, Andhra langar as it was called shared space with Jalandhar kitchen as they had to shell out a good amount to Shri Amarnathji Yatra Board to serve the people.We buy materials from Andhra Pradesh and transport them in trucks to this place. We also bring our own cooks to ensure that devotees get authentic food,he said.Mahender from Punjab, who was also present, shared similar sentiments. They are happy that people contribute liberally for the cause and that has made their task that much easier.The same views were shared by a couple of others from Punjab who also had langars.They are unhappy that they had to rent the space to serve the people and forcing a few of them to share the space.It is nice to get such a good and tasty food for free. We have the choice of selecting the place. All of them are clean and neat, Rajesh, a government employee from Bengaluru, said.We had not expected the facilities to be so good. We were worried about how to manage food, Anupama, a senior citizen from Hyderabad, who had come as part of a package tour, observed. Several groups in different parts of the country depend on contributions in kind to set up langars (free kitchens) for pilgrims for the Amarnath Yatra.Even those coming out of Baba Amarnath Mandir after darshan will be pleasantly surprised as they are served with hot rice and dal. It is amazing that materials are carried on the backs of horses and they travel a distancea treacherous roadof 14 km one way.The logistics are mind-boggling as thousands of people are fed every day. It is even hard to imagine how the system works. Ask anyone serving in the langar and they show their hand towards the cave shrine where stalagmite linga exists and say everything happens by the grace of god.Here, one litre of bottled water is sold at Rs 50 and langars serve unlimited food without collecting a single penny.Even on the way to Amarnath from Jammu, scores of langars on the roadside are busy preparing food and serving it to pilgrims during the yatra time. At important places, three or four langars are set up offering variety of food. What makes them to do it, the standard reply is that they feel it is like serving god."

Besides launching initiatives like planting saplings and holding blood donation camps, they have started many projects which not many of their ilk have attempted so far.Going beyond their usual voluntary services, a 320-member Home Guard contingent, including 50 women, is engaged in creating awareness on the importance on organ donation, fighting man-animal conflict and helping the authorities at Kasi temple in Uttar Pradesh by sending coconut shells for the cremating the dead.Recently, over 100 home guards in Coimbatore helped a hospital to get an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records for popularising the cause of organ donation by enrolling 13,206 donors in just eight hours. They also pledged their organs on the occasion. To create an awareness on the importance of eye donation among the people, the home guards have also pledged their eyes.We were doing our usual work till a few years ago. However, all of us thought that we should do something different to the people, which should help them, says Balaji Raju, Area Commander, Coimbatore district Home Guards.Accordingly they started rice bucket challenge two years back, a unique programme with each home guard providing one kg of rice to one family living on the street and daily wage workers.After the rice bucket challenge, the district Home Guards have now taken up another initiative to provide clothes to the downtrodden in society. The condition of children and men was pathetic as many had only two pairs of clothes, according to Balaji. The plight of those living in far-flung areas inside Thengumarada Forest, Kallampalayam, Melur and Keelur was horrible and many women were wearing torn clothes to cover their bodies. Called adai kodai (donate clothes), sarees, dhothis and kids wear, both new and used, were donated to the poor in those areas.As Coimbatore and its neighbouring districts are surrounded by forest area, animals like elephants and leopards enter human habitat frequently. This was a great concern for the district authorities as many people have lost their lives in the man-animal conflict in the last one decade.In a bid to help forest officials, home guards chipped in to help the authorities. Following our request, the forest authorities conducted a training programme in Annamalai Tiger Reserve, which was mainly focused on animals in hilly areas and preventive measures to keep them inside the forest, K Sidharthan, a home guard, said.He said the man-animal conflict programme is focused on Pollachi, Thudiyalur and Mettupalayam areas. Each unit is headed by a company commander, he said.The comprehensive training covered the safety measures needed to prevent animal attacks besides stocking rice and salt at PDS shops in a manner that does not attract elephants and other animals to human habitats, Sidharthan said. We were also trained on light and sound alert systems and SMS introduced by the forest department"".Under the SMS programme, a message on the movement of animals is sent to the nearest forest department outpost. The Home Guards and forest officials will alert people through public address system.Deputy area commander Vidhyashree Dharmaraj said that her unit has launched a novel programme called Kasi Pasumai Yatra. She said in Kasi trees are cut for burning bodies. We thought of a remedy to this and our cadres started collecting coconut shells, which can be used as alternative for wood to burn bodies, she said. We send the shells regularly to Kasi and an NGO helps us in this regard, she said.Vidhyashree said on some occasions, home guards also help the local police in nabbing criminals. Last month, our cadres Shanmuga Sundaram and Satish were on night duty when they noticed two people moving around suspiciously in the wee hours, Vidhyashree said. On seeing the home guards, the two attempted to flee. After a long chase, the home guards caught the hardcore criminals with guns and handed them over to the Mettupalayam police.Another Home Guard company commander Jaikumar said his cadres along with college students travelled to the flood-hit areas with relief materials. A group of home guards went to Chennai and Cuddalore district, which were devastated by December 2015 flood, and supplied food and helped in rescue and relief works.In another attempt to enter into the Guinness Book, the Home Guards cleaned Coimbatore city recently in association with the municipal corporation under Swachh Bharat Mission. The unique work included removing nails from trees and illegal hoardings. With an aim to stress on the importance of girl child, home guards were asked to take selfies with their daughters and post them on FaceBook.Recognising their efforts, the Tamil Nadu police have provided a distinct white uniform to the Home Guards , which is similar to the ones used by traffic cops in Coimbatore. Like traffic police, our cadres could also be identified during nights, which is not possible in the usual khakhi uniforms, Balaji Raju said.Interestingly, women cadres are also involved in activities such as cleaning local hospitals, providing temple security and extend escort to VIPs.Kalpana, who is in catering business, said: ""I am proud to be a part of the Home Guards team. Though I have lots of commitments at home, I do devote some time to public service."

Today, the gentleman-naturalist is widely regarded as the Butterfly Man. He thinks, breathes and dreams butterfliesand is Indias walking encyclopaedia on butterflies. His new book Butterflies of India, a field guide, will be released soon.Kehimkar, currently Manager-Programmes with the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS-India), has also authored two comprehensive field guides  Common Indian Wildflowers and Book of Indian Butterflies.In fact, more than my work, I would give total credit to Facebook. I could connect with butterfly lovers, experts and students, the 59-year-old said. Facebook and other platforms have connected amateurs and experts. This, he said, was making a difference in terms of research. His previous book has a list of 634 butterflies but now he has managed to compile 1,024 species found in the Indian sub-continent.There are over 18,000 species of butterflies across the globe, he says. Apart from India, the book covers the butterfly fauna of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar.We are in a butterfly paradise with more than 1,500 species in India itself. With such diverse habitats ranging from the Himalayas to deserts to grasslands, there is so much for a naturalist to explore! Exploring varied places and studying butterflies there inspired me to write this book, he said. India is very rich in butterflies. Britain has 47 species. But, Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai alone has around 170 species, he said.India is a haven for butterflies, whether it is the Western Ghats-Sahyadri ranges, the North East or the Himalayas or for that matter places like the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. There are several endemic species here as well, he said. Jammu & Kashmir needs to be explored.It took me more than two years to write this book. This is truly a magnum opus on butterflies. I hope the readers will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed writing it, adds Kehimkar. A few years ago after the release of his first book, he met with an accident. At that time, he started the work for this book. It is not my work. It is the work of many. In fact, wherever I have found that someone elses photo is better, I have used it, he said.Kehimkar joined the BNHS in 1979. In fact, I worked with a big corporate, but when I came to know that there is an opening in the BNHS, I joined. Salary was far less than what I was getting earlier. My mother was a bit upset, but my father, who was an officer with the Reserve Bank of India, said that if that was my interest, I should go ahead, he said.Its more difficult to find a job that will make you happy, than one which pays you well. If you follow your heart, the money will eventually follow  thats what my dad told me, he says. His father was also interested in things like philately.Isaac had grown up in the Govandi-Deonar area in suburban Mumbai. After rice was harvested we played cricket or climbed trees, caught fish and crabsa lot of people from the local koli and agri communities were my friends, said Kehimkar, who is a Jew.I have seen legends like Salim Ali, J C Daniel, Vyankatesh Madgulkar working....they were an inspiration, he said. In the late 80s when his article was published in the Sanctuary magazine, Daniel was impressed and he was made part of the Hornbill magazine. He had helped set up the butterfly garden at the Conservation Education of the BNHS at Filmcity in Mumbai and Ovalekar Wadi in Thane.Today, when it comes to butterflies, there are avenues and many butterfly meets are held. There we not only project nice pictures but also speak on research and career opportunities in the field, Isaac said.Today we have the potential to develop butterfly parks, he said.He said that formal research started in a way when the Britishers came in. In fact, you would find butterflies named Commander, Commodore, Sailor, Captain, Major and Sergeant, he pointed out.A doctor from Arunachal Pradesh has photographed the rare Kaiser-i-Hind and it has been used in the book. More than 50 people from the sub-continent have supplied pictures for my book, in addition to my own, he said.According to Kehimkar, it is essential to take children to nature and wilderness. In a small way, we can start butterfly gardens. Yes, it is possible to attract butterflies to your doorstep. You can have a closer look into the lives of these fascinating insects by planting flowering plants to provide nectar to adult butterflies and food plants for butterflies to lay eggs. You will enjoy every moment of this experience when you see butterflies actually visit your patch of garden or your windowsill pots. Watching little caterpillars hatching out, growing, pupating and then witnessing the magical moments of the butterfly emerging and finally taking off its first flight is truly a rewarding experience, he added."
59042b507be9e02646bdca78,"Marriage falls in China, hits finances, families",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/570036/marriage-falls-china-hits-finances.html,2016-09-12,"By Amie Tsang and Zhang Tiantian, Sep 13, 2016, International New York Times 0:29 ISTThe decline in marriages means a decline in the number of babies, and potentially less spending on homes, appliances and other family-related purchasesLiu Zhenfeng got married at 25. The usual trappings of family life followed  a daughter, a home, furniture, toys. That daughter, Song Zongpei, now 28, is taking a different path. Song shares a rented apartment in Beijing with two roommates and is focusing on her career and her finances. She does not see marriage or motherhood in her immediate future. At this stage, the most important thing for me is personal development, Song said.Fewer Chinese people are getting married, a shift with profound implications for Chinas economic and social life. The decline in marriages means a decline in the number of babies, and potentially less spending on homes, appliances and other family-related purchases  the kind of spending China needs to drive economic growth.Already some businesses are thinking single. Jewellery-makers are offering cheaper baubles for unmarried sweethearts. One appliance-maker is selling smaller rice cookers. Foreign fertility services are advertising for Chinese women who want to freeze their eggs  a process that is prohibited for single women in China  to have children later.But the marriage slump  caused in large part by Chinas aging population and the legacy of its harsh one-child policy  has a silver lining. It also stems from the rise of an educated population of women.Specialists in economics, demography and sociology say some of those women are delaying marriage to build careers and establish financial footing, resulting in a more empowered female population that no longer views marriage as the only route to security.Because they are highly educated, they hold well-paid jobs, they lose the financial incentive to get married, says Zhang Xiaobo, a professor of economics at Peking Universitys National School of Development. China continues to emphasise marriage in its official media, entreating women not to wait for Mr Right. But demographics and changing social mores make that a tough sell.Last year, 12 million Chinese couples registered for marriage, making it the second consecutive year the number has declined. Divorces, which stem from some of the same trends, reached 3.8 million last year, more than twice the level of a decade ago. Much of the marriage decline results from Chinas one-child policy.Ended formally in January after 35 years, the policy accelerated a decline in the countrys birth rate. As a consequence, people between 20 and 29  prime marrying age  make up a declining share of the population compared with two decades ago. And because families often preferred male babies, China has a surplus of men, further complicating marriage prospects.Those trends test cultural notions of family that go back hundreds of years. While arranged marriages have largely faded in China, parents remain deeply involved in the nuptials of their offspring, chasing down leads on potential suitors and hounding their children during holiday visits about marriage plans. Liu, Songs mother, agrees that her daughter should wait for the right match, but she still hopes that she finds someone. I want her to have a happy life, Liu said, and I think its more secure to have a family.On the economic front, the effect could be double-edged. Single people generally buy fewer houses, have fewer children and buy fewer toys and gadgets than married couples. That could complicate Chinas efforts to turn its traditionally tightfisted population into American-style spenders, to offset its economys dependence on exports and big-ticket government projects.It could also lead Chinese consumers to sock more money away in the bank or under mattresses. Families of prospective grooms in China often save money for years to buy a home for a couple before they marry to give them financial stability. Families save more, to buy bigger homes, if brides are hard to find, said Zhang, the Peking University professor.But Chinese consumers could simply spend money on something else  with single young people leading the pack. Some of the decline in marriage stems from the growth of a group of young, educated urban women who no longer need to wed to achieve financial security.China still faces yawning gaps in wages and employment between men and women, according to surveys. But women made up more than half of undergraduate students in 2014, compared with about 46% a decade earlier, and accounted for nearly half of graduate students, government figures show.Cheng Guping, a 30-year-old from Hangzhou in eastern China who works at a startup and is pursuing a doctorate in economics, is one of those women. She cited her professional and educational obligations as the reason she and a recent boyfriend broke up. I felt that our level of affection wasnt enough yet, she said. I want to see how far I can go on my own. Suitable mates are simply hard to find, said Cheng, who describes many men her age as not mature or irresponsible.Businesses are preparing for the shift. The jewellery industry expects sales growth to slow in China as marriage declines. In response, many stores are offering a greater variety of jewellery, such as cheaper gems to entice dating couples who have less money. Even though they are not getting married, said Annie Yau Tse, the chief executive of Tse Sui Luen, a jewellery chain based in Hong Kong, people still need someone to be with them, and they still want love.Single buyersJiajiashun, an online property agent, said it was planning to sell less expensive housing to cater to single buyers. Midea, a Chinese appliance-maker, has been expanding its range of smaller rice cookers  giving singles a way to make fresh rice and avoid the refrigerated leftovers that leave many Chinese cold. We are concerned about the changes in family structures in China, according to Huang Bing, chief product manager of Mideas small domestic appliances division.In Chinese homes, the shift raises questions about family ties and filial responsibilities. For example, married couples in China traditionally care for aging parents. Wu Jingjing, 29, can see the burden that the aging population could be for her generation. Theres a group of people who will feel very much crushed by being in the middle layer, being the pillar of a family while raising both the children and their parents, said Wu, who works for an internet company.Her mother worries about who will care for her daughter if she does not marry. We can still care for her now, but we wont be here forever, Zhai Liping, 53, said. We hope she will find someone who cares for her, so we can feel more reassured. Still, Wu is single and she said she is still determined to wait until she meets the right person.Back in the old times, many people met because they were introduced and just wanted to find a partner to live through everyday life, she said. There were very few people who had a free relationship based on love. Now lots of people reject that kind of old attitude and want to find the suitable person."
59042b687be9e02646bdca89,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before Mamata",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/573895/after-singur-ruling-challenge-mamata.html,2016-10-03,"After Singur ruling, the challenge before MamataDrimi Chaudhuri, Kolkata, Oct 04, 2016, 23:57 ISTMamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and Trinamool Congress chairperson, did the unlikely. She kept her promise and returned the land to the protesting farmers of Singur. Ironically, with that, Mamata celebrated the defeat of her own state government!On September 14, a fortnight after the Supreme Court found the acquisition process at Singur in 2006 done without due process of law, and ordered that the land be returned to farmers, Mamata  Didi to her followers and well-wishers  organised a meet at the hamlet in Hooghly district.Supposed to be an administrative event, it turned into a victory rally of her party. She declared that she kept her promises and handed out land deeds and compensation cheques to the farmers.Even though the defeat is to be counted on the columns of the erstwhile Left Front administration, in effect, Mamata was celebrating the defeat of the government she leads. And she could not be happier. What seemed impossible even a month ago is now a reality and she has been able to keep her most difficult promise. For her and for her party, life has come a full circle.This does not make Mamatas job any easier. Even though she managed to keep her word, when the land was acquired, she was in the Opposition. Later, the challenge was to stop Singur from happening and prevent the Left from acquiring the land. After this, the challenge was to wrest power.Now, the scenario has changed. She is the chief minister and cannot claim any unfriendliness with the industry. And with every passing day till January next, when Mamata has her annual Biswa Bangla business summit, things will get harder.With the annual ball in mind  where she invites and pampers captains of industry from India and abroad  her team has been working hard. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the states nodal agency, formed a committee six months ago and top officials have been travelling around the globe, seeking commitments of attendance. Mamata herself had recently been to Europe, meeting honchos from BMW and other companies to ensure the summit is well-attended.The challenge before her is to prove the summit is not just another gathering, but that there will be some serious commitments from the industry.It was keeping these aspects in mind that she announced from the stage at Singur on September 14 about the available land and invited Tata Motors, BMW or anybody else to set up an automobile factory. Insiders say she knows BMW is not likely to come calling, and that her invite was more for the sake of Tata.With her vote bank in mind, she kept at her policy of no forcible land acquisition and announced a number of sops, including state support to set up farming infrastructure once again, from one-time grants to easily available loans.At the same time, instead of ordering officials to demolish the factory shed at Singur, she put the process on hold, urging Tatas to take care of their belongings.This is in sharp contrast to her days of Singur movement, when she inspired supporters to break down the factory wall.Now, the administration has put up posters to prevent the same acts that became the hallmark of her movement back in 2006. Insiders also whisper of the back channels that she has opened up through state Finance Minister Amit Mitra, a former FICCI head.If getting industry is the proverbial tip of the iceberg, she also needs to deal with a number of undercurrents at Singur. At some of the villages in Singur, most residents are share-croppers and landless workers who formed the most militant faction of her agitation.Since they were the least to gain from the factory coming up, they were the most invested in the movement. Under the changed scenario, they dont yet know how long the states monthly allowance of Rs 2,000 and Rs 2 per kg rice will continue. They also dont know what will happen after the dust settles since Mamata had nothing much on offer for them.Uncultivable landIn 2006, when the acquisition process started, the most eager section included absentee landlords, who formed nearly 70% of land-holders. Their eagerness stemmed from the fact that share-croppers and landless workers, till then backed by the Lefts farming organisation, Krishak Sabha, held an upper hand over the landlords.Added to this is the realisation that the land might not retain its earlier fertility. Of the total 997 acres acquired for the project, 300 acres have been used to build the shed, roads, drainage and other infrastructure inside the abandoned premises.Uncertainty has cropped up on whether these areas can ever be cultivable again. This has made a large section of land owners consider selling their holdings, now that they have got it back.Land prices plummeted once the Tatas left and even though there are willing sellers, prices remain uncertain. Then there is the local youth, who have seen the worst aspects of the movement and were witness to a changing economic scene. These youngsters coming from the middle class and agrarian families have lost it all to the political upheaval which hit their growing years at every step. And most of them want a factory to come up at Singur.The circle that came full over a decade has led Mamata into yet another circle. A decade ago, as a firebrand Opposition leader on the brink of ignominy, with hardly any political capital to show, things looked much different for her. The landscape, however, looks altered when she stares down from the chief ministers office.Mamata might get her name etched on pages of history but that will not help her get investment, while keeping her rural, agrarian vote bank pacified. In the end, a hard-earned victory could turn into a Greek tragedy, where the heros fate is sealed because of a weak heel."
59042b9d7be9e02646bdcab2,Mouth-watering Kashmiri delicacy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/520866/mouth-watering-kashmiri-delicacy.html,2016-01-02,"Zulfikar Majid in Srinagar Jan 03, 2016, 23:59 ISTThe high-calorie mutton halwa requires long hours of preparationAs snow has draped the lofty mountains of the Kashmir Valley causing a dip in the mercury, Harissa, the mouth-watering mutton delicacy, is in huge demand these days. Harissa, a delicacy of Kashmir made only in winter, tempts people living here so much that whenever they choose to relish special dish, it first comes to their mind.Surviving the onslaught of junk food, old city of Srinagar is dotted with many Harissa shops but famous among them are mostly located in Aali Kadal and adjoining areas. Braving bone-chilling cold, people in small groups jostle through dense fog in the wee hours and swarm around these unique shops. Forgetting their worldly problems for some moments, they sit around a steaming earthen pot warmed by firewood in the shop and keenly watch every movement of a man using a big wooden spoon called dhagun in local parlance.Though the high-calorie delicacy requires long hours of preparation and is costly, people still prefer it due to its unique taste. If you have eaten Harissa once, you simply cannot ignore it, goes the old saying in Kashmir. Some call Harissa mutton halwa, as it is made of mutton with addition of rice or wheat as well as spices.The concoction is heated and constantly stirred for hours together until it becomes mushy and pasty. Onions fried in oil or ghee till they become golden brown, are poured onto it and when served at the caf or packed for home delivery, Kashmiri raita or kebabs are also added.Mohammad Shafi, 60, who owns one of the oldest Harissa shops in Srinagar is over-busy these days. We start making Harissa after first snowfall. Usually Harrisa season begins from November but its at peak in December and January, Shafi told Deccan Herald as he served Harissa to his customers from a big earthen pot known locally as mat, which is kept warm by firewood beneath it.As he adds cooking oil to the delicacy, a large number of people, including aged men, throng the shop. His son warms the traditional Kashmiri bread known as chout and sets plates as the customers wait. A kg of quality Harissa costs between Rs 900 and Rs 1,000, a plateful Rs 80-100.On an average I sell 40 kg in a day during peak winter as there is a huge demand for it. Some people pack and take it to home to eat with their families. Ive kept food-grade airtight containers for them, Shafi said. Some customers send Harissa to different parts of the country like Delhi and Mumbai for their relatives or officials. But Harissas shelf life is short and has to be consumed in three days, he said. It tastes best when its fresh, he adds.Harissa making is an arduous task rather an art which one learns by constant practice. I learnt it as a child by watching my late father. Our family is in this trade for over 100 years. People can make it at home, but they should use earthen pots instead of copper utensils to make it tastier, Shafi said.For the past some years, some affluent Kashmiri families have started the practice of sending large quantities of Harissa to the families of their newly-wed daughters. Normally, a well-to-do father sends five to seven kg of Harrisa to his daughters new home. We dress such gifts with kebabs to make the dish more attractive, Shafi said.According to him, no one knows the real way to prepare the dish except for a few families from the old city. After my fathers death, I decided to carry the business forward as it is a tradition of Kashmir, he says while emphasising how important it is to retain a connection to ones roots and to keep the traditions alive.Muzaffar Ahmad Shah, a businessman who had come from uptown to downtown to purchase two kg of Harrisa for his family, said: When I crave for Harissa are the only days when I wake up in the wee hours in winter.I have become a Harissa addict by relishing it for past 24 years. It (Harissa) is delicious and I relish it on every weekend during winters with my family. As Harissa shops open in the wee hours, one has to reach early in the morning in biting cold, Shah said.Some historians attribute Harissas origin in Kashmir to Central Asia, which influenced the art, custom, rituals, belief and the food culture of the Kashmiris. And thus they got the blessing in the form of a flavoursome delight, now known as Harissa.According to reputable historian of Kashmir Fida Hasnain, Mirza Hyder Duglat of Yarkand brought Harissa making to Kashmir during Chak period in 1540.Zareef Ahmad Zareef, a Kashmiri poet and considered an authority on Kashmirs cultural history, traced the roots of Harissa to the Mughal period. During Afghan rule Harissa was formally introduced in its present form in the Kashmir Valley. At that time the economic condition of Kashmiris was not good and they could not afford to relish Harissa. Instead, they would boil turnips as they were cheap alternative to Harissa. However, Mughals used to boil sheep feet known as Pacha to make a kind of Harissa, he said.Known for his satirical poetry, Zarief minces no words to say that Harissa was misused extensively as a means of corruption in Kashmir. Some people used to send Harissa to government officials and ministers for favours, he said. But Harissa has become a part and parcel of our culture now. It is also sent to in-laws after engagements and marriages as a token of love. Now Kashmiri Harissa is famous world over.Medicos say that Harissa is a good source of protein for humans. Harissa has muscle and tissue building protein. It should be consumed in the proportion of one gram of per kg of body weight, according to doctors. However, overeating Harissa can be counterproductive to health and lead to significant weight gain, doctors say.A story still told to children by parents is about an Afghan governor of Kashmir in the past who liked the dish so much that he did not know where to stop. He simply over-ate himself to death."

It was 1980s and everything was bright and well with the oil-rich country. We had a delightful time and enjoyed the low cost of living and the other umpteen conveniences and privileges given to us by the Ministry of Education.I was posted to a prestigious girls school in Kaduna city. The school had a strength of 1,000 girls who were distributed over 10 well-maintained houses which formed the main hostel. We were there for a long period of 8 years, during which we learned a lot about the Nigerian culture and traditions. The former British colony enjoyed the sincere encouragement given to it in the fields of education and health. Innumerable schools and hospitals had been built with the aim of developing the country.Different Nigerian states had different cultures and it was indeed tough to unite them completely. Kaduna had a big chunk of the traditional Hausa people who were peace-loving and religious. The missionary institutions in various parts of Nigeria in the form of schools and hospitals offered education and relief from the killer disease, malaria. The students, and the local people in general, had great respect and love for the Indian teachers which made our life amid them really enjoyable.It was a fine Saturday morning, and I was relaxing with my family in our quarters when Dr Reji, one of our close friends, walked in with his usual sweet smile. He asked me whether I was game for a trip to Kano, a three-hour journey from Kaduna. I knew that I would enjoy every minute of the trip as Dr Reji was a fun-loving guy.We started our Kano trip around 10 am and were supposed to have our lunch in one of the way side restaurants. Around 12 pm, we came across a beautifully decorated restaurant and decided to have our lunch there. As we entered, our eyes were drawn towards a big black menu board which contained the names of all the delicacies they had. We were, however, attracted towards one item displayed because of its special name.It was called Spare Parts Curry. Having decided to go with it, we were placing the order for rice and spare parts curry when the manager of the restaurant came to us and asked if we had tasted the dish before. We replied in the negative. He ordered the waiters to bring one plate of the so-called Spare Parts Curry.Lo, it was nothing but the waste parts of chicken  the bony legs, nails, head et al! The manager informed us that it was very tasty and urged us to try it. As opposed to my taste, my friend Dr Reji ordered one more plate of the curry and told me that he would pack another for his wife. I, for one, ate rice with a delicious fish curry (which tasted like the Kerala pearl fish curry). It was an unforgettable Nigerian lunch, indeed, the memory of which I cherish till today!"
59042cb77be9e02646bdcb85,Where beggars were choosers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/545835/where-beggars-were-choosers.html,2016-05-11,"Where beggars were choosersBy Snehlatha Baliga, May 12, 2016, DHNS 0:16 ISTMany beggars have bank balances running into lakhs, reported a newspaper some time back. The educated form a big percentage of the beggar population in our country, announced a recent survey. Such reports bring back my childhood memories in a close-knit town of Kerala (now is a big city) where beggars were a part, albeit remote, of society rather than faceless entities.It was a time when giving alms was looked upon as ones duty and a way of helping a fellow being in distress rather than an insult to humanity and endorsement of idleness. The social scenario then had its own way of efficiently and instantly lapping up the problems thrown by the society, and the issues of destitutes and beggars were one of them.Beggar colonies were unheard of, as were starvation deaths. Beggars were seldom shooed away to make way for VIPs and their visits, for they restricted themselves to their shelters in temple compounds and other public places that could afford to house them and made their presence felt only one day a week.Beggars begged out of real and utter helplessness, thankful for what ever they got and seldom laid their hands on what ever came their way. Perhaps, all this lent a semblance of respectability even to this group. The aim of this write-up is not to glorify beggary but to recall the interesting characters who frequented our locality and how things were then.The sick and the infirm, the old and handicapped, childless couples with none to fall back on  the households were familiar with them all and took their weekly visits in their stride.Questions were seldom asked, judgements rarely passed and none went back empty handed because it was just a few handful of grains that each household had to spare to nurture a life or two.There was this interesting old man who collected a cup of rice from one house, dal from another, a bowl of oil from a third, couple of potatoes and papads from others, thus filling up his larder for the coming week. The coins that he earned could have gone into buying spices, fuel , tea and milk, I suppose. A fine example of prudent management of resources and life!The Hindi-speaking Kamalabai-Damodar pair, who managed to eke out their living despite the language barrier is still etched in my memory. The dominating wife and the hapless husband often formed the subject of discussion for the families during times of limited modes of recreation. I remember how Kamalabai once gulped down a coconut shell full of pickle that my mother gave meant to last them for days, just to spite the husband who looked on helplessly!Beggars on the move caught my attention when my sister got married and train travels to visit her became frequent. The blind beggar on the train, who groomed himself in the waiting room mirror unaware of being watched; the mute who distributed printed matter attested by some obscure VIP explaining his plight and requesting help (which the VIP himself couldve have done) became all to familiar to me.These days, in mega city Bengaluru, my encounters with this tribe is limited mostly to the traffic signals. Here, they seem have devised their own ways to suit the fast city that shelters them."
59042d817be9e02646bdcc22,Diabetes and diet:  the low-carb debate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/572608/diabetes-diet-low-carb-debate.html,2016-09-26,"Diabetes and diet: the low-carb debateBy Gina Kolata, Sep 27, 2016, International New York Times 23:58 ISTA few years ago, Dr Richard Kahn, the now-retired chief scientific and medical officer of the American Diabetes Association, was charged with organising a committee to prescribe a diet plan for people with diabetes. He began by looking at the evidence for different diets, asking which, if any, best controlled diabetes.When you look at the literature, whoa is it weak. It is so weak, Kahn said in a recent interview. Studies tended to be short term, diets unsustainable, differences among them clinically insignificant. The only thing that really seemed to help people with diabetes was weight loss  and for weight loss, there is no magic diet.But people want diet advice, Kahn reasoned, and the association really should say something about diets. So it, like the National Institutes of Health, went with the Department of Agricultures food pyramid.Why? Its a diet for all America, Kahn said. It has lots of fruit and vegetables and a reasonable amount of fat.That advice, though, recently came under attack in a New York Times commentary written by Sarah Hallberg, an osteopath at a weight loss clinic in Indiana, and Osama Hamdy, the medical director of the obesity weight loss programme at the Joslin Diabetes Centre at Harvard Medical School.There is a diet that helps with diabetes, the two doctors said: one that restricts  or, according to Hallberg, severely restricts  carbohydrates.If the goal is to get patients off their medications, including insulin, and resolve rather than just control their diabetes, significant carb restriction is by far the best nutrition plan, Hallberg said in an email.This would include elimination of grains, potatoes and sugars and all processed foods. There is a significant and ever growing body of literature that supports this method. She is in private practice at Indiana University Health Arnett Hospital and is medical director of a startup developing nutrition-based medical interventions.But there are no large and rigorous studies showing that low-carbohydrate diets offer an advantage, and, in fact, there is not even a consensus on the definition of a low-carbohydrate diet  it can vary from doctor to doctor.There have been debates for literally the whole history of diabetes about which kind of diet is best, said Dr C Ronald Kahn, chief academic officer at Joslin, and no relation to Richard Kahn. But, he said, the answer isnt so straightforward.In support of a diet like Hallbergs, there is one recent short-term study, by Kevin Hall of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleagues, involving 17 overweight and obese men, none of whom had diabetes. They stayed in a clinical centre where they ate carefully controlled diets.The researchers asked what would happen if calories were kept constant but the carbohydrate composition of a diet varied from high to very low. The answer was that insulin secretion dropped 50% with the very low carbohydrate diet, meaning that much less insulin was required to maintain normal blood glucose levels.Since diabetes results when the body cant produce enough insulin, perhaps it is a good idea to reduce the amount of insulin it needs by eating very low carbohydrate diets, Hall said.Some longer-term studies, though, failed to show that low-carbohydrate diets benefited glucose control. Even if diets are effective in the short term, Hall said, the difficulty is adhering to the diet over the long term.In an analysis of weight loss diets (not specifically for diabetics) published this summer, he and Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa wrote: Diet adherence is so challenging that it is poor even in short-term studies where all food is provided. When diets are prescribed, adherence is likely to diminish over the long term despite self-reports to the contrary.But short-term studies of just a few weeks, which constitute the bulk of the diet studies, can be misleading, said C Ronald Kahn. In the short term, the low-carbohydrate diet sometimes does better on glycaemic control, he said. But as time progresses, the difference mostly disappears. What counts is which diet helps most with long-term weight loss.The reason the advantage sometimes seen with a low-carbohydrate diet tends to vanish, C Ronald Kahn added, is probably a mixture of people failing to adhere to the diets and their bodies adjusting to them.Lon-term impactAnother issue with low-carbohydrate diets, researchers said, is the question of what will happen to overall health if diabetics actually follow the diet for years or decades. (Heart attacks are the major killer of people with diabetes.)Insulin levels may be better, but, said Dr Rudolph Leibel, co-director of Columbia Universitys Naomi Berrie Diabetes Centre, effects of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipoproteins and vascular biology could offset such a benefit. In other words, it is not clear if a lower insulin level would translate into fewer heart attacks.Hamdy, whose recommended low-carbohydrate diet is less restrictive than the one Hallberg suggests, reports that many patients in his clinic have been able to stay with the diet for as long as five years, losing weight and keeping it off. He presented his study at the 2015 annual conference of the American Diabetes Association and has submitted it for publication. It involved 129 patients. Half were able to lose weight and keep it off, and those who did maintained an average weight loss of 9.5%. Their diabetes was much improved.It is impossible, Hamdy said, to separate weight loss from the diets effects on diabetes because people following such a diet  which limits but does not forbid things like breads, pasta and rice  also lose weight.But multiple studies have found that when it comes to weight loss  the only proven way to help with blood sugar control over the long term  there is no difference among diets that restrict calories, fat or carbohydrates.Experts like David Nathan, director of the diabetes centre and clinical research centre at Massachusetts General Hospital and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, advise dieting for people with diabetes.But, he said, when we advise people to be on diets, the major goal is to lose weight. What matters the most for controlling diabetes, Nathan said, is how much weight you lose."

The temple is located 85 km from Rajahmundry in the picturesque Konaseema area surrounded by coconut trees on the banks of the River Vridha Gautami.All one has to do is go to the website and submit details such as birth star of the girl or boy whose marriage is delayed. The website then offers three different dates. After booking Kalyanam (celestial wedding) of the deity and paying Rs 800 a receipt is generated. The speciality of the temple is that the wedding of the deity is performed at night. Those who cant travel all the way to Muramalla can also book the Kalyanam by paying the fee through money order and the purohits at the temple will perform it for them.The Kalyanam is believed to solve problems of the unemployed and unsuccessful and those having problems in studies and not getting opportunities to go abroad. Those booking for the Kalyanam will have specify the purpose of the pooja. The temple provides everything for the celestial wedding except a few articles that one needs to purchase from the shops near the temple which might cost around Rs 200.The process starts with three circumambulations of the temple by the performing boy or girl or her family members along with the Palkin carrying the Utsavigrahs of the deity. Following which the deities are placed in the kalyana mantapam which can accommodate around 100 people. A group of trained priests performs the celestial wedding in a smooth manner and offer Ganeswara Puja, Punya Vachanam, Kankana and Yagnopaveetha Dharana, Kanyadanam, Sumuhoortam and Sutradharana. The devotees get a chance to understand the process.On any given day not less than 80 people participate in the Kalyanam. It is believed that the wishes of the devotees are granted immediately and the legend never failed, says Akella Satyanarayana, a priest at the temple.He says that people can book at the counter on the temple premises. The devotees and their kin can avail a free meal offered as a service by the donors. A piping hot sumptuous dinner is served after the completion of the Kalyanam, which generally ends around 10 pm. Many consider this meal as a celestial gift.We are asked to send this akshintalu (turmeric-laced raw rice grains) and a piece of jacket cloth given to us to my daughter who is in the USA. She is not getting a good marriage proposal due to some problem in her horoscope. So I booked through the website and I hope soon she will get married, a father, who performed the Kalyanam on behalf of his daughter, said. He said that many have confirmed that Muramalla is the destination for people whose marriage is delayed. Every day dozens of young men and women perform the Kalyanam hoping that they will also get married. After their wishes are fulfilled devotees bring their married children to the temple to perform the celestial wedding of the lord once again as a thanksgiving.According to the temple literature, Muramalla is the place where Lord Shiva married Bhadrakali in Gandharva style. The wedding was performed to pacify a furious avatara of Rudra after the self-immolation of Sati Devi at Daksha Yagna. It is believed Adi Parasakshi sent her to earth to bring peace. At the very place Munimandala (a congregation of sages), now known as Muramalla, Rudra and Bhadrakali were married. It is also said that every day sages such as Agastya, Suka, Viswamitra, Vasishta, Goutam, Bhargava, Bharadwaja, Mareecha, Kasyapa, Markandeya and Narada visit the Munimandala to witness the celestial wedding performed at night.The legend says that around hundred years ago a local chieftain Veluvali Sarabha Raju of Komaragiri wanted to reconstruct the dilapidated temple at Muramalla. However, the Linga which they were carrying to a new place grew and became heavy. Upon the advice of the lord himself they said to have erected the Linga at the place where the new temple in Muramalla now is located. The kalyana mantapa was built by one Routu Peramma, a Dravidian queen who was saved by the Lord while her boat was about to capsize in the Bay of Bengal.Muramalla is also unique as it has no flour mill or grinders. There is a belief that any work related to rotors and motors wont flourish in Murmalla. The temple which provides paid accommodation to devotees earns a considerable amount from the 200 acres of land donated by land lords of I Polavaram village. Free annadana is done every day with help of donations given by devotees from across the globe.Just 51 km from Muramalla is another temple which fulfills the wishes of employees who want a transfer. Devotees believe that one visit to the temple will result in the long pending transfer. The Jagan Mohini Kesava Swamy temple is situated between the rivers Vashista and Gautami, tributaries of the River Godavari. The famous temple is the birthplace of Purusha Shakti concept. The only other temple of Mohini avatar is in Mhalasa in Ponda, Goa.The black idol which is 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide depicts Kesava or Lord Vishnu in the front and Jaganmohini in the rear with hairdo. Also carved into the idol below is the image of the Akasha Ganga or the image of Goddess Ganga washing the feet of Sri Maha Vishnu."

The disturbance in that region is now subsiding, but the question remains: how to ensure its non-recurrence in future? Is there any solution to this vexed problem?The Cauvery water sharing issue between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu dates back to 1892 and 1924 when the British Presidency of Madras and the Mysore State entered into such an agreement.Before it lapsed in 1974, a subsequent arrangement was made by the Government of India in 1972.At the request of Tamil Nadu in 1986, and through subsequent intervention by the apex court, the Central government constituted the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal under the Inter-State Water Disputes Act in 1990.The Tribunals final award came in 2007, which the Central government notified in February 2013. Under the final award, the total availability of water in the Cauvery basin, with 81,155 square km area and having many tributaries, was assessed at 740 tmc (thousand million cubic feet). Tamil Nadu was allocated 419 tmc against a demand of 562 tmc, and Karnataka 270 tmc against a demand of 465 tmc.In distress years, the allocated shares would be proportionately reduced among the three riparian states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry. A mechanism of Cauvery Management Board (CMB) and Cauvery Regulation Committee (CRC), having representatives of all co-basin states, is also envisaged under the award. Such a mechanism is yet to be formalised. The award also says that in a normal year, 192 tmc of water will be released by Karnataka to Tamil Nadu while also detailing the monthly break-up of such release in a year.The Cauvery river water is monsoon dependent. Erratic monsoons lower water availability in the region. This has happened in the past when the apex court came to the rescue of the lower riparian state. In September 2012, it directed Karnataka to release 10,000 cusecs of water per day during Sept 12-19. Similar intervention was seen in 2013.Before 2013, the Cauvery River Authority, headed by the prime minister, while the Cauvery Management Committee, chaired by the secretary of the Water Resources Ministry, used to handle the day to day water sharing arrangement in crisis years. These arrangements have been superseded by the formulation of the CMB and the CRC, which are yet to be constituted.Water management has two sides: the supply side and the demand side. What is being contested now is the supply side of the issue. In the Cauvery basin, the erratic monsoon would cause less availability of water in every drought year.But even in normal years, it is unlikely that the demand on Cauvery water can be met, due to increase in demand of water in agricultural, industrial and domestic sectors, concomitant with the surging growth in our population and economy.Hence, a need for managing the demand side of water use is of utmost importance.There is, in fact, enormous scope for reducing the demand of water use in various sectors: for example, in agriculture, the water use efficiency is much less compared to international standards. In the industrial sector, Indian industries consume about 2 to 3.5 times more water per unit of production compared to similar plants operating in other countries.The ratio of water consumption to economic value creation is much less in Indian industry compared to many other countries, for instance, the United Kingdom. In the domestic sector, the water conveyance loss is even more than 30%.The demand side management also calls for water conservation, through recycle and reuse of water. For example, in Israel, through use of advanced urban water management systems, about 80% of domestic water is recycled and reused in agricultural sector. In India, about 80% of available water is used in agriculture, so micro irrigation and crop rotation can be used to match water use with its quantum of supply.Samba crop of TNFor example, the samba rice crop production in Tamil Nadu during August-November requires a huge amount of water, and time has come when a rethink is needed for growing crops which use more water. The per drop more crop policy of thegovernment needs to be implemented in right earnest.Similarly, in industrial sector, water use audit is a must, and zero discharge policy should be encouraged. In the domestic sector, too, rain water harvesting and aquifer recharge should be effectively implemented in addition to reducing water loss during conveyance to its barest minimum.An intense discussion and debate is called for early on this subject. In fact, The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) in its World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) being held during October 5-8, 2016 is focussing on the theme Beyond 2015: People, Planet and Progress, and has already lined up a few sessions on these issues as a part of the overall scheme for achieving global SDGs on water.Given the finite water resources availability, unless water use is efficient in future years, the Cauvery type of water problem is likely to occur in many other parts of the country, leading to India becoming a water scarce country by 2050  a situation which should be avoided at all costs!(The writer, former Secretary, Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India, is now Distinguished Fellow, The Energy and Resources Institute.

The place is pulsating with activity and bonhomie; the mulch and the traffic in the backdrop is not a deterrent either. Soon I long for the weekly high... Wondering what this is all about? Well, it is the liveliness of a typical weekly vegetable market! Called the weekly santh, this is a diminishing culture in the city but still prevails in some villages and towns.Being a bit old fashioned in some ways, I like to pick and choose my vegetables and scan for their freshness. Most often, as I do this, the recipe is already taking shape in my mind. I like the fresh greens smiling at me from my basket, and I thoroughly enjoy the vendors boastings. Though I live in a locality with surplus vegetable shops, the attraction to shop at the santh is immense. Somehow, the affability a local market has to offer goes missing in the choreographed atmosphere of a supermarket.The Sunday santh in an area close to where I live stretches for nearly a kilometre end-to-end, right next to a flyover. Vendors spread their produce on self-appointed areas on the adjoining footpath. There is an air of action and it starts early, progressing through the day.Apart from vegetables, there is a spice vendor, a woman selling pulses and tamarind, dry fruits and nuts; while others have puffed rice and flakes; pumpkins and ash gourds the size of mini drums, heaps of fancy greens beckoning you, all add to the colourful melee.A man busily tosses fresh cabbages into a mound, while another expertly piles cauliflowers. An ajji (granny) proudly sells a small batch of gourds from her backyard whilst the coconut, in reply to a knock, gives an account of its inner vitality in a strange language known only to its seller.As the panorama unfolds, there is a lot of hustle and tussle with people scampering for purchasing; vendors unloading their wares, buyers haggling; and yet others demanding their set places. Some tech-savvy vendors frequently check their mobile phones or tune in to FM radio as they go about their business, while the buyers hop, skip and jump the hurdles to grab the bargains. Mid-morning, the air fills with the aroma of flavoured rice, tea and coffee  with caterers looking after the needs of the vendors.Soon you are hooked to your regular vendors who are ready to have a chat with you, choose the best, fresh produce and give feedback in the next visit. Some are friendly, take criticism positively and compensate to the best of their capacity. In no time, you catch up to their frequency and strike a good bargain. When weary of the spoils, the tender coconut seller offers respite with a refreshing drink. With batteries recharged, you get into the fray again.I am yet to tire of this mania or the routine, for the place seems to have an unknown magnetism. I look forward to every Sunday for a new experience and a surge of enthusiasm engulfs me as I pick up my big basket."

After retirement, Mr C settled down in Delhi and Mr P in Bengaluru, but they made it a point to keep in touch with each other on phone and via email.Mrs C planned to go out of Delhi for two weeks once and when Mr P learnt about it, he invited his friend to Bengaluru instead of spending the hot summer alone, an invitation his friend readily accepted. Thus, Mr C landed at his friends house late one night.In the morning, there was a knock on his door and the helper brought him the very own south Indian kaapi in a steel tumbler. C sahib hated the smell but politely accepted it and added loads of sugar to gulp it down his throat.C sahib and his friend sat in the lawn, reading newspapers, interspersed with the gossip of the days, when Mrs P walked up to them and announced that the breakfast was ready. By sheer habit, he was hoping to see aloo, puree, pickles and egg bhhujia, but instead found idli, dosa, vada and sambar with the attendant chutneys. The breakfast was served in a silver thaali.Mr C was flummoxed and waited for the host and the hostess to take the lead. Being accustomed to using both hands in tearing his purees apart into bits and pieces, he found himself handicapped, having to rest his left hand on the knee.The friends spent their morning sightseeing and came home for lunch. What Mr C found on the lunch table was yet another unfamiliar sight. As he started digging in, he was given a detailed introduction by Mrs P somewhat like, Mr C, meet Mr Kharabhaat, made out of rice and lentils. Mrs Rasam was served in small bowls and there was left over sambar from the morning to complete the meal. The meal ended with curd rice which Mr C laced with pickles to convert the blandness into spiciness.Coconut seemed to be the backbone of the meals. He was hoping to be served a Patiala peg but was insteadoffered some fresh coconut water.However, in about five days, Mr C got so hooked to the south Indian dishes that Mrs P had to double the produc-tion and spray red pepper flakes on the dosas.Back home, after Mrs C had come back from her holiday, Mr C came to the dining table to find the oil-laced bhaturas and channa laid out. He threw a fit and demanded idli sambar, kharabhaat and coconut chutney. Mrs C, who didnt know how to react to this outburst, kept a glum face and kept out of trouble by leaving the dining room.Mr C then enrolled his driver, Raghu, to drive him to various Udupi hotels and eateries located in different parts of Delhi. He also made it a point to carry a flask to bring home a few cups of Darshini-like coffee.Post script. It is reliably learnt that Mrs C is taking practical lessons in South Indian culinary meals from Mrs Gowda, living on the sixth floor of their apartment complex. She also spends many hours on YouTube watching demonstrations of making idlis, dosas and other south Indian dishes."

But it was not to be. Ramila is among the many in the impoverished areas of Vadodaras old city area who have been left out of the scheme as they do not fulfill the criteria.The final list of beneficiaries released by the state government for Vadodara shows that a higher number of cards have been distributed in pockets where mostly middle-class families inhabit. On Wednesday, in an elaborate function at the Akota stadium in the city, 31,357 beneficiaries of the scheme will receive their Annapurna cards, but many families in Vadodara are unable to fathom why their names were deleted from the final list released on March 15, after an initial inclusion in the interim list of beneficiaries on March 3. Under the scheme, a beneficiary holding the Annapurna card will receive wheat at Rs 2 per kilo and rice at Rs 3 per kilo. Currently, Above Poverty Line (APL) card holding families are entitled to a monthly stock of 2.5 kg wheat per member of the family at Rs 7.70 per kg.Ramilas husband, Ramesh, is a daily wager and the oldest of her three children collects sticks to sell them off to poor families for an additional income. Ramila says, There are days when we do not have money to buy any food. We subsist on the wheat that we buy from the fair price store on our ration cards and some spices mixed with oil.Ramila says she had applied for the Annapurna card, but her name does not feature among the 200 beneficiaries who have been chosen from the area. According to the guidelines, each rationing shop was to be allowed 81% cards of its total list of ration card holders. Ramilas fair price shop, however, has received only 200-odd clearances.Sunita Chaudhari is also among those whose form has been rejected for the Annapurna scheme. This, despite the fact that she entered the details of an ailing husband, under one of the required columns. Sunitas husband, Ashwin, worked as a daily wage painter until he slipped into coma after an accidental fall, three years ago. Since then, Ashwin has been unable to walk, forcing Sunita to take up jobs as a domestic help in affluent areas of the city. I have no breadwinner in the family. When our form was rejected, I found out that more forms were cleared from affluent areas where Annapurna cards are not necessary, Sunita says.Another resident of Fatehpura, Nazir Mohammed, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, said that despite the specific column seeking details of terminally ill patients, his form was rejected. To register their protest, fair price shop owners association handed over a memorandum to the District Collector last week, seeking probe into the distribution of cards. The association alleged that Annapurna cards were cleared for shops that did not need them, in connivance with officials.Vadodaras District Supply Officer B B Chaudhari said that the names could have been deleted due to a technical glitch and the people could re-apply to seek the cards.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

When questioned by us later for such singular gratefulness displayed after a painful punishment, he said, Thank god, he didnt thrash me 13 times. My grandfather explained that it was a fatalistic approach, for it could have been worse.Not that his thanks were reserved for only human beings. On one occasion, when he was speeding home, Jimmy, the Shylokian Alsatian, sprang on him and claimed an ounce of his thigh muscle. Yet, the shaken Nattu thanked the animal. When the first of the course of 13 or so injections was embroidered around his navel, he explained the reason: He deserved thanks for not going further up and causing unmentionable damage.It was de rigueur for him to say thanks to his bride, Santha, for lowering her neck to have the thali tied around. And dhanyam vadaami in Sanskrit to the pundit who solemnised the wedding after chanting mantras in Sanskrit in full throated, booming and resonant voice. As the love-hate relationship of marital life gathered pitch and vigour, the quarrels that kicked off with verbal skirmishes graduated to weaponry attacks with vessels, utensils, cutlery and crockery.During one such skirmish, I happened to make an injudicious entry. Nattu was ducking the missiles of cups, katoris and rolling pins, muttering the words thanks, thanks and thanks as each one of the objects whizzed past his head. Obviously, his thanks were dedicated to her supreme kindness in not choosing the heavier rice cooker, electric stove or grinding stone instead.Considering his track record, he was chosen unopposed to propose a vote of thanks during the first anniversary of our book club. After a seemingly interminable elocution of star speakers, Nattu began laboriously thanking the owner who rented out the hall, the guys who cleaned it up, those who donated the shawls, manned the amplifier, took still photographs, drafted, printed and posted the invitations, served coffee at the foyer and the weather gods for not sending rains, to name a few.Irked by this, the committee passed a resolution that Nattu be relieved of such duties. His cryptic reaction (you would have guessed!) was a deadpan thanks."

Since the option of import is limited, the bottomline is we need to boost domestic production and productivity,"" CEA Arvind Subramanian told reporters after submitting the report to the finance minister.Among steps required to be taken immediately, he said the procurement of kharif pulses should be geared up in a war footing mode to support farmers as prices of moong have dropped below the minimum support price (MSP) and even tur prices are heading lower.To encourage farmers to grow pulses in coming seasons, he suggested a hike in MSP of gram by Rs 500 per quintal to Rs 4,000 for the 2016 rabi season to start from the next month.He also recommended a sharp hike in MSP of tur and urad to Rs 6,000 for the kharif 2017. At present, the MSP of tur and urad is Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,000 per quintal, respectively.""MSP for other pulses should be increased by the same per cent as calculated in this report for tur, urad and gram,"" he said further and suggested that the farm price advisory body CACP should review its methodology to fix MSP for various crops.He also said MSP of tur should be raised to Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018 when short duration kharif variety is ready for commercialisation.Asked if hike in pulse MSP will impact inflation, he said, ""I don't think increase in MSP will have any impact on inflation. The MSP increase will boost supply in the immediate term and bring down prices.""To encourage pulses in irrigated areas and rice fallows, the CEA suggested that the government should give production subsidies of about Rs 10-15 per kg to farmers via DBT.Stating that MSP alone will not be enough to induce farmers to switch to pulses, Subramanian said, ""This kharif season, the government should launch a war-effort to procure moong, tur and urad at their respective MSPs. It is meaningless if MSP is not backed up by procurement.""He also asked the government not to take ""blunt steps"" to check prices and called for immediate lifting of ban on exports and stock limits on traders.Since pulse yields in India are below the world average, the CEA favoured development of GM technology to boost production and productivity, to boot. ""We need to clearly signal that we are open to GM technology in pulses,"" he said."

I name it and get a restaurant-grade dish, some of them I cant even name.Initially  I mean just after marriage  I prepared fish fry, fried rice and even rasagolla. My friends in Bengaluru used to love my fish fry and rasagolla. So, I thought even he will be amazed to taste it. But within a few days, he made tea first and then chicken, fish, fried rice and what not. I had never expected this and I never dared to cook those items again.I understood the meaning of role reversal quite early. He can cook a variety of cuisines and I have learnt to help him in the kitchen. After two years of marriage, I now know how to make a perfect tea. Coffee is still in the learning stage.I cant cut vegetables the way he cuts. I cant make a Chinese dish like he does. I can never bake a cake like he does. It is just too professional. He knows the measurement, the technique and, of course, the presentation too. Oh my god, I never knew so many things! He cooks for my friends too. From a welcome drink to a dessert, my friends can have everything at my place. I know now, that when it comes to the kitchen, its his playground. I am happy to sit back and relax.My parents have found a son-in-law who cooks everything. My mom says I should not complain because my husband knows how to cook. Thereby, he has the power of immunity  he gets all the credit for having this bit of expertise. Some people believe that I dont know cooking because my husband is a chef. Is that true? Well, heres the truth. I have accepted the fact that I can make ghar ka khana while I am also happy to serve his hotel-style food.My husband does not like his own chapattis but he loves my chapattis. In fact, he never attempts to make chapattis. He loves the breakfast I make and he enjoys eating the roti and dal. In two years, we have learnt that he cannot have his delicious curry without my chapatti and I cant have a chapatti without a curry. We both love to cook and we both like to feed each other. Therefore, the lesson is this  cook with love.Love, The chefs wife"

This is the time when night shift workers and party hoppers pack up and go home to have a good days sleep. Once in Bangkok while briskly walking on the footpath, I heard loud music blaring from a parked vehicle and saw empty liquor bottles indicating a pavement party. Some partying sex workers who were there accosted me and would not allow me to move forward. With great difficulty, I could sneak out. In Cape Town, a bunch of drunk goons were about to rob me and thanks to a police patrol car, I could get away to safety.Pre-dawn, is also the time to see and smell freshly arrived vegetables, fruits and flowers. Any passerby in front of K R Market in Mysuru will be exhilarated by the smell of Jasmine and sight of brinjals. Early birds in coastal towns can see freshly caught fish being sorted out and, if lucky, buy the best catch at reasonable price. Seeing the faces of satisfied fisherfolks coming back home with a substantial catch is elevating.Early mornings are also peoples fitness time. One can come across people walking, jogging, doing yoga, clapping their hands. In Hanoi, I saw a group of elderly women convert a footpath into a gym and perform Chinese dance.This is also the time to see different breeds of dogs. I was amused to see walkers in New York carrying plastic bags and scoops to take away their pet dogs poop. I was surprised that people in Antwerp allow their dogs to spoil pavements despite seeing warning signs of hefty fines.Mornings are the times to know the local breakfast habits. It is the time when roadside vendors do roaring business. In Saigon, one can see footpath vendors serving pho, a soup with rice noodles, to customers sitting on low plastic stools. In Ghana, it is burgers and sandwiches, whereas in Sri Lanka it is string hoppers with curry. While walking in the Little India area in Singapore the smell of fresh Idlis linger and while in Belgium, it is the smell of waffles and potato chips. The smell of filter coffee in Tamil Nadu makes one stop and savour a tumbler. It is a sight to see busy office goers grab a plateful of breakfast on the streets and rush to their offices.Dawns are also the time when the smell of printing ink wafts through. Road corners are full of newspaper vendors. As a media man once, I would learn which newspaper sells most in that town by talking to the vendors, apart from quickly glancing at all headlines. As the sun slowly rises, the air smells of petrol and diesel, the chirps of the birds recede and the city comes to life with a lot of noise. Mornings, wherever in the world, are a mirror to the lifestyle of the people of that place."

Of course, given the large role of cash in every day transaction in India's economy the currency transition would have to be managed prudently to minimise possible disruption,"" the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spokesman Gerry Rice told reporters at a news conference in response to a question.He was asked to comment on the Indian government's decision to withdraw Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes from circulation.""I am just saying that when countries make these kinds of move, which is not exceptional - countries do this quite often - the transition needs to be managed very well,"" Rice said in response to another question."
59043c227be9e02646bdd8c1,"Ahead of G20 meet, China tightens security",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/567991/ahead-g20-meet-china-tightens.html,2016-08-31,"Ahead of G20 meet, China tightens securityJane Perlez and Yufan Huang, Sep 1, 2016, International New York Times: 23:15 ISTThe govt is forcing residents to move out of buildings near the meeting site to diminish risk of protestsAs China prepares to host the Group of 20 economic summit meeting this weekend in Hangzhou, it is determined to show the world that it is an equal partner in one of the most exclusive clubs of wealthy nations.The conference, in this striking lakeside city south of Shanghai, will be the most significant gathering of world leaders in Chinas history, and President Xi Jinping has ordered stringent security to ensure it goes off without a hitch.The government is using all the levers of its authoritarian system, forcing residents to move out of buildings near the meeting site to diminish the risk of protests or attacks and telling workers to take vacations to help clear the city and present a sanitised version of one of Chinas most vibrant economic hubs.It has gone so far as to banish cooks who are Uighurs, a Muslim minority that has been accused of fomenting terrorism, from working at one restaurant in the city.Not for the first time, officials want to demonstrate to people at home and abroad that China, the worlds second-largest economy after the United States, deserves a bigger role in global governance.The rotating presidency, now held by China, is the culmination of a long battle for acceptance at the top of the international system. Though China is a member of the United Nations Security Council, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the World Trade Organisation, the countrys leadership feels as if it has been treated too much like a Johnny-come-lately at global summit meetings.The G20 appeals to China as a place to stake its influence because its members include some developing countries that Beijing enlists as friends, yet as a whole the group represents more than 80% of the world economy and a big portion of world trade.Hosting the G20 offers a significant opportunity for China to become a rule maker rather than a rule taker, said Zhu Jiejin, an associate professor of international relations at Fudan University. The G20 may not be a platform of bounding force, but at least it ensures we have equal say along with the developed countries.Yet China takes centre stage just as the popular mood in the West sours toward globalisation, the American presidential candidates retreat from free trade, and skepticism abounds about the ability of the G20  more of a talk shop than an enforcer  to raise sluggish world growth.On geopolitical questions, China is making sure that issues like its activities in the South China Sea and its overproduction of steel, rattling the US and Europe, are absent from the agenda.There will not be any policy miracles coming out of the summit, said Tristram Sainsbury, project director of G20 studies at Lowy Institute for International Policy in Australia.That makes the show, itself, even more important. For China, first and last its about the show, and to show they can organise a major international meeting, said Matthew P Goodman, a G20 expert at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.Hangzhou, the provincial capital of Zhejiang, is one of the most prosperous centres in the country and serves as the base for the e-commerce giant Alibaba. Xi served as secretary of the Communist Party for Zhejiang in the mid-2000s. The partys resilience under Xi  on display with giant flags showing the hammer and sickle at security checkpoints  is part of the meetings message.One of Xis provincial successors, the party chief, Xia Baolong, said the meeting would demonstrate the great achievement of Chinas opening and reform and the immense superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the governments description of its political and economic system.No matter where global summit meetings are held, host cities invest in huge amounts of security to avert terrorist attacks and to dampen protests. In 2012, President Barack Obama moved a G-8 meeting from Chicago to Camp David, Maryland, because of the fear of large demonstrations.In Hangzhou, thousands have been forced to move from luxury high-rise buildings near the conference centre, their apartments sealed with tape to prevent a sniper from venturing inside.Government and private sector workers have been granted vacations, and migrant workers have been told to return to their home provinces. In an effort to guarantee blue skies, factories within a wide perimeter around the city have been closed.Yet some of the security measures here seem picayune. Two weeks before the meeting, the kitchen division of the Metro Centre department store was devoid of knives. They had been ban-ned for sale since June, a saleswoman said. At a Starbucks in the centre of the city, the food coun-ter was empty. Delivery trucks had been unable to crack the security cordon, the barista said.On Uighur alertA major focus of security has been the Uighurs. At the Beijing restaurant, with wall murals of Chinas western deserts and a halal menu, 10 Uighur cooks were sent home in June at the request of the government, said the manager, Cai Ziwei.Only afterward was the establishment placed on a list of restaurants recommended for Muslim delegates to the meeting, he said. Hotels were told two months ago that they must inform the police if a Uighur tried to register, a worker at the Hanting hotel chain said.In June, police officers in the migrant neighbourhood of Qibao, 15 miles from the city centre, ordered all the grocery shops, clothing outlets and street-side restaurants closed, said Wang Jinfu, a municipal government worker.In some instances, small businesses were asked to close on the grounds that if they stayed open and an accident occurred, local party officials would be penalised.They told us, this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing, and if anything happens while Obama is here, the officials could be sacked, so they said, Please close,  said Li Yindeng, the owner of Chenyang, a noodle shop. Theres nothing we can do, and the government doesnt pay compensation.One party official was detained for 10 days in July for complaining online about the high costs of the preparations. The state-run Global Times reported that the official, Guo Enping, was held because his article  Hangzhou, Shame on You  drew such wide readership.As the rules began to disrupt daily life, more people vented online, and calls to the citys hotline mounted. Every day our media attacks the vicious foreign powers, and now they come, we have to kneel and serve, one person wrote.For a public that regularly faces problems of contaminated food, there was dismay when the leader of the state authority for grain, Ren Zhengxiao, said he would not allow one single grain of unsafe rice or one drop of unsafe oil to enter the kitchens preparing the leaders banquet meal.The government urged everyone to get with the programme. People must not express their discontent with unreasonable actions or even deny the importance of the security work of the G20 summit, the state-run Zhejiang Daily wrote."

At 89 centimetres and 10.3 kg, he is the only malnourished child at the anganwadi centre no 4 in Lakshmangarh no tekro of Ghatlodia  Chief Minister Anandiben Patels constituency. Just after 1 pm, the coordinator arranges the steel bowls on the circular table and the children know it is lunchtime. Spoons in hand, the children sit and clean up the bowl of rice and daal. Manthan refuses to join them.Since Manthans seven-year-old sister is also categorised as malnourished, I had to stringently monitor their mother before Manthan was born. The health department officials who visit here follow up on him regularly. We are taking additional care of his food and vitamins intake, said Yuvrajben Puvar, the anganwadi worker, as she picks him up from the slide he is playing on and makes him stand against the measuring tape, painted on a wall, to check his progress.Manthans mother, Kanchanben Thakore, says, Everybody in our family is like this. Look at me. Even I am small-built. But ever since Manthan started coming here a year back, he has changed for better. We feel the difference.The centre, which has about 35 children, is among the progressive and modern anganwadis functioning from a self-occupied building, which is rare since many work out of rented premises. While the walls have come alive with neatly painted colourful fruits, vegetables, flowers, shapes and body parts, it is also well stocked with a wide variety of toys for both girls and boys. Tucked away in a corner are plenty of puzzles, shapes and abacus. A colour therapy chart hangs on a wall, enlisting treatment for minor diseases among children. The anganwadi has a separate toilet and an open play area.Ghatlodia constituency also has the maximum number of anganwadis  1115 of the total 2,400 anganwadi centres  in Ahmedabad. The highest concentration is in a single ward  Gota  which has 48 centres. Recently, equipments were purchased from the corporator grant of former mayor Minaxiben Patel, who was elected from the Jodhpur ward. This centre keeps getting grants under various heads that help us purchase the required equipments, from toys to kitchen utensils, said Minaben Puvar, Ghatlodia anganwadi supervisor.Over 60% of the total anganwadi centres are running in independent buildings, the remaining from rented properties. Attempts are on to shift maximum of rented ones into our own buildings,said Bhailalbhai Patel, a BJP worker, whose job is to monitor the functioning of anganwadi centres in Ghatlodia. Apparently, he reports directly to the CM, who is the legislator from here.Since she cannot be everywhere, I am there as a facilitator, communicating and keeping the CM updated with the problems and achievements of anganwadi centres. It is not an official appointment, but Ive been voluntarily working for the society, he added. Patels job brief is to visit 4-5 anganwadis daily and keep a log of fruits and dry fruits distributed among students and resolve their issues. These goodies are generally passed on to the anganwadis by politicians who receive gifts in kind at public functions.The anganwadi centres in Juhapura area, however, paint a gloomy picture. Of the total 25 centres in the area, there is only that runs in an AMC building. Located in the Makhatmpura ward  which has a population of nearly 3 lakh  it was inaugurated last April by CM Anandiben Patel. The rest centres run in rented premises.It is nearly impossible to rent a premise at Rs 950, inclusive of the electricity bill, said Urvi Mistry, the anganwadi worker at Makhatmpura centre No. 1, where nearly 20 children are enrolled. The one-room house with a verandah, where the anganwadi runs, is shared with the landlord. There is no place to keep our food stock and other items. Where will we keep toys and furniture even if we get them? Mistry wonders. She adds that numerous representations have been made to authorities to have them move to an independent place. Sometimes, even the LPG bottle issued by the AMC is used by the landlord. We cannot help it since we do not have a separate enclosure, said Zubeidaben Vora, Makhtampura anganwadi supervisor.The only respite is that all anganwadis under AMC have a uniform breakfast and lunch menu, after the corporation signed up with NGO Akshaya Patra that also provides mid-day meal to Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar schools. The state government provides pre-cooked fortified packets of sukhdi, upma and sheera to lactating mothers and malnourished children and balbhog to children below one year.Unlike Ghatlodia, the Makhtampura anganwadi has two malnourished children out of 20. The two were absent the day The Indian Express visited their centre.As lunchtime approaches, two children leave for home. The rest wait on a rug on the floor, for food. My grandson does not eat here, so I am taking him back, said Mussarat Bano.

Archive photo Canara Coffee House was established on June 10, 1954. Archive photoVadodaras iconic and oldest cafe, Canara Coffee House, that represented the yesteryear charm and served its signature Maharashtrian and South Indian dishes, has met its end. Late on Sunday night, the restaurant was demolished by its owners, with a promise to return in a renewed avatar. For its hierarchy of fans  some second and third generation foodies  the loss is irreparable.Social media sites were flooded with eulogy from frequent patrons comprising students, executives and senior citizens, who reminisced the waiters with a pencil tucked behind their ears, taking down orders for the signature Poona Misal of the restaurant  steaming hot rice flakes and steamed lentils topped with yoghurt  and its dosas and uthappas; most importantly its inexpensive rate card that remained mostly unchanged over the years. As an assurance to its patrons, 82-year-old patriarch Pandurang Madhav Kudva, who has been running the coffee house, said, We will be back within some time and this is just a renovation we are doing. It is also an emotional time for us but we have to change with the time. We will be back with the same old taste and love.Kudva says, Nobel Laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (Venki) has been a regular visitor to the cafe, since his days at Maharaja Sayajirao University. The coffee house was also frequented by several popular cricketers from Vadodara.Kudva said he had no idea that the Coffee House had a Fanpage on Facebook that was struck with shock and grief  the demolition, although rumours had been spiraling, was unexpected. A long-drawn dispute for the land with its original owners and a proposed road widening project of the VMC compelled Kudva to take the bold new step. He has purchased the plot and is now planning to design the structure to ensure that the impending road widening by the civic body does not hamper his business.Kudva said, I am happy now, as we have purchased the place where we ran our coffee house for a such a long time. However, I was upset by some of the social media messages which said, RIP and we miss you Canara Coffee House, I want to say them this is just a new beginning.Kudva said that his staff who have been loyal for the last 40 years, will also return. Kudva said, My staff is like family; that is the secret of our business. My restaurant will be closed for next three-four months but they have said they will work with us. That is the biggest wealth I have earned.Kudva who shifted from Karkala village of Karnataka at the age of 20 to help his brother-in-law Vasant Rao Mahle, who founded the Canara Coffee House in Vadodara on June 10, 1954. And, there is more assurance from the patriarch. The price at the brand new Canara restaurant will also be carried forward. I dont like to charge more, as poor people are also coming to my coffee house.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
59044fa07be9e02646bddfeb,Brexit may impact India's engineering exports,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/555460/brexit-may-impact-indias-engineering.html,2016-07-01,"Brexit may impact India's engineering exportsJuly 02, 2016, New Delhi, DHNS 23:10 ISTIndia's export stood at $7.6 bn in April-MayWith EU, including the UK, claiming one-fifth of Indias engineering exports to top 25 destinations, any upheaval following Brexit would have an impact on the exporters who are already in a state of distress, an EEPC India analysis has shown.As per the latest data , Indias total engineering exports to top 25 destinations which account for 75% of the countrys total engineering product shipments aggregated to $7.6 billion for the April-May period of the current fiscal.Of this, the EU members contributed $1.5 billion with the UK emerging as the number one destination among the EU members, followed by Germany, the EEPC India paper noted. Seven of our 25 destinations are from EU. So, any upheaval in the entire market as a result of the political division with wide economic ramifications on the trade, investment and currency movement should be a cause of worry for us, Chairman of the EEPC India T S Bhasin said.He said, though a two-year window of negotiations for the exit of UK is available, the current indications point towards extreme political stand by a divided British polity and the EU leadership. Indias engineering exports to UK for the period under review were $372 million and for Germany, the shipments amounted to $339 million.The other major trading partners are Italy with engineering shipments of $253 million, France $191 million, the Netherlands $141 million, Spain and Belgium $121 million each.Brexit to affect global economyBritains decision to leave the European Union has created significant uncertainty that will have repercussions not only for the UK and Europe, but also for the global economy, the International Monetary Fund has warned. IMF spokesperson Gerry Rice said the Brexit was likely to cause a dampening of growth in the near term, and urged policy makers to act decisively while dealing with the situation.""Brexit has created significant uncertainty, and we believe this is likely to dampen growth in the near term, particularly in the UK, but with repercussions also for Europe and the global economy,"" he said yesterday.Rice said policy makers needed to stand ready to act, if the impact of financial market turbulence and higher uncertainty threaten to materially weaken the global outlook, adding that ""decisive policies will make a difference.""""Prolonged periods of uncertainty and associated declines in consumer and business confidence would mean even lower growth and again, policymakers in the UK and the EU have a key role to play in helping to reduce the uncertainty during this period,"" he said.Rice said the IMF sees the near-term risk for the UK, the EU and the global economy arising mainly from macroeconomic and financial market impact, and a sizable increase in uncertainty, including on the political front.""One notable source of this uncertainty concerns the terms of the future relationship between the UK and the EU, and these relate to questions about how long it will take to decide those terms, how the new relationship will impact business, and other actors,"" he said.The IMF has encouraged both the UK and the EU to work collaboratively toward a smooth and predictable transition.He said the IMF ""strongly supports"" the commitments made and steps taken by major central banks, including the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the US Fed and the Bank of Japan, among others, to provide liquidity and curtail excess financial volatility."
5904711e7be9e04154df6cc6,Wheat imports will help improve supply and restrain any sharp surge in prices,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/wheat-imports-will-help-improve-supply-and-restrain-any-sharp-surge-in-prices/,2016-12-12,"The government move to sharply reduce the import duty on wheat from 25% to zero at the end of the last week has set off howls of protest from farmer lobbies and other assorted groups. The argument has been that such free imports would dampen domestic wheat prices and hurt Indian farmers while it would help traders and large multinationals who largely dominate wheat trade.On the face of it the government move seem surprising. Its decision to boost minimum support price of wheat by Rs 75 to Rs 1525 per quintal, one of the largest increases in recent years, have helped boost the sowing of wheat in the rabi season. Total sown area under the wheat crop has gone up by around 10% to 226 lakh hectare by 9th December.And the crop has not been too bad in recent years. Wheat output has picked up from a low of 86.5 million tons in 2014-15 to 94 million tons in 2015-16 which is close to target set for the year. However, the fact remains that both wheat and rice production has largely stagnated since the turn of the current decade.But what makes the current scenario especially worse in the case of wheat is that the buffer stocks have whittled down rather sharply in recent months. Wheat stocks with the government which peaked at 32.6 million tons in June 2016, soon after the rabi market season, has been halved to 16.4 million tons by December 2016.This is a precarious situation as the stocks were never so low in recent years. In fact despite a bad crop the wheat stocks with the government were 26.8 million tons in December 2015 and as much as 31 million tons in December 2014. And the demand for wheat is likely to be buoyant especially given the need for meeting the demand for grains from the PDS under the food security act.And the signals from the price front has been ominous. Wholesale wheat prices which had fallen in the first three months of the last year has seen prices shoot up by more than 5% in the early months of the current year. In fact wheat prices has shot up double digits a few months back. Though it has climbed down to the 6% plus range in the most recent month the stage is now all set for a further rise given the depleted wheat stocks with the government.And this is not the first time that the government has used customs duty to reduce the gap between demand and supply. In fact the first UPA government reduced import duties on wheat from 50% to zero in 2006 after two years of bad wheat crops. And this time it is especially bad because though the rabi wheat crop sown in the current year is now excess of the norm the sown area has fallen in important states like Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. By allowing for free import of wheat the government has made the best out of a bad situation without waiting for the crisis to get out of hand and reach alarming proportions"
590471297be9e04154df6cd9,The importance of being Amma: Today’s politicians can learn many lessons from Jayalalithaa’s politics,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/the-importance-of-being-amma-todays-politicians-can-learn-many-lessons-from-jayalalithaas-politics/,2016-12-07,"The irony was stark. All her life J Jayalalithaa had shunned 247 media, snapping at Karan Thapar in an interview, It was certainly not a pleasure talking to you, namaste. She was a self-declared hater of the limelight, contemptuous of the press, famously slapping criminal defamation charges against a newspaper. She preferred to remain shut away in her shrouded residence of Chennais Poes Garden, an aloof Lady of Shalott.Yet what she eschewed in life, she could not prevent in death as TV crews kept up minute to minute coverage of her deteriorating health, beaming out details of her bodily functions in an invasion of privacy she would have sternly curtailed if she had been able.Jayalalithaa did not need and had never needed the media. Among the thousands gathered outside Apollo hospital in her last hours, the huge presence of women and poor was a reminder of her vibrant connection with her voters, however far removed she may have outwardly seemed. She required no support from mainstream or social media. Instead she touched the lives of millions in basic, workaday and ordinary ways, sensing the peoples pulse through an excellent rapport with cadres and creating service delivery schemes that established her presence in their daily lives. Ive never been comfortable in front of the camera, she told Simi Garewal, Im a behind the scenes person. First fighting for MGRs mantle, then battling the DMK for 20 years, she showed extraordinary stamina.There lie some of the key lessons that Jayalalithaas career offers todays politicians. In the age of constant media exposure when netas are either tweeting or giving speeches on primetime TV, Jayalalithaa practised an older form of politics  she knew her voter so well that she didnt need the media to validate her appeal. To those politicians who think that the television media is the message, Jayalalithaas politics instead show what can be achieved through a systematic programme of action where daily needs of voters take centre stage.She provided Amma water and Amma medicines. Amma Salt, or salt fortified with iron and iodine was created to treat iodine deficiencies. An NGO executive once remarked that if rising anaemia among women was brought to Jayalalithaas notice she would have immediately worked on a scheme to deal with it.She faced serious corruption charges, accused of gathering disproportionate assets and building a treasure chest for herself. But despite being sent to jail on two separate occasions, she was able to bounce back each time, her popularity intact. Here is the second lesson for todays politicians: Jayalalithaas credibility among the people was so high that she was able to withstand the taint of financial corruption. Her powerful delivery-oriented social welfarism made her the perpetual lady bountiful.It was almost as if the voter forgave her excesses because she was the provider of the basic necessities of life, from the tasty Rs 5 sambhar rice to the Rs 1 idli in the Amma canteen. Not food as slop thrown condescendingly at the poor, but cooked and served with spotless cleanliness and dignity.The third lesson that Jayalalithaas politics provides is that politicians are ultimately judged on their administrative efficiency. That Tamil Nadu has been a leading state in attracting investments and in ease of doing business is a reflection that  although corruption charges have been levelled at the administration  Jayalalithaa was able to reduce the traditional obstructionism of government. She took on the LTTE in Tamil Nadu after Rajiv Gandhis assassination, enhancing her tough, no nonsense image. She was criticised during the Chennai floods and for her liquor policy, but in the 2016 elections it was clear she was still trusted as an administrator.Like todays politicians she thrived on a personality cult. Like other women politicians Mamata and Mayawati, her whimsical behaviour was often deliberate strategy to keep political rivals always on the defensive. Yet, in another lesson for todays single-leader parties, Jayalalithaas personality cult did not destroy the party apparatus or structure. Hers was not a leader cult based on the destruction of the party worker. The fact that O Panneerselvam has been able to take over as her successor, without a power struggle shows that the party structure has, at least for now, held firm.The role of Jayalalithaas close aide Sasikala remains controversial and there are reports that she could now play the role of an extra constitutional authority. Yet all her life Jayalalithaa remained a singular figure, without family or coterie, totally unlike the families and coteries that surround other regional satraps. There is no parallel in Jayalalithaas life to a Yadav parivar or a Badal clan. She was the supremo as a lonely heroine, her absolute power seasoned with personal sadness.Jayalaithaas life story also offers lessons for celebrities who seek instant recognition by entering public life. Jayalalithaa may have been brought into politics by MGR but she had to claw her way to the top against implacable opposition. She fought back fiercely every time she was pushed into a corner. The people saw her being attacked and abused and witnessed her courage in facing her attackers.There was nothing gimmicky about Jayalalithaa. Her connect with vast masses of people was based on an unabashed and unapologetic social welfarism. She reminded that what is considered populist in high flying seminars is vital social welfare for millions on the ground. She was a ruthless politician and a dictatorial leader but she touched voters lives in simple ways to make their living conditions better. Jayalalithaa was not a politician of photo-ops, soundbites or carefully crafted PR images. No wonder that the one time TV cameras were able to report on her 247, was only when she began to lose her final battle."

Thinking back on exhibitions in the country and elsewhere- 10 images that remain in the memory of Indian art.1) Subodh Guptas Kerala Hut at Invisible Realities the Hauser & Wirth Somerset show Reassembled out of wood and terracotta tiles here was a work that was over-illuminated by stark LED lights radiating from within, probing one to speculate on the impenetrable contents of the house. The phosphorescent spill animated the structure, permanently altering its purpose as a residential site and challenging the boundary between the interior and the exterior.2) Modern Master Sayed Haider Raza-When modern master Sayed Haider Raza passed away on July 23rd 2016. This modern master strove to seek a balance of atmospherics: through his colour fields-from his dense tempestuous dappled midnight blue night skies he had embarked on highly keyed blues,crimsons and yellows to give us his rippled concentric Bindus. His journey in the world of abstraction was the epitome of the Bindu gradually coalescing into the Indian idiom of germination and the soul floating freely in a realized landscape.3) Jayashree Chakravarty -Indias quasi abstractionist Jayashree Chakravartys show at Akar Prakar Kolkata was the testimony of a show that had an ecological echo. Her works stood apart for their ability to evolve constantly- thus her easily identifiable works- have a distinct periodic uniqueness. Her use of brush, palette knife, fingers and imprint of what is popularly known as the bubble wrap for desired effect though has not much changed, yet the effect varies from canvas to canvas .Textures and illusions abounded in her works that looked at the requiem of a river-Kuchini. Her felicity with an exciting variety of media like rice paper, tissue and cellophane added to the richness of intent.4) Jamini Roy drawings at Dhoomimal From the Uma and Ravi Jain Estate, it was the set of drawings taken out of a folder weathered and brown that added to the ingenuity and vintage vitality of Indias great master Jamini Roy.The lines lithe and lean and languid celebrated the power of the contour and the discipline that darwings suggest.It brought back the beauty of observation and the passion for everyday sketches.5) Kounteya Sinhas Kolkata at Mother Teresas CanonisationKounteya Sinha made history by taking his Kolkata photographs and standing on streets in Italy and showing and sharing the beauty of Mother Teresas city that made her the Saint. Among colour and black and whites, it was the gravestone of yesteryear with cow dung cakes that spoke of the equivocal tone of history and the co-existence of religions as you saw a stunning image that froze the past and present into a single echo of yesterday once more.6) KG Subramanyan  Manida, as the mentor, muralist, painter, poet and scholar was called passed away on June 29th, 2016 this year and Aakriti gallerys tribute had a host of works that reflected his passion and idea of multiple imageries and myriad moorings in creating narratives that straddled many traditions and historic gleanings. While 300 works graced the walls it was the paper works that fascinated and reflected the fervor and fetish of a revered mentor.7) A. Ramachandran (Vadehras Delhi Rural poems in a pot)  Watercolours and drawings that were washed with snow. The 24 works in Vadehras once again boasted of the beauty of botanics and the realms of rural rhythms that were created with the grace of anatomical perfection. In America, with the snow falling outside his window A.Ramachandran dreamt of Rajasthani belles who sat in conversation amidst the ripple of leaves and buzzing of insects.8) Velu Vishwanadhan  At Delhis Nature Morte Abstract master Velu Vishwanadhans wine toned canvasses spoke of the ripple of mantras and the beauty of resonant rituals in the framework of Bhagvati poojas and sound of bhajnams and flamed Theyyam dances. In its maze-like rooms at Nature Morte Vishwanadhans works were a lesson in abstraction and the journey that traverses so many different idioms and metaphors of multiple manifestations.9) Hema Upadhyay At the international show Megacities was the late Hema Upadhyays works. Exhibited in 2011 at Centre Pompidou Upadhyays 2009 work 8ft x12ft was the piece de resistance of the show. We saw the conflict between regionalization and urbanization, modern values and traditional values, as well as negotiation of the current financial crisis.She portrays a small room created with aluminium sheets, car scrap, enamel paint, plastic sheets, found objects, M-seal, resin and Hardware material. In an interview, she is known to have said:  So much chaos in my work actually came from the city. When I work in my studio in Mumbai, there are lots of elements, of decay, of life, of chaos. Its a double-edged condition when you see development in the making  you see growth but decay, you see modern skyscrapers but the mushrooming of slums, etc. It is the dichotomy which existed within us and outside us as well. Here, it seems to be no chaos but an internal chaos is there in the forest. A construction and deconstruction cycle is taking place. As an artist, I am constantly confronted with the idea of creativity, of how the natural elements or conditions affect the manufactured work.10) Thomas Henriots Pen and Ink on Japanese rice paper In Mumbai at the Nine Fish gallery was French artist Thomas Henriots works created out of pen and ink and pastels.Rivetting landscapes in black and red ink coalesced to create stunning skylines and pure landscapes that celebrated the discipline and genius of this ballet dancer turned artist who was brought to India by the Basu Foundation for Arts that does meticulous shows of famed European artists."

He wrote an entire series. Called Taranath Tantrik, these are tales of the supernatural, dealing with tantriks, kapaliks (black magic practitioners), hauntings and evil spirits. They are unputdownable.The format these stories are told is remarkable: the setting is Calcutta of the late 1930s and 1940s, when WWII is raging and inflation is eating up Bengalis incomes. On monsoon afternoons, under lowering skies, two friends, the narrator and his friend Kishori Sen, visit elderly Taranath, a former tantrik, now reduced to fortune-telling to make a living.They carry small gifts  telebhaja (deep-fried veggies in batter), a packet of Passing Show cigarettes, on one occasion rabri, which Taranath cannot afford any more. In return, they get endless cups of tea and a scary tale from Taranaths past.Apart from suspense and thrills, these addas offer rare glimpses into east Indian beliefs, customs and the economy at the turn of the 20th century. In one tale, Taranath mentions that in those days one could buy an entire goat for 6 annas, a little less than 40 paise. I was reminded of this on a visit to the local butcher, who sells mutton for Rs 500 per kg.These tales say when the finest rice tastes bitter in a mans mouth, he is about to die within days. I learnt that the best bait to catch fish is a little bit of the honey of the mustard flower, mixed with other ingredients. That, just a hundred years ago, consumption of tea was a rare luxury, even in Calcutta.Taranath is not the only exemplar of the fiction as adda genre in Bengal. In 1945, Premendra Mitra, a prolific writer, published a yarn called Mosha or Mosquito in a magazine. This gave birth to the tall, scrawny Ghanada, a resident of the mess at 72, Banamali Naskar Lane in Calcutta. Though penurious, Ghanada has a colourful past, with adventures that span science fiction, mystery, historical thrillers. Sudhir, the narrator, Shibu, Shishir and Gour comprise his fan club, coaxing Ghanada to disgorge his tales in return for  what else  cigarettes and tea.Then, theres Rajshekhar Bose, a Bengali polymath who majored in chemistry, wrote the first Bengali dictionary (Chalantika), and spun hundreds of satirical stories based on his knowledge of the scriptures (he also translated the Ramayana and Mahabharat in Bengali) under the pseudonym Parashuram.Among the many tales told in his freewheeling, adda style, is one called Dhusturi Maya or Datura Magic. It involves two friends, the wealthy Udbhab Babu and his less well-off buddy, Naren Babu. Both go for an adda regularly, usually by Calcuttas lake.One day, theyre tipped off by a couple of magical birds about how they can recover their youth by eating some datura and uttering a mantra. The consequences are hilarious. Remember, Satyajit Rays first film after the Apu trilogy was Parash Pathar (The Philosophers Stone, 1958), based on an adda-style Parashuram story of the same name.One day, theyre tipped off by a couple of magical birds about how they can recover their youth by eating some datura and uttering a mantra. The consequences are hilarious. Remember, Satyajit Rays first film after the Apu trilogy was Parash Pathar (The Philosophers Stone, 1958), based on an adda-style Parashuram story of the same name.The Bangali adda is, therefore, a potent cultural phenomenon with many knock-ons: in politics, education, literature and filmmaking.Auteur Mrinal Sen has written an adda memoir: among the gems, his  and other directors  struggles to get into the film industry without any resources; his recollection of friend Ritwik Ghataks smoking habits. Sen and friends smoked cheap cigarettes, 2 paisa for a packet of 10. Ghatak smoked bidis.At the time a bundle of 25 bidis was 10 paisa. But Ritwik had already drawn up credit worth Rs 80 at his bidi shop, wrote Sen. Thats two lakh bidis.Crowd wait to get into a session in Times Lit fest 2016, at IHC, in New Delhi, on Saturday. Photo Piyal BhattacharjeeThe late writer, Sunil Gangopadhyay, another well-known addabaaz, writes about the social stratification of chatting. While intellectuals and future politicos would blow off at Calcuttas Coffee House or in salons hosted by writer Buddhadeb Bose or poet Bishnu Dey, the gifted Kamalkumar Mazumdar would spend his talk time at Khalashitola, a down-market bar, originally intended for sailors, in existence for at least 100 years.In 2004, the Oxford English Dictionary incorporated adda as a noun; descriptors ranged from a place where people go for informal intellectual exchanges to an illicit drinking place. That spans it, across most cultures. The mohalla gathering is an adda, as is talk at Pramod Swains Presidency College canteen.People love to communicate, face to face. Its easier to have a conversation than messaging on a social network group. So, today, we have a new form of adda  the wildly popular literary festivals that started with Jaipur and are now hosted by The Times of India.All addas need a venue and a bunch of kindred souls. Today, with so little people time, this is probably the future of adda."
590473877be9e04154df70ba,Government must not interfere between GM technology providers and licensees,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/et-commentary/government-must-not-interfere-between-gm-technology-providers-and-licensees/,2016-08-20,"By CS PrakashOne of the components of farm biotechnology, genetically modified (GM) crops, has realised tremendous benefits to farmers globally. It has provided them with a tool to address crop loss due to damage caused by biotic and abiotic stresses.Agriculturally advanced countries have been using the technology to improve farm output for their people as well as for exporting purposes. The US has several food crops made from GM technology that include maize, soyabean, cotton, potato, canola, papaya, alfalfa and squash.Recently, we have seen as many as 109 Nobel laureates come together to support GM crops and their benefits. In India, however, more weightage is still given to many environmentalists, NGOs and swadeshi groups whose arguments against GM crops are not based on science but on emotions.This acts as a hindrance not only to the introduction of new technology to improve Indias farm productivity, but also severely leaves a negative impact on the economy.The agri-biotech industry takes risks by putting in huge money, effort and valuable human resource in conducting research over years to bring innovative technology to the farm. Scientists need about 10-12 years of work globally to develop a crop biotech product. After developing the product, there is much effort needed for regulatory approval before commercialisation.If the breakthrough research does not get to the market after such humongous efforts, it not only discourages the scientific community but also the industry, farmers and consumers, who are deprived of latest technological advancements in agriculture.Bangladesh has shown how embracing technology can enhance farm income significantly. Bangladeshs agriculture minister Matia Chowdhury has been at the forefront of raising such awareness. She was convinced by the research and partnership mooted by the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (Bari) to bring new technology to its farmers struggling to find solutions to farming challenges with conventional methods of cultivation.Sowing New FutureBangladesh is successfully sowing and harvesting Bt Brinjal, a technology developed in India, for the past three years. So enthused are they by GM technology that they are in advanced stages of research in crops like transgenic cotton, golden rice, salinity-tolerant rice and late blight-resistant (LBR) potato, all of which can take the country far ahead in terms of farm productivity as well as achieving food security for its citizens.In India, regressive anti-science measures at the behest of certain vested interests are still the order of the day. This is quite clear from Indias recent price control measure for Bt cotton and capping of royalty on GM technology. These send wrong signals to the world and also project India as a country that does not honour technology agreements and intellectual property rights (IPR).The Indian government will have to take a long-term view on the way forward for technology in agriculture. Getting swayed by vested interests or specific ideologies leading to such abnormal anti-R&D and anti-IPR policies can benefit only a few at the cost of the farmers and the nation.The unusual action of the government in bringing price control and draft licensing guidelines has a backdrop of a commercial dispute between a few licensees and the technology provider. These measures appear to be in support of a few seed companies who have defaulted on payment of trait fees to the technology provider.The licence of the biggest seed company that has defaulted has been cancelled and its promoter is also the president of the National Seed Association, which represented to the Indian government for price control, leading to a perception that the stated objective and the actual intent of these measures are different.The proposed compulsory licensing of technology and price control where the price reduction to farmers on a weighted national basis is less than the reduction in trait fee is widely believed to benefit only the sublicensees, not the farmers.Indias leading seed company, Nuziveedu, has been playing a game to ouster Monsanto from the country in the name of safeguarding farmers interest. Since Monsanto challenged Nuziveedu for not honouring the licensing contract agreement for Bt cotton and also cancelled its technology licence for defaulting on trait fee payment, all hell has broken loose.This also shows the world how Indian companies like Nuziveedu can still manipulate the local system for their personal interests.Technology is InclusiveBy interfering in bilateral private agreements between technology providers and licensees, the government is weakening investor and innovator confidence. This will see a slowing down of research and no new technology will be made available to our farmers from outside, who are already under stress due to the vagaries of agriculture.In the larger interest of Indian agriculture and the economy, one would urge the government to reverse the anti-innovation measures. GM Mustard, if approved, would have addressed the edible oil shortage in India  as will Bt Chickpea and Bt Brinjal in providing nutritional food intake. To be globally competitive in food production and curtail imports of food grain from other countries, it is high time India has a conducive policy environment to promote and adopt modern and well-proven technologies like GM crops.(The writer is professor, plant genetics and genomics, Tuskegee University, US)"

He wanted the prime minister to announce a date by which prices rise will be controlled one of the main poll campaigns of the NDA coalition.The focus of Rahuls grouse seems to be the soaring prices of pulses where the market prices have soared up sharply. Pulse prices which were going up at a normal rate of around 5.8% when the UPA government laid down office touched double digit levels even before the NDA completed one year in office.But the poor response of the NDA government soon sent inflation rates of pulses soaring to peak levels of 45% by the end of 2015. Though prices increases have softened to some extent in the more recent period it still remains at a super normal 31% in the most recent month. However, this trend is expected to be reversed soon as the sowing of pulses in the current khariff season has shot up substantially.Most recent numbers show that the sown area under pulses has gone up substantially. Numbers up to the third week of July show that the sown area of pulses has gone up to 90 lakh hectares which is almost one third higher than the area sown in the corresponding period of the previous year. This is indeed remarkable given that the total acreage sown in the current kharif season has gone up by only around 3% so far.The increased market prices of pulses, the higher minimum support prices announced by the government and good rains seems to have finally induced the farmers to plant pulses over more areas. This means that the market signals are being smoothly transmitted to the producers. This is a positively different from other food products where the price signals are not transmitted to the farms despite remaining persistently high prices for extended periods.This is best reflected in the price of vegetable which continue to soar at double digit rates since the UPA days. Though vegetable price increase has softened substantially from the peak levels of around 60% plus reached during the UPA rule the prices continue to spike up occasionally due to seasonal turbulences. However, some states like Maharashtra has come forward to delist fruits and vegetables from the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act so that the farmers can directly trade in the markets and escape the clutches of traders in the local mandis who corner the maximum gains from the high prices.Other foodstuffs where the NDA government has been unable to bring down high prices increases include that of high protein products like meat and fish and eggs where price increases continue to hover close to double digit levels. An exception to this is the milk sector where prices increases have softened substantially to almost one third the peak levels reached during the UPA rule. Similarly the NDA has also achieved substantial gains in holding down price increase of cereals like rice and wheat.However, the overall scenario shows that food prices have continued to pick up faster than that of the overall consumer prices even though the gap has shrunk sizably from around 6 percentage points at peak levels to closer around one percent now. But despite these gains the recurring cycles of food inflation does pose a problem for monetary authorities as food prices account for half the weightage of the consumer price index which is the focus of monetary policy.Given the scenario the one sure way to tackle to the recurring inflation in food prices is to improve the supply response to market signals by improving supply chains and ensuring that producers get a sizable share of the increasing prices. The government continued focus on improving road connectivity, especially in the rural areas, and the increasing use of mobile phones will go a long way in improving supply.But the one big hurdle that remains is the provisions of the agriculture marketing act in most states that infringe on the farmers rights to sell his produce at the market of his choice. Current regulations in many states does not allow the farmers to sell directly to the consumers or carry out contract farming. And many force the farmers to sell in the local mandis, which not only impose heavy charges, but also pay the minimum possible prices.

590473e77be9e04154df7141,Sabarimala case is before Supreme Court now: Will it be at the bleeding edge of change?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/sabarimala-case-is-before-supreme-court-now-will-it-be-at-the-bleeding-edge-of-change/,2016-08-02,"Shorn of legal niceties, the crux of the petition before the Supreme Court challenging the verdict of the Kerala high court sanctifying the ban on entry of women between the ages of 10 and 50, into the sacred precincts of the Sabarimala temple, is the access of women of bleeding age to sacred places of worship.The judgment of the high court justified the ban largely based on two pleadings before it: women in the banned age group menstruate, thus become impure and hence are unable to observe the mandated 41 day penance before the commencement of the pilgrimage to Sabarimala; the deity at Sabarimala temple is in Naisthika Brahmachari (eternal celibate) form and does not like young women to distract him, lest he deviates even slightly from his penance of celibacy and austerity.The apex court, for sure, would apply the principles of inviolate human rights and pronounce its verdict in due course. It is timely at this stage to bring out certain facts, customary practices and perceptions that are germane to the issue.The custom of treating women during the period of menstruation as impure and untouchable was in vogue in Kerala. Even today, vestiges of this outlandish custom prevail and many Hindu women voluntarily avoid going to temples and other sacred places during their periods. There is absolutely no legal sanctity or scriptural injunction behind this practice.Paradoxically, even when this custom was largely observed, women of all ages had been on pilgrimage to Sabarimala though they did not climb the 18 sacred steps carrying on their head the irumudi kettu (specially designed cloth carry-bag containing articles of offerings). Parents were permitted to perform the annaprasham (first rice feeding) of their children  with infants sitting in the laps of their mothers  in the sannidhanam (sacred precincts).The custom-mandated penance of 41 days prior to setting out on the pilgrimage to Sabarimala is no longer followed. Hundreds of devotees from Kerala start the pilgrimage by car in the early hours of the day, alight at Pampa, get their irumudi kettu prepared at the Ganapathi Temple and reach the sannidhanam in about two to three hours. Walking up the 18 sacred steps with the irumudi kettu on their head, they offer prayers in the jostling crowd, climb down to Pampa for lunch and drive home for dinner. This pilgrimage tourism is widely known and accepted without question.The deity at Sabarimala is in the Naisthika Brahmachari form bound by the rules and conduct of abstinence. Hindu mythology has instances of brahmachari rishis going astray, lured by the lustful eyes of voluptuous women. A legend has it that Malikapurath Amma sitting in the premises of Sabarimala in a separate shrine, is a lady devotee eternally waiting for Ayyappa. Notwithstanding Manusmriti, the Hindu pantheon is replete with women worshipped as goddesses. Motherhood has been held in high esteem in Hindu scriptures.The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) which manages Sabarimala is vociferously for continuing the Kerala high court ordained ban. The Thantris (Brahmin high priests) who are the last word on the rituals and customs of temples favour the status quo.Kerala, which basks in the glory of its sea-faring tradition, globe trotters and total literacy was not long ago described as a lunatic asylum by none other than Swami Vivekananda for its crude and often cruel caste-based customs. Large sections of people (not just menstruating women) were not only denied entry into temples but also their surroundings and even the roads leading to them.Winds of change are blowing across countries and continents sweeping away many hallowed sanctions, injunctions and customs. Our country, though belatedly, is debating a uniform civil code for its citizens. Male bastions protected by customs, and dos and donts sanctified by faith are crumbling.Still there are many under the protective umbrella of faith, whether they be of Hindu, Christian or Islamic persuasions. The Supreme Court of India has been called upon to decide how long one such bastion will survive the onslaught of changing times. Whichever way it decides, the verdict will transcend the precincts of the abode of the Naisthika Brahmachari and prove historic."

Besides routine checkups and scans, there are certain foods that should be avoided and there are a few which are perfect for a healthy start.To maintain a high nutritional content in body, following an organic food diet is a good option. Organic diets are a great source of essential vitamins, minerals, potassium, iron and proteins that are healthy for you and your child.Why choose an organic diet over a normal diet?There are many reasons how organic is better but I would consider these to be the most important:Free from toxins that may cause damage to brain and nerve cellsSupports childrens neural and body developmentReal food and not pesticide factoriesReduces risk of cancerSimply tastes betterIs there a difference between natural and organic foods?Yes, both of them are different. Natural foods are usually considered as minimally processed foods that do not include hormones or artificial flavors. On the other hand, organic foods are strictly regulated and do not contain toxic substances such as synthetic pesticides, herbicides or chemical NPK fertilizers.Organic diet ideas for pregnant mothersBreakfast:Breakfast is the prime meal of the day for would-be moms as it helps you stay active throughout the day. I would recommend incorporating whole grains and fruits in breakfast meals for that extra added energy and to keep morning sickness awayOrganic eggs topped with organic spinach, mushrooms and grilled tomatoOrganic oats boiled with organic milk with added organic berriesOmlette with a wholegrain toastPorridge without sweetened rice or coconut milkPlain yogurt mixed with fresh berries, cinnamon, and vanilla. Use almonds to enjoy the crunchHealthy moong chaat is a nice and crunchy meal rich in nutrients like Vitamin A and C, Iron and FibreHot and fresh multiflour idlis but they may turn hard upon coolingLunchLunch is the best time for a dose a protein and consuming healthy vegetables, especially leafy green as they have high folic acid content, which is essential for fetal development.Whole wheat pita sandwich stuffed with greens like baby spinach and chopped veggiesSuper food salad that includes leafy green vegetables, energy-rich vegetables, high omega-3 nuts and dress it up with extra virgin olive oil and vinegarBeans and capsicum salad is an all-in-one treat for high levels of protein, fibre, calcium, iron, zinc and vitamin CBajra, moong dal and green pea khichdi, which is rich in fibre and proteinsBaked methi puris that are rich in iron and calciumDinner:Dinner time should include light meals for smoother digestion. One should always prefer low-fat foods and avoid consuming fried foods to keep insulin levels in control. Brown rice with a mix of green leafy and iron rich vegetables Chapati with a bowl of lentils A bowl of spinach salad along honey-peach smoothie, raspberry orange-punch or pineapple and basil smoothie as per tasteWhat to do for maintaining healthy eating habits during pregnancy?First of all, before consuming anything, you should be aware of its contents. Check label and expiry date to make sure that you are not eating anything which could affect your health or the babys.Remove brinjal, papaya, celery, onion, garlic, ginger, pepper, mustard, carom seeds and jaggery in your diet if you have history of abortionAvoid consuming green peas, potatoes and heavy cereals if you have habitual acidity, constipation and bloating issuesNever eat left over or frozen foodsRegular intake of Vitamin and Iron supplements as prescribed by your gynecologist for healthy growth of babyClosing ThoughtsNot only would-be mothers but everyone should opt for organic foods. Though organic foods are free of pesticides, but there are possibilities of organic foods being contaminated with bacteria. In short, no matter what you buy  organic or conventional  wash and cook meticulously before eating."
5904741d7be9e04154df719a,Korean envoy proud of his Tamil ‘links’,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/korean-envoy-proud-of-his-tamil-links/,2016-07-19,"Appa, called out a voice as the consul general of Korea Kyugsoo Kim was taking a stroll on the Mahabalipuram beach. His first impulse was to look back, thinking it was his son calling him. Seconds later he realised that Tamils like Koreans also address their fathers as Appa. The incident inspired him to start researching on words that are common to both Tamil and Korean languages.Although a possibility of the two cultures sharing a common origin has been disputed due to a lack of genetic and anthropological links, Kim, who will soon give a presentation on the topic during the Madras Week celebration, asserts that Asians, in general, share a lot of values and are indeed genetically related. He adds that Indias mission to capitalise on the growth potential of Asia has to be studied and developed so that South Korea and India can be considered as sister countries.During his research, Kim came across about 500 words in Tamil and Korean which share the same meaning and pronunciation. For instance the Korean word Apahada which is Avadhipadu in Tamil means the same  in pain or suffer  in both languages. Similarly Vanakam (hello in Tamil) in Korean is Vangapta, Manaive (wife) is Manura and Nal (day) is also Nal.Not just words, the two cultures share a lot of cultural and traditional practices too. Just like Tamils, Koreans have the habit of leaving the slippers outside the house and bowing before the elders as a sign of respect. And when it comes to syntax and grammar, Korean and Tamils share the same sentence structure. For example, I am cutting the grass in Korean is Naan pul-ul-beda.Kim says another thread of similarity could be a stone that Huh, the first queen of Kaya kingdom, took from India to Korea. This could be the Illavattakkal, the practice of a man lifting weight to prove his strength. The old Tamil ritual involved a young girl asking her lover to lift a heavy stone to prove his strength. These stones are still found in interior villages of Tamil Nadu, says Kim.When a baby is born in Korea, we have green chillies hung outside the house to ward off evil spirits and I find the same practice here too. It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel completely at home here, he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff, and lentil cakes are a few to name. There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each others country, he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts dont rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University, Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of. We just cant have a meal without pickle and they too cant have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils. He adds that more research should be done in the area to strengthen the relationship between the two countries."
5904741d7be9e04154df719b,When biriyani became haram,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/when-biriyani-became-haram/,2016-08-27,"A short story gets a long dissectionAfter a long time, a Malayalam short story has stirred a heated debate over the notion of political correctness in literature. Biriyani, by Kerala Sahitya Akademi award-winning writer Santhosh Echikkanam, was published in a vernacular weekly last week and has unleashed a discussion, at times bordering on the libellous, on authorial intent, public perceptions and hidden sub-texts.The story, set in Poyinachi village in Kasara god, is an ironic take on deprivation and ostentation. The story begins with migrant labourer Gopal Yadav reaching Poyinachi and getting work at the venue of a rich, fat Muslim wedding. Yadav, who is from a remote village in Jharkhand, is awed by the extravaganza of the whole affair.In the storys climax, food amounting to several quintals is dumped in a man-deep pit dug by Yadav who, incidentally, has not had a morsel all day. What he sees and shrinks back from takes Yadav down memory lane, when he and his family had struggled to even have one proper meal.Discussions in social media, which initially began as praise for the beautifully-crafted story, took a serious turn when Rubin DCruz, assistant editor at National Book Trust, came up with criticism that the writer is part of a purposeful design to create an anti-Muslim collective consciousness.In his Facebook post, which invited sharp criticism from many, including writers Benyamin and Manoj Kuroor, Rubin argued that the writer intentionally reinforces stereotypes through portrayal of Muslims as ones who are into polygamy, ones who flaunt symbols of Gulf money and are generally uncultured.Rubin substantiated his point by presenting descriptions about char acters Kalanthan Haji, Asainarcha and Sinan on one side and protagonist Yadav and another character Ramachandran on the other.Benyamin responded stating that readers must decide what should be done to people who choose to focus on the religion of the writer, its characters and supporting cast instead of on the story itself. Young novelist Kuroor wrote in Facebook that he is against literary reviews that portray characters in black and white and analyse the politics of the writer through the narration of the so-called villain.Echikkanam, while accepting political and ideological criticism over his work, is not ready to tolerate the anti-Muslim tag critics thrust upon him. He says that criticism accusing him of having a Muslim phobia could be better termed as terrorism. The character Asainarcha tells Ramachandran that the Biriyani rice is not something that is available at the function of poor Muslims. My story was a criticism against upper caste Muslims. The biriyani they dump in the pit is something that lower caste Muslims and Hindus are deprived of. Considering the Dalit and lower caste peoples nation-wide protest against Hindu fundamentalists, how could one term Yadav, a backward Hindu, as part of Hindu extremism? he asks. He adds that Hajiyude Heart by Uroob too was a criticism against polygamy.When asked about the need of writers to be politically correct, Echikkanam says that writers just portray what they see in their surroundings. Sometimes, one has to write from the perspective of a criminal like Govindachamy. It is not necessary that one should always write from a moralists perspective, he says.Echikkanam, however, acknowledged that a discussion on a short story is happening after a long time. Only 5% of so-called intellectuals made anti-Muslim allegations. The rest supported it and it got more readers following the controversy, he points out.A few years ago, writer NS Madhavans award-winning story Higuita had to face similar allegation when writer MT Ansari criticised him for using making his villain character a Muslim."
5904746d7be9e04154df7204,Ethiopian food: Thaal se thaal bajaa!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/ethiopian-food-thaal-se-thaal-bajaa/,2016-08-25,"There are no forks or knives on the table. Not even spoons. Everyone is eating with their fingers and the only sound punctuating the Oohs and Yums is the occasional slurp. As I look around the room, I notice that even the most well-heeled customers are uncomplainingly and happily rolling up the bread, scooping the stew or vegetables and paying tribute to the chef by a single-minded focus on the delicious meal in front of them.I am at an Ethiopian restaurant Zeni in San Francisco with my sister, her husband and my younger son, The Foodie. We have just got our table at 9.30 pm after a 45 minute wait on a working day. The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."
590474797be9e04154df721b,Trends in progress of sown area of khariff crops shows that it will be difficult to meet targets,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trends-in-progress-of-sown-area-of-khariff-crops-shows-that-it-will-be-difficult-to-meet-targets/,2016-08-18,"The numbers released by ministry of agriculture just before the advance of the southwest monsoons targeted a 7.1% increase in total food grain production in 2016-17. Both khariff and rabi grain output was expected to go up by the same extent to push up total food grain production to 270.1 million tons. This was indeed an ambitious target as it would require that the increase in food grain production be stepped up to the highest level in the last five years.However, the progress of the khariff sowing season has lent hopes that the grain production this year would match the ambitious targets laid out by the government. Numbers released for the period up to the middle of August shows that the sown area in the current khariff season has touched 954 lakh hectares which is 6.5% higher than the sown area in the corresponding period of the same previous year.However, the increase in the sown area has been uneven across the major states. Among the four states with the largest sown area, and which account for close to half the total sown area in the country, only Maharashtra had registered a sizable 15% increment in gross cropped area. One reason for this may be the increase in states rainfall, which went up close to a quarter during the current season.However, the total sown area in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, the other major states with the maximum sown area, have remained largely stable. This is surprising because the increase in rainfall in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan has been higher than in Maharashtra. Among other states with extensive cultivation Karnataka, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also registered a substantial increase in the gross sown area in the current season.But a crop wise investigation of the trends in the progress of the total sown area shows that increase has not been in proportion to the targets set in case of many crops. In fact only in the case of rice and pulses has been the increase in sown area been commensurate with the production targets set. So while the agriculture ministry targets has set that the khariff rice crop be increased by 2.7% and the pulse production be raised by 32.1% the sown area for these crops has increased by 7% and 33.2% so far which indicates that the targets can hopefully be achieved.But in case of other crops the increase in sown area has not been very significant. For instance in the case of coarse cereals and oil seeds the ministry has targeted 16.4% and 36.5% increase in khariff output. However, the trends in the progress of the sown area so far shows that sown area has so far only increased by 6% and 5.1% respectively. To achieve the targeted increase in output the productivity of these crops has to go up substantially in both cases.However, the worst case scenario is seen in the commercial crops like sugar cane and cotton. The targets set out by the ministry would expect sugarcane and cotton output to increase by 2.4% and 17.9% respectively. However, the trends in the sown area indicate that the crop under sugar cane has declined by 8% while that under cotton has fallen by 8.9%. That would make the achievement of the targets difficult if not impossible in the current season.So the overall assessment is that while the good monsoons has improved the prospects of achieving the target set for important crops like rice and pulses it does not seem to have very much improved the prospects of others like coarse cereals, oilseeds, sugar cane and cotton. The country has to roll out more innovative programs to improve productivity of important crops if it is the raise agriculture output to much higher levels."
590474ac7be9e04154df7267,For the frequent traveller,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fit-bits/for-the-frequent-traveller/,2016-07-20,"While I am overwhelmed with the response & encouragement I am getting from my readers, I am rarely told what you would want to read about. Finally, a very dear friend (Seema) asked me to write a follow up to my last post about easily doable tips on nutrition & habits for the frequent flier club. It got me thinking about how my sisters, friends, colleagues and even I travel so often that we tend to resign ourselves to our food fate so to speak.At first, the whole jet setting concept is very appealing, but like a cheap piece of imitation jewelry, it quickly loses its sheen for most (business) travellers. The excitement is quickly replaced by groans about only stopping over to change bags, etc. With that comes the added burden of having to eat heavy, unhealthy food most of the time because one is either running and can only grab the sugar and fat overloaded snacks at airports or one is entertaining/being entertained at business lunches/dinners and miss the chance to eat healthy.I have had clients who crave simple home made food so much that they cried tears of joy when they finally got to eat ghar ka khana even though their cook at the time was atrocious!! So how does one manage to be a jet setter and still stay on track?Irrespective of how crazy your work is (trust me, I come from a family of overachievers who have been jet-setting before it was even in vogue) you have to make some time for yourself. Easier said than done, I know, but POSSIBLE. Below are my to dos:1. Pack a set of workout clothes/swimming gear + good pair of sneakers, also check out the facilities available at the hotel youll be staying.2. For snacks (I have the entire gamut of clients  pure vegetarian, vegans, lactose/gluten intolerant & those wholl eat anything that moves), my advice  carry something healthy you love, your go to  eg. Nuts.3. Wake up 30 minutes earlier than normal & go workout  swim/run/cross train /jump rope & stretch  even the Phys Ed stuff we did in school works brilliantly.4. Golden rule  stay well hydratedall that air travel & artificial environment isnt good for ones skin & mental focus. Always keep a water bottle handy & sip it every 30 minutes.5. Breakfast should be something filling yet healthyoats/cereal/granola/eggs/fruit. Avoid sweet, sugary, processed breads etc.6. Pack a fruit + a little cheese at breakfastsnack on it in a couple of hours.7. Never skip lunch. Keep it light and simplesomething that gives you nutrients you need for proper brain functioning without sugar highs & subsequent crashes. Soups and salads (dressing on the side please), light wraps or steamed vegetables/rice, etc work well.8. 1-2 meals should be eaten between breakfast and lunch & lunch and dinner. Keep sugar to a minimum in tea/coffee. Preferably a glass of fresh juice or coconut water once out of those 2 meals.9. Unsalted almonds/walnuts/peanuts/roasted rice crispies/channa for snacking.10. Dinners similar to lunch with less bread/rice. Rosted/lightly sauteed steak (cottage cheese/chicken/fish fillet/tofu) with vegetables.11. Im not on the eat dinner before 7 bandwagon. Consultants rarely sleep early. They end up working late so their bodies & brains need sustained energy for longer. A cup of milk about 45-60 minutes before bedtime is fine.12. Paradoxic as it sounds try and get as much sleep as possible & avoid reaching out for processed and packaged food.13. Alcohol if unavoidable, should be had slowly & spaced out with plenty of water in between. Smoking should be completely avoided.And there you have it! Happy travelling"
5904751a7be9e04154df730b,"Food for thought: When in Rome, eat like the Romans",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/talkingturkey/food-for-thought-when-in-rome-eat-like-the-romans/,2016-07-25,"Whenever I travel to a new place, I try the local cuisine. In fact, for me, travelling and trying out local food are intrinsically linked to each other. I cant imagine the former without the latter. Put in another way, I dont see the point of travelling without tasting local delicacies. This is because I firmly believe that to discover a new place and understand its people and culture, one has to have the local cuisine. For food is not just sustenance for us human beings. Its history, its a celebration of culture, its politics, its philosophy, its beliefs and, most importantly, it represents stories.Local cuisine is the culmination of centuries of practice, thinking and lifestyle. It comes from the very soil of the place that one seeks to comprehend. It exemplifies the outlook of the local people and reflects their heritage and aspirations. But theres another reason why people should try the local food of a place they visit  to bring back home a slice of the newly discovered place.One of the things that my wife and I do when we visit a new place is try and pick up local recipes. And we try to recreate them when we come back home. We have found that these recipes are, in many ways, far more enriching than the souvenirs and photographs one collects from a trip. In fact, when you recreate those special dishes, the aroma and taste immediately transport you back to those places, thereby replenishing the memories of your wonderful holiday. Additionally, these recipes are also something that you can share with your friends and families, providing them a taste of your travel experience.I know many people who travel but never try the local cuisine. This is a shame. For one can never fully soak in all the joys that travelling has to offer if he or she is conservative about food. I understand that some people might follow dietary restrictions because of ideological or religious reasons. I fully respect that. For example I am not advocating that a vegetarian forcibly tries non-vegetarian fare. But my point is that if one is open to trying the local cuisine, you will definitely find dishes that suit your palate.My wife and I recently went on a holiday to Singapore and Malaysia. Needless to say that we were overwhelmed by a smorgasbord of exquisite dishes. The flavours, textures, colours and aroma were just heavenly. In fact, my wife was hooked on to a local Malaysian preparation called kangkung belacan  leafy vegetable cooked with dried shrimp paste (belacan) and dried anchovies (ikan bilis). For me the Hainanese chicken rice that we had in Singapore and Melaka was absolutely brilliant.Hence, we made it a point to pick up the basic ingredients for these recipes. And last weekend we prepared these two dishes for our family. The result was superlative, even if I say so myself. But the biggest high was recreating something from what was a really memorable vacation and being able to share that joy with our loved ones. I hope that people become more adventurous in their approach to food while travelling and make their journeys that much more enriching."
590475287be9e04154df731a,WATCH: How horseback library is helping Indonesia’s remote readers,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-photo-blog/watch-how-horseback-library-is-helping-indonesias-remote-readers/,2016-07-15,"Astride his white mare, a wide-brimmed hat shielding his eyes, Ridwan Sururi looks more cowboy than librarian as he winds towards the hilltop village, his horse Luna saddled with books.Their arrival sends ripples of excitement through Serang, a quiet hamlet fringed by rice fields and a volcano on Indonesias main island of Java.The horse library! children shriek, sprinting towards the mosque where Luna is tethered. Slung over her saddle are two handmade wooden boxes filled with books.For many there, this unique mobile library is their only link to books. There is no traditional library nearby, and stores are miles away in big cities. Its a problem for villages across the sprawling Indonesian archipelago.Sururi, a 43-year-old professional horse groomer, devised a unique way to encourage reading in his district.Armed with Luna, one of several horses under his care, and about 100 books donated from a friend, Sururi began road-testing his novel mobile library in early 2015, unsure if it would succeed.It was a huge hit. In no time, the father of four was fielding requests from schools and villages further afield, eager crowds greeting him on arrival.The kids are always waiting for my horse and I, said Sururi.Sometimes they even form a queue, waiting a very long time just to borrow a book.In Serang, enthusiastic youngsters flick through picture books, young adult titles and even some classics in English.Some shyly pet Luna while waiting their turn to browse. Sururi believes the gentle nature of his six-year-old mare helps attract children, and pique an early interest in the books.The horse makes me happy, said 10-year-old Arif, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, before settling in to read a book titled Wild Animals.But its not just children discovering a love for reading via this charitable community library.Adults are almost just as enthusiastic, many pausing work and emerging from their homes as Sururi and Luna pass through the narrow lanes of one village.17-year-old Warianti, perusing titles alongside her elderly mothers, said villagers of all ages benefited from Sururis visits, as most did not have time to source books elsewhere.The horse library helps increase the knowledge of local women through reading, she said.Adult literacy rates in Indonesia have climbed steadily in recent years, reaching nearly 96% in 2013, according to data from the ministry of education. But some provinces remain far behind others. Central Java, where Sururi makes his rounds, is lagging in the bottom third nationwide.Nearly five percent  or close to one million  adults in this mainly rural province remain illiterate. Sururi is aware of this, growing up in Central Java without access to a great deal of books.But the altruistic stable hand never underestimated the importance of reading, leading to his free-of-charge mobile book loaning service.Thats the aim of the horse library, so that everyone can broaden their horizons, gain knowledge, become more intelligent, he said.Outside his simple home, Sururi has cleared an area where he dreams of building a permanent library, one stocked with many books and  perhaps one day  a computer.But for now, everything is done by hand. The spines of all books are clearly labelled with a code for identification, and he keeps meticulous records so books are returned on time.Like a conventional library, books can be borrowed free of charge but cannot be loaned forever.In Serang, Sururi checks his notebook and tells one boy he needs to first return an outstanding title before loaning another. The young student sprints off home, returning a short while later clutching the forgotten item, relieved to see his pick of choice remains untouched on the shelf.Once the flurry of borrowing is over, the children settle down in small circles, bearing their new books with pride as Sururi packs up for another week.Soon the air is filled with the sound of dozens of children reading aloud, older pupils helping their younger friends with difficult words or phrases.When I see kids chasing my horse I feel so proud, Sururi said.I feel like Im needed, and thats hugely satisfying.(Text & photo courtesy: Agence France-Presse )"
590475727be9e04154df7394,Dangers of play: Get ready to punish OP Jaisha for nearly dying,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/dangers-of-play-get-ready-to-punish-op-jaisha-for-nearly-dying/,2016-08-24,"Dice it any way you like two Olympic medals for a country inhabited by every sixth human being on the planet, is incredibly pathetic and painful. This is not to deny the valour of individual sportspersons, the incredibly dedicated effort that got them to compete among the absolute best in the world.But lets face the fact that our sportspersons are hugely handicapped by a support system that appears among the absolute worst in the world. Especially as so many stories emerge about how this system instead of supporting the athlete undermined her, acted as antagonist.Right now this system is busy felicitating the two medalists, showering upon them largesse on taxpayers behalf, clicking selfies  and even playing absolutely ridiculous badminton as seen in the video below. Taxpayers yearning for heroes is so infrequently fulfilled that they surely wont begrudge PV Sindhu and Sakshi Malik all this largesse by proxy.But the only way to build a stronger sports culture is to punish incompetence alongside rewarding excellence. From the case of Narsingh Yadav to OP Jaisha there is a crying need to fix accountability  although all we are seeing right now is a passing of the buck as laughable as this shuttling of the cock:WATCH: #PVSindhu plays badminton with Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu in Vijaywadahttps://t.co/4JsOblEff6  ANI (@ANI_news) August 23, 2016Narsingh has of course been heavily punished  banned for four years by the international Court of Arbitration for Sport which effectively brings his Olympic career to an end.But somebody also needs punishing at the National Anti-Doping Agency and the Wrestling Federation of India for all the shenanigans surrounding this case, which have basically put Indias entire anti-doping architecture under suspicion. The smell of governmental interference in the case is also foul.The OP Jaisha tale is even more harrowing. Her father was a daily wage labourer. Her early childhood was spent in such poverty that rice water was a luxury and eating mud was not unknown. She may have had some nightmarish flashbacks as she ran the Olympic marathon passing station after station where other countries representatives were ready with water and nutrients and support for their folks.But the Indian sports officials hadnt bothered turning up and she became dehydrated and collapsed at the end of the 42.2 km race. She feels she could have died.The Athletics Federation of India says she did not ask for personalized nutrition  as if to underline that while other countries pamper their athletes ours must rise and fall by themselves and our country refuses to shoulder any responsibility.Union sports minister has set up a probe panel with two sports ministry babus. Sadly this panels findings seem a foregone conclusion.Other issues like why the babus flew business class to Rio while the athletes were in the cattle class or denied their personal physiotherapists or stuck with a radiologist for a doctor also look set to be buried rather than candidly addressed. It doesnt look like any sports official is going to get the can for these failures.Instead the athlete who stood up and complained is going to be squashed. Guess whats the message going out to sportspeople? Just suck up and shut up and sweat at your own peril.If you win despite all these tall odds then, well then you are a superhero and we will fly with you like a shuttlecock in the wind."
590475a37be9e04154df73e6,National breastfeeding week 2016: Mother’s speak,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/your-fertility-friend/national-breastfeeding-week-2016-mothers-speak/,2016-08-04,"On the occasion of National breastfeeding week 2016, I would like to share a couple of questions that hover in the minds of nursing mothers during their breastfeeding journey.I am having low milk supply. Are there any foods that can help me in improving lactation?Being a nursing mother, you will surely have tons of questions revolving in your mind. Every mother is deeply concerned about their newborns health and growth and wish to resort for the best. During the nursing phase, the mother should pay more attention to her health since whatever the mother consumes plays an important role in post-delivery recovery and amount of breast milk produced.Here is a list of few foods that are must-have for nursing mothers to improve milk supply:Oatmeal:Oats regulate the possibilities of having diabetes after birth. They are a great source of fiber and aids in indigestion. You can have a bowl of oatmeal in morning or grab a few oatmeal cookies.Spinach and Beet Leaves:Spinach and beet leaves are full of iron, calcium and folic acid and promotes lactation. They strengthen the baby and also prevent breast cancer in mothers. The best way to eat is to mix the spinach and beet leaves in moderation and prepare dough for parathas.Carrots:Carrots are rich in Vitamin A which directly complements lactation and also improves the quality of breast milk. A glass of carrot juice with breakfast or lunch will do wonders.Fenugreek Seeds:Fenugreek seeds are a proven method for enhancing breast milk supply. Mix fenugreek seeds and rice in parathas and enjoy a healthy breakfast.Basil Leaves:Basil leaves are anti-oxidant rich and help in increasing babys immunity. Also, it gives a calming effect. Dip the basil leaves in hot water overnight, drink the mixture every morning and experience the difference.Bottle Gourd:Bottle gourd is not a vegetable in true sense but is highly nutritious. It helps in keeping the nursery mother hydrated throughout the day. Have a fresh glass of bottle gourd juice to keep the blood sugar levels in control post-delivery.What should I avoid eating during my breastfeeding phase?Are you wondering why your breast milk supply low? Or do you need any change in your diet that is lowering your milk supply production?Here is a list of foods that you should avoid during your breastfeeding phase:Citrus Fruits:Citrus fruits have high vitamin C content, which is healthy for you and your baby. However, some babies may suffer from diarrhea due to sensitivity to vitamin C as it interrupts with the babys gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, avoid consuming citrus fruits like oranges and lemons and switch to kiwis, papayas, mangoes, pineapples and raspberries.Peanuts:If your family has genetic condition of peanut allergies then avoid having peanuts during your breastfeeding phase. Peanuts have proteins that may act as allergens during breastfeeding resulting in symptoms like rashes, wheezing or hives in baby.Caffeine:Having caffeine in moderation is absolutely fine. Note that high consumption of caffeine reduces iron content in breast milk as well as hemoglobin levels.Chocolate:Chocolate might be a great alternative for you to satisfy your sweet tooth but it involves theobromine. If a nursing mother intakes more than 750 mg of theobromine per day, there are chances of baby exhibiting erratic behaviors and sleep issues.When should I stop breastfeeding my baby?The best time for breastfeeding is until your baby turns six months. This phase is very crucial as it is the development period of your baby. So continue breastfeeding till six months for a healthy start. Later, if you and your baby are enjoying breastfeeding can be done till 2 years. It can be followed by introducing complementary foods along with breastfeeding or as desired after six months of breastfeeding.For how long can I store my breast milk?To ensure that stored breast milk stays fresh for longer time, keep in mind a few guidelines as follows: Room temperature: Breast milk could be stored at room temperature for upto 6 hours Insulated cooler: Breast milk can be stored in an insulated cooler for 24 hours Refrigerator: Breast milk could be stored in a refrigerator for 5 days Deep freezer: Breast milk can be stored at the back of deep freezer upto 6 monthsHow is foremilk and hindmilk different from each other?You might have heard that mothers produce two types of milk at the beginning of breastfeeding phase. Foremilk is the thinner and low-fat milk which the baby receives at first. While milk is being produced, the fat layer sticks to the boundaries of milk-making cells while the liquid content of the milk moves down the milk ducts towards the nipple, where it combines with the leftover milk in the previous feeding.When the hindmilk mixes with the high-lactose foremilk, it becomes the perfect food for babies. This yields high-calorie and high-fat milk content that helps in babys growth and brain development.I may be having hypothyroidism; can I still breastfeed my baby?Hypothyroidism is a serious condition of having an underactive thyroid that directly impacts the metabolic rate. The symptoms of hypothyroidism consist of fatigue, poor appetite, depression, intolerance to cold, thinning hair and dry skin. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism can be determined as the symptoms and a simple blood test. A radioactive testing may also be used. The duration of the mother required to let down breastfeeding depends upon the type of radioactive materials used. Radioactivity of breast milk decreases with time and frequent milk expression may help the mother remove radioactivity for her and the milk should be discarded and not fed to baby.Breastfeeding is not just a duty but the creation of a pure and loving bond between the mother and baby. As soon as a baby is born, the breast milk of the mother becomes its source of life. It is beneficial for both the mother and the baby. Therefore, all the would-be mothers stick to breastfeeding instead of formula milk products. Happy Breastfeeding!"

It brought back memories of my music teacher Sudhir Khastgir who taught us Rabindra Sangeet at school, and made us sing the perennial song  Mon Mere Meghe Songi every time it rained. A day of rains meant listening to the baritone rich Hemanta Kumar and his haunting renditions of Gitabitan.In Kerala, Malayalis call the monsoon mazhakaalam and it is the catalyst for many things. Poets, writers, film makers, artists musicians the world of artistic domains awaken into a realm in which they are possessed.Uthaman Kadanchery is modest about his life as a photographer.  I do wedding photography as well as portraits for film stars because that gives me my daily wages. But between assignments I carry my camera and become a nomad of silent journeys.Uthamans photographs of the Kerala monsoon are stirring testimonies of the sweeping showers of the rain gods. When the verdant forests and nature get washed by its sheathes of wet beauty it speaks of the rhythm of the falling rain.In a single image of the tree as a silhouette against the nimbus filled sky it is as if the wind is a torrent of darkness and the atmospherics pregnant with moisture. As raindrops fall on the silver streams of a small tributary the little bridge is crossed by a dhoti clad resident who carries his umbrella and walks in the rain. Rice pickers in a rice field seem happy to pick up the green shoots while the raindrops fall.The magnificent peacock in its splendid fanning out dance is a signature of Gods beauty in the art of creation. Colours gloom and glance and vie for attention. Red earth becomes pungent in colour zones as the pouring rain engulfs the soil and fills it with its weight.Of rare symphony is the image of a sari clad lady with a patterned umbrella walking barefoot on the road as the wetness surrounds her pathway. I was sitting in the car and I saw her,so I stopped the car put my head out of the window and quickly clicked,not always can one get good results in the rain,it is tricky and somewhat challenging because your senses can guide you into a realm of just watching and enjoying the moments adds Uthaman.Monsoons in Kerala have their own charm. It is reminiscent of Hari Prasad Chaurasias Brindavan Malhar that is laced with the harmony of the heavens. Listening to Chaurasias monsoon raagas conjures images of dripping raindrops, drenched red earth, shimmering streams ,glistening flora, chirping sparrows, and wet hills agog with joy at the soaking sensation of rain.It is not easy to shoot images in the rain according to Uthaman,it requires expertise and uncanny precision to picturise the real-life scenario adroitly . Not to miss the trademark sweeping speed of the blanketing moisture with the tapering trees abruptly being taken to a finale as the palm leaves bend in the gust .Uthaman explains the rudiments with a soft passion. Life itself takes on different cadences and the short syllabic notes are like little rhythms that you to listen to as it beats on the ground or on a tin roof. The staying power of the monsoon and its ability to make everything and everyone respond to its falling rhythms is what makes the experience amazing to say the least.The cascading images of the falling rain in Kerala can have a Wordsworthian effect on the people. It can drum its way into your ears like a gushing waterfall or it can just sound like a brook sprinkling welcome drops on a city bred soul fed up of superficiality. Whatever the response it awakens, Uthamans monsoon studies brought back multiple memories-it spoke of an inner sensory alchemy the flashback of the gifted but blind Grammy award singer Jose Feliciano and his eternal song Rain that holds true so many years hence :Listen to the falling rainListen to it fallAnd with every drop of rainYou know I love you moreImages: Uthaman Kadanchery"
59048aa57be9e04154df83e6,Modi sends the wrong message on centre-state contributions,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/modi-sends-the-wrong-message-on-centre-state-contributions/,2016-05-09,"In an election speech in Tamil Nadu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi drew a false distinction between centre and the state in terms of their contribution to public welfare. Given Modis personal popularity and his position, it is bound to give a lot of people an incorrect idea about the way India functions.According to Times of India, Modi said: The rice that the poor get in Tamil Nadu, they dont know where it comes from and no one here tells them. For 1kg of rice, Rs 27 comes from the Delhi treasury, thats why you get it at subsidised rates of Re 1 and Rs 2. Dilli sarkar is concerned about you. But there arent any photos of Modi or his name on the bags. My happiness is the smile on the faces of the poor people.The paper said it was a veiled comment on the stickers of Jayalalithaa pasted on flood relief materials.It was said in the middle of an election campaign where facts or accuracy are not sacred. But the problem is that the speaker is the prime minister who is taken seriously. Almost surely, his speech has conveyed the wrong impression about the role of central and state governments.For the central government, taxes contribute 63 paise for every rupee it gets. Even in the case of states, taxes make up most of their own revenue. In addition, states gets a share of centres tax revenue and grants.Tax revenue is, therefore, the most important aspect of a budget.Tax is generated on production of goods and services, and their consumption. Over and above these production and consumption taxes, the centre has exclusive right to tax incomes and profit of companies.The extent and nature of economic activity is what supports the entire structure. The centre and states, as two distinct layers of government, get to tax the same economic activity at different stages. Generally, the centre taxes production and incomes, while states tax consumption. This is not a watertight classification, but an indicative one.If taxes are generated on the basis of underlying economic activity, it is impossible for centre to take credit as Prime Minister Modi did. The economic activity takes place in one state or the other, or between states as in the case of a telephone call which leads to service tax. Constitutional demarcation of taxation rights, allows different layers of government to tax the same economic activity at different stages.So, who is responsible for that economic activity?Both centre and states through a combination of economic and social policies, and the quality of governance. Policies and governance quality vary across states which, along with historical factors, account for a significant variation in their performances.Finally, if the centre raises money from economic activity in India, it is only logical that they spend the money on the people of India. But given the nature of Indias administrative structure, the effectiveness of a central scheme like food subsidy depends primarily on how well the state government implements it on the ground.Eventually, no matter which way one looks at it, it is not possible for either centre or a state to take exclusive credit for anything.For sure, both sides try to get political mileage out of a scheme, ignoring the contribution of the other side. If Modi can feel unhappy about centre not getting enough credit for its contribution to food security, then states can feel short-changed by the centre running away with all the mileage for Swachh Bharat when improving public health and sanitation are states responsibilities.One would expect Indias prime minister to be more careful about the message he conveys even in the midst of an election campaign."
59048ad87be9e04154df8428,Who killed Wayanadan Thampan?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/who-killed-wayanadan-thampan/,2016-10-15,"As the CPM-RSS feud erupts again, a look at the life and times of a notorious hit manMathai remembers that late January morning in 1980 as unusually cold. As he left his brick-and-thatch house for the paddy fields, dawn was just breaking and there was mist breathing through the thistles. A chill draft of air came off the river and with it the smell of reeds. A furlong from his house he stumbled on something and looked down at the beige feathers of a dead bird glinting like tinfoil. Picking it up and turning it over he thought it looked like one of those ruse birds that distract predators with their neat camouflage. He was wondering if this was a new type of peregrine or hoopoe when he heard a woman scream.He looked at the bridge in the middle distance and thought someone had fallen into the canal. With the dead bird and duffel bag and sickle, he ran to the bridge, taking a shortcut, tearing through an overgrown patch of communist pacha. He saw no one on the bridge, only a vague shape like an ornamental gourd in the middle of the road. Coming closer it took him a full moment to register what, or rather, who it was. He dropped his things and staggered back to the bridges railing and then he saw the woman who had screamed sitting stunned and silent on the river bank.Some miles away, sleep eluded Sasidharan. Outside his room, he could hear Kottayam town stir itself in preparation for another long day and he knew he had to wait for a couple of hours before confirmation reached him. The previous evening he had been to Mancombu, anonymous, casing the area for the last time, ensuring there would be no last-minute glitches. He relayed the information to the squad in their safe house and left for Kottayam. If it had gone as planned -he could positively feel the hair stand on end on his forearms -it would shock Kerala like nothing else since the Naxalite outrages in the late sixties.Sasidharan, an RSS pracharak, was convinced that the Marxists were bent on physically eliminating political rivals and that they had to be stopped. In Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, the refusal to countenance trade union diktats by tenant farmers, themselves only marginally better off than agricultural labourers, combined with the growing exodus from CPI-M ranks to the sangh parivar had led the Marxists to unleash a reign of terror. Now, finally, terror would be met with terror: a severed head on a bridge ought to give the Marxist leaders and their murderous henchmen some pause.In recounting to me what happened then, Sasidharan clearly remembers his anxiety over the four-men RSS hit squad escaping from Kuttanad. It was not only the peculiar topography of the water-logged area or its preponderance of diehard Marxists, but also that the police could be expected to be over-zealous because the Left Democratic Front was in power in the state. But the squad included Wayanadan Thampan and if anyone could get them out of a hole, it was him.Sasidharan had spent an entire week with the squad, helping them scout for the best access and exit routes and to study the targets daily pattern. Before they first met, Sasidharan recalls, Thampans reputation preceded him. His real name was Ayyappan and he was an extraordinary abhayasi, or martial art adept, so much so that subsequently the sangh parivars hagiographers were to credit him with magical powers that enabled him to be at many places at the same time. His operational coup de grace was to decapitate his victim with a single slash of the urumi [the five-feet-long flexible sword, coiled around the waist when not in use] and there was evidence of his handiwork all the way from Kannur to Kuttanad. Here then was an assailant almost invisible, immune to capture and who never missed his target. It was easy to believe that he would never be killed which is what probably got him his alias, though the Wayanadan Thampan in Kottarathil Shankunnis Aithihya mala is an old necromancer who has to periodically seduce virgins and then murder them to hang on to his youthful exterior.In that excruciating week, he spent with him, Sasidharan says, he was too excited, his nerves shredded, to train a microscopic gaze at Tham pan. He did notice one thing: though Thampan was unassuming and never displayed any aggression, the others moved around him as if he were a pit too deep to fall into. Sensing my growing curiosity, Sasidharan takes me to meet Gargi, a man who handled many RSS hit men including Thampan during the 80s and 90s. He warns me that Gargi is a difficult type, very reticent and probably all you will get is a feel of how things were done, not any concrete details.We meet Gargi one afternoon at a house in central Kerala. He is in his seventies, has fulvous tufts of hair in his ears and a nice rueful smile. With his walking stick and thick bifocals he has the unbuttoned look of a ghazal ustad and it is difficult to conjure him as a mentor for politi cal assassins. And as though his appearance werent enough, his name: Gargi, a name from the Upanishads, and that too of a woman, one who dared challenge the great Yajnavalkya, and was probably his secret lover.By way of preface, Gargi remarks, Thampan was someone who wished to live at the edge of his skin. He gave no story, made no claims and the action he sought, the risks he took were a way of compensating for his extra adrenaline. In his own day, Gargi was known to be an extremely hard taskmaster. His wards dreaded his bad opinion. Sasidharan tells me that Gargi kept his men relentlessly occupied and that this daily attention, this continuous tinkering was a way to keep these types, anyway not given too much self-reflection, from questioning their fragile mortality. He sought to strip them of all identity and to exclude all normal concerns from their minds. He often addressed them not by their names, but with some muttered imprecation like hey or you. It was never acknowledged but the model for all this, and the unthinking obedience that he always and above all extracted from them, was clearly paramilitary.Its almost evening before Gargi opens up. Thampan had an unwarped mind, the mind of a good doctor. He could kill a man on the street and then go back and finish his lunch or whatever he had been doing. Once he decided on something he had no use for morality, Gargi recalls.I ask Gargi to describe Thampans appearance but he waves his hand. I suspect he is thinking he has already revealed too much. Earlier, Sasidharan had shown me a photograph, which he refused to part with, of Thampan with two others. The light in the photo is poor and I can be certain of only a narrow, dark face, mustachioed and with cropped hair. Sasidharan had appended his own description: how Thampans short figure, though wiry and powerful, appeared to be flawed somewhere. He had a limp, rather, a list to one side. It was probably caused by some minor hip defect or maybe one of his legs was fractionally shorter. But his sideways scuttle, or at least it seemed so to Sasidharan, was part of the mystery and menace of the man, the imagined disability making it more sinister than a straightforward one would have.A few days after meeting Gargi I find in a vernacular newspapers archives what I had been looking for a three-para story tucked away in an inside page reporting the death of Thampan in October 1985. Ayyappan, an RSS activist, also known as Wayanadan Thampan, was killed by suspected Marxist party workers at Nayathode the other day. He was stepping out of a stream, a by-way of the Periyar, having just finished his bath, when the assailants hurled country bombs at him. He died on the spot. Ayyappans mother, a neighbour confirmed, refused to attend the funeral, claiming she had no tears left for a son who had made so many mothers weep.I try to contact Gargi, phoning him, to quiz him about that melodramatic part of the report. He says hello, recognizes me, inquires if everything is fine, and hears out my question. There is an audible pause, then prolonged static and I keep saying hello then a click at the other end.I had somehow, somewhere, in the course of working on this story, started to romanticize people like Gargi, thinking him a samurai with a heart, a rock not fully stone. Now, with the phone dead, the scene suddenly slid from everyday colour to black and white: with such types what you get is never what you see."
59048b157be9e04154df8471,"Driving to Meerut, a foodie paradise",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Addictions/driving-to-meerut-a-foodie-paradise/,2016-07-04,"Only the truly devoted will drive from Delhi to Meerut on a Sunday morning in search of the perfect chicken kali mirch. We, four friends, are heading towards the western Uttar Pradesh town, about 60 kms from the capital, as food explorers.Meerut has an impressive resume. We know it was the raging heart of the great 1857 revolt that shook British raj. The small town was once the centre of a multi-million rupee Hindi pulp fiction industry and still manufactures the finest cricket bats in the country. But many may not know that Meerut is a gastronomic delight too.Our first stop is the famous Jain Ki Shikanji shop at Modinagar. There are dozens of shikanji sellers in this town once famous for Modi suiting and shirtings. But Jains small cubicle-size shop, located by the police station, is the real McCoy. Shikanji was created to beat the summer heat. And at Jains, you know how. The drinks preparation is a short seven-step to heaven. First, a measured portion of sugar syrup is poured into a glass; followed by a strong squeeze of lemon.The glass is stuffed with crushed ice. Then a bottle of soda is emptied over it. This is followed by a spoonful of the special shikanji masala. The glass is then capped and shaken. Your drink is ready. Unlike Coke, the ingredients is no state secret. You can buy them separately too.The drink fortifies us for the lunch ahead. Asking passers by every 50 metres, we arrive at Papa Ji Daal Wale (sic), a dhaba near the old Baghpat More bus stand. Daal is to any meal what Laxman is to Ramayan: vital and self-effacing. At Papaji, it commands centre stage. The shop, owned by a genial sardarji, specialises in urad-chane ki daal which is slow cooked over low fire overnight. We want to pack some for dinner.But sardarji hasnt come in yet and without him, the staff refuses to serve. We leave with a heavy, hungry heart.Delhi Durbar, next to Imliyan Masjid, is on Hapur Road. Far more accommodating, they usher us into the new air-conditioned section where a young man is feeding what looks like fruit-cream to a woman in burqa. Our order is simple: chicken kali mirch and tandoori roti. One of us orders a chicken biryani too. The biryani is a crushing disappointment, it feels more like chicken in fried rice minus the finesse. But the chicken kali mirch is just right; its thick curry blended in cashew and cream. Flavour and taste blend to create a dish that is pure bliss. It is worth a hundred trips from Delhi. Anytime.Thats the unanimous view.On the way back, we pick up the dal. But before that we stumble upon the culinary treasure of the day. We spot a hotel whose name reminds me of an old Bollywood song. Its called, Char Yaar, and it was set up in 1950. Its basically a sweet shop that specialises in halwa-parantha. The deep-friend paranthas are the size of a large pizza and its crisp and flaky, much like a patty. The halwa, topped with cherries, is equally oily. You can say, its a dish to die for.Rather literally. But as food explorers, this is our discovery of the day. We taste some and pack the rest. It has been a week since that afternoon but the taste of the chicken kali mirch lingers on."
59048b397be9e04154df84b2,How goats can clean Delhi’s dirty air,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/how-goats-can-clean-delhis-dirty-air/,2016-10-16,"Delhis air pollution season is starting with the burning of rice stubble by farmers on lakhs of acres after the kharif harvest. Its politically impossible to stop a traditional practice like burning through legal bans: farmers think they have a right to burn, whatever the ecological consequences The solution lies in finding profitable ways to use the rice stubble. Of these, the most intriguing is the conversion of stubble into goat fodder.Burning stubble destroys a useful raw material, pollutes the air, causes respiratory diseases and worsens greenhouse gas emissions. Traditionally, rice was harvested manually. But todays farm labour shortage means combine harvesters now cut most of the kharif crop in the north-west. Manual cutting leaves only a couple of inches of stubble, but combine harvesters leave 12-15 inches.Once, farmers allowed shepherds to graze sheep on the stubble. But today farmers are in a rush to clear the fields and plant a rabi crop within a fortnight of the kharif harvest. Cutting and transporting stubble can cost Rs 1,200 per tonne, and few buyers will pay so much. Hence most farmers simply burn the stubble.Multiple approaches are needed to discourage burning. Zero-till farming, for instance, sows wheat seeds without removing the stubble. A promising new machine is the tractor-mounted Happy Seeder that simultaneously cuts rice stubble and sows wheat seeds, depositing the cut stubble on top as a mulch. This eliminates burning, but carries additional costs. Hence farmers, who are risk-averse, mostly stick to burning. To catalyse change, a promotional tax break for Happy Seeder machines can be given for, say, five years. This will help spread awareness of the new technology and popularize its use. Some studies suggest that with some new tweaks, it may also increase yields.Punjab has a pilot project using straw as fuel for power generation. But that loses money right now. It pays farmers less for straw than other users such as the packaging and paper industries. Neither demand nor the price of straw suffices today to discourage burning.The best use of stubble is as animal feed. Over 100 million tonnes of stubble is burned today. Converting that into milk and meat will add more value than using it as fuel. Problem: rice straw has high silica content, reducing its digestibility. Hence only 30% of rice straw is used today as fodder, against 70% of wheat straw. Both rice and wheat straw have a high lignin content that also hampers digestion.Humans cannot digest straw at all, but ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) have four-stage stomachs that digest up to half of it. Goats have the toughest stomachs and best digestion rates. They are famous for aggressively eating almost anything. So, goat feed is potentially the best use of rice straw.Traditionally, goats were grazed in village pastures and forests. Shrinking grazing space has reduced the goat population. Forest grazing must be stopped, as it thwarts regeneration. The future lies in stall feeding: animals are kept in stalls and fed a mixture of straw, oilcakes and cereals. Treatment with urea, alkalis or molasses can improve the digestibility (and hence calorific value) of straw.Stall feeding is obviously more costly than free grazing. But it has advantages too. The energy animals spend in grazing uses up to one-third of their calorie intake. This is avoided by stall feeding, so stall-fed animals produce significantly more milk and meat than those that graze.Operation Flood has hugely increased milk production and the cattle population. But nothing similar has been done for goats, although goat meat is the most prized, and goat milk has buyers. Cows produce only one calf, whereas goats produce three to six kids, which mature much faster than calves. A goat costs one-tenth as much as a buffalo and so is affordable even by poor villagers, apart from being hardier and less disease-prone.India needs a goat revolution to match Operation Flood. This requires much R&D and incentives for stall feeding. These can be combined with short-run moves, of which the simplest will be a tax break or subsidy, funded by green levies, for fodder processors that upgrade the nutritional value of straw by adding urea or molasses. This can immediately make stubble harvesting more profitable, checking burning and reducing the brown haze that chokes Delhi and the north-west. This can supplement other anti-pollution measures to reduce road dust, construction dust and vehicle emissions."

Speaking with Amin Ali, Scindia discussed how his party rebuffs BJPs charges, why he thinks BJP should apologise to the nation, BJP versus Congress on corruption  and whether Congress is slowly regaining public trust:BJP says the Agusta evidence points to your partys top leaders being involved  why are you in denial?In my recent speech in Parliament, i have point by point dismantled BJPs presumptions  there is no evidence of our party leaders involvement.In fact, we filed the case, we got the ED involved, we sent letters to four countries and we impounded choppers.What have they done in the last two years? Removed the ban, allowed them to participate in a new deal and invited them for the Make in India show.The ball is in BJPs court now  they have to show action.We have demanded a Supreme Court-monitored probe. We request the probes report be placed before the House every three months. We demand the speediest and fairest probe.However, your speech has been called playing the victim card, basically to save Congresss top family.But BJPs only reply about their progress in the Agusta case is theyre awaiting a response to letters our government had written to concerned authorities  is this the progress that a government in power for the last 730 days should be proud of?They have not done anything except indulge in character assassination of our leaders.Well give it back to them in good and equal measure.BJPs responded by terming Congresss March for Democracy a hike to save an undemocratic dynasty.Well, BJPs undemocratic designs have come a cropper with the recent SC verdict in the Uttarakhand episode. They failed at throttling democracy  theyre hiding their frustration through such statements now.Uttarakhand has been a moral defeat for BJP  they must apologise to the nation for their anti-democracy actions.So many allegations of corruption against Congress exist  arent these a big dent on the partys credibility?We stand for probity in public life.Look at our track record. We dont stand for people who are corrupt. Weve taken action against our own members, even when we were in government.And what is the track record of the people accusing us? Coffingate, a party president caught on tape demanding a bribe, reports of corruption in every BJP-ruled state, from Vyapam to a rice scam.We take action against the corrupt  while BJP shields them.Rahul Gandhis flip-flops about assuming responsibility, either as a potential CM face in UP or party president, are also mocked.Rahul Gandhi is vice-president of the Congress party  that in itself is a position of tremendous responsibility.As a responsible leader, he has raised a gamut of issues, from students, farmers, fishermen to our countrys foreign policy, which are all matters of utmost importance.Under his leadership, we are sure to rise to new heights.Sonia Gandhis tenure brought us to power twice  now the party will rise again under Sonia and Rahuls combined leadership.BJP is scared of this leadership. Hence, the personal attacks.Wont possible defeats in upcoming state polls dent Rahuls image further?I wont speak about a hypothetical situation.We accept every election result with utmost respect. The mandate of the people has to be accepted with utmost humility.But BJP says you still havent come to terms with humility about 2014s mandate and thats why Congress keeps disrupting Parliament  isnt that true?We accepted that result with respect. We lost the confidence of the people  but weve regained it again to a certain measure.We have played the role of a responsible opposition. We participated in debates and put forth our views on financial matters, drought, student persecution.The House has worked above its potential. It was due to our involvement.BJP should look at its own history  due to its opposition tactics, 65% of Parliaments precious time was lost.Everyones not impressed. AAPs Arvind Kejriwal feels the Congress-BJP fight is a fixed match.Arvind Kejriwal should look at fulfilling the promises hes made to the people of Delhi. He needs to focus on common citizens now.Were committed to raising the concerns of every citizen  and making the flag of our party fly high."
59048bf27be9e04154df85e8,"What Mamata has learnt from Nitish, Lalu",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/what-mamata-has-learnt-from-nitish-lalu/,2016-05-15,"The urban middle classes hate her, the rural masses love her. The middle classes hate to admit it, but in elections the rural masses matter more.Most of the bhadralok castigate her for ruining university autonomy, filling institutions with her loyalists, and selling not just university teaching posts (as the Left Front used to) but even student seats in the best colleges. They say she has brought her own thugs to every district, replacing those of the Left Front. Often, the old thugs have simply switched sides.She is alleged to have created a web of syndicates  monopoly suppliers of various services and construction materials  that skim money from procurement systems. She has financed a plethora of youth clubs, which intellectuals claim are just gangs loyal to Mamata.She is frankly contemptuous of intellectuals, and proudly says she represents the masses. In this, she resembles Lalu Yadav, who in Bihar spent 15 years empowering backward castes at the expense of the upper-caste elite, often by dubious, thuggish means.A very different image of Mamata comes from her supporters, including a minority of the bhadralok. They say she has promoted economic development, and done more for rural roads, rural electrification and water than the Left Front did in decades. In this respect, Mamata resembles Nitish Kumar, who also focused on economic development and was rewarded with three successive state victories. GDP growth seems to have accelerated a bit, but nowhere near as much as in Nitishs Bihar.In a poor country, all politicians have to show a populist streak, and Mamata is no exception. She has spent much effort promoting cheap health for the masses. She has offered bicycles to schoolgirls, and rice at Rs 2/kilo to ration card holders. Yet this is a very small list of freebies compared with those of politicians in other states like Tamil Nadu.Her main election platform is rural development, not freebies. She defends syndicates and youth clubs as ways of empowering rural people and sharing the benefits of development with a wide range of grassroots folk. She claims thuggery is much reduced compared with Left Front rule. The smell of corruption has hit some of her ministers, yet her personal image is of simplicity and honesty.She has had the guts to stand up to government trade unions that have ousted governments in other states. She pays them dearness allowance amounting to only 75% of basic salary, as against 125% given by the central government. Almost all other CMs have felt obliged to follow the central norm, so Mamata stands out. She has diverted money from civil service salaries to development, and that is both courageous and productive.The Left Fronts land reforms, starting 1977, won it great rural goodwill for decades, but that has now evaporated. The CPM replaced formal government rule largely by cadre rule, and all villages and districts became fiefdoms of CPM cadres. Electricity was perennially in short supply, hitting not just industrial development but rural electrification. Most farmers had to use diesel pump-sets for irrigation, which cost far more to operate than electric pump-sets.Mamata is lucky that, thanks to weak industrialization, the whole eastern grid now has an electricity surplus. Nitish Kumar took advantage of this to extend rural electricity to almost all villages in Bihar, and this spurred his election victory last year. Mamata has also greatly expanded rural electrification, and hopes for a similar electoral dividend.Several chief ministers who have won repeated re-election  Narendra Modi, Nitish, Naveen Patnaik, Shivraj Chouhan  have followed the model of a strong, high centralising CM empowering the bureaucracy to ignore MLAs and panchayat politicians and deliver results (including politically biased ones). Mamata has adopted a milder version of this model. Businessmen like this model, and are surprisingly upbeat on Mamata, even though she came to power  and retains mass rural support  by excoriating the Tatas and other large industries for acquiring land from farmers at cheap rates. West Bengal is doing far better in services and small manufacturing than big industry, and this needs less land.The states main crop is paddy. Once, the state was highly deficit in paddy, but the green revolution has created a surplus, lowering the market price below the minimum support price. Mamata has substantially expanded government procurement of paddy, just as Nitish did in Bihar, benefiting farmers. This could be an important vote winner.In sum, Mamata has learned lessons from Lalu Yadav on the importance of dignity for the masses, and from Nitish Kumar, the importance of rural development. I suspect that will give her a big election victory."

At a time when one-fourth of India has been hit hard by water scarcity, the apex courts alarming conclusion that the Centre is guilty of washing its hands of a national disaster even as several states have adopted an ostrich-like attitude must lead to a policy overhaul. For a water-scarce country like India, managing such a valuable resource is essential and immediate steps must be taken to fix lopsided priorities.Better water management is particularly crucial because Indias water map is uneven. Outside the water-rich Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin and the western coastline, just 29% of water resources service 64% of its land area. This leaves over half the country at the mercy of rain gods. Experts point out that over 80% of all fresh water used in India is for agriculture. Even as groundwater tables across the country are fast depleting, our agricultural yields remains woefully low when compared with countries like China which, for example, produces twice the amount of rice per hectare, or Indonesia, whose groundnut productivity is 1.5 times higher. India urgently needs a time-bound plan for controlled irrigation.Sustainable water management also requires local solutions. Large-scale national projects like the National River Linking Project are simply too unwieldy to be effective. What we need is a drastic overhaul of farm and power policies and the promotion of new irrigation and harvesting techniques that need low capital investment and land. With nearly 33 crore people affected by drought, the need for a nationwide water pricing mechanism as well as a model water law that penalises over-exploitation of water is more urgent than ever."
59048cb67be9e04154df8710,7 reasons why Jayalalithaa remains the voter’s favourite in Tamil Nadu,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/youth-ki-awaaz/7-reasons-why-jayalalithaa-remains-the-voters-favourite-in-tamil-nadu/,2016-10-06,"Jayalalithaa, the incumbent Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu has been admitted to Apollo hospital in Chennai. According to a news report, the hospital has said that she was admitted due to fever and dehydration. Life has come to an uncomfortable standstill for millions of her supporters, who see light only in her.At a time when many people in Tamil Nadu are unable to take a deep breath, we bring you seven reasons which probably had a role to play in her being such a huge name in the state.Amma Unavagam (Mother Canteen)One of the great successes in postcolonial India is the scheme of Amma Unavagam (Mother Canteen). It is a chain of canteens where food is provided at a highly subsidised rate. It is a hit amongst the people of Tamil Nadu. The beauty of it lies in the fact that it is not only people from the poorer sections of Tamil society who go to have food in the Amma canteens. Its popular amongst people from affluent backgrounds as well. The scheme started in 2013.Currently, it has over 200 such canteens across Tamil Nadu. Curd rice and sambhar rice are always available and cost just Rs 3. Two chapattis with dal also cost the same amount. Amma and her partys success in both the general and state elections seem to suggest that people are happy with such welfare policies in a neo-liberal setup.Banning of alcohol in phasesAfter being re-elected as Chief Minister in the 2016 state elections, she decided to close 500 liquor shops across the country. Before the elections, she had promised to ban alcohol in the state in phases. Time will tell if the Tamilians who love alcohol will be robbed off their drinks or if it was one of those promises before the elections, which was never meant to be taken seriously.The encounter of VeerappanThe encounter of Veerappan, the notorious smuggler and bandit was under the reign of Jayalalithaa in 2004. It was a huge achievement. Thousand crores had been spent on the manhunt and 130 police personnel lost their lives. It was such an important event that even the national media could no longer think of an excuse to not cover a state from South India.Cradle Baby Scheme In 1992The Cradle Baby Scheme, launched by the Jayalalithaa government in 1992 was started to bring an end to infanticide of girl children. Cradle baby centres were initially constructed in the Salem district and it has now spread to other districts such as Dharmadari, Madurai, Namakkal, etc. The centres are equipped with life saving drugs, bed sheets and gas connections, amongst other things. There are facts to back Jayalalithaas claims that it created a positive impact in Tamil Nadu. The child sex ratio in Tamil Nadu was 1000 : 942, as per the 2001 census. According to the census of 2011, it jumped to 1000: 946.Rain Water Harvesting SchemeIn a country where water from tankers leak on the main roads and taking three showers a day is described as a need by many, Tamil Nadu is one state which has given due importance to rain water harvesting. The Rain Water Harvesting Scheme was started by Jayalalithaas government in 2001. The government made harvesting mandatory for all residential and government buildings. Water tables in many neighbourhoods in Chennai have risen as a result. The scheme was initiated 15 years ago. Today, the people of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are ready to take law into their own hands as the earth cant afford to share water anymore with everyone. Such vision of Jayalalithaa must be appreciated.Offering freebiesShe is famous for providing a lot of freebies to the voters right before the elections. It continued even in the 2016 state elections despite the debt of the state reportedly having gone up by 80 percent over the past five years. In the 2016 state elections, AIADMK promised employment to one member of each family. Students from class 11 and 12 were offered free laptops with internet and every household was promised 100 free units of electricity. She had offered freebies in the 2006 and 2011 elections as well.Amma saltThe most iconic freedom movement in British India, the Dandi March, began with the production of salt. The necessity of salt in everything we eat and the cheap price at which it can be obtained makes it the friend of people from all classes. How could there not be an Amma salt being sold in the state? Manufactured by the Tamil Nadu Salt Corporation, it is cheaper than the salt sold by private companies. Sodium salt costs only Rs 21 while other companies sell it for not less than Rs 25.These are just some of the reasons why Tamil Nadu is always on the edge of the seat whenever Amma is in the news.The article was originally published in Youth Ki Awaaz."
59048cde7be9e04154df8752,Japan’s love for Bollywood reaches new highs,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/voices/japans-love-for-bollywood-reaches-new-highs/,2016-11-05,"Bollywood has found serious takers among the Japanese. So much so, that it is not uncommon for Japanese girls to travel all the way to India to learn dance the Bollywood way.Indian movies have been instrumental in giving a push to this trend. It was with the 1998 release of Rajinikanth-starrer Muthu  The Dancing Maharajah that Indian films began to catch the attention of the country. The film was a huge success, thus paving the way for other Indian films.According to fans in Japan, Indian films have long been considered kitschy, with characters that suddenly start singing and dancing for no reason. But it is true that this image has undergone some change today, as Bollywood films come up with increasingly better storytelling. But the characteristic large-scale dance scenes are what draw many Japanese girls towards the genre.Young women initially started by learning a few Bollywood moves as a hobby, but soon, a few of them started performing in nightclubs, bars and even at events of the Indian community. In recent years, this number exploded to include over 4,000 Japanese women. A few have been known to take leave from work to join classes in India.Once they return, they have the option of pursuing a second career as dance performers.According to a performer who learned Bollywood dance in India and now performs and teaches the dance style in Japan, Japanese girls have been highly influenced by visiting artistes from India. Dancing is seen to be a skill that can be acquired over a period of a few weeks or months, so they can return and begin performing. As people witness their performances, they too are inspired to learn.An important factor in the growing popularity of Bollywood in Japan is that India is considered affordable by most foreigners. Further, learning the dance form is not too costly either.The appetite for Bollywood and Indian dancing among Japanese girls is on the rise. Not limiting themselves to Bollywood, some even learn Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi, Odissi among other dance forms.This fascination for Bollywood is so evident that ad-makers are trying to cash in on the trend. It is now a common occurrence for boys and girls to promote curry-flavored rice crackers and other products with the picture of some Indian superstars inscribed on them. Packaging for spicy food often displays cartoons or photos associated with Indian movies and dance.A pertinent question is why it is mostly Japanese who perform the Indian dance, but not Indians. The truth is, it is difficult and challenging for Indians artistes to perform in Japan, other than those specifically invited for embassy programs.It is a fact that the Japanese entertainment market is dominated by Hollywood films and to some extent, Chinese and Korean ones. But the emotional drama, dance and song sequences prevalent in Bollywood have clearly charmed their way into the hearts of the Japanese."

It no longer matters what lead to the crisis and different sources have different versions of the story to tell. Violence and looting, has surrounded the country side on a normal day. It is little different from terrorism for innocent civilians, desperately searching for meaning and direction. Watch group observatory for violence said that on an average around 10 lootings are taking place daily where people are searching for rice to detergents to toilet paper and also beer. Lack of electricity has created massive rolling blackouts. Large scale violence has engulfed Venezuela and people are robbing and killing for a living. Going by records, Venezuelas capital is the most violent city in the world with the highest rate of global homicides. The kidnapping rate when compared to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq and Syria also remains high in Venezuela. This is clearly a society in distress.International humanitarian organizations are yet to arrive in bulk as the government is showing heightened levels of arrogance to accepting global help.Amidst all the economic disruptions the health impact that is being built on Venezuela is pushing the civilians to the brink and is almost a unique man made humanitarian disaster. Venezuelas economy is one of the worst in the world and according to the International Monetary Fund, the recession and downward spiral in economy will remain until 2019. Inflation grew upto 500% this year and this is not a very encouraging sign for the future of the Latin American country.Venezuelas top three universities showed that people were eating less than three meals a day, which was revealed through a research study. Eating less will naturally lead to decreased nutritional intakes and will eventually make civilians vulnerable to certain diseases. Children who do not get food and are under 5 years old, will go into malnutrition that remains a significant problem in Venezuela. Doctors have abandoned hospitals and left the place because of gross distress. No doctors in hospitals means the end in view for those patients on palliative care and those suffering from chronic diseases. What is alarming is that the International community has not yet understood the magnitude of the problem and global aid has not yet started coming into Venezuela. The global media are far too isolated and have not felt the desperation of the situation. Possibly for countries in Europe and Asia, Latin American Crisis gets neglected attention. El Guri Dam, the countrys main power generating source is at new record low level and the government blames drought to run away from taking responsibility and fixing the problem. In the light of this emergency, the United Nations should pressurise the International Community and the diplomatic wings to tell the world of this deepening crisis. The global health community are tearing their heads apart. From juggling the African health situation which struggles for basic health care, to addressing migrant issues on health in Europe, to focusing on war zones and depleting health work-force in those conflict zones, to facing disasters and emerging infections, to address rising burden of non-communicable diseases and to pacify road injury victims, increased spending and increased corporate spending for social responsibility should become the dictum of the day.Venezuelas Government is in distress, it cannot afford to pay for products like sugar, eggs, flour and milk. In the light of sugar crisis, the global giant of beverages, Coke announced stoppage of its outlets in Venezuela. Government officials work only twice a week to save electricity and medical supplies are getting scare. The nations 30 million people are only counting on hope and prayer to resurrect them from this crisis.Are we listening?Recently in a statement, The Ministry of Health, Venezuela said that 75 % of the medicines described as essential is not existing in Venezuela and with the added burden of Zika virus epidemic doing the rounds, the collapse of the health system is imminent. However, the health systems decline will not only paralyze Venezuelas citizens, it is going to create devastating impact on neighbouring countries like Colombia and Guyana which is already in political crisis.The solution to the above is straightforward. International pressure on the Venezuela Government to encourage and appeal to outside help needs to be stepped up, to seek soft loans from other nations and to take tough decision to reduce inflation. To address health care as a very very urgent mandate and permit outside health workers to remain in the country for at least a year. In answering some of these basics, we will be able to move forward slowly, very slowly."
5904934d7be9e04154df8af7,The alcoholic mammaries of the welfare state,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/the-alcoholic-mammaries-of-the-welfare-state/,2016-05-08,"Upamanyu Chatterjee once wrote a book titled The Mammaries of the Welfare State. If he visited Tamil Nadu today, he would be tempted to write another called The Alcoholic Mammaries of Tamil Nadus Welfare State. Tamil Nadu gives away more freebies to voters than any other state. Its dark secret is that these freebies are financed mainly by massive revenues from liquor sales.All liquor shops are run by TASMAC, a government monopoly, to maximize revenue. TASMAC makes additional money by leasing space to private bars within liquor shops. Liquor revenue has risen from Rs 2,800 crore in 2002-03 to Rs 30,000 crore today. To finance an ever-growing list of freebies, the state government has aggressively expanded the number of liquor shops, making access easy. These now open early in the morning, leading to stories of drunkenness before noon.In one sense this approach has succeeded: liquor revenues have boomed. But in another sense the strategy has failed. It has created a big backlash from women complaining of abuse and wasted household money. The DMK has blamed chief minister Jayalalithaa for encouraging drunks, and promised to impose prohibition if elected. Jayalalithaa in turn has accused the DMK of relaxing prohibition when it was in power, and proposed phased prohibition herself.Neither party can explain how the freebies will continue if there is no liquor revenue. The history of India is replete with examples of prohibition being introduced to win the female vote at elections, followed by a fiscal crisis caused by lack of liquor revenue, followed by a return to liquor sales. History will surely repeat itself in Tamil Nadu.It is by no means the only state where prohibition has become a major election issue. West Bengal and Kerala, two other states currently holding state elections, also have parties promising prohibition. They too have no convincing explanation of how liquor revenue will be replaced. But none has as long a list of freebies as Tamil Nadu, whose task is therefore most daunting.Jayalalithaa has just released her party manifesto. Her list of freebies includes: free cellphones for rationcard holders; free laptops with internet connections for 10th and 12th class students; maternity assistance of Rs 18,000; maternity leave increased from six to nine months; one hundred free electricity units every two months; waiver of all farm loans (at a cost of Rs 40,000 crore); fisherfolk assistance to be hiked to Rs 5,000; women to get 50% subsidy to buy mopeds or scooters; an eight-gram gold coin for women getting married; a free Amma kit including sanitary napkins; and much more. Note that Jayalalithaa already provides 20 kilos of free rice per family, a free mixer-grinder and fan per family, subsidized Amma kitchens, and subsidized goats or cows for rural families.The state is reputed to be Indias best in delivering many government services, including education, health, MNREGA and the public distribution system. However, complaints of corruption are rising. Industrialists say this has been worsening for 15 years, eroding a oncestrong reputation for being a business-friendly state. One industrialist says that if you do not pay up, an army of inspectors will descend to harass you and threaten to close your establishment. An educationist complains that environment clearance is now required even for educational institutions, with the bribe for clearance fixed at so much per square foot of space.The sugar industry ran up enormous losses in recent years because state-advised cane prices were very high in relation to sugar prices. Modis rescue package for sugar mills in 2014 included raising the amount of alcohol to be blended with petrol from 5% to 10%, with the ethanol price rising from Rs 34.50 to Rs 48.50 per litre. But Jayalalithaa wants to maximize alcohol for liquor production. And so she has limited ethanol supply by sugar mills to oil companies to a trickle. The sugar mills are crying foul, in vain. She says she is industry-friendly, but is friendlier to the liquor industry than any other. Thats what produces the money for freebies.Elections in Tamil Nadu are rarely fought on policy issues. Both sides agree on a mixture of economic development and welfarism. Elections are contested mainly on the personal popularity of Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi, and on competition in freebies. Using liquor revenue to improve basic state services like education and health is defensible. Using it for freebies is a political race between parties to the fiscal bottom. It can only end in tears."

That question  which was devised as an advertising slogan for an American hamburger chain  has had, and continues to have, political implications, in India and elsewhere.Wheres the beef? became the focal point in the 1984 faceoff between US presidential candidates Walter Mondale and his rival Gary Hart. The catchphrase was used by both contestants to claim that there was nothing new that could meet  or meat  either the eye, or the aye, in the others electoral campaign.That in the end neither of the two won the run for the White House suggests that such attempts to bully  or bull-y  ones opponents can often backfire.Nonetheless, Wheres the beef? is back with a vengeance, this time in the Indian political arena. With more and more so-called gau rakshaks  self-appointed oral police who dictate what people may or may not put into their own mouths by way of sustenance  jumping onto the bandwagon, or more appropriately onto the bullock cart, the Haryana sarkar is reportedly deploying policemen to check whether any of the pre-Eid biryani sold in the state contains the taboo meat in question.It is not yet clear as to how this culinary constabulary will carry out its official function. Will randomly chosen samples of the rice preparation be sent to specially designated forensic laboratories for chemical analysis of the contents? This could prove to be a time consuming and costly exercise.Besides, given our native genius for food adulteration, the findings might indicate that the suspect substance belongs not to the bovine species but is of canine, feline or other creaturely origin that in no way is kin to kine.Perhaps the beef detection squads might use specifically trained sniffer dogs to nose out contraband cuisine, in much the same way as their counterparts at airports and other sensitive areas zone in on bombs or narcotics. However, there is always the occupational hazard that having got scent of what theyre searching for, such four-legged sleuths might gobble up the evidence before it can be presented in a court of law.Meanwhile, even as the Haryana authorities are trying to catch the metaphoric bull by the horns, in neighbouring UP the political stewpot is being kept bubbling with Mayawati literally beefing up her vote bank by urging her traditional Dalit base to make common cause with the Muslim community on an issue which allegedly is being used to cow down, in more ways than one, both these sections of society.All of which might prompt sceptics to conclude that when it comes to cooking up political gambits its not so much the steak which counts as the symbolic sizzle put on it."
590493be7be9e04154df8b97,Record grain output should boost efforts to extend farm insurance and electronic trading platforms,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/record-grain-output-should-boost-efforts-to-extend-farm-insurance-and-electronic-trading-platforms/,2016-09-23,"The record production of 135 million tons of food grains in the kharif season, which is 11 million tons higher than in the previous year, is a major relief that will give a big boost to the rural economy and stimulate overall demand in the economy. The good Southwest monsoons this year is expected to boost production of most crops above last years levels. Given that food crops account for around two thirds of the agriculture output, and that kharif grain contributed around half the total annual grain output, it is a good breakthrough for the agriculture sector where growth has slumped from a high of 4.2% in 2013-14 to a negative 0.2% in 2014-15 and a meagre 1.1% in 2015-16.Improved supply of food grains will also help soften food prices which has been one of the bugbears that has rankled policy makers, especially the central bank which has had a tough time trying to hold down inflation rates. This is especially because rice output has gone up to record highs. The higher coarse grain output, primed mainly by the record output of maize, will also help bring down prices of an important product consumed by low income groups.Especially reassuring for the government is the surge in output of pulses by more than half to 8.7 million tons mainly boosted by the significant improvement in area and productivity of tur and urad dal. This would help bring down pulse prices, which has hit the roof for some time now, and help cool down food prices substantially.Among other major crops oilseeds have also registered a boom in output this year. However, sugarcane production is expected to be hit in the current year. However, the surprise is the increase in cotton output despite the fall in cropped area, mainly due to the increase in productivity. Overall the first advance estimates of crop production in the middle of fiscal year will be a major boost to consumer and investor confidence in the coming months.Given the optimism on the farm front this is the ripe time for the government to push forward with its efforts to extend important schemes like the extension of farm insurance and e-marketing to a majority of the farm households. Though the number of farmers benefiting from the national agriculture insurance scheme has gone up in recent times only about a fifth of the farmers has been covered in the last kharif crop. Numbers show that crop insurance covers at least half the farmers in only two states: Maharashtra and Rajasthan. However, in states like Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh less than a tenth of the farmers are covered by crop insurance.The other important intervention of the NDA government has been on extending ecommerce facilities to farmers. The idea is to extend electronic trading facilities in 585 regulated wholesale markets by 2018 so that farmers can trade the produce across the nation without any hurdles. Though the plan was to link up 200 markets by September this year and another 200 markets by March 2017 the government has been able to link up only about 23 wholesaled regulated markets in 8 states to the national portal.This not only points to the lackadaisical approach of the states government to freeing the farmers from the clutches of the middlemen but also the strong political links of the trader cartel which not only deprive the farmers of the gains of any increase in food prices but also cause supply bottlenecks to crash prices. Extending the reach of the farm markets should now get the top priority of the government and push it to roll out the program to meet deadlines."

It makes you want to go out and about. Walk in the flower-full parks. Read some poetry at Rajghat. Revisit the beautiful tomb of Safdarjung. Go boating at the Old Fort or India Gate. Cook gajar ka halwa. Have a mimosa breakfast. Drizzle the ghee on the roti. Enjoy the marigolds and plant exotic pansies. Dance at kirtans or Christmas parties. Knit a sweater and renew your relationship with the razaiwala.Say hello to winged guests from far climes. Grow your own palak and methi. Enjoy a good gossip in the sun on the weekend. Get maalish. Wear zari shawls to shaadis.Yet, instead of looking forward to the winter a lot of Delhiites are growing anxious. Because in recent years all its charms have come eclipsed under a sickly dark cloud of pollution, a lot of it caused by crop burning in the neighbouring states, who are repeatedly exhorted by the courts to get with the environment but remain enamoured of the spirit of Rhett Butler  Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn.This year too the Delhi high court is asking the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments about their plans to curb crop burning. Winter after winter satellites provide scary heat maps of the scale of the problem. Breathing troubles spike across NCR. Children are especially badly hit. But as the persistent cough of chief minister Arvind Kejriwal shows, all that smog is like kryptonite to adult lungs too.So that instead of going out and about you feel like hibernating in your bedroom with air purifiers. Sadly their superpowers are dodgy as well.When a foul grey covered the capital last winter a ten minute walk in traffic would cover your face with an icky film, making your lungs feel tortured and your throat scratchy as if you had chain-smoked a whole pack of cigarettes. Kejriwalji battled that acute health emergency with an on-off odd-even scheme that far from cleaning the air made it even more mottled  with the sounds of cussing and swearing.Please mukhya mantriji do better by us this year. Look, this can be a big opportunity to teach pradhan mantriji how cooperative federalism is done. Get the neighbouring governments to show some love for clean air. Persuade kisan bhais to sell that rice straw to paper mills. Help herald a brave new world of modern agriculture and happy winters. Even the lungs of poll-bound Punjab will thank you."
590494167be9e04154df8c1d,"A 5,000-year-old journey to the old you",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mrsfunnybones/a-5000-year-old-journey-to-the-old-you/,2016-06-12,"I have spent the last few weeks in a remote spot in Kerala, drinking copious amounts of ghee, throwing up violently while trying to balance my vata, pitta and kapha and align various joints so that I could possibly discontinue my two-decade-old biannual limping sojourns to various physiotherapists.When you end up putting your foot in the mouth as often as I do, its rather unpleasant to have that particular appendage constantly tasting of Iodex and crepe bandage.Within a day of my arrival I start empathizing with the prison inmates in Tihar jail. I, too, have a mandatory cotton uniform, am not allowed to use the air conditioner and even my hair conditioner is confiscated. A ringing bell heralds meager meals of rice gruel, and under no circumstances am I allowed to leave the premises unless I do a dramatic, over-the-wall jailbreak with a fast car waiting on the other side. But like all prisoners, some of their own circumstances, I soon adapt to my new surroundings.A lot of intriguing things happen when you are left to your own devices unlike being left with your Wi-Fi enabled devices. You start observing things, like the wind blowing shimmery ripples on a green pond filled with mottled lotus leaves and a squawking black duck who, oblivious to the Fair and Lovely commercials, seems happy in its own skin; a woman in a blue sari, humming contentedly to herself as she works in the garden, strings of jasmine flowers wrapped around her bun like a soft cloud of scented wonder.You spot a blue kingfisher sitting on a branch of a neem tree and when you accuse him, Hey, you are just fluttering around, making merry, what about the money you owe? The kingfisher retorts, Dude, I am not culpable. I was just the celebrity brand ambassador, and it ruined my reputation too, God knows when I will get another gig now! And then he flaps his wings, taking off on a long journey across the English Channel to retrieve his own outstanding payment.The days tick by in a whirl of 5am yoga and innumerable oil baths till I can see my release looming on the horizon, so I make an appointment with the doctor for a list of dos and donts once I am back in the real world.The doctor gives me a printed sheet and adds, Madam, please no non-veg and alcohol for two weeks after this Panchakarma treatment.A random thought occurs to me and I tentatively ask, Doctor but what about, you know, physical relations?He answers promptly, That also two weeks waiting or all benefits of treatment lost. But Doctor, I wail, why didnt you tell me? What if I had not asked you, my whole treatment would have gone down the drain. To which he replies, See sheet, point 6 says no vigorous physical activity.I snicker, Thats hardly self-explanatory. Its not always that vigorous you know, sometimes you just lie down flat on your back and think of George Clooney!Looking at the doctors raised eyebrows, I hastily try to redeem myself and end up in a deeper pit as I add, Uhyou can also think of patriotic things like your country or the prime minister! ErrNo no! I didnt mean our prime minister, I meant maybe in Canada, there I am sure they lie back and think of Justin Trudeau. Well, it depends on how nationalistic you are And I fumble to an uneasy stop.The next day I get another printed sheet assigning me to a new treatment which involves sitting for 40 minutes with a funnel on my head that is slowly filled with hot oil. And below in bold letters it says, Shirovasthi: Treatment good for Alzheimers, Parkinsons and mental imbalances.A few days later, I am ready to go home. Waiting at the airport, I finally give in to the subliminal cries of the internet and grant myself unrestricted access to my phone, unlike the ten minutes a day that I was using it to primarily make calls home. I quickly scan all the news that I have missed.I come across a plea by the external affairs minister who responded to recent racist attacks by imploring Indians that each time they meet an African citizen they should shake his hand and say, India loves you.Growing up in a boarding school filled with Ethiopians, I have many happy memories of eating njera fir fir (bits of pancake mixed with butter and berbere, a red spicy powder), and I still remember once being terribly homesick and asking a cheerful girl called Susie, How are you always so upbeat? and she, the colour of burnished ebony, saying, I carry sunshine within my skin.So, in my new enlightened state, and eager to atone on behalf of my fellow countrymen, I scamper up to a gentleman at the airport bookshop, and with a big smile ask, Are you an African? To which he replies with a strong South Indian twang, Are you an idiot? Oops!I return home to a rather weary looking man of the house and realize that there have been a few marked changes in the household in my absence  the baby for some strange reason is wearing only one earring, the dog and the family room where he presides are both full of fleas and since we ran out of a few kitchen staples, the man of the house asked Mummyji to help stock up, so in place of the organic atta that I normally buy, my pantry cupboards are filled with packets of Baba Ramdevs Patanjali Aarogya Chakki Atta instead.The one gleaming item is the television, and because no one can recall where he or she last saw the remote, it is now conveniently stuck on Sony Max Live Cricket.Days pass and I slowly begin to process aspects of my Ayurveda treatment. There are subtle changes  I dont like using the air conditioner anymore, and the dozen chillies that I would devour every day now seem to leave a burning path down my esophagus. My joints move more freely and so does my mind without the requisite multiple cups of black coffee.The man of the house laughs when I borrow his almond oil and shun my moisturizer. He has lived his entire life by the principles of Ayurveda, urging me all these years to follow the basic tenets and I had just turned a deaf ear, till I reached a point where even my ears had to be filled with oil.It is mystifying that we have this 5,000-year-old science that we disregard to a large extent. Modern medicine is a vital, lifesaving tool but perhaps if we follow the principles of Ayurveda we may not need this tool as frequently as we do. Isnt it better to use natural ways to ward off a heart attack than to stake a stent in the heart a few years down the line? But we dont, because there are no shortcuts to the Ayurvedic way of living. It is about finding balance, a precarious balance that can be lost if not renewed every single day.But we evolved beings have our own way of dealing with health now. Who has the time and patience to decipher the cause of an ailment and make minor changes to bring the body back to equilibrium when its so much simpler to just pop a pill and banish your symptoms while the disease surreptitiously festers away."
590494707be9e04154df8ca0,"Across the thin line: Cross-LoC strikes have occurred before, owning it this time was a political call",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ist/across-the-thin-line-cross-loc-strikes-have-occurred-before-owning-it-this-time-was-a-political-call/,2016-09-30,"With a little help from the Indian army, Prime Minister Narendra Modi picked a good window to give the green light for surgical strikes across the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on Wednesday night. The world has been engrossed with the UN General Assembly, America is obsessed with the tight presidential contest between Clinton and Trump and even the Chinese are warily waiting and watching how the latest escalation between the two south Asian nuclear powers will manifest itself.It seems as if the Americans had indicated to Delhi, in the wake of the Uri attack, that if the Indian side carried out a covert strike and took out a few people, it would look the other way. It is more than likely that US national security adviser Susan Rice exchanged notes about the strikes with her counterpart, Ajit Doval, when they spoke over the phone on Wednesday.Delhi put out a laudatory press release, highlighting the fact that Rice had condemned the cross-border attack. Earlier statements by the US state department had only condemned the terrorist act itself, with no pointer to Pakistan. With memories of Operation Geronimo still fresh, when the US sent planes under the cover of night to take out Osama bin Laden from Abbottabad five years ago, Rice couldnt but have grudgingly accepted that Doval could take a leaf out of Americas book.What the world simply doesnt want to see is war, especially not between two nuclear states and definitely not when the risk of a nuclear accident is at stake. Pakistan defence minister Khawaja Asifs irresponsible statements about not hesitating to use nuclear weapons is a clear case of nuclear blackmail. The Chinese may try and smother this unnecessary irritation and the Americans may hope Asif doesnt mean what he says  or more importantly, doesnt say what he doesnt mean.If Modi wanted to avenge the Uri attack, the Americans are believed to have said, he would need to do it skilfully so it didnt invite Pakistani retaliation.As it turns out, the Pakistanis are even denying that surgical strikes have taken place inside its territory along the LoC. The Pakistan armys media cell has admitted to two soldiers being killed, but thats all. Thats probably best, at least for the time being, as anger levels in Rawalpindi are kept down, thereby ruling out retaliatory measures.Just as the narrative inside Pakistan, after Uri, blamed Indians for carrying out the attack against their own soldiers at the army base, accounts from inside Pakistan say the cross-LoC strikes were only small arms fire from the Indian side.Certainly, the Pakistan armys capacity to throw wool in the eyes of its own people has been notable since 1947  then, the soldiers were called raiders, until that deceit was exposed by none other than the people of Jammu & Kashmir who repulsed them. And in 1999, Pakistans Northern Light Infantry dressed themselves up in civilian clothes when they first invaded India at Kargil.The prime ministers strategists effectively used the media to send some messages to Pakistan. And so an array of options were discussed  from abrogating the Indus Waters Treaty to withdrawing most favoured nation status for Pakistan, to telling Pakistani artistes and musicians to exit India.It could be that this was only a feint, a master cover-up, never intended for implementation; although some of these measures remain on the table. But as he spoke to the people of Pakistan, from a party pulpit in Kerala, asking them to rise up against their own establishment  meaning, the Pakistan army, the centre of gravity inside Pakistan  the PM realised he had to distinguish between the two.Cancelling Indias participation at the Saarc summit and masterminding the absence of three other countries, was the first step. Striking terror launching pads  and killing a Pakistani soldier or two  was in line with Modis newfound strategy, that the Pakistan army, which is hand in glove with an anti-India army of terrorists it has raised, had to be taught a lesson.None other than former army chief, Gen Bikram Singh, has come on record to say that such strikes by Indian soldiers have taken place in the past as well, including in the wake of the decapitation of two Indian soldiers in January 2013 when Manmohan Singhs UPA was in power. Interestingly the strikes have only been mounted across the LoC, never across the international boundary.The difference, this time, is that Modi made a political call to own the cross-LoC strikes. In 2013, no one knew that such a strike had even taken place.Still, the truth is that the Pakistan army isnt about to give up training, arming and transforming poor Pakistani boys into terrorists and sending them into India to create mayhem. The prime minister must know that. That is why the army has to stay alert, especially in the coming days.But the prime minister must also know that for the army to be successful it must be backed not only by the political class, but also by the popular peoples will. If only for that reason, the PM must implement measures for reconciliation in Kashmir. Travelling to Srinagar, after Modi has shown Pakistan that it cannot be business as usual, could be the opening that Kashmir needs to turn a new page.The writer is a politcal commentator"
590494907be9e04154df8ccd,Rule of Right? Daal-chawal only ideology that matters,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/rule-of-right-daal-chawal-only-ideology-that-matters/,2016-05-22,"By now, enough has been said about how the state assembly elections have been a booster shot for BJP, how they have moved India closer to a Congress-mukt Bharat and how the results have been another kick in the guts for Rahul Gandhi. With over 35% of Indians now under the rule of BJP state governments (43% if we count BJP alliances) as compared to just 7% for Congress (15% if we count its Bihar alliance), Amit Shah is rightly exulting at the prospect of BJP domination from Parliament to panchayats. The BJPs replacement of Congress as the dominant national party makes the narrative of rightwing ascendance seductive.Yet, look deeper and the most important lesson coming out of these elections is not a triumph of ideology but its demise and the replacement of blind political loyalties of the past by a new neta-voter relationship that is increasingly transactional. Mamata Banerjee decimated the Left with even more seats than her poribartan year of 2011 and Jayalalithaa rewrote the script of Dravidian politics to become the first Tamil CM to get re-elected since MGR because both inherently understood this fundamental shift in political cultures.Politics in Kolkata and Chennai beats to different rhythms but the one thing that unites the game-changing triumphs of both regional satraps is their single-minded focus on a social welfare net for the rural poor, rural development and a plethora of populist freebies for different interest groups.Consider the Mamata model first. Just like Nitish Kumar in Bihar, she fixed roads (5,212.94km of roads in Bengal were improved and renovated during 2011-2015 as compared to 3,220.28km during 2007-2011), brought rural electrification (over 90% of below poverty line households electrified by January 2016, compared to just 18.18% in 2011) and increased social spending (tripled from around Rs 7,000 crore in 2010-11 to Rs 20,000 crore in 2014-15).Along with the Nitish-like Kanyashree scheme for greater enrolment of girls in schools and the distribution of bicycles to four million schoolchildren, Mamata also borrowed a leaf from Raman Singh in Chhattisgarh, who earned the sobriquet of chawal waale baba with his Rs 1 and 2/kg rice schemes for the poor. These schemes have been central to Raman Singhs BJP government remaining in power in Chhattisgarh since 2003. In West Bengal, not only did Didi increase state support for foodgrain almost 12 times, from Rs 516.32 crore during 2010-11 to Rs 6,000 crore, she made rice available at Rs 2 per kilo, entitling almost 80 million Bengalis to subsidized rice.Mamatas focus on PDS and freebies, of course, paled next to what Amma of Poes Garden offered in Tamil Nadu, but West Bengal has a much lower starting base. Jayalalithaas plethora of promises such as subsidized mopeds and her low-cost canteens, medicines, buses, cement, housing, free goats and cows, etc built on a strong culture of social spending in Tamil politics that both AIADMK and DMK have embraced for decades.Her focus on delivery  combined with a superb, tactically fought election, where there was virtually nothing to separate the two parties ideologically  fetched her uniform gains in all Tamil Nadu regions. It also allowed her to break the revolving-door rule of Tamil politics where power has see-sawed between the two main parties for three decades. Jayalalithaa may have returned to power with a reduced majority, but make no mistake: this is a historic victory.The BJPs path-breaking triumph in Guwahati completes the ideological lesson from these elections. Unlike Congress, BJP learnt its lessons and course-corrected after losses in Bihar and Delhi where its local leaders felt sidelined and its message of development got sidetracked by divisive issues. In Assam, not only did it project a local chief ministerial face in Sarbananda Sonowal, it reaped the benefits of local clout through its ex-Congress import Himanta Biswa Sarma and smart alliances with the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF). Although this was the first state election being fought after the JNU and beef controversies, the BJP remained focused on local issues during the campaign. The BJPs Assam model offers a good template as the party seeks to expand further from its north Indian heartland.The BJP is dominant nationally and Narendra Modi remains Indias most popular leader  but in a polity where both BJP and Congress put together have won less than half the seats and votes polled in all the 30 assembly elections held since 2012. As this paper has reported, the two got 42% of the votes polled in these contests, 58% went to other parties. Even in the latest contest, Congress won 115 seats, BJP 64, but others won 643. As many as 465 seats were won by parties not allied to either BJP or Congress.This is the most revealing statistic that defines Indian politics today. The Congress may be declining but regional parties continue to hold the bulk of India and more than Left or Right, voters care more about daal and chawal  and who provides it better."

He has angered a sizeable population of the gastronomically proud nation of Spain by posting a link to his unorthodox paella recipe on his social media account. He enthusiastically proclaimed that his version combined chicken thighs and chorizo, something that shocked Spanish connoisseurs. Paella is a rice-meat dish from the Valencia region of Spain. And although they vary depending on preference, style and availability, main paella ingredients include white rice, chicken, rabbit and vegetables. Seafood paella essentially replaces meat with seafood, while mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat, seafood and vegetables.Good Spanish food doesnt get much better than paella. My version combines chicken thighs & chorizo https://t.co/2cXK4xoTfS #recipeoftheday pic.twitter.com/DD0HXY98pM  Jamie Oliver (@jamieoliver) October 4, 2016So, why the fuss over Jamie Olivers paella recipe? After all, he did say it was his version of the famous Spanish dish. My understanding is that the matter goes back to the old debate over tradition and experimentation in the culinary world. Purists believe that original recipes have a hallowed status. They are right in saying that original dishes tell a story. That they epitomise the culture, wishes, struggles and aspirations of a people. And I firmly believe that by partaking in authentic fare, one can better understand the cultural ethos of a foreign society.Hi @jamieoliver, big fan of yours. I guess you know that Valencians call that Rice with Stuff (TM). Now THIS  this is a real paella. pic.twitter.com/s0rxFdSkVC  Paco Polit (@pacopolit) October 4, 2016That said, this doesnt mean that experimenting with original recipes is sacrilege. In fact, experimentation is the very essence of culinary evolution. After all, those dishes that are seen as signature of a particular culture are products of generations of experimentation. And that is also why they need to be messed with from time to time. For in undoing the perfect we create space for more original recipes to come up. If we dont have chefs pushing the boundaries of taste, aroma and presentation  like Heston Blumenthal and his crazy molecular gastronomic inventions  the culinary process will become painfully stagnant..@jamieoliver1 This is Paella2 This is Spanish Food (by @andresmadrigalg )3 This are you Now pic.twitter.com/isepyaqu9l  mmadrigal (@Mmadrigal11) October 4, 2016Now, this is not the first time that Jamie Oliver has been criticised for messing up an original  in 2014 he tweeted a recipe for Jollof rice that sparked similar levels of anger among West Africans. Nonetheless, he has every right to give his own interpretation to recipes  just as people are free to criticise him for this. Perhaps a happy mean can be found in giving due respect to originals while acknowledging that experimental cuisine is inspired by the former. Bon appetit!"
590494ef7be9e04154df8d58,Ganesha and me,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/dev-vani/ganesha-and-me/,2016-09-07,"You better go to a temple and offer ten rupees on my behalf to Ganesha on the occasion of Ganesha Chaturthi, my wife ordered on a phone from thousands of miles away.No, I firmly replied, You know clearly that in twenty-three years of our marriage, going to a temple was never an activity that I accepted as my part of the deal.Please, she continued. I knew that this was not exactly a please but an order. Yet, I was prepared to take my chances. After all, I was miles away and differing with my wife, even though a dangerous sport was less risky to play from a distance.Are you kidding me? Me, going to a temple! Even your God will get psyched out as to why on his happy day, his critic has come to spoil the party. He may send one of his Bhakts to put me to my place. No way, I continued my protest.Its an order. Do you want to have your Tawa vegetable and Spinach rice when you come back to Canada or not? Cant you even do this small thing for your wife? She thundered with a rising voice.But what can Ganesh get in ten rupees. You dont know India now. Forget about a Laddoo or Modak, your Ganesh would not be able to fetch even a banana in ten rupees. Its a waste of time. I will not go to the temple, I continued meekly knowing fully well that I was now fighting a lost battle.Then give ten dollars but make sure that you go today and send me photographs on WhatsApp when you are there. And I want to see my Jaanu selfie there.Ten dollars! Selfie! WhatsApp! I knew I had lost and any further arguments could only drill the hole deeper into my pocket. And technology! I cursed it again as I knew sitting in Canada she knew exactly how to keep track of her meandering animal. Even though he was pretty much useless for the damsels of the world now! And surely for her God who must have given up on me ages back!Ok, I surrendered.Off I started my walk to Ulsoor Lake Bangalore to see how people celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi in this part of the world and to keep my date with the Elephant God.I am not anti-religious but have enjoyed a love-hate relationship with religion for many years. Especially in the last few years when I have seen religion being used as a tool to settle personal and political scores by one and all, world over. I have also realized that being stuck with a boundary of one religion meant clearly that you are forced to develop a kind of apathy, if not hate, towards another and hence have set myself free from all boundaries what so ever.I cannot call myself an atheist as I still believe in a God particle present in all living matter which adds soul to the elements of nature that we are made of. And I am at peace with myself and with the God within and outside in its omnipresent form.Yet I have wondered how religion can affect people so much and how religion can blind them to the wrongs carried out in its name. Young and old, illiterate and educated, rich and poor, priest and criminal, all seem to surrender completely to their chosen God and are even ready to kill in its name.How could religion make a suicide bomber out of a child or make an educated parliamentarian gun for a fellow human in the name of protecting an animal?Why does reason leave when religion start and where does all the education and scientific knowledge go while following religious superstitions?How come in this century, millions of people are eager to call Mother Teresa a saint just because she supposedly healed two or three people miraculously who worshipped her name? Her greatness in serving the humanity and the downtrodden was not enough for the church to call her a saint but the proof existed in the ridiculously laughable mirages created to call her divine!Walking through the streets of Bangalore, as I reached the Ulsoor lake and saw hundreds of people, bring their little Ganeshas for visarjan or drowning in the small pond, I found my answer.Religion or faith gives us power. It gives us strength. It gives us hope when all seems lost. It is our light at the end of the tunnel.This faith in the supernatural who will take care of us at all costs, who will protect us from all evil, who will stand by us in thick and thin, makes us believe in God blindly. Or his created form. And object to anyone who does not believe in our belief!Like a small child who adores his father, his superhero who can never go wrong.God is our Papa. Our father whose shadow we never grow out off nor perhaps want to. He is our comfort zone. Our shade under which we rest our soul!Looking at the raw energy, gaiety, happiness and joy in the eyes of the worshippers who believed in their Ganpati Bappa, I realized that there was no way, I or anyone in this world could make them alter their love towards their cute Elephant God. And there was no need to do that. This is what gives them strength and is their lifeline. Their road to happiness and salvation! Wow! It was beautiful! In every smiling face, I could see the image of a happy Ganesha. Whom they were immersing and leaving behind was minuscule as compared to what they were carrying back.If Ganesha or Ram or Krishna gives courage to my wife and to many like her to fight the battles of life, so be it!A converter was converted today. But not completely! I was happy to see people happy with their God while I was happy with mine inside!Slowly I took out a ten dollar bill from my left pocket, showed it to the closest Ganpati Bappa and put it back in my right pocket. After all, I was offering it to the Bappa himself!And yes, I took a selfie while holding the bill out and flashed it to my eagerly awaiting wife.Ganesha looked back at me with amused eyes. We both, creators ourselves of each other, happily laughed and continued with our respective journeys!"
590494f57be9e04154df8d63,"Wasting water: India needs economic incentives, technology and regulations to tackle water stress",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/wasting-water-india-needs-economic-incentives-technology-and-regulations-to-tackle-water-stress/,2016-09-20,"Two disquieting developments have foregrounded Indias growing water crisis. Even as Karnataka and Tamil Nadu limped back to normalcy following friction over sharing river water, meteorological reports indicate that southwest monsoon this year may be below normal. This comes on the heels of two years of deficient rainfall, putting more pressure on groundwater resources. Water shortage poses an economic, environmental and security threat to India. Its important all levels of government understand the gravity of the situation. Things can change, but that requires an integrated approach which combines economic incentives, technology and tighter regulations.Agriculture uses about 80% of Indias water resources. A solution, therefore, must focus on changing agricultural practices. Indian agriculture is inefficient in its use of water. We use two to four times more water to produce a unit of major food crop than China or Brazil. Within India, a Punjab or a Maharashtra which are among the most water intensive producers of rice and sugar are key producer states. To get away from this suboptimal situation, governments must realise that power subsidies have had an adverse impact on irrigation patterns. States must break the groundwater-energy nexus to remove a perverse incentive to overuse groundwater.Decades of perverse incentives have led to a situation where 65% of the wells in India registered a decline when water level this year was compared with the last decades average. Action on power subsidies needs to be complemented with use of technology to carry out aquifer mapping. Efforts thus far have been haphazard and technology needs to be used more effectively. Technology and tighter regulations also need to be combined to mitigate water contamination. India may be water stressed but so is Israel, which manages its water resources far better to obviate any shortage."
590494fc7be9e04154df8d6f,Even the modak is going mod!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/75266/,2016-09-27,"It is the tenth day of the festival at my friends house and as she bustles around the house, she occasionally wipes away a tear. Surrounded by family and friends, there is frenetic activity as rituals are performed. For ten days now, there has been a constant flow of family and friends coming to give offerings of fruits, flowers, and sweets, all for the venerated guest at home who is about to leave their house. As the time comes to bid farewell to this guest, she feels an overwhelming sense of sadness.The guest the family is bidding adieu to is the elephant god, Ganesha and the festival is Ganesh Chaturthi. The end of the official monsoon season brings around one of Maharashtras best known and most beloved festivals. Celebrated by devotees as the birthday of Ganpati, Ganesh Chaturthi also marks the beginning of a feasting time for gourmands. This is the famous modak season, the dumpling that has been Maharashtras favorite sweet for centuries. Popularly known as ukdiche (steamed) modak, these rice flour dumplings are traditionally stuffed with coconut and jaggery and eaten warm with pure ghee.An interesting nugget my maternal grandmother used to tell us as kids is that shape of a modak is very similar to that of a coconut. As she would roll out the dough amidst a sea of interested grandchildren, she would tell us modak tales and enthrall us by showing us how the shape was in the form of folded palms for Namaskar: a sign of benediction for the god who would visit our house during the season. As we used to roll up the rice flour to stuff the ingredients inside, all of us would vie to make the best namaskar possible to atone for perceived misdemeanors.While the traditional modaks are stuffed with coconut and jaggery mix, the modak, in keeping with the times, has gone through numerous hybrids. So during the season, there are enough variations to whet even the sternest appetite. From modaks stuffed with dry fruits to those infused with strawberry or chocolate mixes, there is a modak for every palate. I have seen modaks steamed with fragrant turmeric leaves, others stuffed with mawa/khoya sugar and cardamom powder and still others stuffed with dried sweet mango. I have even seen modak flour made from dried fruit pulp and rolled out diligently and carefully before being stuffed with desiccated almonds!The festivities and sweets make ones diet go for a toss. But there is a way to ramp up on these delicacies and not worry about the numbers on your weighing scale. For the health-conscious among us, there are baked modak and sugar-free ones. The stuffings too have become less stuffy over the years. From grated beetroots, diced carrots mixed with coconut, oats, and fruit fillings, the modak season in the past few years has given itself a healthy twist.In all this excitement about the modaks, what is often times taken for granted is the little known and often overlooked delicacy called Nivagrya or nivagria. Typically made during the ten days of Ganesh Chaturthi, nivagrya are little savoury, steamed patties made from leftover ukad (rice flour dough) that was made for the modak casing. The leftover dough is kneaded together with fresh coriander, cumin seed powder, coarse green chilly paste, a bit of oil and salt, flattened, and steamed. The little patties are eaten with plain curd or a bit of peanut oil and are absolutely wholesome and delicious.Barely has the Ganpati festival got over and the monsoons gave a firm send-off, when a host of festivals come chattering around the corner, starting with the nine-day Navratri Fest. And for epicureans, this means a nine-day food fest despite the fasting that most people do during the period. As I prepare for a dandiya-ras deluge to hit the city, I am looking forward to savoring delicacies like aaloo mewawale, kacche kele ki chaat, singhaade ke pakode, singhaade ka halwa, kuttu ki puri, and fried arbi ki sabzi.But thats a blog for another day!"
590495247be9e04154df8dad,"How Mamata whipped up a pro-incumbent wave in Bengal, despite corruption scandals",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ronojay-sens-blog/how-mamata-whipped-up-a-pro-incumbent-wave-in-bengal-despite-corruption-scandals/,2016-05-21,"Not many predicted the magnitude of the Trinamool Congress (TMC)s victory in West Bengal, where it won 211 of 294 Assembly seats. The reason for believing TMC might not win big was a buzz during the election that the Left Front-Congress alliance had momentum on its side. This had something to do with urban middle class disenchantment with TMC.But anyone who had gone around Bengal during the elections would have seen that there was no real mood of anti-incumbency. By and large, rural voters seemed satisfied with the TMC governments investment in infrastructure. Roads and bridges had been built, more people had access to water and electricity and there was some improvement in the state-run health system.This, along with schemes like subsidised rice and free bicycles for students, had meant that rural Bengal was always going to back TMC. Muslim voters, who constitute 27% of West Bengals population, were appeased by stipends to imams and muezzins and scholarships to students. The election results have borne out the governments efforts. Except for districts like Malda and Murshidabad, where Congress has traditionally been strong, and Darjeeling where the Gorkha Janmukti Manch is dominant, TMC did uniformly well across the state.The moving force behind TMCs strong performance was chief minister Mamata Banerjee herself. She ran a whirlwind election campaign, holding some 200 rallies over the course of two months. Mamata turned the tables on the opposition alliance, which had made her the personal target of its campaign, by making the 2016 election a referendum on herself.It is, however, TMCs exceptional performance in urban areas, where discontent with the government seemed to have been strongest, that carried the party over the 200-seat mark. TMC won all 11 seats in Kolkata including the ones where candidates, who had figured in a video sting taking bribes, were contesting. One of the reasons for the TMCs sweep in Kolkata was the unknown opposition alliance candidates pitted against TMC heavyweights.On paper, the Left-Congress alliance had seemed formidable. It had roughly the same share of the vote as TMC in the 2014 national elections. The alliance also displayed surprisingly good chemistry by not only dividing electoral constituencies smoothly, but also campaigning vigorously on a joint platform. It, however, won a combined vote share of 39% and only 76 seats. The alliance was undone by several factors.First, the alliance did not have a face with statewide acceptability. Its CM candidate, Surjya Kanta Mishra, was not up to the task as was evident from his inability to win even from his own constituency. Second, unlike Bihar, where the combination of the Janata Dal (United) and the Rashtriya Janata Dal worked well, there wasnt a smooth transfer of votes from Congress to the Left and vice versa.Third, the people of West Bengal have not forgiven the Left Front for the stagnation it inflicted on the state. This was reflected in the decline of the Left Fronts vote from 30% in 2014 to 26% now, even as Congress marginally increased its vote share. Finally, the alliance did not have a new narrative to offer to Bengal except for being opposed to TMC and Mamata.In 2011, there were huge expectations of poriborton or change that TMC had promised after 34 years of Left Front rule. While TMCs welfare policies delivered a resounding mandate and marginalised issues such as corruption, the party has failed on several counts. Political violence and intimidation, which are a legacy of the Left Fronts tenure, continue unabated in West Bengal. This is largely the effect of mass migration of the Lefts lumpen cadre to TMC.Whereas a heavy security presence ensured a relatively peaceful poll in 2016, earlier civic and panchayat elections in the state have been marked by violence. At the same time, lack of industry and employment opportunities have given rise to extortion rackets or syndicates run by TMC members.During Mamatas second term as CM, expectations might not be as high as in 2011. It is unlikely that she will be able to break free from the constraints of her partys organisation and support base. But given her mandate, the question is whether Mamata will crack down on some of the most corrupt and violent elements in her party. Or will she take it as an endorsement for business as usual?"
5904953c7be9e04154df8dd7,Decline in area under GM crops is more of an aberration than a trend reversal,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/decline-in-area-under-gm-crops-is-more-of-an-aberration-than-a-trend-reversal/,2016-09-15,"The world of GM crops witnessed a starling development in 2015. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), a forum for disseminating and sharing technologies for agriculture sustainability and development, the acreage under GM crops declined for the first time after the commercialisation of GM crops in 1996.The acreage under GM crops, also known as genetically modified or transgenic crops, which had steadily grown to touch peak levels of 181.1 million acres in 2014, dropped by one percent to touch 179.7 million hectares in 2015. This was mainly on account of the fall in acreage under important GM crops like Maize and cotton. This is a major setback because acreage under GM crops had shot up almost 100 fold from the meagre 1.7 million hectares in the last 19 years, making it the fastest adopted agriculture technology in recent times.Latest estimates show that GM crops were raised on 28 countries which is home from 4 billion people of which 8 were developed countries and the rest from the developing world. However the bulk of the 180 million hectares under GM crops were concentrated in five countries which accounted for 90% of the acreage and included the United States (39%), Brazil (25%), Argentina (14%) and India and Canada with 6% each. However, in China the most populated nation which stood 6th in the hierarchy, the share of GM crops was a mere 2% of the global total. But what is exceptional is the acreage under GM crops in developing countries has exceeded that of developed countries for the fourth consecutive year which raises hopes of increasing its acceptability in poor countries.In the United States the vast majority of the GM acreage was under three crops namely maize, soybean and cotton where the high technology variety covered more than 90% of the sown area each. The scenario was similar in Brazil and Argentina too where the three were the most popular GM crops. In Canada the largest GM crop was Canola followed by maize and soybean while that in India was mainly cotton. In China too cotton reigned supreme followed by papaya.The United States not only had the largest acreage under GM but also had the most diversified one. The number of GM crops including, apart from Maize, soybean and cotton, also canola, sugar beat, alfalfa, papaya, squash and potato. And 2015 was also a notable year for GM crops in the United States as it commercialised a new strain of potato and a new version of canola and secured approval for two varieties of apple.The year was also important for United States as salmon secured approval to become the first GM animal for commercial production. It also secured approval for a new GM chicken. The GM community also was able to foil efforts to introduce labelling for GM crops in four states. However, despite all this it was the fall in acreage of 2.2 million hectares under maize, cotton and Canola, due to the falling prices that cause the global acreage to fall for the first time.A country attempting a significant push to GM crops among developing countries is Bangladesh. Though the commercial acreage is still low the area under bt-brinjal has been doubled to 25 hectares and efforts are on to exponentially increase the quantity of bt seeds to meet growing needs. The country has also stepped up efforts to initiate field trials of blight resistant potato in the next year and also initiated measures to evaluate crop like bt cotton and golden rice in field trials. All this indicate that the fall under acreage of bt crops is an aberration and would be reversed in the coming years."

Zoom out a bit whether you are celebrating, or waiting for another time. Just get a sobering influence, whatever be your state, gleeful or without!In Feb, while attending a conference in L.A, when the primaries in each of the parties, had reached till Hampshire there was this quote in the LA times No matter who wins, your life shall remain the same. Some wisdom this. Do political changes really change our lives? Its an alternating pleasure -pain phenomenon. One ruling partys pitfalls, becomes the platform for anothers rise. Surely it happens after the principle, power corrupts etc, while the wise sans power rise with a more composite agenda. Getting into power is not easy work. Party vision, vote bank strategies. Maybe a dirty tricks department is the kit with all warring sides.Finally one wins by performance, but importantly performance perceived, and perceived the way the larger segment of the polity looks at it. Three times winner Gogoi had done enough, but his smarter colleagues fell apart. The opposite camp could pick up the seeds of dissent and hit a home run. It depends on the choice of partners in regionally run states. UPA II could not make it because its allies TDP, and AIADMK fell short of numbers. This is now happening to the grand old party. Surely, the bugle of development was heard loud and clear in Assam, a state that supported a finance minister and two times prime minister, without having a single national, or even an international institute. Even one in economics would have done!So there are chaps as the electoral genius Amit Shah, Hemanto Vishwa Sharma, who brought about a change in Assam, Rahul Gandhi and his team, somewhat unable to connect, Karuna and sons, Oomen Chandy in Kerala. What worked in Assam, was the combination the major think tank of the ruling party, had reached a political concordance with the other the prime mover, who knew the ethnic feel of his people behind the out-going Mr Gogoi.What took the cake in Bengal and TN were actually the handiwork of the women CMs. The great lesson to learn is that behind well intentioned mega economic programs, programs as 2kg rice for the needy, assurance and implementation of free or subsidized education, the Ammas kitchen, tea, pongal, even chapatis do strike a strong note with the common man. (An essential part of conveying regrds to this goddess =politician, is to plie prostate in jeans Lungis are banned, after a recent incidence of an inscure knot that unravelled, as he devotee turned over on his back). Bigger parties may like to learn. Amma knew what the electorate wanted, and came romping home. Even financial irregularities ascribed to regional parties, were given a go-by by their followers. In regional waters, sometimes over campaigning of what is and what should have been, goes against the strategy to win peoples hearts. More often than not it is taken personally.That was the cause of failure in Bihar. Imagine propaganda on similar lines in other states as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana. People just wont take it. In such cases, be the doer, but lay no claims to it. That credit shall come on its own! If you have a formula of affluence, dont ever let the poor feel disrespect for what they are. Make them feel they are the privileged ones who shall bring a change in their lives. This is for all parties.Chapels, I use this word for communities bound together by religious faith, caste, schedules of the government. It is a natural association, a universal truth, and is absolutely democratic. Further sub classification as Pandit, Thakur, Yadav is a valid extension. To handle these during election time, keep in mind the sum and average of the regional feel. You may use a much mature person on your own side, to read and provide for their aspirations. It is an intelligent interaction between the mature and respected ones in the minorities, and other communities, that helps continue a flexible, and fair stance. It may not be that outlandish an idea for good governance. Extreme views, may have extreme admirers, but in an open political marketplace, fetches little political revenue. One never scores a penalty on the top of the rivals D. The Assam gain may fit well into the ruling partys plan, but it was also the handwork of a couple of insiders, who synchronized the party policy with the regional feel.It is getting clearer, that tactics to score at the hustings, may be quite different from the reforms in your log book, that you strictly believe shall turbo you forward.Chappals Im referring to those white spongy ones, in which Didi walked the streets of Tollyganj softly clapping her hands in her victory lap. A cabinet minister, minister of IB, she still keeps her small spaced house, and simple dress-wear, almost converting it into attributes of Mahatmas Ashram, and khadi. But these are well learnt lessons. Jyoti Babu. but for his earlier years of agricultural reforms, probably did negative industrialization for the rest of his 34yr tenure in Bengal. When a fuming Rajiv Gandhi remarked at the state of affairs it was curtains down for the National Congress. TMC was to emerge as a split after bitterness over similar issues. The Bongs may be outstandingly brilliant in their professions. Dealing with Bengal Politics is a different matter!Irrespective of results that favour one side, the truth of Indias future, our race with China, ASEAN, BRICS, does not change. A small farmer in UP may not see beyond the village well, livestock, but he shall soon be in the economic race for agricultural produce, a race which he may begin to like, If there be gains! The trick soon shall be to spell better living policies (not without the community kitchen) and increase participation.Chai pey charcha may start as a weekly event in each taluka, encouraging more participation. Monsoons are celebration times, but just keep the memories of a rainy day alive, by government sponsored umbrella shops (give it to MNREGA) to repair a broken umbrella right away, and give a proper one as a replacement right there. If you have done camps in villages, you know every roof leaks. Just pieces of 5mx5m tarpaulin with staples, and a trained squad to do it within hours.Talking beyond party lines, politics is an ever evolving art and there may be different ways of getting a majority of a particular polity.The national aim of economic, educational, and finally national up-liftment may not be forgotten by the victors, irrespective of whatever were their novel and legitimate means to victory!Ghame-hasti ka Asad kis se ho Juz margh ilaajShama jalti hai har rang mein saher honey tak Ghalib(How does one cure the misery in-built in life. But see, the candle immolates in so many colours to to survive to hand over the dawn to you)!Now if your mind is in a spin it is the beginning of quantum politics. One of the few instances where ignorance is bliss!"
59049f537be9e04154df972d,A Yen for Japanese food,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/a-yen-for-japanese-food/,2016-04-30,"I am sitting with my Japanese friend, Keiko, in a restaurant in Tokyo and I am afraid to touch my food. She smiles as she sees my mesmerized look and says, Did you know that Japanese people like to eat with their eyes as well as with their mouths? I couldnt agree more. The plating is so artistic, the colors so enchanting and the food so delectable that a part of me wants to let my senses simmer in the visual feast. Arranged elegantly in front of me is a chicken and bamboo shoot stew, with a side dish of pork and beans cooked in a white sauce. The salad is served in martini glasses and the dessert plate looks like an evening at the northern lights with colors ranging from rose pink to neon green.As I wander around Japan on a week-long break, I realize how seriously the Japanese take food presentation. Whether it is a Bento Box, a Sukiyaki lunch or a Kaiseki dinner, I am left in absolutely no doubts about it. My friend informs me that ensuring how the food looks is the cooks last task and the diners first. Poor presentation, such as dull colors or an overcrowded plate might make a diner not want to eat the food. No wonder the Japanese have turned food presentation into a high art, creating a feast for the eyes, with inspirations drawn heavily from nature. The Japanese even have a special word for the rules of food presentation  moritsuke.Nowhere is this artistry more evident than in the Bento boxes that the Japanese take very seriously. Invented in the 16th century, a Bento Box is quintessentially Japanese: creative, healthy and colorful lunch boxes as much for adults as they are for kids. We eat one such Bento Box lunch at a restaurant in picturesque Miyajima, near Hiroshima. The location is particularly poignant because of the Hiroshima bombing and a singed Bento Box housed in its famous memorial. It belonged to Shigeru who on August 6, 1945, set off for his school with a Bento Box lovingly packed by his mother with his favorite food items to mark his 13th birthday. On his way to school, the bomb struck Hiroshima and everything within a few kilometers was incinerated. Three days later, his mother identified his charred body by the new Bento box clutched to his stomach.The Bento Box we are served is bursting with color and vitality. Unlike the West, where food is served mostly on uniform round plates, Japanese food is served on a variety of dishes with different shapes, textures, sizes and colors. Contrasting colors, to set off the food against the serving plates, are de rigeur. The combination of five colors  red, white, green, black, yellow  is always present in each arrangement and symbolize good health. As I tuck into my lunch, I wonder at how much time is spent by cooks in not only preparing each meal, but using ingenuity to come up with such artistic plating.I witness this again at one of the best meals I have during my Japanese soujourn: a Sukiyaki lunch. Sitting with my friends at a long table in a restaurant overlooking Lake Kawaguchiko at the foothills of Mt. Fuji, I am entranced at the number of ingredients put so delicately on the platter in front of me. Sukiyaki is a Japanese dish that is prepared and served in the hot pot style. It consists of meat (I have opted for thinly sliced fish) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table in a shallow iron pot in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. Mixed in the pot are cubes of tofu, chunks of onions and leeks, shiitake mushrooms, greens and transparent shirataki noodles. Surrounding the pot are a variety of little dishes holding pickles, rice and the ubiquitous tempura. There is absolute silence as we tuck into the meal: the kind of silence that is only punctuated by oohs and aahs of an appreciative audience.Of course, its not that everything the Japanese eat or serve is so orderly and precise. The Japanese have a very quirky sense of humor and this idiosyncrasy, funnily enough, is brought out in a most unusual way. What I discover in Japan is that the Japanese are known for their goofy, over the top creativity, especially in the world of snacks. This creativity can yield both bizarre and delightful results. The flavor combinations defy reason and are so adorable that Japan, as a wit puts it is basically like the mad scientist of the snack world. So there I am scarfing down wasabi KitKats one day and licking a cone of Matcha green tea ice cream the next day. There are Mountain Dew-flavored cheetos and candy served in tiny toilet bowls. At a little Japanese store in Tokyo, I pick up candies shaped like Geisha girls and rice crackers in the shape of Japanese men and women dressed in traditional clothes. The flavors too are bizarre and range from soya jelly beans and wasabi to sakura blossoms.But the aha moment on this trip comes at a highly unlikely place: on a bullet train ride from Odawara to Hiroshima. The entire carriage has settled down peacefully for the three hour ride. As the train streaks through the countryside, most of us are dozing gently, lulled by the speed of the train and the zen-like atmosphere inside. An hour into the trip, my drowsy mind registers something. Pssst, says someone in a loud stage whisper. Who has the laddoos? I hear bodies shifting as my friends stir rapidly from their slumber. Pass the parathas please and dont forget to add the mango chutney! comes drifting down the carriage along with the smell of Indian parathas. Within seconds, I see my friends make a beeline for the seats which are rapidly disseminating Indian staple food. I cringe in my seat but surface momentarily to snatch one of the laddoos before the box disappears rapidly into the back of beyond. Arrey who has the lacchaas! And lo and behold, a packet of Haldirams aloo lacchaas starts its journey from the front of the carriage and is tossed blithely from hand to hand with a crackle and a snap.All this while the shell-shocked Japanese are sitting there clutching their briefcases close to their bodies, watching the Great Indian Circus unfold in their pristine bullet train. As quickly as the Indian food tsunami has started, it abates. As the last of the Haldirams are devoured, a collective sigh of satisfaction goes around and the group settles back into siesta mode. And the Japanese? They are still sitting wide-eyed as we exit at the next station! They may have the funny snacks but we have funny ways on where to eat them!"

After software, diamonds are Indias best friends. Gems and jewellery are the country second highest foreign exchange earner. To find out more about this mystery trade and how it is sparkling for India, TOI spent a week in Antwerp, the center of the worlds diamond trade.The Diamond MenLimbabhai Jodhani is hunched over a cluster of rough diamonds scattered on a table in a wood-paneled strong room deep in an Antwerp store. Hes wearing a suit and a necktie, and as he picks each stone the size of a shriveled pea and looks at it through a loupe  a jewelers eyepiece  he grunts in satisfaction. Across him, also dressed in a western suit, Babulal Godhani raises an eyebrow. Limbabhai murmurs approval. They exchange words in rapid fire Gujarati as Limbabhai scoops up the rough diamonds as if it is rice grain, and pours it into a plastic bag.Do you knowhe is totally illiterate? Babulal says suddenly, breaking my transfixed fascination at watching rough diamonds being handled like coarse grain. He can only sign his namenothing else. As I look disbelievingly at the well-attired Limbabhai, Babulal and others kid him into signing his name on a scratch pad. Flushing, Limbabhai complies, slowly writing out his name in Gujarati, one word after another. But he is one of the best judges of rough diamonds, Babulal says reverentially. Limbabhai blushes.Jodhani Exports, Diamond Importers, Manufacturers & Exporters, reads Limbabhais business card, without assigning him any title or designation. It lists addresses in Surat and Mumbai. Babulal Godhanis firm is called Srediam BVBA and lists an address in Hoveniersstraat, the diamond district in Antwerp, Belgium, which is where I am meeting them. We are sitting around a table in a sorting room inside Gembel, one of the oldest and most storied diamond firms in the world. You have to meet to understand Indias diamond story, Gembels head honcho Rashmi Mehta, had told me a week before, setting me off on an adventure that brought me to Antwerp.I had met Rashmi at an India-Pakistan cricket game in Amsterdam, connected to him by Shyamala Cowsik, Indias ambassador in Netherlands. I had some idea of the Indian diamond trade before, having learnt while writing a book on Indias info-tech experience some years back that it was the countrys second largest export earner after software and services. Since much of the trade was centered in Antwerp, I had meant to go there some day. More recently, a wire story about how Indians were upstaging Jews in the business had created a stir in trade circles. But the Indian diamond community is, expectedly, secretive and it needed a good entre to get access and insight into the developments.Rashme was the perfect introduction. His grandfather Kirtilal Manilal Mehta was one of the pioneers in the diamond business, having got into the trade as a teenager at the feet of his father. He had lived in Rangoon in the 1940s, come to Antwerp in the 1950s, set up Gembel in the 1960s, lived in Tel Aviv in the 1970s, returned to Antwerp, won the trust (and honor) of the Belgian government, trained his four sons to take over the business, and died very rich and very happy. When it came to legacy, there could not be a better starting point than the story of Kirtilal, Gembel, and the Mehta clan.To be continued"
5904b0137be9e04154dfa6ba,"Mamata faces a fight: But in north Bengal, the rural impoverished talk positively about Trinamool",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Addictions/mamata-faces-a-fight-but-in-north-bengal-the-rural-impoverished-talk-positively-about-trinamool/,2016-04-21,"Writing on elections in West Bengal is a delicate affair. In Bihar or Uttar Pradesh, voters generally speak up with enthusiasm on who they will vote for and why. Its a different story in a state where political violence has claimed thousands of lives over the last four decades. Hinterland common folk are uneasy about revealing their preference. A dozen variations of the expression, dekhte hobe (well have to see), is what one gets to hear.In a climate of fierce political partisanship, where one is often forced to choose sides, staying anonymous looks like a safer option for survival. Even so, journeying through the picture-postcard villages of Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Alipurduar, Cooch Behar and the stunted expanse of Malda district in north Bengal, one gathers that the Mamata Banerjee government enjoys a fairly positive rating among the rural impoverished.Several marginalised farmers and daily wagers admit to benefiting from state welfare schemes. According to them, PDS functions better than ever. Rice is readily available for Rs 2 (shades of Raman Singhs Chhattisgarh government here) and atta for Rs 3.50 a kg.Like Bihars Nitish Kumar government in its previous avatar, the TMC government has distributed thousands of bicycles among needy school students. These bicycles, painted a political shade of blue, stand out. Miles of roads in rural areas have been laid with fresh tar.Many would love to lump Mamata alongside Lalu Prasad, a mass leader hardly associated with progress. But evidence shows she is closer to the development-driven Nitish. Its possible to argue that TMC lacks a long-term vision for the state. But in contrast to the small-town and mofussil middle-class who are less than satisfied with TMCs five-year performance, the underprivileged in north Bengals countryside have generally positive things to say about her tenure. This class also seems relatively indifferent to the scams (Saradha, Rose Valley) that have put Mamatas party on the backfoot in recent weeks.Throughout north Bengal, flags of the Left parties and Congress flutter on trees and poles like conjoined twins. The erstwhile bitter rivals are new comrades-in-arms. Political alliances, for all their compulsions and contradictions, can be electoral master strokes. Last year, for instance, when RJD supremo Lalu and JD(U)s Nitish rediscovered each other to combat BJP, Bihars caste calculus tilted decisively in favour of the two Mandalites and a piggybacking Congress.In Bengal, this is the question everybody wants a definitive answer to: Is the Left-Congress alliance working on the ground as it unofficially did during the Siliguri municipal elections last year? What one can say for sure is that the unlikely union has energised the duos cadres and party workers, hugely demoralised after the thrashing in the 2011 state polls and 2014 Lok Sabha elections. The jot (alliance) and the fervent wish that it can synergise votes is the hook both parties have hung their hopes on.Any election is also about managing public perception. In that regard, the pact has reasonably succeeded. The allies are sharing stage, attending mohalla booth meetings, even occasionally shouting Inquilab Zindabad together. At least publicly, theres a show of unity.But will party workers of both Congress and Left Front, divided for years by ideology and memories of hate, be honest to that public show of bonding inside the polling booth? It appears that a fair percentage of vote transfer among party workers could happen on that account. And thats primarily because theres an increasing realisation that another electoral setback could be ruinous to their future.However, the same may not hold true for the ordinary party voter, who might walk his own line. Most pre-election opinion polls have given a majority to TMC, in greater or lesser degree. But the alliance, boosted by the surround sound of those who benefited during the 34 years of Left rule, has partially dented the self-confidence of TMC. Whether it is enough to alter the final outcome is another matter.Amidst this battle for the top slot, BJP has marked its physical presence far and deep. From the lush hamlets of Jalpaiguri to the water-parched villages of Malda district to the forest areas of Alipurduar, the saffron flag can be seen in most corners of north Bengal.In the 2014 Lok Sabha poll where BJP got 17.02% votes, pundits attributed the surge to the Modi wave. Thats partly true. Over the years, RSS as well as its political wing have set up base in dozens of villages. Shakhas are common.Broadly speaking, their support base includes sections of SCs (rajbonshis, namasudras), a small portion of STs, parts of the non-Bengali population and the anti-Left, anti-Congress middle class. The party stands a chance in Baisnabnagar and Kalchini assembly seats. Its vote-share should be far higher than the 4.06% it got in 2011 assembly polls. However, the 17% peak of LS 2014 could still be a bridge too far. BJP is a party in search of an articulate and widely-accepted local leader.PS: Another saffron votary is making his presence visibly felt. His visage can be seen outside every shop peddling his goods even in the border outposts of north Bengal. No other businessman comes close. Guess who? Baba Ramdev."
5904b3767be9e04154dfaaf4,Band baaja baraat…aur khaana!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/band-baaja-baraat-aur-khaana/,2016-03-24,"The tables are groaning with food and expensive chinaware. The showily decorated ballroom of a city 5-Star is awash with the sound of people talking and munching their way through food of the continents. I am at yet another of those endless weddings which take place during the hitching season between November and March and balk at the sight of the gastronomic feast which assails the senses. As I ponder on finding the nearest exit to make a quick getaway, a friend trips by laden with diamonds and food. Suneeeta, have you tried the Jaapaanese stall? The tappanyaaki (read teppanyaki) is to die for, she trills, before teetering off on her Manolo Blahnik shoes.I am not in my element in big weddings. The glitterati and the chatterati disorient me and I get tired after a while of the air kissing and fake bonhomie. Worst of all, the sight and smell of myriad cuisines, to showcase the wealth and ingenuity of the hosts, creates a confusing babel of tastes which neither appeases nor gratifies the palate. Japanese Lebanese Thai French Turkish Greek: the hostess wants you to taste it all even as she trips over her shawarma, er, sharara.My mind wanders back to a few days ago when I attended another wedding in a tiny hamlet in the southern part of Maharashtra. Here the atmosphere, while as chaotic as any city wedding, is more welcoming and traditional. The village is small but the festivities are big considering my host is the sarpanch of the village. Everyone in the village is invited and everyone is lending a hand to make sure it is perfect. Out of town guests are housed in neighbors homes (there are no hotels here). All the women of the village have spent the last few days preparing all the savories and desserts needed for the spread. No event managers, no liveried staff, no Yo-Yo or Happy-Shappy to provide the entertainment.And the food? Simple and utterly delicious, bringing to mind those happy days in childhood spent at my maternal grandmothers place where every tidbit at the dining table was freshly cooked. Here too, from the pickles to the papads to the vegetables (straight from the fields), all the edibles are sourced from the village itself. In a large room fragrant with the smell of rose water and jasmine gajras, the guests are seated in pangats or parallel rows in front of chowrangs.  These are short wooden tables decorated with traditional rangoli on which is placed a banana leaf. There is the traditional food offered at weddings such as ussal (sprouts cooked with minimum amount of spices, masale bhaat (spice-flavored rice), aamras (mango pulp), tak (buttermilk) along with vegetables ranging from potatoes to yam. At the end of the meal, there are paanch pakwaan which are mandatory in a wedding feast. The host has decided to go with motichur laddoos, puran polis, karanjee, kheer and basundi (all indigenous Maharashtrian desserts).With a sigh, I come back to the hullabaloo in the ballroom and will myself to try the opulent food on display. From lobsters flown in from Maine, cheese from Switzerland, truffles from France: the hosts have put on a gastronomic blitzkrieg. To add to the adventure, there is even an iceboat filled with shrimp and crab legs and a table with a five-tier Marie Antoinette cake.Just as I have decided to go and try the Japanese counter where the Michelin-quality chef is meticulously putting together Donburi bowls (a bowl of cooked rice served with different meats and a sweet/savory soy-based sauce), I see my friend approaching. This time she is accompanied by two other friends and all of them are advancing purposefully. Oh no, not her, whispers the chef furtively. I raise an eyebrow. She wants me to season her Japanese dish with a bit of tadka. She says my food is too bland! I flee from the station before I am eating Japanese food tadka-maar ke!"
5904b3b57be9e04154dfab35,Reading abstraction,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/plumage/reading-abstract/,2016-04-02,"Walking into the Visual Arts Gallery last night unveiled an epic showing of abstractions entitled Magnetic Forms-1V by Art Konsult from the Siddhartha Tagore collection. Quiet, low profile and far away from the media eye Tagore is the philatelist  he stacks and stores and brings out works once in awhile to let it see the light of day.To be excited by the prospect of a passably pure, toughly modest aestheticism that jettisoned the traditions of a figurative passover reflects the idea of the interior landscape of the human mind. Artists like the master Sohan Qadri who created sprightly geometric and free-form collages and reliefs, often composed by dipping dyes in colored paper dropped onto sheets of white paper. Here are a couple of artists who took comfort and delight in carefully radiating, morning-fresh ways of creating.Abstraction, for these, was a haven and a test of character.A journey, an experience. The magnificent Achutan Kuddalurs in the show makes such humanly grounded sense, his appeal of the abundant flavors of an interior aesthetic binding colour, stroked locomotion, dense planar tectonics, darkened severity. There are two works by Deepak Tandon which barely summarize the phenomenons fantastic variety. His deeply intuitive tresses of darkened spools of intervention gives us landscapes that brood with myriad moorings.The invention and contrariety of an older age are seen in an evocative landscape of Satish Gupta three recesses of a beach with a canoe give us cadences of clearer instincts of a time.Music leads the way, in Shridhar Iyers conclusions of staccato coloured leanings as if he creates a functional harmony born out of islands of colourative confluences.Saba Hasans paper and painted analogies create an evocative echo of time past and present and the embers of a passageway that speaks of darkened recesses.In that mood of smoky tints is an enchanting early Ram Kumar which speaks of his evolution from the logical stylistic developments in the fieldat the time, mainly Cubism, which Picasso and Braque derived from suggestions in the work of Czanne. Yet another work of great delight is the rice paper creation of Dashrath Patel.The intensity of a small cogent cohesion is what entices.Shoba Brootas green and mandarin-colored congeries of arrowing lines and shaded planes, nudging in and out of shallow pictorial depth gives us a fertile plane of discoursive distinctions . Sometimes abstraction can create visible subject matter as in Nupur Kundus incantations of colour that creep and crawl and drip into its own testimony of colded colourative zones.Harshavardhans tribal symbolism in rust tinted recessions create its won rhythms while Manish Pushkales works remind of the minted moorings of a mantra.Perhaps in many ways it is golden ripples rhythm of Sayed Haider Razas work that forms the abacus of this stunning saga of deepened depths of abstractions.Picassos words on abstraction swing into the corridors of this beautiful space at Visual Arts Gallery. Picasso reasoned that there can be no such thing as non-figuration. All things appear to us in the form of figures, he said. A person, an object, a circle are all figures; they act upon us more or less intensely.This show aims to inform viewers about abstract art practices. A wonderful pair of Rajendra Dhawans give us his moody melancholic manner of taut horizontal and cloudy bands of primitive colors, all keyed to a physical sense of gravity.Then there is Kalicharans material, lyrically gravity-defying paintings affirms him as the first among equals. The proof of any arts lasting value is a comprehensive emotional necessity: its something that a person needed to do and which awakens and satisfies corresponding needs in us. This show portrays this so perfectly."

I chose to call her Jasmine. She didnt object. Just as she had never done when someone had asked her if she knew the woman whom she came to meet every week at the elderly care facility. The lady whom she would narrate stories while feeding rice with her own hands. Whose graying hair she would brush while she stubbornly wanted to turn the other way.Did she know the frail lady? Or was it some voluntary service she was offering?Within a jiffy, a million memories flashed in her mind.She smiled. Then nodded. The faraway look in her eyes seemed to say: Yes, I used to butWell, what?But not anymore.And the 65-year-old lady whose privacy I guard by addressing her as Sugandha?You can coax her a million times. Show her photographs. Recollect incidents. Landmark events. Or may be, very mundane ones. Something like her daughters birthday parties when she would cook five elaborate dishes before serving them on a platter to her little darling.Nothing registers. She stares at the ceiling. Sometimes, her eyeballs roll searching, as it were, for what she perhaps has no idea about.Jasmine sits in front.Staring too. Tempted to plead  Forget Me Not. Holding her hand. Occasionally planting a soft kiss on her cheek. Hoping to see Sugandhas lips curl into a smile.Sometimes, Sugandha obliges.Thats enough for Jasmine.Enough to keep her faith in miracles. Enough to live with the hope that someday her mother will recognise her.Yes, Sugandha is Jasmines maa.And she? Her little Tua.Even a year after her retirement as a teacher, she was still Jasmines best friend. Her buddy. Someone who would open the door for her every night when she returned from office after taking the last local train back home. And then, warm the food. The two would then sit together, talk about the days proceedings while picking fish bones over a late-dinner. The clocks tick-tick hardly interrupted their adda. The daal stains on their fingers would dry up as they went chatter-chatter. Jasmine would have to spend quite sometime rubbing her stubborn nails to get rid of those dried daal stains.But that was fun. Every night, she would look forward to those two hours with her mother unless sleep played spoilsport. She never felt the loneliness that many single children do. Sugandha was like a sibling. A companion. A shadow of sorts. Her coolest buddy.She still is.Just that, Sugandha doesnt respond.She no longers calls her Tua.In fact, she doesnt address her at all.Sometimes, Sugandha struggles to speak a few syllables. But they dont connect. All that she manages is a droning zzzzz like sound.Till last year, Sughandha could utter two words  Amar lok. Meaning, my people.But a sudden brain stroke snatched that power away.Sometimes, the touch in her fingers give an illusion that she is still searching for her own people. But thats about it all. Sugandhas grey cells dont connect. No emotional expressions. Rather, an overwhelming sense of disinterest seems to engulf her sub-conscience.Jasmine wants to hug her tight. But Sugandha prefers a peck on the cheek instead.Do her brain cells have any memory that its a kiss from her daughter?Jasmine has no answer. The doctors too arent certain.***In 2005, Sugandha had never watched Black with her daughter though she knew Amitabh Bachchans performance in the film. Jasmine had. A decade and a year later, she can see a reflection of Bachchans character in her mother. Both were teachers who developed Alzheimers disease as age caught up with them. Sugandha has no memory of Bachchans films any more. Recognising him is out of question.In India, more than four million people have some form of dementia. Worldwide, at least 44 million people are living with this disease making it a global health crisis.Jasmines story is a metaphor of sorts or all the caregivers who look after the four million patients in this country. Her struggle is a silent fight that the world doesnt know about. The world is more caring when it sees the pain in a messy ulcer or the crimson blood oozing out of a deep cut. A fractured hip or a balding scalp post-chemotherapy has a visible index of suffering.But the silent agony of seeing a close one losing grip over life doesnt register. The internal bleeding of emotions dont leave behind any stains for the world to sit up and take note. Besides, there is also this whole compulsion of telling the world that everything is fine or will eventually be so.In the process of being the care-giver, the Jasmines of the world wither away since they silently agree to internal erosion. Everybody thinks they are fine and hence, even if the wails choke the throat, the silencer ought to be pressed into action immediately.The rules of the battle insist that frustration has to be beeped and pain has to be internalised. At the most, you can bandage the wound by plunging headlong into work. But that cant happen 24X7. What when the whole world sleeps and the memories come whizzing past like bullets, tearing the heart apart?What then?***Psychiatrist Dr Jairanjan Ram has a personal story to narrate about his mother who suffers from dementia. While he attends to such patients at his clinic, back home his mother is slowly losing her memory. She forgot my birthday and had to be reminded by my sister-in-law to wish me. We told her about a family dinner that we had planned that night. But once we reached her place, we found she had already eaten! However, she tried to manage the situation by saying that she was a little hungry and had hence eaten something but would share the dinner with us, Ram said.Unlike other patients who have doctors to help them deal with the situation, Ram finds himself in a rather curious space. There is no question of living with illusion. The situation is sad but I have to deal with it. The older memory takes time to go. It is the more recent ones that are easiest to forget. If a patient has four sons, he will first forget the youngest one, he explained. Nowadays, the mother-son spend a lot of quality time by cracking old jokes. She has become like a child. Maa likes to hear jokes that were cracked years back. I just repeat them since it makes her happy, he offered.***Advertising professional Sugato Guhas father, Ramen Guha, started having memory lapses two years back. During a trip to Mumbai, Sugato discovered that his father was drawing a blank when he mentioned Amitabh Bachchans name! Baba used to regularly watch cinema and knew all his stars. But that day, he could only recognise Dev Anand and Dharmendra. Beyond that, no other names registered, he said.Thats when Sugato understood that something was amiss. Soon, his father was diagnosed with cerebral atrophy. His brain was shrinking and there was no remedy. It slowly spread. Before he passed away, he could only recognise his immediate family. And that too not always, recalled Sugato.On the face of it, Sugato tried to put up a brave front. Not one of those to languish in self-pity, Sugato accepted the situation. Even if he failed to recognise me or my mother, he was a living, breathing part of our lives. It was very painful for my mother, and I had to maintain a situation of normalcy so that there is no emotional scarring for anybody, he said.This business of maintaining a situation of normalcy is the toughest. It does take a heavy toll on you internally, more so because of my sisters illness. I simply took everything as a job to be done to the best if my abilities, he explained. During that period, Sugato didnt take any break from work as it helped him tide over the emotional maelstrom. He even wrote the lyrics for a bhajan for Har Har Byomkesh.Life had to be as a normal as possible and he literally commanded himself not to fall ill. I knew I couldnt afford that. So, I changed my lifestyle. Illness cant be predicted but I still tried to avoid anything that could easily make me fall ill. No junk food. No returning home late after a party. I knew I had to be fit to take care of everyone. After a hard days work, when he returned home at night, he would switch on the television. The images floated in front of him but nothing sank in his mind. Meditation helped me soothe my nerves. I used to listen to music or read a lot. Id spend some time with my closest friends. But essentially, I am a very private person and wasnt expecting sensitivity from the whole world or pining over why such a thing had to happen to me, he said. He just knew that he would have to brave it all. When on December 12, last year, his father passed away at the age of 81, Sugato didnt even get the luxury of mourning for long. His sisters cancer had relapsed and he had to back to firefighting again. The process continues.***Firefighting is another art that Jasmine is learning from life as well. The first time Jasmine had given me a limited-access pass to her private world of loss was during a trip to a hill station in North India. As the fog descended early one evening, Jasmine started to unravel to me what had largely remained a secret for the rest of the world. Whatever happens, I know I cant afford to fall ill, Jasmine told me.Her words hit me hard. Even if Sugandha doesnt recognise her, Jasmine has to be on her toes 24X7 to battle any adversity. Illness for herself is a luxury that she can ill-afford. When maa started progressively deteriorating, it became exceedingly difficult for me to watch her crumble this way. My mother, who would wait for me every night to return home, started forgetting whether I have returned or not! Soon, she forgot how to cook. She would cut the vegetables and then stare blankly at them not knowing how to start cooking, Jasmine said.Subsequently, Sugandha started to revolt at the thought of taking a shower. Jasmine would make her sit on a chair and then gently scrub her body while a violent Sugandha would try to hit her with a mug.Every three months, there would be new signs of deterioration. Names started missing from her vocabulary. On chits of paper, Jasmine would write down Sugandhas name, address and telephone number and keep them in all the bags her mother had. My fear was that if she left home alone and couldnt return on her own! Jasmine shared.Thankfully that never happened. But the next problem was when she couldnt remember how to dial. I would scribble down my mobile number of every available piece of paper at home so that if she wanted to dial, she would not have to break her head to remember the number! During this time, she would recognise Jasmine off and on. Like a flickering bulb, she would suddenly recall moments only to again go dim into an abyss of total memory loss.One day, Sugandha stopped recognising everyone. Jasmine was left behind with a gnawing sense of emptiness. She dreaded the day Sugandha had to be shifted to a specialised elderly care facility. The whole night she howled. In the morning, she rushed to meet Sugandha. After some hours of futile struggle to jostle the memory, Jasmine reported to office. That day, she stayed around long, offering to do almost all work that anyone would give her. I wanted to prolong my time in office so that I could go back home only for the few hours to crash in bed. Beyond that, the emptiness was unbearable, she said.***But how many people truly understand this emptiness? Or what a Herculean task it is to become a care-giver for patients with dementia, Alzheimers disease and mental health issues? At a time when our celebrities are insensitively dropping names of neurological disorders like Asperger syndrome almost as fancy terms while mud-slinging at each other in public, expecting sensitivity in such case of care-givers is almost like asking for the moon. The worst is when people I meet on the road ask me how much maa has improved after we transferred her to this facility care. I so desperately want to tell that she has. But then, brain cells dont grow her eyes fight back the tears.Communicating with someone who cant recognise is a tough task. What do you say? How do you convey what you have bottled up within? There was nothing to ask. So I just stayed with him, massaged his hands and feet and told some jokes. I would also give him hugs. I came closer to him in those eight months than I was in the previous 30 years, Sugato recalled.He also cut down on his socialising. I was doing only what was absolutely necessary. I even cut down on my travel, going out only for work. I survived, so it can be done. Ultimately, love means sacrifice  how much you can give up for the person you care for. Walking the talk is difficult, but necessary, he said.***The most difficult part is when the patient too becomes extremely insensitive about the needs of the care-givers. Many care-givers have stories about how their near ones have got violent, irritated and cranky. Apart from forgetting things, Maa also began to see me as her enemy and even started spreading rumours about how I was plotting to steal her money and give it away to my in-laws! I spoke to the doctor about it and realised that there was no way to turn back the wheel. Alongside memory loss, she also did weird stuff, said Ayush (name changed on request). There were times when Ayushs mother met their relatives in his absence and filled them up with stories of how he was planning to harm her! I realised that my mother was someone else I have in my memory. The lady I am living with is another person, he said.Jasmine too does the same to negotiate being in the company of a person who bears a faint resemblance to how her mother used to be. To beat the blues, she often goes out for dinner-dates with herself. I watch movies, go to restaurants. I have no guilt-trips for pampering myself keeping in mind that financial expenses that I have to bear. I live life my way and dont fear how others will judge me. At the end of the day, she is my mother. Its my emotion. Anyone who judges me for doing or not doing something will never understand what I feel till I allow the person to step into my shoes, she says.Escapism can be a balm. But momentarily. The wounds never heal. Perhaps, it gets a wee bit bearable only when Jasmine holds Sugandhas fist. Sugandha doesnt say anything. No visible sign of recognition.She just tightens her grip a little.Thats when Jasmine closes her eyes.Takes a deep breath.Thats when Sugandha smells most like Tuas maa."
5904d1be7be9e04154dfc3d1,Chance to leapfrog: Aadhaar Bill provides the foundation to transform the distribution of welfare,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-editorials/chance-to-leapfrog-aadhaar-bill-provides-the-foundation-to-transform-the-distribution-of-welfare/,2016-03-07,"It is almost certain that what could be an important element of a radically different framework to deliver public services in India will soon get legislative backing. The Aadhaar Bill has been introduced in Lok Sabha as a money bill, which sidesteps the need for Rajya Sabhas approval and thus perpetual logjams. As NDA has a majority in the Lower House, legislative sanction is a foregone conclusion. Aadhaar legislation is one of the most important ones in recent times, as it can be used to transform Indias appalling quality of governance.Aadhaar gives every resident an opportunity to possess a portable national identity. It is unique because it anchors demographic attributes such as name or gender to biometric attributes like iris patterns of individuals. When this unique identity is combined with universalisation of banking and communication through mobile telephones, we have a historic opportunity to transform the leaky and corrupt distribution of welfare. Instead of physical distribution such as bags of fertilisers or sacks of rice (which mostly never reach), governments will have the opportunity to transfer cash or food stamps. The benefits of a transition to direct transfer are twofold: price distortions in the economy will end and people will be liberated from local power brokers.Transition to direct transfer has been delayed for two reasons. One, in the absence of appropriate Aadhaar legislation, there were concerns about breach of privacy. Two, the banking systems reach was limited. With the advent of new hybrid banks piggybacking on communications technology, soon every village can be brought within the ambit of the formal financial system. Improving the delivery of welfare is essential to build political support for reforms in factor markets like land and labour. The Aadhaar Bill provides the foundation for these reforms."
5904d3867be9e04154dfc647,Chef scours state for grandmom’s recipes,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/chef-scours-state-for-grandmoms-recipes/,2016-03-08,"This time round, the chef, who has already penned 26 books, focuses on ancient dishes that helped boost the health of women. In olden times, many dishes were made especially for girls who had just attained puberty and also pregnant women and lactating mothers as they need nutritious food, says Damu.But now, with an increasing number of people moving to metros, and living far away from their families, this tradition has been lost. I wanted to dig out the old recipes and compile them into a book so that it would be of help to families, he says. His book, which is in Tamil, will be published by Karpagam Pathippagam, and has about 30 recipes.He began his research more than a year and a half ago, travelling across the state and reading intensively . For instance, in the `Purananooru, a Tamil poetic work, which is one of the eight books in the secular anthology of Sangam literature, and the Agananooru, there are references to certain traditional dishes, says Damu.In the Purananooru, there is a refer anooru, there is a refer ence to gramathu fish curry, which villagers made.While harvesting paddy , the farmers would let out stagnant water. This water would contain small fish, like the vazhai (ribbon fish) and also tortoises, which were then caught and cooked, says Damu. Various kinds of fish curry were made with tamarind pulp in mud pots.It was the old-timers he met across the districts who helped him perfect the recipes. I spoke to old women, many of them over 80, who told me about these dishes, he says.For instance, when girls attained puberty, special food like Uluthuma puttu was given to them for breakfast.Urad dal was roasted, powdered and then added to steamed red rice, coconut milk, grated coconut, elaichi and karupatti or palm jaggery , says Damu. The mixture was then steamed.Similarly , in the afternoon, they were given whole urad dal, which was boiled with parboiled rice and karupatti (palm jaggery). Only pure gingelly oil was used then, he says.Young married women were also put on special diets to make them strong enough for childbearing. They were given nutritious food to strengthen their uterus and hip bones, says Damu.Again, urad dal was used to make a porridge called uluthuma kali. Sambar soru was also made, by mixing boiled sambar rice, with dates, almonds, cashews mixed with red banana, says Damu, adding that pregnant women were given a syrup made of urad dal, gingelly seeds and white jaggery , which has more iron content.Damu has tried out every recipe before including it in the book. Many of the elderly women I spoke to showed me how to make the dishes. Then, I made it myself and had them taste it to ensure it was authentic, he says. He hopes that the book will help improve the health of women."

Speaking with Sugandha Indulkar, Lakshmi discussed being a single mother, an Indian in America, her inspirations  and, on the eve of International Womens Day, how women are judged far more harshly than men:What is life like being a single Indian mother in the West?Well, i am quite fortunate to have a lot of resources compared to most single mothers in the US  certainly a lot more than what my mother had when she was raising me. She was a single mum who worked full-time and attended college at night.With me, i am single because i want to be. I love being with my five-year-old daughter.Youre globally known now  but how difficult was breaking several glass ceilings?There are two issues here  one is being a woman and the other is being from a minority.One of the reasons i am well-known is because there arent too many Indians on American television  theres me, Sanjay Gupta and now, Priyanka Chopra.The standards for women on television are definitely different from those for men. If youre at the top, everyone wants to know everything about you  especially how i stay in shape. Its natural to be curious  but nobody asks my colleague Tom Colicchio how he stays in shape!The pressure to look a certain way and stay in shape for women in media or television is much higher than for men. Women have to excel in everything they do, on or off screen. They are constantly being judged  against men who are accepted the way they are.What was your cultural journey like?I went to America when i was four. Im basically from South Kerala. My grandfather moved to Chennai first. I learnt to balance life between Chennai and Manhattan.It wasnt easy as we were hardcore vegetarians. In New York, wed seek restaurants which served rice and so, frequented Chinese and Mexican joints and salad bars.It was difficult to eat out or mingle with kids in school because our food was so different from theirs.How did you hone your culinary skills?My mother and grandmother were great cooks. My aunties and women in the family spent a lot of time in the kitchen. I loved listening to their kitchen stories and started helping out when i was quite young. As a 12-year-old, i was allowed to peel peas and skin potatoes. I loved watching the women in my family cook.In the US, i started assisting my mother in her kitchen to take some workload off her back.Have you observed transitions in the Indian food scene abroad?A change has been brought by a new generation of Indians. This younger generation has grown up in the West  as the world has shrunk because of social media, theyve strengthened their bond with authentic Indian food, just as its made in Indian households.Indian restaurants in the West have become more authentic now  they no longer worry whether western people will like it or not.Indian food is delicious. We just need to demystify it a bit for more people, so they try it in their kitchens. Indian food is about to have its great moment soon  i dont think its had it yet.Who is your most powerful inspiration?Definitely my mother  she was a single mother, a great cook and a great mother. She used to work full-time as a nurse and attend night college to complete her MD.Despite all the hardships that came her way, she was always smiling, helpful and retained her sense of humour.I can never feel bad for myself because whenever i think of her, i am reminded of the difficult things she has been through  and how well she found her way out of all the difficulties.What drives you in life?I want to leave the world a better place than the one i was born in. Thats what my Endometriosis Foundation is about. Weve educated thousands about this disease which affects 10% of women. Today, we get funds from the state of New York to run our education programme.I know as women, we are very powerful  and we have a different way of doing things."
5904d4607be9e04154dfc758,Love in times of lust in the brothels,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/priyanka-dasgupta-blog/love-in-times-of-lust-in-the-brothels/,2016-03-05,"When dusk settles and the streetlights begin to glow, Munshigunge changes its character. Men, mostly taxi drivers, park their vehicles by the road. Then, depending on their mood and preferences, they disappear into the pigeon-hole sized rooms with their squeeze for the night. The going rates now is Rs 200 per shot.On a good day, a young girl can earn Rs 2000.But such good days are rare. When lust comes for a price, babus turn misers. Some just come, haggle over prices, force themselves on to the girls and then leave without paying the fixed amount. The girls are left behind to deal with a sinking feeling of depression and a gnawing sense of emptiness. With each passing day, they realise how crippled their lives have become and how their fate has been helplessly trapped between their legs!Yet, love happens. Or so they say. Every time a buyer leaves and they scrub their bodies hard to get rid of the stench of exploitation, they secretly dream of leaving the dhanda. Even as they shout aloud that love doesnt exist, deep down they believe otherwise. In privacy, some of the greatest cynics there still hope that men in shining armour will come, if not on a horseback but at least on a cycle, to rescue them.At night when they hit the bed, their dreams comprise montage shots of life in wedded bliss and happiness in domesticity.Each time they get betrayed in love and promise never to tread that path, they also know it is a trap they wont be able to escape for too long.Love is an eternal quest in the red light areas. A mirage of sorts that everyone is chasing. An illusion that curiously gives hope and a sense of meaning for those being forced to sell their all for a price.***On a March afternoon, I walk down Munshigunge with Noor Biwi (name changed) in tow. Noor, now in her 50s, was sold to the brothel when she was only 12. For three months, she was kept confined to a room. Then, a day came when she was readied for her first buyer!I was there in the brothel for a year, she says. Today, she still has friends there. Some girls call her maa. Some imagine that they too can manage to run away from the brothel and settle down the way Noor had decades ago. Others look up to her when she takes a stroll in the bylanes at night trying to ensure that no new girl is trafficked.Noors story, in some ways, comes very close to that of empowerment.As we walk down the road, I ask Noor if she has experienced love.You must be kidding, she flaunts a toothless grin while saying so.The afternoon sun kisses her bare shoulder as she walks in front of me. A few steps ahead, she turns right.A second is all it takes to understand that this is the place where the Noors of the world have been getting sold off in Munshigunge.***A fair-complexioned girl, with tattoos on her arms, reclines on the pavement. Carelessly, she blows rings of smoke into the air. Her cigarette is precariously balanced between her middle and ring finger. At a short distance stands another young girl.Short skirt. Black boots. Crimson lipstick.She stands against the wall, chest heaving seductively and one hand on her left hip. The other browses through her smartphone.Noor doesnt personally know these girls. She is of a different generation. But she knows the others inside. Those, who have been living in the brothel for 20 years now. There is a sense of camaraderie with these girls. A bond of love and care. She doesnt need to knock on the door to enter the 10 ft by 10 ft room that has been home to Razia Biwi (name changed). The paint on the parrot green walls needs a fresh coat. The bed  the paradise for her clients  occupies seventy per cent of the floor space. It is strategically lifted slightly higher than the usual height to make space for a storeroom underneath. Perched on the wall is a television set where Razia has long been entertained by popular soaps like Balika Badhu. That is, when her clients dont pay her to entertain them.***It has been six years since Razia stopped getting clients on a regular basis. She now has a fixed babu who comes twice a week. She insists that I climb up the bed and sit there while she shares her lifes tales.There is a smell of domesticity in the room. Unlike Sonagachhi, nobody here has to share a room with another girl and solicit buyers behind drawn curtains.Privacy is important.Or so, they would like to believe.Its difficult to guess Razias age. She could be in her mid-40s. Or perhaps, late 50s too. Considering the background, its surprising to see her flatteringly decked in gold jewellery. Or may be, gold-plated ones. But whatever the metal, they manage to give an impression of a woman who is taken care of. I have a son who is in his teens! Razia says.Seated on her floor is Asma (name changed). Her 20-year-old son died last year. It was a normal death. Three years ago, my husband died, she explains while I was left wondering how death of a teenager can be normal.Pangs of bereavement dont show on Asmas face. Perhaps, her weathered life doesnt offer the luxury of showing her wounds in public. Asma squats on the floor with a big plate of puffed rice on her lap.Razia is little embarrassed when I ask her about romance. I got married and was sold to a brothel by my husband. Every male member in his family used to get married to girls regularly and then sell them off to brothels. That was their family profession! Do you expect me to believe in love? she asks.Difficult question. But Asma comes to rescue and before Razia can stone-wall the questions, she reminds how the latter had indeed fallen in love with a garage mechanic.Razia blushes. Her face takes on a purple tinge as she goes back in time. He used to work in a garage. I was a line girl. Our eyes met one day when I was sitting by the window and he was standing outside on the road. We would exchange glances. Thats how it all started she says.Razia had just managed to escape her husbands torture then. Her husband, who married her from Kumilya in Bangladesh before bringing her to Kolkata, had lied to her family about his profession. He had told them that he had a utensils shop in the city. Razia, for all practical purposes, could never reveal the truth for the fear of becoming an outcast. The first day he told me to sell my body, I grabbed my husband by the collar and threatened to expose him in my village. But he overpowered me.For five years, he never took me back home. Even when my mother died, he didnt break the news to me. He would insist that I take on a dozen customer every day. There were no timings. I was supposed to entertain anyone and everyone. Back then, they would pay Rs 20 per shot, she says.Razia couldnt keep a single penny on her. Almost on every night after I had solicited buyers, my husband would force himself on me. He would then make me stand against a wall and draw a rectangular box. Then, he would get drunk and start beating me up. The instruction was he would beat me but I wouldnt be allowed to move beyond the area demarcated by the box! Razia recollects.The man would make her abort every time she conceived. His fear was that if I conceived, it would ruin his source of income. I ran away from that brothel in Babubazar. Then, I went to Metiabruz and finally landed in Munshigunge, her voice trails off.The only glimmer of hope, Razia insists, was those hours of silent exchange of glances. We would do isharabazi. He really cared for me. If I was unwell, he would give me money to buy medicines. I knew it had to be love when on the day I tried to abort my child with him, he rushed to the hospital and convinced me otherwise, Razia explains.Motherhood gave a new meaning to her life. But it didnt give her wedded bliss. Religion came in between. The man, a Hindu by birth, left her for Bihar. I got to know that he married a Hindu girl there. We lost touch. Sometimes, he tries to find about the well-being of our son, she says.Love, like ether, vanished from Razias life.***Was this betrayal more than that of her husband? Razia has no answer. Asma insists it is. She felt this was love despite such a cruel experience with her husband. Then, to get deserted is worse, Asma explains, while adding that betrayal in a brothel is never enough for the girls to give up on love. Otherwise why would Razia who was sold off by her husband fall the second time over? She had seen the harsh realities of the world only too often to believe otherwise. Yet, she succumbed like the others, Asma tries to reason.So, are they foolish? Childlike? Or does seeing the world through the rose-tinted glasses of optimism make their realities more endurable?Razia has no answer. Even if she has, she doesnt say so. Her voice, in any case, would have got drowned by the peals of laughter that waft in the air. The girls are partying. It is a ladies party today, she smiles before I ask what kind of a party it is in the middle of the afternoon. It all depends on their mood. They sometimes come together and party hard. Foreign liquor is served. Perhaps, today is one such day, Asma lets me in. I wanted to believe her though I couldnt help remembering being once told that intoxication helps girls endure the pain of taking on multiple buyers. Perhaps, it was their preparation for a long ordeal. Or may be, it was just celebration time! Who knows?***Razia lost faith in love the day her man left her for matrimony. Today, she has a babu. Asma insists that this babu, a driver by profession, is the one who truly loves her. May be, he does. But how does it matter any more? Razia asks.This man comes by twice a week. His children call her chhoti ammi. His wife knows about her. Razia and her 16-year-old son exchange gifts with them. We see a bond developing somewhere Asma insists.Razia smiles. Maybe, there is assurance. But she isnt yet ready to take his familys acceptance as a proof of love. Her eyes glint with impish delight when she says he is my eli-teli babu (meaning a babu who doesnt mean much). Let him feel what he wants. I am happy as long as I get Rs 5000 a month for my upkeep. Acceptance is good but I know he will never marry me. Its religion that will come in the way. So, why get swayed? He comes, we have a good time and then he leaves. I stay back in this room, Razia is happier getting her economics right. Her destiny doesnt allow her to take flights of fancy beyond the green ceiling of her room.***As I walk out of her place, I still dont know if Razia is completely disillusioned. Or does she fear betrayal too much to publicly claim otherwise? Nobody wants to come across as a fool. Perhaps, prudence suggests to keep the faith alive without allowing the world to be privy to it.I meet Noor outside the brothel. In this profession, where lust is what feeds the mouth of deserted women and children who dont know their fathers, love is a complex term, she says. But Noor did find love, didnt she? On the day when a man agreed to help her escape from the brothel? On the day he agreed to marry her and lend his name to their children?Yes, he married me. But this is rare, Noor explains. Every girl in a brothel believes she will meet Noors fate. In that hope, she gives her heart away. Sometimes, her riches too, feeding the babu who soon starts feeding off her.Love here strangely comes for a maintenance fee. And its the girl, who is expected to pay. The logic is skewed. The man insists that maintenance for his upkeep is mandatory for the girl to cough up, even if it means soliciting buyers. His power comes from a weird sense of possession since he is supposedly providing an umbrella to his girl in the brothel! Love sometimes leaks through this broken umbrella of betrayed emotions that get easily entangled in a maze of complexities.***Too many questions keep popping up. They get drowned by the horns of the trucks that speed down the Khidderpore Road. At night, some of these drivers might drop by at the quarters. Some might take a break during the day itself. As I walk back, I remember being told about two kinds of babu-s who frequent the red light districts. During one of my interactions with a sex-workers son from Sonagachhi, I was once explained the difference. There is one kind of babu called the khanewala babu. First they come to the brothels and sweep the girls off their feet. Then, they start living off the girls like parasites. There is another kind of babu who we call denewala babu. They are the ones who are the giving kinds, Ratan Dului had said.His mother had died after being exploited repeatedly by her khanewala babu. Maa had fallen in love with a man and he stayed on with her for 15 years. We would call him uncle. But when drunk, he would turn into a beast and beat maa black and blue, he had told. Ratan and his brother were very small then. But we would still tell maa to leave her babu and not waste her hard-earned money on him. Yet she refused. We were too young to enforce our reasons on her. Maa was blindly in love. Besides, she insisted it was important to have a man for our support and security, he had told me.Ratan failed to understand what kind of security this babu was providing. Arguments stopped the day his mother died when she was 42.Did he believe that this babu had ever loved his mother? This is common in the brothels. The babus dont work. They are okay with the girls soliciting other buyers. My mother has died and now I find the same khanewala babu going around with another girl. He must be 45 now but he looks 30. Men like them cash in on their good looks. In fact, girls themselves propose to such men! he had said.Did such experiences allow him to believe in love? Yes, I still had the faith. I had fallen for a girl. But the girl cheated on me. Now, I am closed to love. I will go for an arranged marriage, he had shared his plans.***Back in Munshigunge, I bumped into Uma Das, a daughter of a prostituted woman. She is a youth leader of Apne Aap, a grassroot movement to end sex trafficking. Some years ago, Uma had met Hillary Clinton and tied a wristband messaged with the line Cool Men Dont Buy Sex. Umas father had married twice. My mother was first sold to a brothel. Then, she came and stayed at the residence of the woman who was my fathers first wife. While staying there, maa fell in love with my father. He was a taxi driver. The initial days were rosy but soon, he started abuse. Whatever he earned, he would blow it up on his drinks. Maa fended for us by working as a domestic help. Baba died in 2000 and I dont have any feelings for him, Uma is candid.She too fell in love with a boy, got married and gave birth to a son. But now, she is caught in a legal custody battle. We met at a tuition. He too belonged to the red-light area. After my pregnancy, he had started torturing me physically. I have seen how love ends, she insists.Yet, her mother tells Uma that she might be lucky in love the next time around. Maybe, 10% of me would still gamble on love. There are many girls in the red light district who live with the thought that someone will give them the dignity of a wife. I have seen that happen only once in my life. A client married my neighbour after he fell for her. Today, they live away from the brothel and have two kids, she says.Uma is practical. She doesnt want to build castles in the air. But love also has a strange charm of optimism. Its an escape route, converting non-believers as well.Uma, for one, isnt ready to be a cynic as yet. She, like so many others living in the fading red light of brothels, doesnt mind giving love a chance. Yet again.Despite the wounds and the heartbreaks, love in brothels comes as a virtual passport to the promised life of dignity. While being courted for lust, the girls live on lusting for love."

It later became the cornerstone of welfare policies in Tamil Nadu. For politicians it was a shrewd populist move by MGR to retain his vote bank; for nutritionists it ensured at least a third of the required nutrition for children; for educationists it was a strategy to increase enrolment in school; for some economists it was a waste of public money; and for teachers it was an added administrative burden. But for MGR it was a moment of satisfaction for having ensured the feeding of hungry children.This scheme is the outcome of my experience of extreme starvation at an age when I knew only to cry when I was hungry . But for the munificence of a woman next door who extended a bowl of rice gruel to us and saved us from the cruel hand of death, we would have departed this world long ago. Such merciful women folk, having great faith in me, elected me as chief minister of Tamil Nadu To picture lakhs and lakhs of poor children who gather to take up nutritious meals in thousands of hamlets and villages all over TN and blessing us in their childish prattle, will be a glorious event, said MGR about the noon meal scheme.Providing noon meal in schools was not new to Tamil Nadu as it had existed in various forms since the early 1900s. The sporadic events of providing noon meal in schools were outcomes of the philanthropic efforts of a few. But it was left to K Kamaraj to conceive it as a public policy so that government could provide it.Yet due to the lack of adequate finances and weak administrative machinery , the scheme was implemented only in rural primary schools and was dependent on contributions from local governments. In 1982 the allocation towards the noon meal scheme was less than 6 crore.The emotion of MGR behind the initiation of the scheme was truly captured in terms of its mammoth size and his determination to implement it against all odds. The total outlay for this scheme in 1982 was 120 crore that was later revised to 140 crore in late 1982 and 220 crore in 1983. Increasing the outlay by 20 times in a year shows the importance it received in the state. The scheme initially benefited 5.6 million children in rural schools in the age group of 5 to 10 years and within two months it was extended to children in urban areas, increasing the number of beneficiaries to 6.5 million. In addition, the balwadis (child care centres) were roped in to provide meals for children in the age group of 2 to 5 years. Subsequently, the elderly, widows and destitutes were also covered by this programme. Nearly 56,000 noon meal kitchens were opened, of which 35,000 were in schools. The average cost of a meal for children was 45 paisa and for adults, 90 paisa.To ensure its smooth implementation, the scheme was reviewed every month at the secretariat during the initial days by a committee headed by the CM and senior ministers, officials and important political leaders.Though the opposition described the expenditure a waste and a political stunt, MGR was aware that those who criticised the scheme would be shunned by the people. Journalist Ragavendra Rao, while recalling his experience during a field survey , had said that even a few pieces of carrot and tomato in the sambhar rice was a delicacy in the interiors of the districts of TN. This showed there were many hungry MGRs in the state, who were a meal or two away from death at that time."
5904e4507be9e04154dfd555,Taste of the Himalayas,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/handle/taste-of-the-himalayas/,2016-02-26,"A refreshing route taken by chefs of late, is home-style cooking, frills and fancy-free (read no heavy-duty carved tomato/carrot garnish), and keeping it simple and true to origin. In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."
590592e27be9e04154e001c9,Making you sweat: Warm winter heats up prices of vegetables & pulses,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/making-you-sweat-warm-winter-heats-up-prices-of-vegetables-pulses/,2016-01-14,"The hot winter and the growing impact of an abnormally dry rabi season seems to have pushed food prices into a tizzy and send them soaring to a 17 month high of 8.17% in December 2015. The last time food prices were so high was in July 2014 when they peaked at 8.47%. This is bad news as this sharp surge in wholesale food prices may soon further push up consumer prices well above the 6% targeted by the RBI and put a big question mark on the soft monetary stance the central bank had adopted in the last year.No doubt such a sharp surge was unexpected given that food prices were falling as late as August last year. Now let us look at what has caused the food prices to shoot up by as much as 8 percentage age points over the last four months between September and December 2015, an extraordinary development in any circumstances. A causal glance at the numbers shows that of the six major components of food prices, namely cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, milk and egg, meat & fish as many as five have registered a sharp spurt. Only in the case of milk has there been a softening of the inflationary trends with price levels dipping to 1.78%.The pickup has been least in cereals that include important products like rice and wheat, where wholesale prices have only crept up from deflationary levels to a marginal 1.63% in December. The highest pick up was in vegetables and pulses where it rose by around 20 percentage points over the last four months. It was especially bad in the case of vegetables where prices had been declining sharply till September and then suddenly shot up to a high 20.56% in December. In the case of pulses the price levels rose from 36.49% in August to 55.64% in December clearly signalling that the government efforts to improve supply, including through harsh measures against hoarders, have failed to have any impact.However, wholesale price trends in the case of fruits and egg, meat and fish were more benign. In the case of fruits prices have only picked up to a marginal 0.76% in December after falling steadily in the previous seven months. Prices of egg, fish and meat have been more volatile with the 2.2% fall in prices in November last year suddenly reversing and perking up sharply to a new high of 5.03% in December.This indicates that the growing divide between food and non-food inflation has become a major issue that will cast a long shadow on meeting the long term inflation target of 4% India has recently adopted under the flexible inflation targeting framework. Such inflation targeting can only work if the government can ensure that food supply responds more strongly to wholesale price signals than seems to be happening now. It also indicates that polices to sustainably reduce inflation expectations are yet to make their presence strongly felt."

As he rattles off names like aiyla, mathi, kari meen, ney meen, aiykoora, my eyes glaze over. It all sounds very fishy to me!And it is. I am in Kerala on a holiday and spoilt for choice for a seafood preparation at one of the most exotic hotels in Kochi, Bruntons Boatyard. Steeped in Raj influences and mid-century elegance, the hotel is famous for its History Restaurant, which boasts a menu that is simple but innovative: each dish reflects the culinary history of the community it is culled from. And with about 30 different communities living in Kochi, the menu at the History restaurant tells its own special story.The First Class Railway Mutton Curry speaks of a time gone by when the British traversed the country building the Indian railways. Fish Cutlets tell tales of an Anglo-Indian heritage. Fish lovers savoring the flavour of Samak Bil Harder Asful are transported to Arabia. Then theres the fish Moilee which is a throwback to the citys Syrian-Christian roots. The Vindaloo transports you to the time of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese influence in the community. And not to be left behind, the Dutch Pudding with a lingering trace of cinnamon, harks back to the days when the Dutch East India Company made Kochi one of their settlements.At the History Restaurant, these cuisines have been given a new lease of life, recreated faithfully each evening by chefs who did their research in the best place possible  with the old families of Kochi. The staff is friendly and well-informed and I get to hear interesting nuggets of information as we wait for our meal. Niju, our waiter for the evening, tells us that the Portuguese taught the local people how to use coconut milk in the dishes and the Jews introduced the famous appam, pancakes made with fermented rice batter and coconut milk. While the Dutch didnt share much, preferring not to go dutch with the locals, the Dutch bread called Brooder is sold on the streets of Cochin even today.I want to sample the two signature fish dishes of this delightful old-world restaurant: Chuttulli Meen and Vypeen Moilee. The chuttulli meen recipe is one of the oldest recipes on the menu and the recipe for the marinade of the fish was handed over to chefs by one of the local Jewish families when the hotel first opened. The fish (mullet or Indian salmon) is filleted, covered with roasted shallot paste and grilled. It is then broiled in a salamander (not to be confused with the amphibian; this is a high-end broiler for kitchens!). The cooked fillet and a thick layer of potato slice is then draped over a liberal helping of saffron sauce and served with a side helping of roasted aubergine and okra.Even as I am cleaning out my plate with relish, my next dish, Vypeen Moilee, makes its grand appearance. Named after Vypeen or the island opposite Bruntons Boatyard, moilee is a take on the original Portuguese stew, with milk being replaced by coconut milk and local spices added to suit the local palate. Served with appams, moilee is a mlange of fish, squid and prawn, flavored with turmeric and tempered with fenugreek seeds.As I tuck into my aromatic stew, I glance around the room. Except for the gentle clink of cutlery and the discreet movements of the attending staff, everyone is concentrating on their dishes.Conversation is hushed, suitably reverent to the surroundings. The Foodie son is busy opening his three-storey Tiffin Meal, containing appam, vegetable khichdi and Kerala chicken cutlets. The H, has played it safe and gone with the more traditional meal of Malabari parathas, Kerala kela koftas and coconut rice.I turn back to my moilee and as I take another mouthful, I let out a little sigh of pleasure. The fare has been simple, but has left me fishing for more food in Kerala."
590593917be9e04154e002c8,"Assam’s minority report: As the state readies for polls, it would be dangerous to abuse the highly emotive ‘Bangladeshi’ card",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/assams-minority-report-as-the-state-readies-for-polls-it-would-be-dangerous-to-abuse-the-highly-emotive-bangladeshi-card/,2016-01-12,"For five hours, the body of the 15-year-old girl hung on the barbed wire fence, blood streaking her clothes in the January chill, her hair hanging down in a macabre flow. She was shot while climbing over from the Indian side in West Bengal to Bangladesh and was going for her own wedding. Her father had managed to get over unscathed but the child, whose name was Felanee did not make it. That was in 2011. That Felanee was Bangladeshi was uncontested but the killing of an unarmed child sparked a furious outcry against shootings of civilians by BSF on the international boundary.As a result of this incident, Indian border patrols were instructed not to fire live ammunition on suspected intruders (mind you, BSF failed to tackle the real infiltrators, those of armed groups who had skipped across for years, creating mayhem, until the Bangladesh government cracked down and handed over Ulfa, NDFB and Manipuri insurgent leaders to India). Nearly 1,000 persons had been killed in a 10 year period or one death every four days.Those who died included Bangladeshis and Indians, cattle rustlers, petty criminals as well as people who were shot while going about their daily business. Cattle smuggling is a major business along the border; so is human trafficking. Criminal gangs which flourish on either side of the border are unlikely to do so without official connivance.Illegal/informal migration from Bangladesh into India is substantial but there are other interlocking issues. I will focus on two here. One is the scale of the migration  most of the figures I have seen are simply assertions and analysis based on assumptions. The other is the impact that such perceptions are having not just in eastern India, especially in Assam and West Bengal, but also across the country, with antipathy growing against Muslims of Bangla origin.The latter is important especially as Assam is going to the polls in a few months. There appear to be few issues, barring the anti-incumbency factor against the Tarun Gogoi government. That is why one must be extremely careful that the highly emotive Bangladeshi card is not used as a weapon of rhetoric.As far as numbers are concerned, the truth is that decades after the Bangladeshi campaign began in the late 1970s, few have been detected and deported despite many promises. Not even the Centre has a clear idea of how many illegal migrants are in India, not just Assam. For years there has been a sense of fatigue on the issue in Assam.Thus, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi correctly chose statesmanship over local politics by settling the IndoBangladesh land boundary issue, a problem that had been unresolved for decades, he piquantly created a challenge for the Assam unit of his own party which had opposed the deal, claiming it would increase illegal migration.Such complexity is deepened by sweeping media reports which posit a future where Bangladeshi Muslims will be a majority in the state and ignore the fact that it has three major groups of Muslims: Assamese speaking Muslims whose ancestors go back to the 13th century, Muslims of Bangla origin, many of whose ancestors came over 100 years ago, and the post-1971 Bangladeshi Muslims. Indeed, this last point is also conveniently forgotten: those who moved from East Pakistan before 1971are not Bangladeshis.Also ignored is that there is a high fertility and birth rate among Muslims groups in western Assam where large families are the norm. This is a key factor in demographics  especially if one considers the fact that Assam has smaller border with Bangladesh than Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram or West Bengal!There is hostility to in-migration in Assam and the northeast. Most migrants  as the recent movement from Syria shows  seek safe havens. In addition to that, there is greater economic security as Bangladeshs economy has grown to a near middle economy, making risky out-migration less attractive.The combination of selective facts, selective memory and rhetoric can be a deadly combination as seen in 2012 after incidents in western Assam where both Bodos and Muslims were victims. Hate mongering triggered an exodus of lakhs of workers from the region, from places such as Bengaluru. Few locally there would make the distinction between a Bodo, a Naga, a Sikkimese or a Mizo. The northeast is lumped together.What happened in February 1983 should suffice as adequate warning about the vulnerability of this complex area: Over 36 years ago, Aasu launched a powerful anti-immigrant movement that brought successive state governments to their knees, stalled the economy, shut down educational institutions and markets and even blocked oil transportation; in February 1983, the central government forced an election in the state, in the teeth of opposition from Aasu and other anti-immigrant groups. In the ensuing violence, thousands were killed  no one still knows the final toll, but it is said to be well above 3,000  including Muslims of Bengali origin, members of tribal groups, Assamese and other ethnics.The worst massacre was at Nellie, which i covered as a young reporter, in which nearly 2,000 Muslim men, women and children were killed. The sight of hundreds of corpses, of infants, women, old men, huddled on dry rice fields are images which i can never forget. Those who died were certainly not Bangladeshis and had lived there for generations. Their survivors struggle futilely to get justice for the murdered and maimed."
590594b27be9e04154e00469,6 actors in search of an author,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/6-actors-in-search-of-an-author/,2016-01-16,"A bold stage adaptation of O V Vijayans fabled Legends of Khasak at ITFoK splits the audience down the middleSeeing is unbelievingby Binu KarunakaranThe play attempts what even great novels seldom dare  art exposing itself as artificeReading is an intimate act, a secret covenant with the author through which you conjure up a fantasy world, aided by perceptive scenography of the brain. To watch Deepan Sivaramans stage adaptation of O V Vijayans Legends of Khasak, therefore, was a blasphemous act  a guilt trip for readers trapped in a fiction about the ultimate guilt-trip.Great novels run the risk of losing out their rich texture and dazzling atmospherics when adapted to suit stage or screen. To make amends, Deepan whittles the text down to a 205-minute-long narrative, a rich tapestry infused with poetry, metaphor, unbridled theatrical energy and clip-clopping spectacle.The staging of the play  a seemingly faithful retelling that showcases all the novels major plot events, main characters and their intersecting stories  was riveting and immersive. But the unrelenting focus on spectacle  characterised by tableaux vivants, rhythmic and stylized movements, ritual theatre, on-stage fireworks and showers  gives little or no space to the viewer to pause and reflect.In the process, the character of Ravi  the sojourner protagonist with many lives and incredible burdens sporting a kurta and an unshaven face appears like a caricature of his witty and sexually subversive fictional persona.The thrust stage, set on open ground with raked seating on three sides and a projection screen on another, gave an illusion of intimacy and interactivity . Odours sweet and acrid  burning incense sticks, ghee rice, lit gun powder and kerosene  wafted up from the arena, enhancing the realism of mise-en-scene. The lighting by Jose Koshy and score by Chandran Veyyattummal were exceptional, so were props by artist Anto George.The actors were seen chatting up members of the audience, some of them who despite warnings, nonchalantly squatted on the performing space and were later served merchandise from the fictional world of Khasak: glasses of sherbet, packets of Naizam Alis No 10 beedis and plates of pathiri and chicken curry .Deepan borrows heavily from the stylised language of indigenous theatre  a project that remains largely peripheral  which explored Keralas own ritual arts and folk forms while searching for Artaudian equivalence and a more sacred performer-audience relationship. The skilful use of Kalamezuthu, ritual drawing with rice flour, and its erasing by actors, as a device, helps to signal the transition from one scene to another. At one point, it turns a potent tool in the hands of the director to make a political comment, as Shivaraman Nair, a Hindu bigot and an Islamaphobe, erases with his feet the domes of the masjid drawn by the mullah Allah Picha.As the play hurtles towards catastrophic denouement, one realises that it treats the loose earth of Khasak  a space that is hybrid, mediated and transformative  as the protagonist. It is in the quicksilver arena of earth muddied by rain that we bear witness to the sound of hooves of Sayed Mian Sheikhs 1001 horses, the enigma of 12 mosques, the goddess of small pox and tamarind branch and above all the despair of Appukkili, the catcher of dragon flies.The play ends with Ravi dragging his trunk to the bus stop in Koomankavu, a luggage that becomes lighter as he gives up his fear of death and caresses the snake skeleton inside. The metal trunk then transforms into a bier, a conjurers box into which Ravi vanishes. The spectacle ends and the director dumps the luggage of text back to the reader, the literary pilgrim who needs to live the fetish, take that journey again to the mythopoeia of Khasak.By the bookby John CheeranFiction shouldnt pretend to be anything elseWhat would have a revenant O V Vijayan said if he had sat through Deepan Sivaramans 205-minute long play version of his Khasakkinte Ithihasam?Would he have been happy, indignant or indifferent? As for me, watching the play at ITFoK in Thrissur on Monday night, with a vague recollection of Khasak and its language, having read both the original and English translation, Sivaraman failed abjectly in negotiating the layered meanings of the epic text. Khasakkinte Ithihasam is about sin, guilt and its expiation. Did anyone of the roughly 900-odd spectators feel anything similar to that? I doubt, for I didnt.But the striking thing, however, remains. Brought to the proscenium under the halo of Vijayan, who upended many political premises of Malayalis, they remained satisfied first through an inordinate delay of 90 minutes and then through the visual spectacle that followed and in the end went home happy. For they had successfully sidestepped Ravis dasasandhis, helped by an asinine and episodical representation of the legends of Khasak propped up by some stage stunts.Vijayan did not write Ithihasam to entertain the reader whereas Sivaraman reduced the stage to a pit for burlesque by bringing alive Allapichcha Mollakka, Appukkili, Kuppuvachchan, Maimoona and Naijam Ali in front of the spectators. If reading Khasak unsettled and unnerved you, watching Khasak lulled you to a dull sense of contentment in a subversive way but without realizing the meaning and fatal significance of such an unintended effort.Shouldnt theatre amuse is a question that was thrown at the spectator in the aftermath of Sivaramans Khasak. The counter-question is shouldnt theatre put a stake through the heart? Its like comparing O V Vijayan the cartoonist with the wildly popular Toms. One provoked, the other made you giggle."
590594b37be9e04154e0046a,Best friends,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/shweshwe/best-friends/,2016-01-22,"Do you feel the same an eternal flame The Bangles was playing on full volume. The four of us were huddled in the back seat of Madhurikas shiny black Ambassador car, while her plump maid with curly hair, Phelomina, sat in front, next to the old driver Swamy. We did this often, going on long drives around Chennais winding roads, feeling the warm breeze blowing on our faces, and singing along loudly with Debbie, or Madonna! We were carefree and cozy in each others company.Sometimes we would go to the Marina beach, where we would get off, roll up our jeans, and dip our feet in the frothy cool sea waves. Then we would dig our toes into the wet sand, and write our names, always together, in one big heart-shape. Mona, Maya, Madhurika, and Me.the four of us were Best Friends. Everyone in our small city knew that we were inseparable.They are like four bodies and one soul!, people would comment, either amazed or jealous of our proximity. We spent our evenings mostly at each others homes, comfortable in the diverse cultures and families we came from.Maya, half-Tamilian and half-American, always had that foreign touch about her! She was the best athlete in school, thanks to her long strong limbs. The downside to those were that it made her clumsy and tom-boyish! Her very short golden-brown hair and rubber-band braces didnt help either! Her bungalow was designed like the ones in the popular TV series,Beverly Hills 90210! She had a high four-poster bed, and we always hid under it with a lamp on, gossiping about the other girls in school, or giggling and blushing over a cute boy! We also spent hours staring at teen-idol posters (River Phoenix and George Michael), pasted on her wardrobe! Soon we followed the intense delicious whiff coming from her large open kitchen, where freshly baked warm apple-pie, and butter sauted sausages and corn would be waiting for us.Mona, was a flirtatious wild-child. She was slightly older than the three of us and bullied us into trying our first sip of beer and talking to the boys! We were somewhat envious of her curves, (which she developed much before us), and her Punjabi fair-skin and pretty face. I think Jaganathan has a crush on me, and maybe I will kiss him someday, she said, as we listened to her awe-struck! She was feisty and rebellious, but her eyes had a sadness that she could not hide. We would squeeze into her single bed and hold her tight, whenever she felt low, though we never knew the reason. She never told us. Hmm.Madhurika, came from a conservative Brahmin background, and everything about her reflected that. Her hair was always in a neat-long-oiled plat, that reached the back of her knees. She wore thick rimmed glasses, her skirts were pleated and came up to her calves. She looked longingly at Monas hot shorts, but never dared to ask for permission to wear them. She was simply brilliant at academics, and stood first in class year after year. Her de-stressing mechanism was to solve math problems, while we would be busy relishing hot meals (heaps of soft rice with dollops of ghee,yellow parappu-dal, and fried apalam), served on banana leaves by the staff a her home all dressed in white veshtis, with grey vibudhi powder across their foreheads! Come on, lets study, she would say enthusiastically!My half-Marwari and half-Telugu genes made for quite an interesting mix! I was an all rounder, and was surprisingly good at everything I did! A sweet, soft-spoken and sensible girl is how one could describe me. But somehow I was also confused most of the times, with many questions in my head! We would discuss these, at our favourite place, in my red-and-white tiled bungalow the terrace, where we would sit on the ledge, our legs dangling dangerously, biting into my Nanis precious besan ka ladoos, that she would send from Mumbai. This is also the place where we made a promiseof being friends for eternity.forever. Then why did we break it? We did we let our friendship fade away? Wasnt it stronger than that? Where are you girls now? I have heard bits-and -pieces from others, over the years, but is it true?Maya, you went away to America, and married a Bengali there, and you both are now living in Kolkata? Do you have kids? Mona..you became a fashion designer, and eloped with a very handsome rock star to Los Angeles? Why am I not surprised? Madhurikayou are now a double Phd, and I dont know anything more about you. Also, dont you all want to know what happened with me? Well, when I moved to Mumbai, I fell head-over-heels in love with a Punjabi, whom I eventually married and now am a mother to a tween girl and lil boy!Many years have gone by twenty-two to be precise. Why have the four of us not tried to stay in touch? Are we scared that maybe we are not the same people anymore? But how much can we change? Or have we actually forgotten each other? Can we, after all the moments we have had? Maybe we are all too busy with our own lives, building new relationships and ignoring the old ones?

(AP Photo/Jerome Delay)More than 4 million children have lost at least one parent in Congo over the past two decades, the silent victims of continuous cycles of violence. And more than 26 million orphans live in West and Central Africa, where Congo is located  the second highest number in the world behind South Asia, according to the United Nations.Watch what else is in the newsThese children have grown up amid conflict fueled by ethnic strife and the fight over valuable minerals.The violence and displacement are eroding the tradition of families caring for their own. The breakdown in family means some orphans are forced to look after themselves and their younger siblings.Some are vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. And many also face sexual exploitation, in a country where rape has become commonplace on the streets.They are the orphans with a story of violence since 1994  its a generation of victims that continues, says Francisca Ichimpaye, a senior monitor at the En Avant Les Enfants INUKA center. And the children lose their story in the violence.As Congo falls once again into violence in the face of a delayed election, here are profiles of some orphans in Goma.ALPHA MELEKI, 6Alpha Meleki was found in a pile of bodies after an attack by rebels on his village in Congos eastern Beni earlier this year. He had been shot and left for dead with his parents in the bush. The bullet wounds and the vine-like surgery scar on the 6-year-olds pudgy belly have only recently healed. He hobbles around, pulling his loose shorts up on his tiny body.The emotional scars are still fresh. When held by someone new, Alpha sits limply. His large eyes glaze over, and sometimes glare with angry distrust. He saves his smiles for those he trusts, often seeking the hands of adults he knows.He cannot stand to see others suffer. Whenever another child at the INUKA center needs medical attention, Alpha cries and screams. In a quiet moment, he touches a short, wide scar on his head. He lets others touch it.They hit me with a machete, he recalls. The center says it could take years to find any family members, as attacks persist in the northeast.JEANNETTE UMUTSI, 17At 17, Jeannette Umutsi has become the caregiver for her little brother, whom she hopes to protect from the horrors she has seen. At first she recounts her story stoically and with distance. She was born only a few years after Rwandas 1994 genocide spilled into Congo. Armed fighters stormed her home, hit her in the leg with a shovel and nearly killed her sister.She and her family fled her hometown of Kirolarwe in 2008 to escape the violence. In the next village, she hid in a toilet enclosure with wooden plank floors for three days to save herself from another attack. Alone, she would sneak out to grab tomatoes that grew nearby. For days, she heard gunshots and saw dead bodies, including that of her uncle. As she continues to talk of violence, she breaks down into tears and gasps.I have so many nightmares now. So many nightmares, she says. Her mother returned to save her. But she later died after giving birth to her brother Shukuru, now 5.Her father used to be a fighter, she says. Once, he threatened to kill her with a machete. As she talks about him, she folds over herself, head in her skirt, and the fear is palpable in her eyes.Finally she fled the family. She wrapped Shukuru up, put him on her back, and walked for days, struggling to breathe, on the way to Camp Mugunga in Goma. She is now an older sister to more than a dozen other children at the INUKA center, where she helps cook the fish and rice for lunch and rounds the kids up for naps.MOISE, 7, AND AGATA MUNOKA, 5Moise Munoka, 7, sits still, looks down and speaks in a near whisper when he recounts the loss of his mother.She died in 2013 after health complications from rapes left her quite sick. Rape is a constant in Congo, where it has become a weapon of war. At the Childrens Voice Virunga Centre in Goma, where Moise and his sister Agata gather during the day, at least 30 children were born of rape.Though Moise never knew his own father, he knows that he was probably a fighter who raped his mother. When asked if he wants to meet him one day, he scrunches his nose up and shakes his head in disgust, No! He is happy to have left his war torn village of Massissi.Its a bad place because theres war, trouble, people dont like each other, they like to kill, he says. Theres always dead people, and blood.He lights up as he explains that he and his sister are now being cared for by a widow, Arlette Kabuo Malimewa, 45. She has three children of her own and also cares for a third foster child. Agata sleeps in the living room, which has several posters of Jesus Christ lining the walls. Moise has his own room, where his two book bags hang from nails on the wooden planks.Malimewa sells bed covers in bright pinks and whites that hang over her black lava rock gate, and makes about $5 a week. I love them, but it is difficult, she says. I want to keep them until my death  because who would they go to?ANUARITA MAHORO, 12Anuarita Mahoro, 12, has been ostracized because she was born with a right hand problem that leaves her too weak to do hard labor. She lived with her father until he was asked to chop wood for armed men who then killed him in 2014. Her mother lived with the men of the forests, as she refers to the fighters. They eventually killed her mother, too, and left.Anuarita fled to her grandparents in Kiwanja. When her grandfather died, she was forced to leave her grandmother to find work to eat. Starving and sick, she was eventually taken in by a center for orphans. Here, her right hand tucked between her legs and leaning on her left elbow, she apologizes.I have suffered so much so I might sound confused, she says. She hopes to return to her village and reclaim her grandmothers land, showing those in the community her worth.After the death of my parents, the community discussed who would take this child. And no one was prepared to take me on as a parent. So since no one wanted me, when I grow up they better not come and ask me for any help, she said, grinning widely, and then covering her face and laughing.She would like one day to set up a center for orphans. And if she ever got the conversation she wants with the men who killed her parents, she solemnly reveals the one thought that wont leave her mind.I would ask why they killed my father and my mother and didnt kill me?DAMIEN MATATA BIZI, 22Damien Matata Bizi looks down, his shoulders heavy, when he hesitantly recounts his past as an orphan who became a child soldier.Many of the thousands of other former child soldiers in Congo over years made a similar choice, or had none at all. Rwandas 1994 genocide pushed fighters into Congo, and multiple rebel groups now fight over the mineral-rich region.Matata Bizi became a rebel after his father, also an armed fighter, died. He was only 10 years old.I was angry when I learned of my fathers death. So I wanted to avenge my father, so I entered into the rebellion to fight, he said. My mother could never pay for school, and we could never find money to pay for food so I thought this was best. Matata Bizi says he was treated well, but others werent.The life that vulnerable children have is hard, he says. They dont have education, they dont have clothes, so it may be better to be in an armed group with the ability to find food and clothes than to be at a loss.When asked about having to kill people, his eyes narrow and he impatiently takes a deep breath, visibly angry.Theres a difference between the militants and child soldiers, he says. The adults have the occasion to reflect on what theyve done. But for a child, we can only execute an order we are given. We dont think of things, we do what we are ordered to do. Matata Bizi was found, rehabilitated by the United Nations and integrated into the army in 2009. He signed papers that say he is no longer a child soldier. He carries the dirtied, crumbling pages around in his shirt pocket. They brand him now.He came to Goma in 2013. He was trained as a mechanic at the Don Bosco center in Goma but has no work. He says its easier to make more money and move up in rebel groups than in the army.War I know isnt good, and neither is violence. Its not good or normal, he says. But the armed groups exist because the country is badly organized. Theres no work. Theres no occupation for the young.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP Photo) In this November 20, 2016 photo, a girl stands by a portrait of Kem Ley, a Cambodian prominent political analyst, at his grave in Ang Takok, Cambodia. (Source: AP Photo)Kem Ley, a poor rice farmers son turned champion of Cambodias have-nots, was sipping his usual iced latte in the same chair he had occupied most mornings for years. Eyewitnesses say a former soldier walked into the Caltex gas station cafe, fired a semi-automatic Glock pistol into his chest and head and casually walked away. Two weeks later, tens of thousands of mourners thronged Phnom Penhs streets to trail the glass casket bearing Kem Leys body in the largest public rally Cambodia has witnessed in recent times. The funeral march reflected not only grief for the popular government critic, but also anger at a government that this year has decimated opponents through imprisonment, intimidation and, many believe, the still-unresolved killing of Kem Ley.Watch What Else Is Making News:Many view the Southeast Asian countrys harshest crackdown in years as an attempt by Prime Minister Hun Sen to sustain his more than 30-year-long grip on power in 2018 elections. The opposition came unexpectedly close to winning the last election, in 2013. Cambodian authorities deny any involvement in Kem Leys death in Phnom Penh, the capital. They arrested ex-soldier and migrant worker Oeut Ang from a distant province on allegations that he killed Kem Ley in July because the activist failed to repay a $3,000 loan. Hun Sen has promised a vigorous investigation.Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Ly Sophana told reporters the investigation is still underway. He did not say when it will be completed or the trial set. At the moment, the court is making an investigation into the case and the government cant comment while it is in the hands of the court, Information Minister Khieu Kanharith said.Interviews with Oeut Angs wife, Kem Lays family and others raise doubts about the governments assertions that a loan was the motive, heightening suspicions that the killing may have been politically motivated.Hoeum Huot said she and her husband lived from hand to mouth and that he could never have had $3,000 in his pocket to lend. She said her husband, whose nickname Chuob Samlap means meet and kill, was prone to drunkenness, out of a job and sold his motorbike before the killing to pay off a gambling debt. She never heard him mention Kem Ley.Kem Leys mother, Pov Se, and sister Kem Thavy said the 45-year-old doctor-turned-activist lived simply and never incurred debts, and had never met Oeut Ang as far as they knew.Shortly before his death, Kem Ley spoke on radio about a report issued by the London-based research and advocacy group Global Witness that alleged the prime minister and his family had accumulated massive wealth and retained power through corruption and brute force. Earlier he had crisscrossed the country to query villagers about their problems.Since Kem Leys death, his wife and five sons left in fear for Thailand, where they have applied for asylum in Australia. I have no idea why my brother was killed, but friends and neighbors often told me that he should not talk about Hun Sen and his family, Kem Thavy said. I argued with him: You cannot hold up the earth all by yourself.'Keo Remy, president of the governments Cambodian Human Rights Committee, refused to be interviewed or answer written questions about Kem Ley and human rights. Activists say the killing has come to symbolize the manifold ills of Cambodian society under Hun Sens 31-year rule.The death of Kem Ley is the death of human rights in Cambodia. It is the silencing of civil society actors. They are now mute, said But Buntenh, a prominent Buddhist monk and friend of Kem Leys who is among the few public figures still openly criticizing the regime. But he said the incident has also backfired on Hun Sen and his Cambodia Peoples Party, having sparked a strong, albeit incohesive, pro-democracy surge among large segments of the population.Meanwhile, Kem Ley has been elevated to a legendary status, perhaps greater than his actual accomplishments. With his death we have gained a great deal, said But Buntenh. It has been five months but people are still weeping.Mourners come to his simple grave every day, including more than 100 who paid their respects on the November day his family was interviewed in Kem Leys native village of Ang Takok, southwest of Phnom Penh.He was crucial to us because of the issues that he tackled. He was a great model for Cambodian people, said mourner Chan Sy. Kem Thavy, often wiping away tears, described her brother as gentle but independent and unwilling to compromise his ideals.He told me that if someone offered him 1 or 2 million dollars he would not sell out, that if someone offered him a job with a big salary in order to stop talking about Cambodia he would not take it, she said.Kem Ley dropped his medical practice to improve life for Cambodians, But Buntenh said. As a doctor he could only cure one patient at a time, so he became a national doctor to treat Cambodias many diseases and help thousands, he said.While denying any role in Kem Leys death, the government has taken steps to silence other critics. According to cases that the human rights group LICADHO has tracked, 26 political prisoners, including politicians and environmental and land rights activists, are behind bars. Others face criminal defamation and charges related to their personal lives.Hun Sen lodged a defamation suit in August against his chief political rival, the self-exiled Sam Rainsy, for saying state terrorism was to blame for the deaths of Kem Ley and other critics, including a prominent labor leader and several environmental activists. Hun Sen said the government had nothing to gain by killing Kem Ley: Who gains to benefit from such a case which happened at the same time the government is talking about peace and safety for the people?The regime has even lashed out against the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Cambodia, describing it last month as not legitimate and threatening to shut down its operations unless it agrees not to interfere in the countrys internal affairs.Ou Virak, who heads the Phnom Penh think tank Future Forum, said the regimes actions are a prelude to the 2018 elections. The close 2013 election was a huge wake-up call for Hun Sen and a huge blow to his ego, he said. His party knows that time is not on their side.Kem Ley apparently knew he had become a target. Three days before he was killed, he told But Buntenh that trusted sources informed him he would be killed in Phnom Penh. The day before he died, Kem Ley posted on his Facebook page a political fable he titled The Garden of Savage Animals, about tigers, cobras and other ferocious beasts trying to prevent meeker animals from entering their bountiful acreage. Their answer: intimidation. You kill one in order to scare a thousand.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Saro Kumari Mandal, 26, covers her head completely, a bundle of grief.Watch What Else Is Making NewsHundreds of young Nepali men wave goodbyes. On this day 1,500 fly out of the Kathmandu airport for desperately needed jobs, mostly in Malaysia, Qatar or Saudi Arabia. But on this day, too, six come back in wooden caskets, rolled out of baggage claim on luggage carts.Scrawled in black marker on one: Human Remains, Balkisun Mandal Khatwe. Saros husband.The number of Nepali workers going abroad more than doubled after the country began promoting foreign labor in recent years: from about 220,000 in 2008 to about 500,000 in 2015. The number of deaths among those workers has risen much faster. One out of every 2,500 workers died in 2008; last year, one out of every 500 died, according to an Associated Press analysis of data released by Nepals Ministry of Labour and Employment.In total, over 5,000 workers from this small country have died working abroad since 2008  more than the number of U.S. troops killed in the Iraq War.The causes are often listed as natural death, heart attack or cardiac arrest  the men go to bed after an exhausting day of work and never wake up. Thats what Saro was told happened to Balkisun.Now medical researchers say these deaths fit a familiar pattern: Every decade or so, dozens, or even hundreds, of seemingly healthy migrant Asian workers start dying in their sleep. It happened in the U.S. in the late 1970s, in Singapore about a decade later and more recently in China. The suspected killer even has a name: Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome.Next year, an international consortium is launching to investigate. For todays arrivals, theyre too late.About 10 percent of Nepals 28 million residents work abroad. They send back more than $6 billion a year, 30 percent of the countrys revenues. Only Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are more dependent on foreign earnings.Nepalese workers are well known for their hard work, dedication and loyalty, boasts the Nepalese Embassy website in Doha, Qatar, where a construction boom employs about 1.5 million migrants from many countries. The comparatively cost effective Nepali workers are experienced at working in the extreme climatic conditions, says the embassy.Nepalis build highways, stadiums and houses in Gulf states and guard shopping malls, sew sweatshirts and assemble televisions in Malaysia. Anyone who has bought imported sportswear or electronics, or who plans to go to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, may be using the products of their labor.The migrants pay recruiters about $1,100 for the jobs. If theyre not tricked out of their earnings  and some are  they can send home about $300 a month.Department of Foreign Employment spokeswoman Rama Bhattarai says some deaths are inevitable: They die as foreign employees, they die here when a bus goes off a cliff.Balkisuns body arrives on an 8 p.m. flight. He died in his sleep six weeks after he left Nepal, at 26, to help build highways as part of World Cup infrastructure improvements, said his Qatar-based Habtoor Leighton Group supervisor, Ganesh Khang Mandal.At the airport, the casket slides easily into a custom-welded coffin rack on one of 10 trucks Nepals government provides to bring bodies back to villages.Saro and 3-year-old son jolt around the backseat for a precarious, eight-hour journey home to Belhi village.The family is marginalized in every way: Ethnically, theyre from the untouchable caste, and they speak Maithili, a language more common in India, a few miles south. They live eight to a room in a mud-and-stick home among sparse rice paddies. A shared cellphone is passed from house to house. Chronically hungry, they survive on less than $1 a day.When the truck reaches Belhi, hundreds of women in traditional saris, men in work clothes and children pour into the narrow dirt street, tears streaming down their faces. Some stand on rooftops. Others crowd a balcony.Mohammed Tohit, 28, watches from across the street. He is the envy and inspiration of his neighbors: Six years of sewing for Nike, Lacoste and Columbia Sportswear in Malaysia helped him buy a sturdy, cement two-bedroom house, a small farm, a cow, a goat and a television set. Hes leaving for Saudi Arabia in 10 days.I am scared, sure, he said, but I have no way to earn anything here.What causes deaths like Balkisuns? Medical journals associate Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome with genetics, infection and nutritional deficiencies. In Nepal, authorities say it could be stress, a changed diet, even homesickness, brought on by physically demanding jobs in extremely hot climates.Utah State University professor Ron Munger studied Thai migrant workers after hundreds died in their sleep in Singapore. He said the Nepali deaths sound like exactly the same thing.While the causes of previous strings of deaths havent been pinpointed, fatalities dropped in each case when workplace safety, housing and diet improved.Cardiac epidemiology researcher Nirmal Aryal at University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand, recently published A Call for Public Health Action in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health about the deaths.

5909e87a7be9e033b96e959d,The arhar solution to pollution,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-pollution-arhar-pulses-demand-supply-gap-burning-of-paddy-4364802/,2016-11-09,"(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The inferno of environmental pollution that the nations capital and its surroundings have been witnessing has many causes, including weather conditions (thermal inversion) that facilitate the settling of particulate matter and other pollution, dust on the streets generated in part from construction activity, and vehicle-related emissions. Particularly critical is the burning of paddy after the kharif harvest which happens every year.Multiple causes will require a broad-based response but one of the permanent solutions to the pollution problem must address paddy burning. This is where pulses come in. In the Subramanian Committee report on pulses that was submitted last month to the ministers of finance, agriculture and consumer affairs, the possibilities created by a new variety of arhar (pigeon pea) developed by K.V. Prabhu and his colleagues at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) were discussed.This variety (Pusa Arhar16) has the potential to be grown in the paddy-growing regions of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and eventually in all of India. Its yield (about 2000 kg/hectare) will be significantly greater than those of the existing varieties and because its size will be uniform, it will be amenable to mechanical harvesting, an attractive feature for farmers in northern India who currently use this technology for paddy.Most important, arhar straw, unlike paddy straw, is green and can be ploughed back into the soil. In paddy straw, the problem is the high silica content, which does not allow for easy decomposition. In the case of arhar, the farmer, even after combine harvesting, just needs to run a rotovator to cut the left-over straw into pieces, which can be ploughed back and will decompose very fast. All this is difficult with left-over paddy stalks that cannot be easily salvaged or ploughed back (it is very firm). Farmers, therefore, choose the easiest option of simply burning it.But replacing paddy with pulses (in over half million hectares or more eventually) will have other social benefits. Our calculations suggest that pulses will use less fertiliser, less water, and fewer emissions, and in addition will replenish the soil with nitrogen unlike paddy which depletes the soil (see table). Together, pulses production would provide social benefits that we estimated at Rs 13,240 per hectare. On this basis, we had suggested an MSP for pulses over the medium term of close to Rs 9,000 per quintal so that it could become competitive with paddy. This would also preserve the incomes of farmers.But, of course, we had understated the social benefits of growing pulses. In the report, we had highlighted that there would be additional benefits: Specifically, the reduced environmental pollution because less paddy would be burnt. But we were unable to quantify these benefits for lack of data. This needs to be rectified immediately to make public and transparent the consequences of current policies.The broader policy lessons outlined in the pulses report have acquired new salience in the light of the pollution problem. These lessons bear emphasis.First, the future of sustainable agriculture must be based on encouraging agricultural science and research especially where Indias scientists have done the hard and creative work. Agricultural research institutions must be free from political interference, must be accorded autonomy, and must reward proven talent.Second, making the fruits of science commercially viable will require price incentives to be re-evaluated. In the case of pulses and paddy, a complicating factor that determines the relative incentives is risk. Because of guaranteed MSPs in paddy, it is less risky to grow than pulses. The Subramanian Committee estimated that pulses production was about six times riskier than paddy production. To compensate this, the required MSP for pulses would have to be about Rs1100 per ton greater than otherwise.Third, pricing in India must increasingly take account of externalities, positive and negative. In the case of agriculture, that means adapting the current methodology of setting MSPs used by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) that focuses exclusively on private costs and benefits. This tends to encourage socially wasteful production and specialisation such as excessive paddy production in north India with all the attendant consequences to which we are grim witnesses. As argued by Professor Ramesh Chand of Niti Aayog and recommended by the Subramanian Committee report, MSP setting must incorporate social costs and benefits.The burning of rice stalks affords an opportunity to implement a major shift in policy that can reduce pollution while also promoting indigenous research and science, incentivising pulses production, and rationalising pricing more broadly. Converting crises into opportunities is the hallmark of good public policy.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5909e8cc7be9e033fa42df33,"US elections still vulnerable to rigging, disruption",http://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-elections-still-vulnerable-to-rigging-disruption-4446223/,2016-12-26,"File Photo: Election lanyards on display (AP Photo/Frank Augstein) File Photo: Election lanyards on display (AP Photo/Frank Augstein)Jill Steins bid to recount votes in Pennsylvania was in trouble even before a federal judge shot it down Dec. 12. Thats because the Green Party candidates effort stood little chance of detecting potential fraud or error in the vote  there was basically nothing to recount.Pennsylvania is one of 11 states where the majority of voters use antiquated machines that store votes electronically, without printed ballots or other paper-based backups that could be used to double-check the balloting. Theres almost no way to know if theyve accurately recorded individual votes  or if anyone tampered with the count.Watch what else is in the newsMore than 80 percent of Pennsylvanians who voted Nov. 8 cast their ballots on such machines, according to VotePA, a nonprofit seeking their replacement. VotePAs Marybeth Kuznik described the proposed recount this way: You go to the computer and you say, OK, computer, you counted this a week-and-a-half ago. Were you right the first time?'These paperless digital voting machines, used by roughly 1 in 5 US voters last month, present one of the most glaring dangers to the security of the rickety, underfunded US election system. Like many electronic voting machines, they are vulnerable to hacking. But other machines typically leave a paper trail that could be manually checked. The paperless digital machines open the door to potential election rigging that might not ever be detected.Their prevalence also magnifies other risks in the election system, simply because error or fraud is harder to catch when vote counts cant be verified. And like other voting machines adopted since the 2000 election, the paperless systems are nearing the end of their useful life  yet there is no comprehensive plan to replace them.If I were going to hack this election, I would go for the paperless machines because they are so hard to check, said Barbara Simons, the co-author of Broken Ballots, a study of flawed U.S. voting technology.Stein described her recount effort as a way to ensure that the 2016 election wasnt tainted by hacking or fraud. Theres no evidence of either so far  a fact federal judge Paul Diamond cited prominently in his decision halting the Pennsylvania recount .Stein pursued similar recounts in Wisconsin and Michigan, to little avail. Those states use more reliable paper-based voting technologies. (The Electoral College certified Donald Trumps presidential victory last week.)But a cadre of computer scientists from major universities backed Steins recounts to underscore the vulnerability of U.S. elections. These researchers have successfully hacked e-voting machines for more than a decade in tests commissioned by New York, California, Ohio and other states.Stein and her witnesses said worries about fraud were justified given U.S. charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential campaign. Emails of top Democrats were hacked and leaked. Over the summer, hackers also tried to breach the voter registration databases of Arizona and Illinois using Russia-based servers, U.S. officials said. Election networks in at least 20 states were probed for vulnerabilities.Its a target-rich environment, said Rice University computer scientist Dan Wallach. Researchers would like to see the U.S. move entirely to computer-scannable paper ballots, because paper cant be hacked.The U.S. voting system  a loosely regulated, locally managed patchwork of more than 3,000 jurisdictions overseen by the states  employs more than two dozen types of machinery from 15 manufacturers. Elections officials across the nation say they take great care to secure their machines from tampering. They are locked away when not in use and sealed to prevent tampering.All of that makes national elections very difficult to steal without getting caught.But difficult is not impossible. Wallach and his colleagues believe a crafty team of pros could strike surgically, focusing on select counties in a few battleground states where a small nudge might be decisive, he said.Most voting machines in the U.S. are at or near the end of their expected lifespans . Forty-three states use machines more than a decade old. Most run on vintage operating systems such as Windows 2000 that pre-date the iPhone and are no longer updated with security patches.On Nov. 8, election officials across the U.S. handled numerous complaints of aging touchscreens losing calibration and casting votes for the wrong candidate.But while many experts agree the U.S. voting system needs an upgrade, no one wants to pay to fix it.Money flowed after the 2000 Florida recount debacle, when punch-card technology was discredited by hanging chads. Congress appropriated $4 billion for election upgrades; states raced to replace punch cards and lever machines with digital technology.But when that money ran out, so did the ability of many states to address security concerns overlooked in their initial rush. Four in 5 U.S. election officials polled by New York Universitys Brennan Center last year said they are desperate to replace equipment but lack the cash.Voters in poorer areas suffer disproportionately, the center found. Data collected in Virginia, Ohio, Minnesota and Colorado suggests the poor are more apt to encounter failing machines.In Virginia, wealthier counties near Washington have upgraded technology while lower-income counties in the states southwest have not been able to afford it, said Edgardo Cortes, the state elections commissioner.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

They had called her rosaappoo amma  the lady beautiful as a rose. They loved her; revered her and worshipped her. They saw her benign smile from everywhere  on everything they had at home that she so benevolently offered. They, in turn, brought her back again and again four times. They had prayed for her when she was jailed and when she was ill, and when the court verdict was expected, and the gods had answered, unable to say no to their bizarre penance and rituals. But this time their prayers went unanswered. They fasted; they circumambulated the shrines and hoped their revered leader would be back home. The gods decided to take her away. They did not see that they, her admirers, were ready to give up their lives for her. They would have gladly consumed themselves in flames in the Tamil tradition of sacrificing oneself for the love of language, or their leader.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa Passes Away After Suffering Cardiac ArrestHer face smiles from the tattoos on their arms, from the rings, their bangles, their pendants they wear like a talisman. Even death cannot separate us from Amma, they say with pride and grief, stretching their tattooed arms. She was their redeemer. Their saviour who had made their lives more comfortable with grinders, mixies, free rice and subsidized food. Who else, but a mother, will have such compassion? Now she was gone. It seemed like a lie. The sense of loss was unbearable.Read | O Panneerselvam take oath as new Tamil Nadu chief ministerThe party men and women knew that hers had been a turbulent life. She had often described it with passion during her election campaign: I stand before you, having come to this point, swimming in the river of fire.They no longer saw her as the once glamour queen of the silver screen. She had transformed to a tough politician, crossing innumerable hurdles placed before her by her rivals and enemies. She carried on her shoulders the entire burden of the party that was rudderless when its founder M G Ramachandran, who was looked upon as demi god, died. It must not have been easy to step into his shoes and be accepted by a party that had its origin in the Dravidian Movement, in which she, a former actress and a Brahmin born in Karnataka, had never participated.But she did, fighting singlehandedly against the crude and cruel sexist politics of Tamil Nadu. The cadres and admirers of MGR believed that she was his chosen heir. Indeed she fitted the bill. She was charismatic; she was articulate and supremely intelligent. The cadres knew her from her days as the propaganda secretary of the party. They loved her and went along with her. They never believed when she was charged with corruption and jailed. They were sure it was a lie foisted by the DMK. Amma was infallible. And as expected, wasnt she absolved by the courts of all the charges?WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaas Life JourneyThe hold that J. Jayalalithaa, Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, held over her partymen and admirers was something of a phenomenon. She was imperious, unapproachable,and inaccessible to her own ministers and yet her firm grip over them was a constant presence invoking fear and awe. She dismissed ministers at will without prior warning or notice. She relieved them of party posts, even suspended some from the party. No explanation was ever given to her actions. There would not even a whimper heard within or outside the party. Her word was law and the leader was supreme.For more than four and a half decades, Tamil Nadu has witnessed the rule of the two dominant regional parties  the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, (DMK), and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra kazhagam (AIADMK). The feud between the two has been of epic dimensions. In combat of the nature of a mythical war, it was imperative that the leader was glorified to abnormal levels to sustain the cadres motivation; the intrinsic connection between political mobilization and the rise of authoritarian leadership was clear. Jayalalithaa could not extricate herself from the web in which she was caught. She realized that the leader had to be projected as an exalted being with rare or superhuman qualities and the followers necessarily were mere mortals, upon whom she showered her grace.She knew that it was a well-tested strategy all over the world. It was more of a necessity for her, having to survive in a male-dominated chauvinistic political arena. Intellectuals ridiculed her welfare schemes, of freebies; she did not care. It was her strategy to win over the masses. It was the path that her mentor MGR had laid. MGR is still remembered as the Good Samaritan. She is called Amma, the universal mother, that emotionally binds people to her.From the day she took oath of office as Chief Minister the first time, way back on July 24, 1991, in the name of God, the Dravidian political culture under the AIADMK changed drastically. Hitherto, atheist Dravidian leaders had always taken the oath in the name of Nature and Conscience. Some of the seniors joining her Cabinet were thereby confused but many followed the leader. After all, she had proved that it was she who was the face of the party after MGR, the charismatic founder of the party.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa Passes Away After Suffering Cardiac ArrestMinisters, new comers, fell at her feet after taking the oath of office  prostrating themselves full-length on the floor, as if before their deity, initiating a cult of leader worship. She must have been amused but did not try to stop them. To have those men at her feet perhaps gave her a sense of personal triumph and gratification. From then on, the party-men went berserk in her praise. They called her the thanga thalaivi, the golden leader, puratchi thalaivi, the revolutionary leader; on her birthdays, party functionaries, whom she fondly called kazhagak kanmanikal, darling party men, tried to outdo one another in showing their esteem and admiration, by organizing celebrations, putting up posters and inserting full page advertisements in the press.The advertiser usually inserted a small photograph of himself along with his name and political standing at the bottom of the picture. It was probably necessary for them to remind her of their existence by parading their photographs to make up for the lack of opportunity to meet her in person.Some posters depicted her as Durga, Meenakshi and various female Hindu goddesses. She was even depicted as the Immaculate Virgin Mary. When there was a protest from the shocked Christian community, she said it was the over enthusiasm of her kazhagak kanmanigal.Yet she was utterly lonely and angry, battered by various court cases filed against her, her wealth frozen, properties sealed; she was even imprisoned twice, convicted and then acquitted; fighting and winning singlehandedly; and she kept her vote bank intact!She always seemed like waging a war against someone  her political enemy Karunanidhi, or the press, intolerant of even the mildest criticism.Even her detractors, however, agree that she was the most charismatic leader that Tamil Nadu has ever seen. Her administrative achievements like the one soon after she came to power  severely dealing with the LTTE insurgency and being instrumental in bringing the ban on the party; and in her second term, giving full freedom to the police to capture the sandalwood brigand Veerappan; monitoring district collectors in the efficient management of the tsunami, fighting for the rights of Tamil Nadu regarding the Cauvery; the thorough homework she did before meeting the officials; the grasp she had over problems facing the state. These were something that unfortunately do not get mentioned.People never got to know her. Or have the courage and grit with which she had to wade through in her 68 years of turbulent life.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

While many consider her demigoddess-like appeal among the masses to be result of her popularity as an actress and a powerful personality, one cannot speak about the peoples affection for Amma without taking account of her populist measures that struck a chord with the poor.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaas Life JourneyIndia is far from being a welfare state, but if there is one region in the country that firmly went ahead with bold welfare measures, then that is the state of Tamil Nadu. Pro-poor schemes were always a part of Tamil Nadu politics, but it received a strong boost by Jayalalithaas policies under the Amma banner. While the late chief minister had been accused of a number of corruption charges, her populist measures including subsidised food, health plans and free laptops, mixers and grinders among many such projects, ensured a solid support among the people of the state; well evident from the fact that she grabbed the chief ministerial post five times.Also read: LIVE: PM Narendra Modi leaves Rajaji Hall in Chennai after paying tribute to JayalalithaaHere are some of the welfare measures initiated by Jayalalithaa.The concept of Amma Canteen went on to acquire immense popularity not just in the state, but all across the country as an ideal example of welfare schemes The concept of Amma Canteen went on to acquire immense popularity not just in the state, but all across the country as an ideal example of welfare schemesAmma Unavagam (Amma Canteen): In 2013, Jayalalithaa announced the setting up of a chain of highly-subsidised restaurants across Tamil Nadu. The concept of Amma Canteen went on to acquire immense popularity not just in the state, but all across the country as an ideal example of welfare schemes. With prices as low as Rs. 5 for a place of Sambar rice and Rs. 3 for a plate of curd rice, Jayalalithaas populist scheme was soon a hit among the poor who could effortlessly eat three meals a day under Rs. 20. Further, the scheme generated employment for a large number of women who were needed for the cooking and cleaning. By 2016, more than 300 such eateries had sprung up all across the state.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa Passes Away After Suffering Cardiac ArrestAmma mineral water: In September 2013, Jayalalithaa launched a water distribution scheme with the aim of making hygienic water available to people at affordable cost. The price fixed at Rs. 10 for a litre is lower than the selling price of the water sold by the Indian railways. Ammas mineral water is made available at all long distance state-owned buses and bus stations.Amma seeds: With an aim to provide high quality, certified seeds to farmers at affordable prices, Jayalalithaa launched the Amma seeds programme in 2014. The project that was executed in January 2016 was allocated a budget of Rs. 5.37 crore. The scheme also encouraged urban citizens to grow vegetables at homes. It involved distribution of kits with required ingredients for vegetable farming at home.Amma cement: In the wake of a possibility of price rise of building materials, the late chief minister had announced the sale of subsidised cement. The scheme would involve the state government buying two lakh tonnes of cement from private manufacturers every month and selling them for a much lower price of Rs. 190 for a 50-kg bag.Healthcare initiatives: Expanding her welfare benefit schemes to the health sector, Amma launched a number of healthcare projects. Foremost among them was the master health check-up scheme that involved a number of medical tests like blood, urine, cholesterol screening among many others for a very low rate. She also initiated a health plan which made available several medical facilities free of cost.Free laptops to students: In 2011, Jayalalithaa initiated a flagship project aimed at better educational opportunities to school and college going students. She announced the distribution of free laptops to students across the state who have acquired a certain percentage in school and college examinations. The laptop distribution scheme was planned with the motive of encouraging digital education among students from a very early stage.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Source: File Photo) BJP seems to take all its vote from West Bengal districts. (Source: File Photo)THE COLOUR is changing in Dhenua, a village in Bardhaman district, West Bengals rice bowl. As acres of green paddy slowly ripens to gold with the onset of winter, the political mood, having changed from red to green in May this year, is slowly tilting towards saffron, it appears. Dhenua, along with more than 150 villages, will go to the polls on Saturday in Monteswar assembly constituency, necessitated by the death of the local MLA, Trinamool Congresss Sajal Panja.Dhenua, now with 4,600 voters, has been unwaveringly loyal to the CPI(M) for over 40 years. Even when the Red Bastion that was Bardhaman started turning green with rapid inroads by the TMC, and Mamata Banerjee swept the district in 2011, Dhenua stood ground. When Monteswar finally fell in May 2016, after a fierce battle, Dhenua remained unbending, having thrown its weight behind three-time CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, who lost to Panja by 706 votes.But thats changing.Watch what else is making newsWe have been hearing about the Prime Ministers plans to curtail black money, and to bring it back. We are happy. We dont care whether we directly benefit from this  we are just happy that moneylenders who have been oppressing us for years, and have been stashing cash, may finally be served justice, said Shanti Majhi, 50. This is our revenge  we are very happy that they (moneylenders) will now be very unhappy.Monteswor has a Muslim population of 43 per cent  there are 900 Muslim votes in Dhenua alone  but that is hardly bothering Biswajeet Poddar, 42, the BJP candidate. This vote will be split between CPI(M) and TMC. We dont expect to change the government with just one or two elections. But people are increasingly turning towards us. With the scrapping of notes, the votes are now ours, he said. Voters have been coming up to me and saying that I dont need to campaign; that they will vote for the BJP because of Narendra Modi, because of what he has done.About the issue of demonetisation, Poddar said, No one is against the decision in this constituency. Many shopkeepers are still accepting Rs 500 notes. There is no problem. Local TMC supporters said that the by-election is of huge significance to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee: it is the first election since the Supreme Courts Singur verdict went in her favour, the first since TMC was registered as a national party, and the first since the demonetisation decision that Mamata has hit out against, seeking its revocation.The by-election is seen by many as a precursor to the state panchayat polls in 2018, and the 2019 General Election.We are facing off with the Trinamool but in my mind the greater rival for us in both the state and the country is the BJP. They have polarised the country in way that we thought was not possible, said former CPI(M) MLA Chaudhry Mohammad Hidaitullah, managing the partys campaign for the bypolls.On the eve of the bypolls, the lines outside banks remained long almost through the day, and ATMs had signs of No Cash, but workers of all three main parties maintained that the inconveniences have not reached alarming proportions. Demonitisation has not affected anyone in this village. How can it? We never used Rs 500 or Rs 1000 notes anyway.

A Santhali tribal, Nandi lived with his family in remote Rahatpur village of Bardhaman district.Villagers said Nandi had been anxious about being unable to pay the labour he had hired to till the field he had rented. He had around Rs 20,000 in an account in the local Samavay Krishi Unnayan Samiti or SKUS. These Samitis are local branches of cooperative banks.He was always very sensitive. His labourers had been taunting him for days. Short of money himself, Nandi couldnt take the abuse anymore, said a villager.Since most famers do not have bank accounts, they deposit their savings in these SUKS branches. Nandi had a certain amount in SKUS but after the directive that no money transactions will take place in cooperative banks, Nandis money was stuck, said Swapan Debnath, who visited the Nandi home in the evening.Nandi is survived by his wife Sundari and son Nirmal.

Its the farmers who have been hit the most. Nandi was just one such case. Because of this government directive, their cash is stuck and this is harvesting season. Most farmers withdraw their cash in this season and deposit it back after selling their product, before the next season of sowing, Debnath said.Forget the farmers.

(David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)The nations homeless are proving to be especially susceptible to a new, dirt-cheap version of synthetic marijuana, which leaves users glassy-eyed, aimless, sprawled on streets and sidewalks oblivious to their surroundings or wandering into traffic.Nearly 300 homeless people became ill last month in St. Louis due to the man-made hallucinogen that experts believe is far more dangerous and unpredictable than the real thing. Other outbreaks have occurred in New York City, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.Watch what else is in the newsIt was common for us to see reactions where they were violent, incoherent, sometimes catatonic on the ground, Austin police Lt. Kurt Thomas said.The homeless are easy targets in a confined area, experts say. The drug is cheap  as little as $1 or $2 for a joint  more difficult to detect in drug tests and is a fast escape from a harsh reality.Things got so bad in St. Louis last month that the regions largest provider of homeless services urged people to stop giving the homeless handouts, because they were worried the money would be used to buy the drug.The Rev. Larry Rice saw the odd behaviors from several homeless people in the streets outside his New Life Evangelistic Center shelter in downtown St. Louis.They told me, You get so low, you get such a sense of hopelessness. Somebody wants to sell this for a dollar and you take it,' Rice said. People are desperate out there.Synthetic marijuana has been around since the late 2000s, packaged under names like K2, Darkness and Mr. Happy. The Drug Enforcement Administration says it is usually a mixture of herbs and spices sprayed with a synthetic compound chemically similar to THC, the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. It is typically manufactured in China and sold in places like head shops, but its also on the street and over the internet.State legislatures have outlawed it based on its chemical makeup, but the makers tweak the formula enough that it escapes the provisions of the law. So far in St. Louis, only one charge has been filed  a homeless man accused of selling to others on the street.You factor in some of the despair or difficult circumstances that these folks are going through, and they often fall prey to the suppliers offering an outlet to deal with their unfortunate situation, Thomas said.The medical dangers are real with synthetic marijuana, which can be up to 100 times more potent than real marijuana, said Dr. Anthony Scalzo, director of toxicology for the Saint Louis University School of Medicine.Users often experience rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, anxiety and hallucinations, he said.Research published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that 20 deaths from August 2011 through April 2015 were blamed on synthetic marijuana, though that doesnt account for overdose deaths of undetermined or multiple causes. Scalzo said those who survive can suffer permanent kidney failure and brain damage.We have no idea how the body is going to react to the next wave of chemicals, Scalzo said. Its like Russian roulette. You just dont know what youre getting.During one outbreak in Brooklyn in July, 130 people were hospitalized. Witnesses said many of users were shaking or leaning aimlessly against trees and fire hydrants.In emergency room interviews, users said they would prefer to smoke real marijuana but took the synthetic drug to avoid detection in urine tests typically mandated for probation and parole issues and other reasons, according to Michelle Nolan of the New York City Health Department.For individuals still using a psychoactive substance, this afforded them, criminally speaking, fewer risks, Nolan said.The Skid Row area of downtown Los Angeles saw the scourge over a few days in August, when 36 people were treated for overdoses. Some had seizures, others staggered through traffic or collapsed on curbs.Around 150 homeless people have overdosed on synthetic marijuana since August in Austin, and one death was blamed on the drug, Thomas said. Police and homeless advocates in Austin are warning those on the street to avoid the temptation to use, but know its an uphill battle.Being realistic, were always going to have a group of folks who are willing to engage in self-destructive behavior, Thomas said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP Photo/File) In this December 9, 2016, file photo, Thai navy officers check the crew of a fishing boat in the waters off the coast of Samut Sakhon, Thailand. (Source: AP Photo/File)The six men lay in red body bags, lined up on a concrete dock. The first died almost three weeks before his ship reached Thailand; the last almost made it alive but died the day before the ship docked. They were Thai and Cambodian fishermen who had succumbed to beriberi, a disease better known for striking sailors more than a century ago. But their deaths, says a Greenpeace report released Thursday, are part of an all-too modern scourge _ Thai fishing fleets operating thousands of kilometers (miles) from home in unregulated waters to dodge government oversight over illegal fishing and onboard human rights abuses. Thailand has responded to problems in the industry by grounding its overseas fleet and ordering tracking equipment installed on the vessels.Watch What Else Is Making News:The two ships carrying the dead had left Thailand in the first few months of 2015, according to an earlier Thai government report. They parked themselves off the coast of Madagascar, where they stayed for months. They transferred their catch to reefers, refrigerated cargo ships, to avoid government regulators while still getting their fish to market. Supply ships brought the fishermen fresh food once every couple of months. But they didnt come often enough. An inspection found there was no fresh food, Thai government investigators concluded after searching one ship, the Somboon 19. The rest of the kitchen had eggs, vegetable oil, and white rice. No fresh vegetables or meat.The ships ran out of fresh food weeks after each delivery, forcing the crew to subsist on fish and rice _ a diet deficient in Vitamin B, the root cause of beriberi. Many began to fall ill. Subject to hours of backbreaking labor, some of the fishermen began finding it hard to breathe. Their legs swelled and their bodies went limp.Though one ship returned to Thailand as soon as a fisherman died, the second one dumped the body in the freezer of the cargo hold and kept fishing, only returning when the navy called them home, said Cmdr. Piyanan Kaewmanee, head of a Thai navy department combating illegal fishing. It was gross, he told The Associated Press in a recent interview. The arrival of the bodies on Thai shores in January 2016 kicked up a media frenzy. Newspapers reported the fishermen had died from vitamin deficiencies.The story of how these vessels ended up so far from home in the first place starts with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. For decades, Thai vessels fished in their waters, splitting profits in exchange for fishing licenses. But following an AP report last year revealing that Thai fishing boats enslaved migrants from Myanmar, Cambodia and other neighboring countries, Indonesia shut off their waters to fishing vessels from foreign countries. Papua New Guinea followed suit soon after. Deprived of their usual hunting ground, the boats set sail for seas far from the prying eyes of governments.Some of these problems weve seen in Indonesia  are just being exported and happening somewhere else, says Mark Dia, an oceans activist and manager at Greenpeace. Nobody really knows what happens on these vessels. The Greenpeace report names some of the worst fishing boat operators, who they say send fish into the supply chain of major retailers of imitation crab and cat food. The AP has not independently verified those claims.Greenpeace said satellite data it obtained tracked the ships as they moved toward the Saya de Malha Bank, an ecologically rich breeding ground for whales that Mauritius claims is part of its exclusive economic zone. However, its effectively unregulated, officials and experts say. To send a patrol boat to inspect them at sea is hugely expensive, Cmdr. Piyanan said. If its not urgent, its a rarity that wed send a patrol boat. After Thailand received a yellow card from the European Union in April 2015, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha created the Command Center for Combating Illegal Fishing.In December 2015, the Thai navy sent a task force to inspect 74 Thai overseas fishing vessels to enforce new permit regulations. A navy report recorded dozens of vessels that had violated labor permits and overstayed their licenses, prompting them to recall their entire overseas fishing fleet back to Thailand. After these abuses were uncovered, the Thai navy grounded the overseas fleet and prosecuted some of the operators. Seventy of the vessels are now docked in a port an hour away from Bangkok and are being outfitted with new GPS tracking equipment; they will be allowed to sail again next year.Navy officials say they are exploring cheaper alternatives to regular in-person inspections, including hiring observers, installing on-board cameras and seeking assistance from countries such as Somalia, Djibouti, and Madagascar.

Greenpeace says more needed to be done, particularly a industry ban on transshipments, the practice of using reefers as intermediaries. Cmdr.

Posing as Dr Anand, Syed Haneef Shanu posted messages on social networking sites promising to pay up to Rs 50 lakhs to kidney donors. When anyone contacted the mobile number he provided, Shanu used to ask that person to deposit Rs 10,000 first as a fee in a bank account. Once the fee was deposited in his account, Shanu would switch off the mobile or stop responding to phone calls from the victims. He is suspected to have cheated several persons in this manner.On November 24, Gandla Surender, a tractor mechanic, lodged a complaint at Mahabubnagar I Town police station stating that his 22-year-old son G Kiran Kumar was missing from that morning after he went out of house saying he was going to the barbers shop. Kiran, who was doing a computer course in Hyderabad and was staying with some friends, had gone home the previous week.Police formed a special team to trace Kiran, scrutinized his mobile phone data records and interviewed his friends. Cops got the first clue from a female friend of Kiran. Working on the information they got, the Mahabubnagar police team suspected that Kiran got trapped in an online kidney sale fraud and traced out Syed Haneef Shanu who was behind the posts on Facebook. On November 28, Shanu was arrested from his house in Guntakal town, and also traced Kiran Kumar.Mahabubnagar Superintendent of Police Rema Rajeshwari said that Shanu was operating under the pseudonym of Dr Anand from Vizag and posted messages on various websites offering huge amounts of money to kidney donors. Syed Hanif Shanu, hailing from Guntakal, worked as a security supervisor in Bellary where he met a person named Kumnari Busappa, a security guard who also hailed from Guntakal. Taking advantage of their friendship Shanu took Busappas identity cards and kept with him which Busappa forgot to collect when he left the job and returned to Guntakal. Shanu also left the job later and returned to Guntakal where he opened an account in Axis Bank in the name of Kumnari Busappa using his identity cards as proof. Then he started posting message online offering money to kidney donors. If anyone contacted him he would ask them to deposit Rs 10,000 as fee in the account he opened in the name of Busappa.Police said that five months ago Kiran found a job in Hyderabad at a call centre but the salary was very low and he as struggling to meet his expenses. While browsing, he saw the message posted by Syed Haneef Shanu and left a message that he was willing to sell his kidney as he was in dire need of money. On August 20, Shanu contacted Kiran on his mobile number posing as Dr Anand, a kidney surgeon living in Vizag and offered Rs 50 lakhs if he donated his kidney. He asked him to deposit Rs 10,000 initially and gave an account number of Axis banks branch at Guntakal. Kiran mortagaged his gold chain at a private firm and withdrew Rs 10,000 which he informed his friends was needed to join a skill development training course at Vizag. He deposited the Rs 10,000 in Shanus account who promptly went incommunicado. Realising that he fell into a trap, Kiran went into a depression and tried to commit suicide by consuming a detergent liquid but was saved by his friends who took him to his house in Mahbubnagar on November 23.The next morning, Kiran decided to go to Guntakal to search for Shanu and left home.

Both common man and farmers were forced to stand in long queues. Farmers are not having money to purchase fertilizers and seeds, Madhya Pradesh Congress President Arun Yadav told PTI.People are highly annoyed with the decision and I am sure that they will vote against the BJP on the issue, Yadav said.They are already facing a lot of problems because of lack of development and tall claims of the government that people are getting 247 power supply in the state.

All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts.In her insightful study of the working of agricultural markets in West Bengal, British development studies scholar Barbara Harris-White has documented in detail how trade in farm produce is controlled through a web of rural and semi-urban agro commercial enterprises.These enterprises  whom she broadly categorises as rural commercial capital  enjoy privileged access to formal credit networks. The monies borrowed from banks and other financial institutions they use for on-lending to farmers against future deliveries of produce. They also control the functioning of agriculture produce market committees  which oversee the operations of regulated mandis  through cornering of trading licenses and restricting new entrants. Further, they ensure all official procurement of wheat and rice undertaken by the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies is channelised through them, thereby guaranteeing both assured business and almost complete elimination of market risk. Through these economic means, apart from ability to court political patronage, rural commercial capital has managed to squeeze out all potential competition in agricultural produce markets, including from petty traders who can never achieve the same size and volume.Watch What Else is Making NewsWhile Harris-Whites work, based on field studies stretching over a decade, has focused on West Bengal, its findings characterise the behaviour of rural commercial capital in other parts of the country as well. Moreover, they continue to hold good even a decade after being published in the form of a book (Rural Commercial Capital: Agricultural Markets in West Bengal, Oxford University Press 2008). Only around 60 per cent of farm households in India today have access to institutional finance. Even among this 60 per cent, a majority has to supplement bank loans with borrowings from moneylenders and other informal sources. The numbers are worse for small and marginal farmers, where barely 15 per cent can even obtain loans from banks, leaving them almost entirely at the mercy of rural commercial capital.Moreover  and this is important  practically 100 per cent of transactions between farmers and rural commercial capital are conducted in cash. The surpluses, which the latter generates in the form of interest on advances and profits on trading of produce, are also retained in cash for further recycling. Needless to add, most of this income is outside the tax net. The resultant liquidity also provides the basis for the enormous reach and power that rural commercial capital enjoys.The above source of power is what has also today become the cause of its nightmare, following the Narendra Modi governments decision to de-monetise high-denomination currency notes. In one fell swoop, the move has left rural commercial capital exposed and vulnerable. While this entrenched lobby has endured many policy shocks in the past, whether it would survive this blow, however, remains to be seen.As of now, the de-monetisation decision has had three broad impacts in agricultural markets across the country. The first is a drastic fall in mandi arrivals. Farmers, having just finished harvesting their first decent crop in over two years, are facing traders who are asking them to postpone deliveries. Even when they are willing to supply on credit and settling payments later  following an old tradition of trust and faith  traders are unwilling to hold inventories in an atmosphere of uncertainty. There is genuine fear today that the Modi government will follow up on its agenda of unearthing black money through a further tightening of the noose. Old timers say that such fear wasnt experienced by the trading community even during the Emergency  which says a lot.Secondly, cash lending has suddenly dried up, which is proving to be more troublesome for farmers than even postponed sales of produce. The reason for it is that the rabi season sowing operations have just commenced. This is the time when all sorts of expenses on seed, fertiliser, labour, etc. have to be incurred. Replacement of the de-monetised currency with new notes would be much slower in the hinterlands than in urban centres. As a result, banks cannot disburse cash loans for seasonal agricultural operations under the Kisan Credit Card window. And with the enormous cash hoards with rural commercial capital ceasing to be legal tender, there is no finance available to farmers even from this informal ATM (any time money) source.Thirdly, even if farmers are in a position to deliver produce in some mandis, further transportation of it has all but come to a halt. The fragmented nature of Indias transport networks means that most trucks, especially medium and small loaders ferrying fresh produce, are individually owned. They again deal exclusively in cash and are simply unwilling now to transport produce in the absence of access to working capital, whether from institutions or the trade. The result is a severe disruption of daily fruits and vegetables produce flows to major markets like Azadpur in Delhi and Vashi in Mumbai.Even as rural commercial capital copes with perhaps its worst existential crisis in recent memory, the current situation offers a unique opportunity for at least cleaning up the countrys agricultural credit market and linking millions of its farm households to institutional finance. The groundwork for it has already been laid with the campaign to open Jan Dhan bank accounts. All that is now required is for the states to link land records to these accounts. By enabling assessment of the credit requirements of each holding, it will allow the eligible loan amounts to be transferred directly to the account holders. The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development could probably lead the way here. It should launch a mission to universalise access to farm loans, by focusing particularly on smallholders who are the most deprived of this facility.While all this may not be possible immediately and requires careful planning for proper execution, the target should be to go for a full roll-out during the next kharif season. This step can go a long away in breaking the stranglehold of rural commercial capital, which has thrived by tethering farmers to a vicious cycle of tied credit and captive marketing of their produce. It would also put Indias agriculture economy on the path of sustainable growth and prosperity.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

I dont think it has really impacted, he said.However, farmers organisations as well as former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar have expressed deep concern about impact of demonetisation, saying farmers are unable to buy quality seeds and fertilisers for their rabi crop and are also facing problems in selling crops for want of demand.Despite record kharif production this year and expected good crop in the rabi season, farmers conditions continue to be grim due to lower sales realisation, with domestic and global commodity prices staying depressed.The demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes has also affected the domestic demand of fruits and vegetables, forcing farmers to sell their produce at throwaway price.About farmers woes, agri-economist Ashok Gulati said: This year, production is likely to bounce back and therefore, much better than last year. However, farmers are already under debt. And prices of cotton, basmati rice and, with demonetisation, many fresh fruits and vegetables are depressed. Because of that, despite higher production levels, farmers have not gained much.2016 began on a sticky note as the countrys overall foodgrain output remained flat at 252 mt in 2015-16 crop year due to second straight year of drought.Pulse output fell to 16.5 mt resulting in high prices for most part of the year that kept the government on its toes, which took various steps to cool prices and bring relief to consumers.The measures like domestic procurement and import to boost local supplies helped ease the prices of tur and urad from about Rs 200 a kg, but chana continues to rule high.As per the official estimate, wheat output rose to 93.55 mt, from 86 mt, but FCIs procurement fell sharply and domestic prices of wheat and its products began to rise towards the end of the year. The government scrapped import duties on wheat to boost domestic supply.To provide relief to farmers hit by the cash crunch, the government has given them an additional two months to repay their crop loans due in November-December and said prompt repayment will be eligible for the extra 3 per cent interest subsidy.The government had earlier allowed farmers to buy seeds through old Rs 500 notes from central and state-owned seed companies as well as from ICAR and central varsities. It had also asked fertiliser companies to sell soil nutrient on credit basis to farmers.To check food inflation, import duties on palm oils and potatoes were reduced. Stock limit on sugar mills were also imposed to check prices although improved domestic rates helped industry clear arrears to farmers.The year also saw the successful rollout of the landmark National Food Security Act (NFSA) across the country. Programmes like new crop insurance scheme and eNAM to link all 585 mandis on an electronic trading platform were announced to augment farmers income.In this years budget, the government raised agri-credit by Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 9 lakh crore for the current fiscal and levied 0.5 per cent Krishi Kalyan cess on all taxable services to fund farm initiatives.Eminent scientist M S Swaminathan hailed the new schemes, but stressed on proper implementation. He also wanted the government to pay farmers 50 per cent more than the production cost as part of the minimum support price (MSP).Expressing concern over poor implementation of agri schemes, Gulati, the former chairman of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, said: The government should focus completely on agriculture and try to implement some of the programmes properly.The year also witnessed the government fixing the maximum retail price and royalty for cotton seeds, including Bt cotton, based on its order issued at the fag end of 2015.The move was opposed by biotechnology firms while the domestic seed manufacturers were in favour of the decision. Global biotechnology major Monsanto threatened to re-evaluate its India business. It plans to introduce new products, besides entering into the legal battle against this order.However, NCP supremo Pawar recently attacked the NDA government for taking such a move, saying Indian agriculture is being brought back to licence and control raj which is detrimental to the growth of the sector.The government of the day should not have hostility to improve systems and technologies, he said, adding that the government is overly cautious on the technology front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Screengrab of the website of kashmirreader.com)The Jammu & Kashmir Police has registered a case against a journalist of banned newspaper Kashmir Reader for a September 28 report on crop-burning, in which villagers were quoted as blaming government forces for the alleged arson.A case under Section 505, pertaining to publication or circulation of statements of conducing public mischief, has been registered against Ishfaq Reshi, who was a trainee reporter with Kashmir Reader, which was banned by the J&K government on October 2.Watch What Else Is making NewsReshi is a student of convergent journalism at Central University of Kashmir and has been associated with the paper since April 2016.Reshi was presented before a Munsif court in Magam on Friday and directed to apply for bail from the sessions court in Budgam. I was in police detention during the day (on Friday) and allowed to go home in the evening, Reshi said. There were allegations from villagers. I had gone on the ground to verify the facts and reported the same.The report had appeared in the newspaper as a front-page banner, along with three photographs, and quoted residents of Budran, Aadina, Kanihama and Mazhama villages in Budgam district as saying that police, paramilitary troopers and soldiers (had) fired incendiary projectiles into the harvested rice crop that had been left to dry in sun.In a statement on September 30 rebutting the story, the J&K Police Media Centre had said the incident has been maliciously linked with forces. Some anti-social elements set on fire two haycocks at village Adina, Magam. On the receipt of the complaint, police took cognizance and lodged an FIR no. 159/16 in police station Magam and investigation has been taken up.The Sub-divisional Police Officer, Magam, Syed Fayaz Ahmad told The Sunday Express that Reshi had circulated a fake news regarding the incident. It was a normal case of burning for which he had blamed the forces. We produced him before the Munsif court on Friday. He was not under arrest, SDPO Ahmad said.Questioning the case against Reshi, Mir Hilal, Editor of Kashmir Reader, said, The story in question is similar to what others reported. If there are similar stories in other publications too that were also rebutted by police, why is there an FIR only against this story? They did not send any rebuttal to us and the statement issued two days later did not specifically mention our paper.Two days after the police statement, Kashmir Reader had been banned by the state government. Srinagar District Magistrate Srinagar Farooq Ahmad Lone had asked the English daily to stop its publication forthwith till further orders so that disturbance of public tranquility is prevented.The paper continues to remain banned.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Kavitha, with a child in her lap, says her son protests at the stinky rice she has been forced to serve him.Kavitha, 28WHAT exactly was the reason for this (demonetisation)? Kavitha asks.Its 9 am and she has just seen off her mechanic husband, who left to find work, and her 8-year-old son who threw a tantrum again over being served stinky rice.The 28-year-old of Nelvay village in Kancheepuram district, about 80 km from Chennai city, used to work in a battery company, but gave it up after she got pregnant. She does odd jobs working in the fields now, and there has been no work for the past few days.Showing the rice they get from ration shops under the Amma Free Rice Scheme, Kavitha says, I had to force my son Lageswaran to eat it. It stinks. We can bear it but the children dont want to eat it. He has been fighting with me. With no money, she cant buy the rice available at Rs 45-55 per kg in the private shops.Under the Amma scheme, the families get 12 to 20 kg of rice per family, depending on the number of members.We have rice left for three more days, no shops give us credit. We will starve if there is no job in the coming days, Kavitha adds.Before the demonetisation announcement took Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes out of the market, Kavitha, like the 300-odd farm workers of the village, earned Rs 200-Rs 400 a day clearing fields of weeds, and plucking and transplanting paddy seedlings. Even in the months farm work was not available, there were other jobs to do. We would go for small construction jobs or work as daily wage labourers in some local industries. But none of them has work now, she says.Kavitha has an account though husband Sriraman, 32, doesnt. But the family hardly uses it as the nearest bank branch or ATM is in Tirukalukundram, about 10 km away. Even the nearest bus stop is a 4-km walk.Sriraman stood in the queue for a whole day to withdraw money from Kavithas account. They got one Rs 2,000 note. We cant use it in any of the shops, Kavitha says.Muniyamma, 60The sight of a visitor sends the 60-year-old muttering in anger. Mistaking him for a taluk official, she says, Had I been educated, I would have questioned all this. Who gave him the right to do all this? Does he know there are creatures like us in this world? By him she means Prime Minister Narendra Modi, she adds, now chuckling. Who else?Its 11 am, and Muniyamma is sitting on the ground outside her thatched hut.Unlike Kavitha, Muniyamma doesnt have a bank account. She lives with her daughter Karnagi, 31, a single mother of two girls, who works at a nearby creche for a monthly salary of Rs 5,000.The day the demonetisation announcement came, Muniyamma had Rs 30 with her. The family has no television, and no one in the village has a computer. Muniyamma says she came to know of the scrapping of currency when she went to the farm where she works the next day.She was not bothered initially, she admits. I thought why should I bother. I havent even seen Rs 500, Rs 1,000 notes in the recent past.However, by November 10, the reality sunk in. On November 9, I got wages for my work. But that was the last day I got paid.On November 11, the farm owner told the workers he couldnt pay them in cash. We worked for food that day. The next day too, Muniyamma says.But then that too ended.With the children away at school and Karnagi at work, Muniyamma is sorting around 1 kg of low-quality black gram. That is among the few food items still left in the house, along with a kilogram of the Amma Scheme rice. The bag of rice, Muniyamma shows, is crawling with insects.Muniyamma has promised her granddaughters Kavinila, 7, and Loginila, 8, that instead of the rice, she would make them idli or dosa the next day from the gram.Even before the demonetisation announcement, paddy transplantation in Nelvay had been hit by lack of rains. Last week, DMK leader M K Stalin asked the Centre to declare Tamil Nadu drought-hit.Seedlings sprout only when rain comes, Muniyamma notes. Pointing to a paddy field, she tells the visitor that the problem would spread to cities too. Already paddy transplantation is delayed. Those who did seedling transplantation in October have no money to buy fertilisers now. If there is no rice transplantation, what will you eat?Jayaraman, 42Around mid-day, villagers who have returned from a visit to the bank are gathered around talking. Those who left early morning were the only ones able to withdraw cash.Jayaraman made his second trip to the bank, this time to deposit Rs 5,000. The first time he had stood in the queue till afternoon to exchange his currency, and finally when his turn came up, the bank said it was over.When he came to know of the demonetisation announcement, also on November 9 afternoon, Jayaraman had only the Rs 5,000 at home, all in Rs 500 denomination. The cash was for the daily expenses, the bus charge for my two children, which comes to around Rs 70 a day, and another Rs 50-Rs 100 for medicines a day. The bank officials said I will get only Rs 2,000 as exchange for old notes. What do I do other than depositing it in my account then? Will the local shop owner accept Rs 2,000? Will the bank manager come and pay the doctor if my son develops fever again? he asks.A seasonal farm worker who does odd construction jobs, Jayaraman talks about a young mother carrying two children who collapsed while standing in a queue at the Tirukalukundram Canara Bank branch earlier that day. We rushed her to the hospital; she is stable now. But there was nobody to look after the children, he says.Money is desperately needed, Jayaraman adds. It is already November third week, and there is no rain yet. Those who have wells could do cultivation even if there was no rain, but the cash crunch has stopped that too. There is no money to buy diesel for the generator pump sets The rice in my house will last only a few more days.N Raj, 50Around 3 pm, N Raj returns disappointed from tourist town Mahabalipuram, located around 20 km away. Also a farm worker-cum-construction labourer, he went there for work but couldnt find any. He had been to three employers in the last two weeks without success, N Raj adds. One had no currency to buy diesel for the pumpset, another had no currency to buy fertilisers, and I refused to work at the third place as he offered food instead of cash, he says, asking who will feed his family if he works for food alone.On November 15, he had been able to get Rs 2,000 from the bank, but struggled to get change for it. Raj says the government-run liquor shop too told him he would have to buy liquor first. So I bought half a bottle of rum. Thats how we get change now, Raj smiles.Apologising that he cant offer either tea or snacks as he has none at home, he puts on his TV and surfs till he reaches a Tamil news channel. It is running a programme on demonetisation and is showing Modi on his Japan visit, with visuals of him playing a flute.His eyes still on the screen, Raj says, We are watching you on TV, but you wouldnt.Then, he asks, What is a surgical strike?Its 4.30 pm, and Muniyammas daughter Karnagi has just reached home with her daughters. Muniyamma sets aside the rice she is sorting and gives them black tea with salted raw mango slices. The girls gulp the food down quickly, and run to the swings made of saris on a tree nearby.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Asad Rehman Prince, now 15; his biggest worry is that their decrepit house (below) might collapse. Asad RehmanJUST a little over seven years ago, the Supreme Court ordered the Centre and states to ensure capping of all borewells so that these dont become death traps for children. This October, six-year-old Komal Meena of Alwar in Rajasthan became the latest child to die from a fall in one, after efforts to save her for eight days, in perhaps the longest such rescue operation. He doesnt keep track of such news developments, admits Prince. The child whose rescue from a borewell changed TV news in India also tries to think as little as he can of that July day, 10 years ago.However, there is one detail that always haunts the now 15-year-old, one that the Supreme Court underlined and one that could have saved Komal. Its because things arent done properly that such incidents happen, he says. Main jab gira tab bhi borewell ke upar khaali bori rakhi thi. Main choohe ko pakad raha tha, aur bori pe ja pahuncha, aur gir gaya (When I fell too, the hole was covered with just a jute sack. I was chasing a mouse, and ended up on the sack and fell in the borewell).The fame he earned after his 48-hour, live-TV ordeal in the 60-ft-deep borewell has long worn off, barring some vestiges, such as the private school he now goes to unlike other children in his village, Haldheri, in Kurukshetra, Haryana. Since the school is 4 km from the village, Prince, a Class 9 student, wakes up at 6.30 am to be ready in time for the school van, which makes its way down the kuchcha roads to his village just to pick him up.Princes father Ram Chandra is a daily wager, earning Rs 300 a day working in farms. Various NGOs and news channels announced monetary aid for Prince after the incident. He says the family received only Rs 3 lakh, most of which was spent making their home pucca, while the rest of the money never came.The villagers allege Princes mother ran away with some of the money when she left him and his father four years ago. However, Prince doesnt believe this, saying the money was stolen by middlemen, rather the adhikaaris (officials) who control the system.He doesnt want to dwell on his mother, he adds. Ab to yaad nahin aati hai. Pehle main sochta tha uske bare mein, gaaon mein log baatein banaate rehte hain uske bare mein, ki woh kisi aur aadmi ke saath bhaag gayi. Main to ab usko bhool gaya hoon (I dont miss her anymore. Earlier I used to think about her, people in the village gossip about her, that she eloped with some other man. I have forgotten about her now).Princes stepmother Mamata, sitting on a broken plastic chair held together with electric wires, says they are hopeful of him finishing his studies and getting a job. Picking out stones from the rice she will be cooking for dinner for the family of five (including Princes stepbrothers), she says, Bas ek hi ummeed hai, yeh padh le, iski naukri lag jaaye, toh humara kuch bhalaa hoga. Aise to hum paanch logon ka parivar hai, aur roz ki aamdani 250-300 rupaiye hai (We have only one hope, that Prince finishes his education, gets a job. We are a family of five and earn only Rs 250-300 daily). The earnings depend on the contractor.Princes father Ram Chandra also tells him education is very important. If he himself hadnt been illiterate, he would have gone to court to get what was promised to the family after the borewell incident, Ram Chandra says. Humein aath lakh bola gaya tha, par mila sirf teen lakh hi (We were promised Rs 8 lakh, but we got only Rs 3 lakh). Its difficult to even make ends meet.Looking at the trophies he received after his rescue, now lined up along the cracking walls of their house, Prince smiles ironically, What use are these, if one doesnt even have a home? He worries about the decrepit walls all the time, adds the 15-year-old. The house can collapse any time.The last hope that remains is the Army. Prince says he was promised a job in the forces once he turns 18. Fauj mein naukri karna chahta hoon, desh ki raksha karoonga (I want to join the Army, fight for the country). He hopes a job for him would also mean that his father can take the occasional day off from work.However, Prince fears that he may not be able to cope with school for too long. Sabhi bachche kaafi paise se mazboot hain wahaan (All the children there are very rich). People tell him he is brave, having survived those 48 hours. He smiles at the thought. Besides the sack that gave away and the fall, there is one other thing Prince remembers about the borewell: the cockroaches, which kept crawling up to him. I was so small. Mitti daal kar unko chupaa de raha tha (I kept covering them with mud).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A resident of Electric Veng area here lodged an FIR on April 21 alleging around eight gun-totting soldiers waylaid his car on the southern outskirts of the capital last December and decamped with 52 gold bars worth Rs 14.5 crore which he smuggled from Mizoram-Myanmar border.The complainant claimed he did not file the FIR earlier as the soldiers, belonging to Assam Rifles, threatened him of dire consequences if he approached police. In the investigation, the eight Assam Rifles personnel reportedly told the interrogators that the dacoity was committed on the orders of the then battalion commandant and they submitted the gold bars to him at his official residence in Aizawl.At least 14 people, including the officer, an Aizawl-based non-tribal businessman and a former student leader were arrested in this connection along with a Naik Subedar, four Havildars and three jawans of Assam Rifles.The officer denied the charges and said he was at Silchar when the dacoity took place and claimed gun runners smuggling weapons from Myanmar were behind the heist.

The Congress party was in power at the time and if the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had listened to the advice of Chavan, her cabinet colleague, on demonetisation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not have been compelled to take the note ban decision, Javadekar said at a function at the Dombivili Gymkhana here last night.Chavan was firm on demonetisation but no one in the government was ready to take his advice on it. His disciples should at least understand his teachings today, he said, in a veiled dig at NCP supremo Sharad Pawar.Pawar has slammed Modi for dragging Indira Gandhi into demonetisation debate by saying that the then Prime Minister virtually rejected Chavans proposal in that direction. Javadekar said black money and corruption had become cancerous to the society and to get out of its grip there was a need for a firm decision, which was taken by Modi.For the last 70 years people have been standing in queues for procuring rice and kerosene but now for some time they are required to stand in queues for the betterment of the nation, he said, adding that most people have welcomed the decision.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo by Rajesh Stephan)Indira Vasahat, a cramped colony of daily wage workers in Khadki, usually wears a deserted look in the afternoons, as most residents leave by then to look for work. But three weeks after the Centre announced the demonetisation of high-denomination notes, most residents of the colony are heading back to their homes in villages and towns across India, as almost 40 per cent jobs have dried up due to the cash crunch. With their contractors failing to make timely payments, residents of Indira Vasahat are struggling to even pay for essential items.As supporters and opponents of demonetisation continue to debate its pros and cons, those hit hardest by the measure seem to have little choice other than to hope for the best. Daily wage workers like Mankiribai Reddy and Shinu Pawar, who came to Pune in search of work from distant Telangana, are among them.Mankiribai Reddys daughter is the sole breadwinner in a family of three.The girl, who works as a loader at construction sites, used to earn about Rs 500 per day, with the contractor paying her the cumulative amount every six days.Since the bigger notes have been withdrawn, my daughter has not been paid her full wage. The contractor pays her just about Rs 800-1,000 per week, as against the Rs 3,000 she is supposed to be paid, said Mankiribai. The cash crunch has forced them to stop buying vegetables and cut down on the consumption of milk.We are surviving on 10 kg rice and 10 kg wheat, which we get from a fair price shop, she added. The family already has a debt of almost Rs 2,000 with the local grocer and other shops. The contractor said he is finding it difficult to get cash to pay us and if the situation doesnt improve soon, I dont know how will I make ends meet, she said.However, Reddys daughter is one of the few who still have regular work. For daily wage workers such as Shinu Pawar, who has a wife and two young sons to take care of, work has dried up completely.Many of us dont get jobs any more work has halted at many sites, said Pawar, a mason who used to work at under-construction sites.Before the ban, I used to earn around Rs 3,500 per week in the last few weeks, I have barely earned Rs 1,000 per week, he said.While supplies from the fair price shop has alleviated Reddys plight to some extent, Pawar and others, who dont even have a ration card, have run into debts which they dont know how to pay off. Most of the residents of Indira Vasahat have bank accounts but they have hardly ever carried out any bank transactions. None of them have debit or credit cards, and are clueless about online banking.One of them, Shanti Nenaware, has not been able to pay her rent as she has no cash to do so. There have been long queues outside the Bank of India branch where I have an account. I skipped work twice to try and withdraw money, but could not do so, she said.Like others in Indira Colony, Nenaware is a daily wage earner and she misses out on an entire days pay when when she skips work. As her creditors grow impatient, Nenaware is desperately trying to figure out to how to make ends meet without any cash. At the most, I can resist the creditors for one more week after that, I dont know what will happen, she said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express Photo by Debabrata MohantyHealth worker Jhunumani Mohapatra threw up her hands in despair in Malkangiri district, now in the grip of an encephalitis outbreak that had killed 87 until Thursday, including 30 of Japanese encephalitis.We have been running around for weeks, trying to convince villagers to use a mosquito net and apply mosquito-repellent cream on their children. But its a tough battle, said Mohapatra, working in Palkonda village, where six children have did in the last two months.Watch What Else Is making NewsShe had one colleague but he was suspended last week as he had stepped out at night for dinner, she said. Now I leave home at 7 am and return from the anganwadi at 9 pm after ensuring the villagers have put up a mosquito net, she said, as tribal children in Koya milled around for hot cooked lunch that is being provided daily for over a month.We are in firefighting mode to see that no new deaths occur, said district collector K Sudarshan Chakravarthy, who personally went to a village last week to persuaded the parents of a girl to admit her. We have taken all possible measures at village level including removing pigs (the natural host of the virus) and fogging to using mosquito nets so that no new cases are reported.Of the 303 children admitted to Malkangiri district headquarter hospital over the last two months, 151 have been diagnosed with Japanese encephalitis  121 have been discharged  while the other 152 had acute encephalitis syndrome. AES is a broad spectrum of encephalitis-related diseases that includes JE. Doctors and virologists have not been able to identify the exact virus that killed the 57 children who had AES but not JE.The basic issue is immunity due to lack of nutrition. Tribal kids who did not have immunity fell to the virus, said additional district medical officer (public health) K K Sarkar.At MPV-62 village in Kalimela, children of Bengali settlers were diagnosed with JE but survived.These children have better nutrition and their families are conscious about keeping their surroundings clean, said Nil Ratan Mandal, a health worker at Koimetla anganwadi centre near Kalimela.In Koimetla village, Debe Madhi, who lost her son Majnu to Japanese encephalitis, said all he ate was rice and fried saag leaves. Its difficult for me to get him egg and milk. The only time he got egg was at the anganwadi and that too was not regular, she said.Her neighbour Chukda Padiami lost his son Bapi. 3. Last year I did not have a good crop. What else could I feed him except rice, salt and a few vegetables? he said.Of the 81,000 children in age group 0-6 getting food under the central scheme ICDS in Malkangiri, only 1,400 were reported as severely malnourished. In blocks like Korkunda and Kalimela, where the outbreak has been the worst, 500-odd children were reported severely malnourished.Yet, in January 2012, a survey in 100 districts across of India done by NGO Naandi Foundation had found Malkangiri the worst with over 57 per cent children underweight. The kind of food our children are being served at anganwadi centre is pathetic, alleged Ghanashyam Madkami, president of Zilla Adivasi Samaj Mahasangh, which observed a 12 hour shutdown in Malkangiri on November 8 protesting the deaths of children.Doctors at the district headquarters hospital stressed the need for vaccination. Despite Malkangiri being a JE-endemic area since 2012 when 38 kids died, it is baffling why no vaccination was done, said a paediatrician, brought in from SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. Even at the district headquarters hospital there is no MRI and CT scan device, nor a single micoropathologist.In the absence of a micropatholgist, blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples are being sent to SCB Medical College and MKCG Medical College in Berhampur, with results coming after six or seven days.At the JE/AES ward, Suni Kabasi prayed for her daughter Sukumati, 9, as she suffered intermittent fits. Three years ago Suni had lost her son, who was in class IV.There is little one can do except pray the virus doesnt suddenly travel to the brain, which would kill the child, said a doctor who attended to her.Officials hoped that the mosquitoes would have less space to breed as winter advances. Its a waiting game. With no vaccinated children here, we are hoping the outbreak somehow ends, said Malkangiri CDMO Uday Shankar Mishra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Archive photo Tea plantation workers tend to a garden. Archive photoA state minister has claimed that continued delay in wage payments to tea plantation workers in North Bengal could lead to starvation.Speaking at a series of agitations that the TMC held in the region on Tuesday, north Bengal development minister Goutam Deb said, Since most dont have bank accounts, they will face problems in withdrawing wages from banks. The nearest banks are located around 10-15 km away. They will lose a days wages if they go to banks to withdraw their cash. These poor people have no alternative source of income and ultimately it will lead to starvation of the tea workers, he said.WATCH VIDEO: West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjees Flight Reportedly Had Low Fuel: Heres What HappenedThe spectre of starvation has been a constant companion for tea garden workers in north Bengal, which, according to some reports, recorded 1,200 hunger deaths after tea estates began shutting shop from 2002 to 2007  a claim contested by the TMC government.Officials admitted that the continuing cash crisis could have devastating consequences for the vulnerable tea estate workers.Deb added, We are trying to tackle the situation through the Food Security Act. We will talk to the administration whether rations can be arranged on credit for tea workers and likewise.We are poor people, said Mithun Lohan, a tea garden worker at Dhumchipara. I dont think the government realises how poor we are. We get rice at Rs 2 per kg from the state. But even then it is difficult for us to ensure that weve enough money to buy food for our family. If we miss a days work to go to an ATM or a bank that means a loss of Rs 120 for me. I cant afford that. Following demonetisation, the RBI has asked tea plantations to open bank accounts for workers.Salaries have always been paid in cash in tea gardens. But on Sunday, banks set up camps at tea gardens and saw hundreds of bank accounts being opened in the first few days. But like Amita Tanti, another worker, explained there were reasons why many had consciously avoided banks.We know our money will be safer in a bank. But there are no ATMs here. We have to spend on travelling at least 10 kms to go to the nearest bank that works. Our problem wasnt that we were getting paid in cash. But that tea gardens, without warning, would shut and not pay wages, she said.Last year, reports of deaths of tea garden workers due to starvation rocked the government, prompting CM Mamata Banerjee to announce relief packages despite her government contesting the claim.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Modi, who had written off crores of rupees due from corporates, is not even ready to take steps to reduce the burden of the people affected by the policy, he alleged.Chennithala said the backbone of Kerala economy was the money sent from non-resident Keralites, which had taken a hit due to demonetisation.People are afraid to send money to the state due to this policy. It has affected the economic structure and the daily life of the people, he said.The opposition leader said the move has adversely affected agriculture and small-scale industries in the southern state.The hard earned money of people engaged in agricultural sector was deposited in co-operative banks and this move has stopped them from withdrawing their money, he said.The Congress leader said the industrial sector in the state has come to a stand still and enterprises have started asking their employees to go on leave.The opposition leader also criticised the LDF-led state government for its apathy in resolving the crisis over rice distribution and the Centres move of slashing the quota of essential ration commodities to the state.Adding to the suffering of people due to demonetisation, the rice distribution through public distribution system has stopped due to the apathy of the state government.Distribution of rice has been stopped due to labour unrest over wages in the state.

Express Photo Maveli with carcasses of dogs. Express PhotoBrought up in an orphanage during his schooldays, Jose Maveli launched himself as a social worker two decades ago by rescuing children living on the streets from criminals. Maveli, now 66, is back on the streets, this time to hunt down stray dogs. When his phone rings, it sounds the death knell for a dog somewhere.Stray dogs have become a major scare in Kerala, with countless people having been bitten and some even killed. Many are turning to Maveli for help. He claims he already faces eight criminal cases pertaining to killing of street dogs. Not that these deter him from hunting down and killing more dogs.Watch What Else Is making NewsEveryday, I am getting several calls from people and village governing bodies to catch stray dogs. I have killed 2,000-odd stray dogs during the ongoing crisis, said Maveli, leader of a stray dog-free movement in the state. On Monday, he was at Kadungalloor village panchayat, where peoples representatives had called him to get rid of stray dogs.Now based in Kochi, Maveli was born at Karukutty in Ernakulam district. His parents could not afford to educate him and sent him to an orphanage in Alappuzha, where he lived until Class X. After studying a technical course, Maveli went back home, initially helped his parents in farming, and went on to become a wholesale rice merchant. Along the way, he joined the CPM worker and became vice-president of Karukutty panchayat in 1987.His activism for homeless children began in the 1990s. I was moved by the plight of children living on the streets, Maveli said. When a homeless woman gave birth to a child on the street at Aluva, I approached an orphanage seeking to adopt it, but they turned me down as she was not from Kerala.In 1996, he started distributing free food to children. Three years later, he launched Janaseva Sisubhavan to provide food, shelter and education for children rescued from the streets. In 2008, the organisation launched a sports academy for the inmates. These children are deprived of emotional and psychological support of a family. I realised it was our responsibility to bring them up in a homely atmosphere, Maveli said.Over the years, residents of Sisubhavan have made news. Some of the children had participated in district, state and national sports competitions. Two former residents, Velmurugan and Raja, who were rescued from beggars, have found jobs in banks under sports quota,Maveli said.The venture gets help from donors. Around 10,000 people have financially supported Sisubhavan. We have rescued 2,000 children from the streets over the years; 300 are still in hostels under Sisubhavan, he said.Today, the new assignment has brought Maveli out on the streets again. He gathers local volunteers who trap stray dogs and strangle them with a rope. While this has shocked animal rights activists in Kerala and away, Maveli said the stray dog-free movement is determined to kill all street dogs.Stray dogs have attacked several people in Kerala, primarily in cities, over the last few months. Among the latest victims was Charuvila Raghavan, 90, mauled to death by a pack of dogs in Thiruvananthapuram in October. In August, a 68-year-old woman had been killed in a coastal village.Amid reports of culling, Union WCD Minister Maneka Gandhi made a statement recently that Kerala should invoke its anti-goons law against those responsible.

Vikas was admitted to hospital on Thursday.A serpentine, narrow lane climbs uphill to remote Dandwal village that houses 115 tribal huts on the Nashik highway. The last mud-plastered hut belongs to Chintaman Nikade (25). On Thursday, he was packing his belongings to shift to Jawahar Rural hospital, 20 kms away. We have lost our daughter I dont want to lose my son now, he says.With the death of four-year-three-month-old Sheetal Nikade, diagnosed as severely acute malnourished (SAM) case two months ago, the death toll of children aged less than six has risen beyond 320 in Palghar district this year. In Mokhada itself, 28 children have died since August.Tribals in Mokhada are now pressing for an urgent need to provide alternative source of livelihood to curb migration and escalate tertiary level healthcare facilities in hamlets.Watch What Else Is Making NewsIn a makeshift swing, Nikades one-year-old son Vikas lay feeble. He was diagnosed as a moderately acute malnourished (MAM) child on October 12. On Thursday, he was admitted for a 14-day programme under Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre (NRC) in Jawahar hospital. His elder sister Sheetal passed away on Sunday, weighing 7.5 kg with an enlarged liver. Until September, her weight was 9 kg.Her death sparked visits from the health department in the last two days with officials blaming the poor family for negligence and taking quick steps to admit Vikas. The family, however, maintains they took all possible measures to save Sheetal.Sheetal was born healthy weighing 2.6 kg. In 2013, father Chintaman was forced to migrate to Nashik after rice cultivation became an impossible prospect due to consecutive poor monsoons. The government scheme under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) did little to help as he would spent days waiting for a single days wage of Rs 195. Even that wage is not given in cash. We need money for everyday food, Nikade says.To feed my family, I shifted to Nashik outskirts to work in a company, he added. The family claims they and hundreds of similar families living off Nashik highway, received no government health services. In June, when Sheetal started falling ill, the Nikades returned and found the girl was in MAM category.The Village Child Development Centres (VCDC) where a malnourished child is given six meals was shut. It reopened on October 17 in Dandwal but Sheetal did not become a beneficiary.On September 22, her parents took her to Mohrandas primary health centre to treat fever. From September 24 to 26 she was admitted to a private nursing home in Trimbakeshwar. On October 14, an X-ray showed the child suffered from kidney ailment and liver problems. From October 18, she was admitted to Jawahar Rural hospital for 10 days, administered N-75 formula as per mandate.According to the family, she was discharged from hospital as Diwali was approaching. While Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres require at least 14 day admission which may stretch to 21 days for critical patients, Sheetal, despite being serious, was discharged with a reference to Mumbais JJ Hospital.Even as taluka officers allege they provided an ambulance, the family claims they were not financially and mentally equipped to travel to Mumbai, with a monthly income of Rs 5,000. There was also poor counselling done to warn them of dangers of undernourishment.Mokhada witnessed 21 child deaths in August, five in September and one in October. The tribal, health and women and child development department together started provision of one banana and egg for SAM kids in August. In addition, an ASHA worker was supposed to daily visit SAM children for six months. Sheetal was a beneficiary of none.Health workers claim the Nikades stayed for two months and could not be monitored. The take home ration given to Sheetal failed to improve her health.Mokhada has a population of 80,000, of whom over 30 per cent migrate for eight months. While there is an urgent need for government to provide alternative livelihood options to arrest migration, there is an equal need to train anganwadi workers.In Dandwal, where six children are malnourished, anganwadi worker Parvati Dattu did not counsel Nikades enough to initiate proper treatment. Sheetal was transferred from one rural health post to another even as she needed tertiary services.The cases of malnutrition in Mokhada have dropped from 697 to 558 due to aggressive screening and treatment. But the situation has been like this for 10 years now, a local, Vilas Patil, said.Mokhada talukas post for a Child Development Project Officer (CDPO) has remained vacant for three years. In fact, across Palghar district, of 13 CDPO posts, 12 are vacant.This is a huge problem. Very few medical officers want to work in tribal areas, said collector Abhjeet Bangar, adding that since 2015-16 a drive to generate labour under NREGA is underway to stop migration. Fifty per cent work is under gram panchayat and remaining is given by forest and agriculture. We are also focussing on skill development in the garment industry, he said.A pilot programme for 60 women, under Pramod Mahajan Kaushalya Vikas Yojana, to get trained in stitching under an MoU signed with garment companies is also about to start in Jawahar to provide livelihood.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

He, however, noted that the low crop yields cannot be attributed to non-availability of improved technologies but several factors including short growing season, varied agro-climatic conditions and weather extremities.The productivity of various crops and legumes in the country is less as compared to that of some countries in Europe, the US and China, Singh said during the Question Hour in the Lok Sabha.Watch What Else is Making NewsLarge areas being under-rainfed and harsh environment also accounted for non-realisation of productivity potential of improved technologies, he said.Singh said that in countries with high productivity, crops are largely grown in high input management conditions of long growing period without any stress of moisture and temperature.Whereas in India, on the same land, farmers grow more than one crop in a year and per day productivity of most of the crops was comparable to the global average, he added.According to the crop yield data placed before the House, Indias rice yield was 2191 kg/hectare, while the global average stood at 3026 kg/hectare, while wheat is 2750 kg/hectare as against the world average yield of 3289 kg/hectare.Replying to a query that if there was sluggish progress in improving crop yields, the Minister said the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is conducting research in 26 commodities, while several schemes such as National Food Security Mission (NFSM) have been rolled out to increase production and productivity of agri-crops.Under these schemes, funds are being provided to states for implementing state-specific agri-strategies, he said. As a result of implementation of various crop development schemes/programmes, the production and productivity of most of the agricultural crops have increased, he said.For instance, the countrys rice yields have increased from 2131 kg per hectare in 2006-07 to 2416 kg per hectare in 2013-14, while wheat yields have gone up from 2708 kg per hectare to 3145 kg per hectare in the same period, he added.Singh observed that the production and productivty of agri-crops during 2014-15 and 2015-16 declined due to deficit rainfall.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

They are enjoying getting up late. (Photographs by Ankita Dwivedi Johri) 9 AM Rani, Aarti. They are enjoying getting up late. (Photographs by Ankita Dwivedi Johri)Somvaar ko school gaye, gate band tha, koi madam nahi aayi thi, guard ne bola pollution hai, chutti hai (On Monday, when we went to school, the gates were shut, there were no teachers, the guard told us school is closed because of pollution), says Rani, 8, dressed in a worn-out sky-blue T-shirt and yellow pyjamas. Her mother, Meera, however, isnt too pleased. Struggling to run a comb through her daughters oily, scruffy hair, she complains, School band hai toh bas sirf ghoomte rahenge mohalle mein Jao dadi ke ghar par baith ke padho (Now that the school is shut, they will keep roaming around in the colony Go to your grandmothers home and study). She instructs her son, Sunny, to ensure that his sister completes her assignments. The 11-year-old nods dutifully, flashing a smirk at his sister before the two rush out of their home.The choking haze that enveloped the Capital last week prompted Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to take a raft of emergency measures, among them, shutting of schools for three days.So Rani and Sunny, who attend the Nagar Nigam Balbalika Vidyalaya and Sarvodaya Vidyalaya respectively, in East Delhis Anand Vihar, have got an unexpected break from classes, making it difficult for Meera to keep them occupied through the day. Mai teen din se subah kaam par nahi gayi (I havent gone to work for three days), complains Meera, 32, who works as a domestic help.9:30 AM Rani (in yellow pyjamas), with cousins, studying numbers at her grandmothers home. 9:30 AM Rani (in yellow pyjamas), with cousins, studying numbers at her grandmothers home.Anand Vihar has consistently recorded some of the highest pollution levels among the Capitals localities. On Diwali night, according to data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee, PM 2.5 levels (particles less than or 2.5 micrometres in diameter) in the locality rose to a whopping 883 micrograms per cubic metre  14 times the permissible 60 micrograms per cubic metre. At 1,680 micrograms per cubic metre, the locality also had the highest concentration of PM10 (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometres or less) on the day after Diwali  over 16 times above the safe limit of 100 micrograms per cubic metre. The PM10 levels improved to 999 micrograms per cubic metre last week but were still dangerously high.However, for the 2,500-odd residents of Anand Vihars JJ Colony, where Rani and Sunny live, pollution or its dangerous level means little.Sitting on her haunches on a slab above an open drain, Rani, a Class III student, struggles to explain pollution, a sheepish smile flitting across her face. Sunny, a Class VI student, jumps in to help: Dhua, patakha, aag, sab pollution karte hain (smoke, firecrackers, fire, all these cause pollution), he quips. Their friends, who have now gathered around the two in a semi-circle, nod in approval.Its 9.30 am and, as directed by their mother, Rani and Sunny are making their way to their grandmothers home, a few metres away. Textbooks and pencil boxes firmly clutched under their arms, the two children are joined by their cousins, Aarti, 6, and Aman, 9, as they rush past the cramped lanes, before climbing a steep flight of stairs and settling down with their books in a dingy enclosure. The thatched gate of the small room is left open for the light to come in.Sunny asks Rani and Aarti to concentrate on numbers. The two comply by opening their math notebooks; Aman focuses on his tables. Sunny himself is taking it easy today. Maine kal sab maths, English padh liya tha. Aaj bas drawing (I studied maths and English yesterday. Today, it will be only drawing, he says.10:00 AM Sunny spends his morning drawing as he studied yesterday. 10:00 AM Sunny spends his morning drawing as he studied yesterday.Unlike school days, when the two wake up at 6 am to get to school by 8.30 am, Rani and Sunny only got out of bed at 7 am today. Bas brush kiya, kal school jaane se pehle nahayenge (We only brushed. We will take a bath tomorrow morning, before going to school, smiles Rani. Phir nashta kiya, matthi aur chai (We then had tea and matthi for breakfast), adds Sunny.An hour later, the group decides padhai khatam, khelne chaltein hain (We are done studying; lets go and play). The fact that their grandmother isnt home helps. After a heated discussion, they all agree to a game of char ka dabba (hopscotch). Rani goes around, calling out to her friends and Sunny gets his gang. While making their way to the main road, the children make a brief stopover to play with the neighbourhood stray.Yeh Julie hai! Julie, udhar dekho (This is Julie. Julie, look that way), exclaims Rani, petting the dog. The other children too form a circle around the dog, which seems happy with the attention. But there is little time to waste. Chalo jaldi warna mummy bula lengi (Come fast or else mummy will call us home), Sunny yells out to the group and they all leave, allowing Julie to return to her mid-morning nap.In one corner of the main road, the girls prepare for the game by drawing boxes using a red brick. Sunny, who has been having an argument with his cousin over who gets to hop first, looks over towards a group of boys who are burning plastic bags. Yeh dekho pollution (Look, that is pollution), he says, running across to the boys. Startled, the group lets go of the plastic bags and disperses. See the smoke badboo bhi kitni gandi hai (the smell is disgusting), says Sunny. I have been coughing for days. These boys dont understand, Rani joins him, letting out a forced cough, to drive her point home.What about masks, has anyone told them about it? Woh jiske dhaage kaan pe peeche lagatein hain (The one whose strings are tucked behind the ear)? asks Sunny. Mummy had got them last year from her madam (whom she works for), not this time. Do you have some? he asks.11:15 AM The neighbourhood stray, Julie, is everyones favourite. 11:15 AM The neighbourhood stray, Julie, is everyones favourite.The children spend the next hour playing chaar ka dabba. Yeh poore time cheating karti hai (She cheats all the time), shouts Rani at her cousin Aarti following an argument. Offended, she leaves the group. Soon, the rest call for a time-out too.Sunny, Rani and the rest of the children make their way to the nearby kirana store, where they stand in a neat queue for some Fun Flips chips. Ek ek kar ke batao kya chahiye (Tell me one at a time what you want), instructs the shopkeeper. Rani tugs at her brothers shirt and asks him to get her buggle gum. Its bubble gum, Sunny corrects her, before turning to the shopkeeper. He gets a packet of chips for himself. Cousins Aman and Aarti opt for another brand. Papa se paise le lena (take the money from papa), says Sunny, chomping on the chips.Before lunch, the children catch up on their favourite cartoons. Motu-Patlu, Doremon, sab barah baje 400 channel par aata hai (All our favourite cartoons come on Channel No. 400, at noon). On school days, we miss them, says Rani. Theirs is one of the few houses here with a television set; so Sunny leads the group to his home.Inside, their father Raju, 34, a driver, is eating his lunch  roti and a vegetable made of radish. Settling down before the TV set in the room, Rani complains about the meal. School mein rajma chawal milta hai. Namak kam hota hai, par achcha lagta hai (We get rajma and rice at school. There is not enough salt, but we like it), she says, soon getting engrossed in the cartoons with her friends.Only one show, shouts out Meera, who is keen that the lunch gets over soon so that she can go to work in the evening.11:30 AM The children playing hopscotch, quickly drawing the boxes using a brick. They are afraid that their mother, worried about them wasting their whole day, will summon them home. 11:30 AM The children playing hopscotch, quickly drawing the boxes using a brick.

No wonder our eyes have been watering for the past few days, she says. Adds Raju, The children have been coughing too. But we have seen no efforts by the government here.He and his wife together earn Rs 13,000 per month and the family has been living in Anand Vihar for over 40 years. I was born here, says Raju.By 12.30 pm, all the children return to their homes. Sunny and Rani start their lunch. As the conversation drifts towards school again, Rani says, Mujhe Anita maam sabse achchi lagti hain (Anita maam is my favourite teacher). She teaches English and Hindi. Complains Meera: Pollution is fine, but why shut schools? Look at these two wasting their time all day. I am glad the schools are opening tomorrow.She then turns to her children and says, Now eat and go to sleep, you have tuition classes in the evening.

(Source: AP) Kundhavi Kadiresan, Assistant Director-General and FAOs Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific addresses a conference in Bangkok, Thailand. (Source: AP)Even as Asia makes clear strides in taming hunger and famine, the rapidly modernizing continent needs to focus more on diversifying its diet or risk failing to quell malnutrition, with milk having the potential to help, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said in a report Tuesday.We still have nearly half a billion hungry people in this region, said Kundhavi Kadiresan, FAOs assistant director general. This report is an eye-opener.Watch What Else Is Making NewsWith greater political stability and modern farming techniques, undernourishment rates halved in Asia from 24.3 percent to 12.3 percent in the past 25 years, satisfying one of the U.N.s Millennium Development Goals, the report said.As people move from the countryside to big cities by the millions, diets are changing from ones dominated by rice to more Westernized versions incorporating more fruits, vegetables and meats. Calories from starches declined by 50 per person a day while ones from fruits, vegetables, and meat increased by over 300 per person a day, the report said.But despite this improvement, the changing diets arent all good news. Like citizens in the West, people in Asia are exercising less and chowing down heavily processed foods filled with sugar and fat instead of traditional ones like chickpeas. This means many still arent getting enough nutrients like zinc, iron, or vitamin A. Obesity levels are skyrocketing, rising more than 4 percent a year, the report said.So as dire hunger becomes less common, balanced and diverse diets are becoming a more pressing issue. Agriculture experts acknowledge they have been obsessed with rice, wheat and maize in the fight against hunger, at the cost of overlooking whether expanding diets are also nutritious.It has filled the belly, but it is creating a lot of problems, said Kadambot Siddique, a professor at the University of Western Australia.We must make this distinction between hunger and malnutrition, said Biraj Patnaik, a food policy adviser to Indias government. He said India is in the process of eliminating hunger, but has only reduced undernutrition by 1 percent in the past decade.With persistent hunger in South Asia, only two out of 19 developing Asian countries are on track to reach the U.N.s Sustainable Development goal of zero hunger by 2030, and seven by 2040, the study said.However, changing tastes in food means Asians are drinking more milk, a cheap and nutritious way of diversifying diets. Dairy products are traditionally largely absent in Asian diets but now fly off the shelves from Bangkok to Beijing, with production almost tripling from about 110 million tons in 1990 to nearly 300 million tons in 2013. Some countries are providing cartons in classrooms, like Thailands National Milk Program.But experts say governments should avoid repeating the mistake of taking shortcuts that emphasize investment in big agribusiness over small farmers. Small producers produce nearly 80 percent of the milk in Asia, so booming milk sales benefit everyone, not just the rich, in contrast to farmland, where major landowners often win big on crop subsidies.As a result, the report says, the dairy industry is a potential engine of poverty-alleviating growth, so long as things remain egalitarian.Policy-makers need to ensure that the regions small-holder dairy farmers, the largest segment of dairy producers, can have fair access to, and compete in, the marketplace, Kadiresan said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram, who was popularly known as Vizzy, was a most colourful character in Indian cricket.As Virat Kohli battles Alastair Cook at Vizag, the long shadow of crickets princely history falls on Indias newest Test venue. Sriram Veera takes a small jaunt away from the ongoing Test to recount the fascinating tale and intrigue of Indian crickets grand old fiddler Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram aka Vizzy.Its not known whether Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe had spicy chicken curry rice at Vizianagaram in 1931 but they should have sampled it. Its yummy. Long before Alastair Cook or even Geoffrey Boycott came to India, one of the best opening pairs in cricketing history were in this region. The man responsible for bringing Hobbs and Sutcliffe was Maharajakumar of Vizianagaram, popularly known as Vizzy  a most colourful character in Indian cricket. His is a tale that has everything  personal ambition, tussle among princes, fights with commoner cricketers, loads of cash, patronage for cricket. A minor royal who dreamed big.Vizianagaram is a historic town 50 kms north east of Vizag, famous in the 1700s for its battles between the kings of Vizianagaram and Bobilli, which also played out as proxy wars between the British and French. Its well connected to the cricket stadium where incidentally the pavilion, the first structure to go up on the ground that used to be filled with fly-ash in the days gone by, is named after Dr. Vizzy. It could well have been Sir Vizzy for he was knighted by the Queen in the 30s but relinquished it after India became a free country. Vizzy wasnt even the crown prince, he was the second son of the king and his brother ascended the throne, but he was a man with great ambition, and tagged himself with the unique title Maharajakumar, son of Maharaja.The old fort of Vizianagaram of Vizzys ancestors still stands, an 8-rupee shared-auto ride from the bus stand. Eateries abound here and there with delectable local fare. There isnt much to see but the old man guarding the gate tells you to go around the fort, from outside, to see narrow holes in the grounds. It used to be a moat filled with crocodiles to keep the enemies at bay. A trust MANAS runs a school inside the dilapidated fort now, and a small book-fair  books from Peter Drucker to Amitav Ghosh are spread out on a few tables  is currently being held on the eve of the Test. Schoolgirls form a disciplined queue and walk towards the books.About 10 kms from the fort, stands a Sainik school, which once used to be Vizzys palace with a tree-ringed cricket ground. Hobbs and Sutcliffe must have passed the fort to get to this palace where they not only stayed but also batted a bit. It was in Benaras in Uttar Pradesh where Vizzy moved after the death of his father into a palace owned by Vizianagaram royal family that Hobbs hit his first hundred in India. The bat with which he scored those runs is now on display at the Lords museum in London. On it, Hobbs has scribbled, I used this bat in my last Test match versus Australia at the Oval August 1930, also while scoring my first century in India at Benaras, November, 1930.Not only did he get the English openers but Vizzy also drafted in the West Indian all-rounder Learie Constantine to come play in India. Those were the days Vizzy was waging cricket wars with his arch rival the prince of Patiala Bhupinder Singh, and Constantine found himself in the thick of battle in 1933 during the final of Moin-ud-Dowlah tournament between the teams owned by the two princes. Vizzy didnt play that game but he sent a telegram to Constantine, offering to ply with pounds for runs and wickets taken. Vizzys side lost the game by three runs but his battle with Patiala prince over Indian cricket had just begun.*******Vizzy was up against a man incredibly richer than him. Bhupinder Singh was a prince with a lifestyle that can astonish even those who are used to reading about decadent lives of rich and famous. The writer Khushwant Singh had once waded into the prince on print. He was a headstrong bully, a debauch, drunkard, womanizer and philanderer. A proud owner of the famous Patiala necklace as it came to be called that he specially commissioned the Parisian jeweller Cartier and took three years in making  it had 2930 diamonds, weighed 962.25 carats, and included the 7th largest diamond in the world, a 234-carat De Beers. He was the first Indian to own an airplane, had a fleet of Rolls Royce, and the state of Patiala already had Indias first automobile, a French made De Dion Bouton imported in 1892. Also suffice here to say that his sex-tales are mind-boggling, and he reportedly had over 300 concubines.Its not known whether Bhupinder indulged in a traditional ritual but the authors of Freedom at Midnight record that his father certainly did  The Maharaja of Patiala would walk out annually, clad just in a diamond breastplate. People would cheer and greet the nude king, a custom that was supposed to ward off evil spirits from the kingdom. Unlike Vizzy, Bhupinder Singh could play pretty decent cricket, and had set his eyes on taking control over the game in the country. But Vizzy could never be accused of being chicken-hearted and was ready to take on the Patiala prince.Without the patronage of these princes, Indian cricket would have been a non-starter for it was they who ploughed money into the game. The princes sponsored tours from visiting teams, also allowed India to go on foreign tours, and the money helped cricketers and cricket to grow.Vizzy vs Bhupinder battle started much before Indias first Test tour of England. The Patiala prince had fallen out with Lord Willingdon, the viceroy of India and the patron of Indian cricket board, and Vizzy moved up as the challenger. The cricket historian Mihir Bose put Vizzy in perspective. In a land where titles were important, Maharajakumar, meaning the son of a king suggested someone connected with royalty but never likely to rule. In English terms he was, at best, a member of the landed gentry. But what he lacked in princely clout he made up in tenacity and an unrivalled capacity for intrigue.In 1931, the cancellation of MCC tour of India due to the political situation allowed Vizzy to step in. He organised cricket tours in India and Ceylon, and it was during this time when he somehow managed to convince Hobbs, who has refused several such Indian tours before, and Sutcliffe. Prominent Indian cricketers like CK Nayudu, Indian crickets first superstar who used to feature in adverts and whose name was used to promote movies, DB Deodhar and Mushtaq Ali too were part of the team. Incidentally, the current Indian and England team bus rolls past a statue of Nayudu thats near the entrance to the Vizag stadium every day. Inexplicably, though, the wondrous hitter, who hit three sixes even at the age of 61 in his last Ranji game for Andhra, is caught in a pose as if he is leaving the ball.*******It was this tour that had Hobbs, Sutcliffe and Nayudu, that Boria Majumdar who has written several tomes on the Indian cricket history especially covering the early battles in the cricket board and the tussles of these princely patrons, notes as the turning point in Vizzys career. Vizzy also cosied up to Willingdon and offered 50,000 rupees to the Indian cricket board  40,000 was proposed for Indias tour of England in 1932.But Bhupinder wasnt done yet. He not only financed the trials for the tour at the Bardari Palace ground in Patiala but also offered to sponsor Indias month-long tour in England. That tilted the scales back in his favour, and he won the first round, as he was named the captain of the touring party. The vice-captaincy was given to a prince Ghanyshyamsinhji of Limbdi and Vizzy was made the deputy vice-captain. Vizzy promptly withdrew from the tour, citing health reasons, and as it turned out, so did Bhupinder. Thus it came to pass that Maharaja of Porbandar was made the captain but luckily, for India, he realised he was the worst cricketer in the camp, and asked CK Nayudu to captain the team.However, Bhupinder lost his hold on the cricketing powers by 1933, perhaps due to Lord Willingdon, and in his book, Bose mentions a 1933 meeting where the members of the board had turned against him. The prince though wouldnt be dissuaded, and threw in the money to win back the hearts. In 1934, during a MCC tour of India, he arranged hunts and shoots for the English, and reportedly won the favour of the captain Douglas Jardine. However Jardine also ended up boosting the profile of Vizzy on that tour praising his captaincy after MCCs solitary loss of the tour came against Vizzys team.The prince and the Maharajakumar made another valiant effort to seize control over Indian cricket. Patiala donated the trophy for the domestic tournament and decided it would be named after Jamsaheb of Nawanagar, Ranjitsinghji, the famous Indian prince who played for England and had died a year before.Not to be outdone, Vizzy too donated a trophy, gold plated and made in London, for the same domestic tournament and in an attempt to ingratiate himself further with the viceroy, said it should be named after Willingdon. Vizzy suggested that Ranji hadnt done much for Indian cricket, and Indias premier tournament shouldnt be named after him. It was around this time that the teams of Vizzy and Patiala met in the final of Moin-ud-dowlah where even the presence of Constantine couldnt help Vizzys team win as Lala Amarnath came up with a counter-attacking hundred that sealed the game. The domestic tournament also rapidly progressed towards its finale  nameless and without much interest from people who were still hooked on to Pentagular tournaments then. The trophy was to be given away by Willingdon himself but Vizzy had to suffer the ignominy of watching the viceroy hand out the trophy donated by Patiala, and the tournament also named after Ranji.*******Vizzy wasnt the one to be dissuaded by such small episodes though. Even as Patiala was in London for the silver jubilee celebrations for King George V, Vizzy was busy in India, organising a tournament to honour the King. His team, that included CK Nayudu, defeated Patialas team and this time around, the viceroy handed out the original Willingdon trophy to Vizzy. His team also had Captain Jack Brittain-Jones who would later become the manager of Indian team that toured England in 1936.Patiala tried to repeat the same ploy he did before the 32 tour- offering to host the trials and sponsor the tour but by now Vizzy had moved ahead in the game. He went around the country, canvassing for votes, and managed to secure the captaincy for himself. And unlike the maharaja of Porbandar, he didnt allow CK Nayudu to captain, and played himself in all the three Tests. This was the tour that also saw Vizzy send back Lala Amarnath on disciplinary grounds.Vizzy averaged 16.21, his captaincy came under fire, and he cut a sorry figure on the field: a plumpish, rather hunched figure, perpetually standing in the slips and peering through spectacles at a game he did not seem to understand.It wasnt just Amarnath, CK Nayudu faced Vizzys wrath, too. Vizzy had Baqa Jilani abuse Nayudu at the breakfast table, and rewarded Jilani by giving a Test cap. On that tour, he also asked Syed Mushtaq Ali to run out Vijay Merchant but Ali duly informed Merchant when he joined him at the crease.For all the criticism, though, Vizzy had achieved his dreams. Not only did he manage to captain India in Tests, but he also got knighted on the tour. The once minor royal who couldnt become the king of Vizianagaram had come a long way.Meanwhile, his once-arch rival Bhupinder not only lost control of cricket but also was fast losing his virility. He tried various concoctions from Indian doctors and even tried radium therapy from the French doctors, but in vain.However, Collins and Lapierre nail the issue of his death in their book. It was not a lack of virility that afflicted the jaded and sated prince. His was a malady that plagued not a few of his surfeited fellow rulers. It was boredom. He died of it.In later years, Vizzy became a commentator, selector, board president, and a politician. His commentary too was reportedly dull, captured best by a story told by his fellow commentator Dicky Rutnagur, featuring the West Indian batsman Rohan Kanhai. Tired of Vizzy yakking on about his numerous tiger hunts, Kanhai, supposedly asked him, How do you kill them?I shoot them.. And Kanhai let it rip: Really? I thought you just left a transistor radio on when you were commentating and bored them to death.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
590a1bdf7be9e033fa42f8e4,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses production",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/588472/pay-more-farmers-up-pulses.html,2016-12-26,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses productionBy Pandurang Hegde, Dec 27, 2016, 0:04 ISTThe 68th United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses (IYP) to heighten awareness of nutritional benefits, to better utilise of pulses-based proteins and to increase the global production of pulses. Being the biggest consumer of pulses in the world, India plays a dominant role as a producer and importer.The pulses are a common source of protein either as combination of common mans food in north India as dal and roti, or as sambar and rice in the south. India has a tradition of using diverse pulses in the food chain like lentils, chick pea and beans of different kinds.How far have we progressed in achieving the goals of IYP? What policies have been initiated during the year to increase the production and consumption of pulses?The history of pulses cultivation in South Asia dates back to 9500 BC, even pre-dates to the centres of origin in West Asia. Thus, its cultivation has evolved through the millennia in which the farmers have developed diverse pulse varieties.Despite the ancient roots, the status of pulses production has stagnated over the years as the food security policies concentrated on cereals that were to supply carbohydrates while the protein providing pulses were neglected.The neglect of pluses is shocking in comparison with the cereal production in the country. For the triennium ending 2013-14, production of rice increased by 225%, wheat by 808% but the pulses production went up only a meagre of 47%!As a result of this lopsided policy, the per capita availability of pulses has drastically declined from 69 grams per person per day in 1961 to 43 grams in 2013. The persistent deficit in demand and supply has not kept pace with cultivation. The failure to provide the poor mans protein has adverse consequences on the nutritional status of the people.The cultivation of pulses has the multiple benefits of increasing soil fertility and provision of protein security to address the issue of malnutrition.Pulses contain almost twice the amount of portents found in cereals like rice and wheat. It is complimentary food for infants and children that ensures adequate of proteins, minerals and vitamins.Women, who form part of the poorer sections of society, can benefit a great deal by consuming pulses combining them with vitamin C. This results in absorption of high rates or iron that is essential at the reproductive age.Cultivation of pulses as a rotation crop after cereals provides opportunities for converting atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that can be used by plants and improve soil fertility. This develops high resilience to diseases and builds the agro ecosystems.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), pulses promote higher rates of accumulation of soil carbon and they can contribute to improving the carbon sequestration.Growing pulses also reduces the use of synthetic fertilisers that help in mitigating climate change. It does not emit greenhouse gas in the process of cultivation.Pulses can be grown in diverse agricultural production systems like crop rotation, intercropping and ground cover. In most dry zones in India, pulses are part of multiple cropping systems that enrich soil fertility and provide food and nutritional security for human beings as well as livestock. The leftover of pulses is used as fodder after processing the final produce.Over the past three decades, our policy makers have been chanting the mantra of increasing pulses production. However, the failure in its implementation has led to a severe crisis in the supply of pulses.Domestic demandIt is estimated that the domestic demand for pulses will rise to 31 million tonnes by 2020 whereas the production is below 20 million tonnes (pulses production in 2013-14 was 19.8 mt which came in 2014-15 to 17.3 mt; imports increased from 3.5 mt to 4.64 mt during this period). Obviously, we do not want to pay higher prices for the farmer who is capable of growing pulses to meet the ever increasing demand.Our policy makers allow dumping of cheap imports which only helps the agri business. This year, the farmers are expecting bumper crop of pulses, but the prices have crashed below the minimum support price.Recently, the Indian government requested the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, South Africa and China) to cultivate pulses and ship it to India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mozambique to purchase pulses at an assured rate.It is ironical that our rulers do not want to pay farmers in India, but are assuring to purchase form these distant continents that adds to environment costs due to the increased food miles of shipping.The case study of Australia is illuminating as India gave 400 grams of pulse seed in 1970 and in 2000, it exported 9 million tonnes to India! If a country that has no culture of growing pulse can produce such record quantity, why cant we do it?"
