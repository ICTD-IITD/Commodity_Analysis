Monica explained, The art is open to interpretation. Sometimes people understand this, sometimes they dont. The idea is to take art out of galleries and get common people to discuss it.Lius performance involved sticking a banned note of the Rs 1,000 denomination to her mouth. Explaining her performance, Liu said, When I came to India, I had this Rs 1,000 note. I tried to get it exchanged through friends and local contacts but they told me the deadline was over. I realised that people were facing similar problems so I made this the theme.Liu was however, unprepared for the reaction from the audience. Some of them interpreted it as an insult to Prime Minister Modi and took offence, forcing her to stop halfway through. Several others thought it would be disturbing for the children to watch her wrap her head in tape.I have heard of such things happening to other performance artistes. I thought people would be more open to discussion in India than in my country where everything is censored, she said.For the first time I am witnessing such a spontaneous, unannounced performance in a public space. It was interesting to see how people reacted. Some could not understand it and found it funny, while others found meaning in it, said Dheeraj Kumar, an onlooker."

However, fostering widespread methanol is going to present challenges and the experiences of China and the United States may both prove instructive. Overall, the government would do well to initially focus on select markets to create a sustainable base for heightened methanol production in India.Though long seen as a clean burning alternative to gasoline that can significantly reduce vehicular tailpipe emissions, methanol has lost out to ethanol in the last 10-15 years as the alternative fuel of choice to reduce gasoline consumption. Even as the Centre sponsors a Rs 500 crore ethanol plant in Bathinda that will use rice and wheat stubble straw as feedstock, much more methanol can be derived out of crop residues more easily and cheaply than ethanol.Methanol does not impinge on food production the way ethanol will continue to do in the foreseeable future, as most of the latters production will be sugarcane or corn-based. Biomass-based methanol also emits significantly less carbondioxide on a life-cycle basis than sugarcane or corn-based ethanol and even CNG.Domestic biomass-based methanol production need not actually worry about finding an outlet. India already imports around 2 million tonnes of methanol every year for synthesising a range of industrial chemicals. Indias current installed capacity for methanol production is almost wholly based on imported natural gas and can meet just 25% of this demand. Clearly, a major opportunity exists to increase domestic methanol supply using sustainable feedstock while also reducing air pollution.While supply of methanol derived from renewable sources rises, India can also turn to its coal reserves in the interim for methanol production for considerations of energy security and forex savings.Syngas produced via coal gasification has been proven to be a viable feedstock for producing methanol. China, the worlds largest producer (and consu-mer) of methanol, derives most of it from its coal reserves, unlike the rest of the world where natural gas is the chief feedstock.Though it was long thought that Indias high ash content coal could not be used so readily to produce methanol, coal gasification processes suitable for Indias coal reserves have now matured and that is one of the reasons why the Narendra Modi government is spending Rs 7,700 crore to revive the Talcher fertiliser plant using coal gasification.It must be noted though, that coal-based methanol production leads to greater carbon emissions than oil-based gasoline production and can also stress freshwater supplies in areas of major production, as the experience of China shows. Coal-based methanol should, therefore, be seen as a transition tool in the move towards a more sustainable methanol economy.Serious contenderWith methanol-based chemical industries providing scale and a guaranteed market for domestic methanol production, one could expect methanol supply to rise over time to a point where it will become a serious contender for gasoline, blending into automobile use.However, as seen in the US in the 1990s, this process is very simple. Although methanol blends of up to 15% can be used in most existing vehicles with little modification, getting distribution networks and automobile firms to simultaneously make investments to accommodate methanol  corrosive towards many materials and less energy dense than ethanol (necessitating more frequent refilling)  proves rather difficult.Although the government must incentivise the establishment of distribution infrastructure as well as mandate more flex fuel automobiles, it would do well to look towards riverine transport as a major market for methanol.Worldwide, the marine transport industry is considering methanol as a potential alternative to traditional bunker fuel to meet the more exacting emission standards that it is now being subject to. Obviously, if India wants to clean up its rivers even as it develops a riverine freight transport, it needs a fuel other than the highly polluting bunker fuel for its future river barge fleet.Methanol will prove far more economically viable for this purpose than say liquefied natural gas (LNG) which will involve much higher capital costs for the transition. Methanol is also not subject to methane slips which can neutralise the emissions benefits of LNG use.So, if Indias rivers have to be both emission-controlled areas as well as transport superhighways simultaneously, methanol is very likely the fuel of choice to reconcile these two seemingly disparate objectives.(The writer is a New Delhi-based commentator on security and energy issues)"
590a1db17be9e033fa42fa9b,Insight into Castro's positive revolution,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/586484/insight-castros-positive-revolution.html,2016-12-13,"Insight into Castro's positive revolutionBy E P Menon, Dec 14, 2016, 0:19 ISTFourteen Indians and seven Pakistanis were together for 10 days. They lived together in the same comfort and cordial atmosphere at Hotel Havana Libre in Havana, capital of Cuba. They greeted each other, smiled, gossiped and discussed serious issues now and then. They all cherished one common dream: when will we all, as neighbours, be able to live as human beings?The atmosphere was created by a great and adorable human being, Fidel Castro. He was our host. The skyscraper Havana Libre was home to us 1,200 guests from three continents of Asia, Africa and Latin America who were there for a tricontinental conference in January, 1966.Being the youngest member of the delegation, I was full of curiosity, anxiety and even worried sometimes. One month in Cuba was most inspiring and educational experience in my life. Morning till midnight plenaries, group sessions, cultural events and sumptuous food dominated all the 10 days.The focus of Castro's opening welcome speech stressed the need for tricontinental understanding and solidarity at all levels. Without that, a just and pea-ceful humanitarian society was impossible, he insisted. Castro was always with people. He mo-ved around in a small car with one body-guard besides the driver. No security paraphernalia.Formal conference over, before leaving for a two-week nationwide tour, one morning Castro suddenly appeared in the huge dining hall during breakfast and greeted all of us. Pointing out through the window he asked: Who would like to join me for climbing that mountain over there? Only four hours. Instantly, about 30 of us youngsters jumped to our feet shouting: Yes, Fidel, I do, I do...In the next few minutes, a huge military truck pulled in. We were all driven to the military camp few miles away and provided with warm jackets, and moved towards the forest. Castro was already waiting for us. Lets start climbing, he greeted us with a clap, grand smile and added: This was one of my hideouts eight years ago.The next two hours we walked and jumped, briskly to keep pace with him, stumbling over rocks and rivulets, excited and exhausted, but with delight and electrified nerves. When we reached on top of a flat spot, he stopped and asked us to sit around in circle. Then he gave a little introduction of the mountain and declared: Guess what is uppermost in my mind today?This evening I am going to ask my people one question: should we not help the most suffering people on earth today, the Vietnamese? Cuba is going to get 50,000 tonnes of rice from China shortly. Should we not ask China to send that rice to the people of Vietnam?""We, the 30 youths, clapped and shouted in one voice: Great idea, Do that Fidel... Viva Cuba. That very evening in the Revolution Plaza in Havana city where Fidel explained the mountain-top decision to over 30,000 people, the entire crowd clapped and raised hands shouting in chorus: Viva Fidel, Viva Vietnam.Total literacyOver 100 miles away in a mountain slope, a huge building was coming up. This is going to be our first engineering college, the interpreter explained to us. We have already recruited 2000 students who will be studying here. They will be the first engineers of new Cuba! Far away from Havana, a village and beautifully built school!As soon as the revolution was over in 1959, one of Castros priorities was total literacy. For one year, all schools in the country were closed down. All teachers and senior students spread out into countryside, each one stayed with a farmers family, taught the whole family during night and during the day worked with them in their fields.There was no electricity, and therefore the government provided a kerosene lantern to each volunteer-teacher. Around the lantern the whole family would sit and learn their lessons with me, explained a proud teacher in another village. Within a year the whole country was literate!Education, agriculture and health. These were given the top priority by Castro and his revolutionary team in the 1960s. So today, we know how Cuba has been capable of providing free medical education and training to 52,000 students as doctors from 130 countries every year, how Cuba had given enormous help to several African countries, why the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Cubas Latin American Medical School as the most advanced medical school in the world.While leaving Cuba after a month, Castro had given me a small bag of parting gift. It contained a bottle of the famous Bacardy, which I had decided to present to that person who would make a constructive revolution in India.These days, as people around the world are mourning the demise of Fidel Castro, I feel it a terrible personal loss to me as the only Indian who had that opportunity to climb a mountain with him and share several of his thoughts and dreams.(The writer is Director, India Development Foundation, Bengaluru)"

Obama is in Lima for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that is likely to focus heavily on Trumps shock victory.Watch what else is making news:Today, he will meet leaders of the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, which Trump has opposed and now faces an uncertain future. White House officials admit the chances of passing the deal are slim, but Obama will urge leaders to give the new president time to formulate policy.From Obama down, officials have stressed that US economic and strategic interests have not changed as a result of the election, and Trump may yet recalibrate his views.Its only been 10 days since the election, said US Trade Representative Michael Froman. He warned of serious strategic and economic costs if the United States walks away from the deal, designed to be a cornerstone of US influence in the Asia-Pacific region. But there is little chance of Trumps Republican allies in Congress ratifying TPP anytime soon.I think that is a real blow to US interests, economically and strategically, in terms of our position in Asia, but I think that is the reality, that the US is not going to be participating, said Matthew Goodman, an expert on Asian economics with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.But there are 11 other countries in TPP and I think that it is possible that they will agree to go ahead and pass TPP, he said in an interview, adding that they could tweak the agreement to keep it alive without the US. Some allies are turning their attention to a rival Chinese-backed free trade agreement.Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, who took domestic political risks to back the US trade deal, visited Trump in New York on Thursday to hear from the president-elect himself. Trump has sparked concern in Japan and South Korea in particular by questioning decades-old mutual defense obligations that underpin their security. Ahead of Obamas visit, National Security Advisor Susan Rice told AFP allies should expect those obligations to hold.It is manifestly in the United Statess interests for these alliances to endure and to be a source of confidence to our partners and for them to understand that they dont need to come out from under the US umbrella, she said.While stressing that she did not want to speculate about Trumps foreign policy, she sought to reassure key US allies in NATO and the Pacific Rim that they will not be abandoned.

Owner of a roadside eatery at Jullena in Jamia Nagar, Shanu has a hard choice to make every time a customer says he will pay later.I have to turn a lot of loyal customers away because they dont have cash. I feel guilty not feeding them, but what do I do? I cant give them food on credit. I also have to get my supplies and pay my workers every day, he said.WATCH VIDEOFor 13 years, Shanu has served affordable lunch and dinner to at least 200 people every day. Anyone can eat unlimited food  daal, sabzi, chapatis, rice and onion and radish salad for Rs 40. Its the most affordable meal for a whole section of society outside their homes, he said.But for the last couple of days, things have been shaky. My business has come down by half. Before November 9, I used to make at least Rs 10,000 per day, now it is hard to make even Rs 4,500, he said.Of the Rs 4,500, Shanu spends almost Rs 500-600 to pay his four-member staff  two cooks, one cleaner and one waiter. A third of the earnings are spent on supplies for the next day. He also has to pay rent and for cooking gas. At the end of the month, I save around Rs 10,000. I dont think Ill be able to save that much this month, said Shanu, a father of three and the familys only earning member.

Anyone with respiratory or cardiac problems may collapse because of exhaustion. You should not be running in this (marathon), said a bench of Justice Badar Durrez Ahmed and Justice Jayant Nath. The bench added, If someone can run in Delhi, they can run anywhere.The observation came after the court noted that on November 17, the Air Quality Index had shown that PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels were approximately four times more than the prescribed safe standard.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court also directed the Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan governments to phase out diesel-run taxis and introduce CNG taxis in the NCR. The All India Taxi Permits granted by these states for taxis to ply inter-state should be streamlined, said the bench. It was informed that of the 1.9 lakh taxis in Delhi, 80,000 run on diesel, while 35,000 inter-state permit cabs violate the 2001 Supreme Court order  which states that all commercial vehicles in Delhi must run on CNG.Why cant Punjab, Haryana and UP stop giving permits to diesel-run cabs? Their polluting vehicles are also coming to Delhi, observed the bench. The bench added that ban on diesel taxis could be extended to inter-state buses as well.What are you going to do to prevent the burning of paddy straw, and what is your plan of action for All India Permit taxis to move towards CNG? asked the court.Refusing to accept the argument that CNG pumps are not available in the other states, the bench has asked for a clear-cut plan with timelines for introducing CNG stations and phasing out diesel-run taxis from the four NCR states within three weeks.On the issue of crop stubble burning in Punjab, the bench once again pulled up the state government for not taking steps to stop the practice. Punjab alone generates 17 million tonnes of rice paddy straw every year, of which only a small percentage is used by cardboard and paper factories. More than 13 million tonnes is being burned. Do we know how much pollution that causes? asked the bench. The court has also asked the Central Pollution Control Board to conduct a study on the amount of pollutants released from the burning of crop residue and submit a report.With the recent spike in pollution due to lighting of firecrackers on Diwali, the court suggested that the government could consider giving fewer firecracker licences and designate certain areas for fireworks display.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Muhammad Ali was a three-time heavyweight champion , an audacious mix of speed, dazzle and brute force.Mighty sequoias fell in sports in 2016, transformational figures who reshaped the games and the culture from Muhammad Ali to Gordie Howe, from Arnold Palmer to Pat Summitt.And there was loss much too soon. The famous poem To an Athlete Dying Young tells of a runner and his town, and how shoulder-high we bring you home. So it was with the Miami Marlins and 24-year-old pitcher Jose Fernandez , killed in a boating accident.Along the way, other lives lit up sports across the years:Baseball said goodbye to Ralph Branca , Monte Irvin and Joe Garagiola. Basketball lost Jim McMillian, Dwayne Pearl Washington , and the fierce Nate Thurmond. Gone in boxing was relentless Aaron Pryor. In football, it was Buddy Ryan , Dennis Byrd and Dennis Green .Hockey mourned Andy Bathgate and skiing remembered big-talking Bill Johnson. Soccer is now without the great Johan Cruyff and former FIFA President Joao Havelange , who died at 100. On television, tennis and the NBA are diminished with the loss of Bud Collins and Craig Sager.Muhammad Ali, 74On that last ride, the hearse windshield was covered with so many flowers the driver could barely see the road let alone the throngs lining the streets. Muhammad Ali was back where it all began, in Louisville, Kentucky, where he launched a career that would shake sports like no athlete before or after him.He was a three-time heavyweight champion , an audacious mix of speed, dazzle and brute force _ the stark counterpoint years later to the shuffling man with a whisper slowed by Parkinsons.His fights with Joe Frazier were an epic trilogy. He proclaimed himself The Greatest. He did it with wit and guile, boasts and taunts, in prose and rhyme, and always with a wink. He understood the marketplace and the showmanship that go with ticket sales. Ali fought everywhere and said they would know him in an Asian rice paddy.He lost prime years, refusing military induction. He spoke up when that was not in fashion. He changed his religion and his name. He became a flash point for a country on edge.Time softened the rancor. By the end, he was a national monument. At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, he stood, shakily, with torch in hand at the cauldron.The man who has no imagination, he once said, has no wings.Gordie Howe, 88He was as elemental to the game as ice.Gordie Howe came out of the hard Saskatchewan prairie and presided over his sport for five decades. He was Mr. Hockey.Even Wayne Gretzky acknowledged the preeminence of No. 9 of the Detroit Red Wings, and it was no coincidence Gretzky wore No. 99.Howe joined the NHL just after World War II, and before he was done finished with 801 goals and 1,850 points. He led the Red Wings to four Stanley Cups and was MVP six times.He was a player with vision, presence and toughness. Sticks and checks and fists were the flip side to his majesty on the ice.Family was paramount, and when he left the NHL at 45 to join the renegade WHA, nothing gave him more pleasure than to play beside sons Mark and Marty. This Methuselah with a slap shot came back to the NHL at 52.He was, former Flyers captain Bobby Clarke said, the ultimate professional hockey player.Arnold Palmer, 87His was a life well played.When golfers today look around at the big prize money, the television coverage, the sponsorships and the place golf holds in the sports conversation, they can take a 3-iron from their bag, hold it aloft and thank Arnold Palmer .He was The King of our sport and always will be, Jack Nicklaus said.Palmer never much cared for the regal honorific. His roots were in western Pennsylvania, and with sinewy wrists, a whip of a swing, a swaggering glint in his eye he carried an entire sport into a new age. Palmer and TV came along at the same time.If it wasnt for Arnold, golf wouldnt be as popular as it is today, Tiger Woods said.Palmer won seven majors and 62 PGA tournaments, and his rivalry with Nicklaus gave golf its juice.Palmer had a daring game, gamblers instinct and a connection to the gallery that liberated golf from its country-club enclaves.Pat Summitt, 64When she was 38 and deep into a pregnancy Pat Summitt insisted on making a recruiting trip to Pennsylvania. The timing was off for the Tennessee basketball coach.Her water broke while she was making her recruiting pitch. A frantic ride to the airport followed, although Summitt was the calmest one around. The plane was prepared to stop in Virginia. But Summitt, who bleeds Volunteer orange, wouldnt hear of it. Her child would be born in Tennessee. And so he was.Her stare could crack steel. Her authority was unchallenged. She coached 38 years at Tennessee and became the first NCAA coach to reach 1,000 wins. Her showdowns with UConn counterpart Geno Auriemma became the sports signature rivalry.She moved womens basketball into big-time arenas. Her coaching _ and her life _ was cut short by early onset dementia. But when the conversation turns to the games greatest coaches _ man or woman _ Pat Summitts name is part of it.Jose Fernandez, 24Maybe its best to remember the succession of batters flailing at his pitches; his Cuban grandmother in the stands; the exuberance of him pounding the dugout railing, the pure and simple joy of baseball.But other images are just as indelible: his No. 16 carved into the pitching mound dirt in his honor; the trumpets haunting notes of Take Me Out to the Ball Game.Jose Fernandez fled Cuba by boat at age 15, making a successful escape on his fourth attempt. But as the sea proved a starting point to stardom, so it was the finish. On a September night after a game, Fernandez and two friends died when their boat crashed at high speed into rocks near Miami Beach. The medical examiner would rule alcohol and cocaine were in his system.Fernandez was twice an All-Star for the Miami Marlins and had a 38-17 record in four seasons. He was NL Rookie of the Year in 2013, with a future possibly pointed to Cooperstown.Sadly, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest.Contributing to this report were AP sports writers Tim Dahlberg, Doug Ferguson, Larry Lage, Steve Megargee, Tim Reynolds and Steven Wine.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

(source: AP) A second US official said the issue would be high on the agenda when Obama and Xi meet on the margins of an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru. (source: AP)President Barack Obama will use his final meeting with Chinas President Xi Jinping Saturday to press for an increase in the pace and severity of sanctions against North Korea. With Pyongyang launching test after provocative test to develop a miniaturized nuclear warhead and a missile capable of delivering that deadly payload to the United States, Obamas White House wants to ratchet up the pressure before he leaves office in January.Watch what else is making news:Contributing to the tensions as the United States undergoes a transfer of power to President-elect Donald Trump, is the possibility that North Korea will see it as a prime opportunity to test an inexperienced new US commander in chief. In an interview ahead of Obamas last foreign trip, his National Security Advisor Susan Rice told AFP that the United States would work with allies and at the UN to put increased and maximum pressure on North Korea.We dont view their progressive development of their capabilities as being anything other than a significant threat to our interests and that of our allies. This pressure, she said, has been building and will continue to build, certainly through the duration of this administration.A second US official said the issue would be high on the agenda when Obama and Xi meet on the margins of an Asia-Pacific summit in Lima, Peru. The US intelligence estimate of North Koreas nuclear-missile program is classified. But military officials have said its prudent to assume North Korea could already have some capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States atop an intercontinental ballistic missile.North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests this year and test-fired a series of missiles. Sanctions are already in the works at the United Nations to target North Koreas coal exports to China, diplomats said  a vital source of revenue for the regime. Pyongyang has used loopholes in previous sanctions to increase coal exports by as much as 60 percent, netting more than 100 million dollars a month in much needed income.North Koreas reclusive leaders are estimated to have spent billions of dollars on weapons programs, while as many as 18 million of North Koreas 25 million people face food shortages, according to the Japanese government.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP Photo) Some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a choice of whether to quit because of concern that a Trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. (AP Photo)Some Republican foreign policy veterans who came out against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign said on Wednesday they were sticking to their guns following his election victory, but a few others signaled that objections to serving in his new administration were softening. Trumps stunning upset over Democrat Hillary Clinton has created a new dilemma for the Republican national security establishment, much of which had publicly distanced itself from their own partys candidate, declaring him unfit to lead. They must now decide whether to return to the fold.Some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are also facing a choice of whether to quit their posts because of concern that a Trump presidency would violate their principles, or else stay and try to influence policy from the inside. However, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said, I wouldnt expect a mass exodus. About 150 of the Republican partys most prominent national security specialists signed open letters in March and August in outright opposition to Trumps candidacy. One said he was utterly unqualified for the White House. The other warned that he would be the most reckless president in American history.Watch: Republican Donald Trump Becomes 45th US PresidentWhile neither letter said the former officials would never work for Trump, their scathing critique was clearly intended to discourage fellow Republicans from supporting him. Trump responded at the time by deriding them as members of the failed Washington elite who deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place. A number of the signatories contacted by Reuters on Wednesday made clear that they were unswayed from their negative view of Trump and would not work for him.However, they stopped short of urging others to also shun the next administration, which is widely seen as having limited foreign policy expertise at a time when the next president will face the challenges of Syrias civil war, the fight against Islamic State, a newly assertive Russia and the rise of China.I dont expect to be asked. I wouldnt serve. But there are others who will. It will be a matter of individual conscience, said Eliot Cohen, who served as counselor to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and helped spearhead the March letter, which was posted on a blog called War on the Rocks and created a stir among Republicans.Im concerned about his ignorance, the belligerence, the misunderstanding of how the world works, Cohen said of Trump, a wealthy real estate developer and former reality TV host who rode to victory on a wave of voter anger toward Washington insiders.Max Boot, a foreign policy adviser to Republican Mitt Romneys 2012 presidential campaign and a supporter of the U.S.-led Iraq invasion in 2003, said: I wont have anything to do with Trump, but I dont know about others. I hope good people go into the government.WAITING AND WATCHINGBut others appeared to waver, with some saying decisions on whether to join the Trump administration could depend on how the president-elect behaves during the transition and who he appoints to senior posts. Among the Trump allies said to be in consideration are former House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and one-time United Nations ambassador John Bolton for secretary of state, and General Michael Flynn, a former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, for national security adviser.Dov Zakheim, a former Pentagon undersecretary who signed one of the dissent letters, said Trump would have to reach out beyond his circle of supporters to find enough qualified people to fill many important jobs.He will want to show that he is not dividing the Republican party, so he will extend an olive branch to those in the party who opposed him, Zakheim said. Asked whether he expected to be offered a post, he said: I have no idea, as its not up to me.Bryan McGrath, a retired US Navy officer and co-organizer of the War on the Rocks letter, said he did not expect that those who signed it were signing away employment rights, that they werent going to work in a Trump administration. If the president asks for your service, he said, you have to take that request seriously.Patrick Cronin, an Asia expert and former third-ranking official at USAID under President George W. Bush, said that despite his earlier opposition to Trump, he eventually briefed his transition team and would continue to provide advice. But he said he was not interested in joining the administration.Michael McFaul, President Barack Obamas former ambassador to Moscow and a Clinton supporter in the election, said the Republicans had a deep bench of experience for enlisting foreign policy experts. Even as Trump prepares to form his foreign policy team, some career diplomats, intelligence officials and military officers are facing a post-election quandary.Some said privately before Tuesdays vote they would consider retiring or quitting rather than working under Trump, who alarmed them during the campaign by questioning US-led alliances, praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting that Japan and South Korea should be allowed to have nuclear weapons and threatening to order the resumption of interrogation methods condemned as torture.Other officials suggested they would wait to see how he acts once in office and who he names to senior posts, saying the responsibility for government service transcended any one president.If he keeps some of his campaign promises, about the use of torture, for example, many of us have discussed whether we are honor-bound to resign or to stay and try to have some influence from the inside.

Since MSP is already announced, at this stage declaration of bonus can be considered as an option.Hence, I request the Government of India to announce bonus of Rs 700 for ragi and jowar over and above MSP to help small and marginal farmers at one hand and benefit the poor consumers on the other, he said.In a representation made to the Agriculture Ministry, the Karnataka Chief Minister said that the state wants to promote production of these two nutri-cereals, which are climate smart crops can be grown in rainfed and drought-prone areas.Since these two millets are far superior from nutrition point of view when compared with rice and wheat, the state government has started supplying ragi and jowar through the public distribution system, he said.There is a need to promote cultivation of these millets by giving good support price, Siddaramaiah said because at present total acreage and production of ragi and jowar in the state are showing a decline.Ragi acreage has come down to 7.08 lakh hectare in 2014-15 from 9.39 lakh hectare in 2015-06, while jowar area has come down to 10.46 lakh hectare from 15.20 lakh hectare in the said period, he said.In addition to low yields, prices of millet at the farm gate level are also very low and farmers lose money by cultivating millets.

(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan)Colombias government and Marxist guerillas said on Saturday they agreed on a revised peace deal to end a 52-year war, six weeks after the original was narrowly rejected in a referendum amid objections it was too favorable to the rebels. The government and Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who have been holding talks in Havana for four years, said in a joint statement they had incorporated proposals from various groups in the new deal.Watch What Else Is Making NewsWe call upon all Colombia and the international community to back this new accord and its quick implementation so as to leave the tragedy of war in the past, the statement read. Peace cannot wait anymore. However, former President Alvaro Uribe, who led opposition to the original accord, said his camp and victims of the conflict, which has killed more than 220,000 and displaced millions, should be able briefly to study the new deal before it is implemented.I have asked the president that the texts they announce in Havana not be definitive, he said in a statement posted on his Twitter account, adding that the opposition might want to make further tweaks. Details of the new deal were to be made public later on Saturday. Colombias lead government negotiator, Humberto de la Calle, said one main change is a requirement the FARC present a complete inventory of its assets, which are destined for victim compensation.The new accord also takes foreign magistrates off special peace tribunals, although there will be foreign observers, and stipulates the FARC must turn in exhaustive and detailed information about its involvement in the drugs trade, de la Calle said. No details were released on whether the deal addresses the main concerns of the Uribe-led opposition, namely guaranteed congressional seats for the FARC and immunity from traditional jail sentences for leaders.This accord is better insofar as it resolves many criticisms and dissatisfactions, de la Calle said. Like the first one, it will not have unanimous acceptance, but we hope that it will have more solid support.

(Source: AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe) Thongpoon Unjit, second left shows weeds he plucked during harvesting his organic rice-field in Buriram, close to the Sarus cranes acclimating center in Thailand. (Source: AP Photo/Gemunu Amarasinghe)A fuzzy-headed baby sarus crane hatched on a rural farm this fall offers a glimmer of hope for wildlife conservationists, organic farming advocates and a nation grieving after the death of their beloved king. Thats because this chubby chick named Rice is the first of its auspicious species to survive after hatching in the wild in Thailand in 50 years.Watch what else is in the newsThe tallest flying birds in the world, 70 incubator-hatched, hand-fed sarus cranes have been raised and released over the past five years in Thailands farm-rich northeast province of Buriram, whooping their startling two-toned song at dawn.The older generations told us about these cranes, they said they bring luck, but when I actually saw one in my field I was so excited, village leader Thongpoon Unjit said.He and dozens of other farmers stopped using pesticides and parked their noisy tractors to help the birds survive. They hand-harvest for acres and leave large swaths untouched around nests.Already the birds have brought good fortune: The farmers organic rice sells for a premium at Bangkok supermarkets.Forty-two of the cranes released in the wild have survived so far, and eight are living in monogamous pairs. But until now none have managed to successfully reproduce. Rice, now about a month old, likely pecked its little sibling to death, but thats to be expected, say the experts.Its been really fun to watch this family, said visiting ornithologist George Archibald, spying on the yellow-brown hatchling and its magenta-topped parents through a spotting scope. Ive been really touched by the intimacy of the parents to their juvenile. Theyre just continually watching that chick.Archibald, co-founder of the International Crane Foundation, has advised Thai animal scientists throughout their efforts to reintroduce sarus cranes, 6-foot-tall birds listed as vulnerable globally and extinct in Thailand.There are many challenges facing these cranes, said Archibald. Will the farmers tolerate a little bit of damage in their rice fields? Will there be too many powerlines? Will the cranes fly into them? Will this landscape that has been absolutely transformed by modern man have a place thats safe for these enormous birds?Thailands sarus crane colony disappeared in the 1960s after farms took over their habitat, pesticides wiped out the snakes and crabs they eat and hunters killed them for their bright plumage. To bring them back, scientists borrowed a few sarus cranes from neighboring Cambodia, where a rare flock lives in a refuge. The United Nations Development Program helped pull together more than $1.5 million for sarus cranes and two other endangered species in Thailand.But raising any type of crane to survive in the wild is a delicate matter, in large part because the birds tend to imprint on humans around them. Wildlife biologists who feed, care for and transport the birds from zoo incubators to temporary outdoor habitats wear fake crane suits to stop the birds from bonding.At the Korat Zoo last week, birdkeeper Sarawut Wongsombat, sweating in his white gown, opened and closed a large sarus crane puppet mouth in his right hand while waving a tiny tilapia in front of the beak of an 8-day-old chick that wobbled on its skinny legs. The little bird refused the fish again and again, shaking its head and hopping away. But when Sarawut took a break, the curious chick gobbled a few mealworms it found in a bowl, followed by some pink vitamin water.He did OK for his first meal, said Sarawut, pulling off the costume.About 100 miles north, two sarus cranes were released just one day earlier, hopping into a wetland from the arms of their Mom and Dad, animal scientists Tanat Uttaraviset and Natawut Wanna, wearing gray-white gowns with hoods and fabric flapping wings.The shaky fledglings, who had spent the past three months in a temporary mesh shelter in the wetland, hopped around and flapped their wings before launching on their first flights.Standing thigh-high in a bog next to an organic rice paddy, conservationists watched nervously as the birds theyd help raise each flapped a large loop over the field. Its a dicey moment when a sarus crane first flies: Sometimes they crash into trees. Other times they face plant on touchdown.On this day both aced their landings.More of these releases are slated for later this month. Organizers plan a ceremony with the Environmental Ministry to introduce nine adolescent sarus cranes into the wild, honoring King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died Oct. 13 at age 88. The birds are considered good luck, and better yet, the number nine honors the king, who was known as Rama IX for his place in the nations dynasty.Bhumibols legacy includes his concern for upcountry rice farms, where he introduced sustainable, environmentally friendly methods.It will be a great way to honor the king, with these special birds, said Nathanik Klaklangsmorn of the U.N. Development Program.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(source: AP) At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. (source: AP)Bangladesh is set to make a splash at the UN climate talks in Morocco when experts and officials present a proposal for a national body to deal with the losses and damage the low-lying South Asian nation expects to suffer from climate change. The body, if established, would be a first among developing countries vulnerable to worsening droughts, floods, storms and rising seas  all threats to development in Bangladesh, where about a third of people live beneath the poverty line.Saleemul Huq, director of the Dhaka-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development  who chaired an expert group on developing a National Mechanism on Loss and Damage  said the proposal had been given to the Bangladeshi prime minister, who is due in Marrakesh early next week.Watch what else is making news:I am pleased to see that the government of Bangladesh is taking such a pro-active position at the national level on this important topic, Huq said.Loss and damage from climate change has been a controversial topic at the UN talks over the past decade, mainly because it asks a tough question: Who should pay to repair the harm done by planet-warming emissions? Aid agencies say loss and damage occurs when stresses made worse by climate change  such as creeping deserts or rising seas  are too severe for people to overcome. That can mean losing your home as shores and river banks crumble, no longer being able to farm a degraded plot of land, or even the disappearance of culture after communities are scattered by repeated weather disasters.Following push-back from industrialised countries worried about being forced to pay for the cost of climate damage, governments agreed in 2013 to create the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage associated with Climate Change Impacts (WIM).At the Paris climate summit last year, developing countries won a hard-fought battle to secure its existence as part of the new global climate change accord. But for that happen, they had to accept a stipulation that the loss and damage provision in the agreement does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation  a demand from the United States backed by other rich nations.At the November 7-18 climate change talks in Marrakesh, negotiators are sparring over when and how to conduct a planned review of the WIM, which has had little more than a year to get going on its key tasks. They include setting up a clearing house for information on climate risk insurance and a task force on climate-linked displacement.HOT POTATOBut it is the financing of measures to address loss and damage that remains the key sticking point.Who should pay for it? The hot potato of responsibility is being moved around, said Olivia Serdeczny, a research analyst with Climate Analytics and an advisor to vulnerable countries on loss and damage. The sources of finance is an issue that remains untouched. Most of the discussions around finance for loss and damage have focused on providing insurance against disasters  a popular measure with rich nations.In June 2015, for example, G7 states announced an effort to increase by up to 400 million the number of people in low and middle-income countries with access to insurance coverage against climate-related hazards, by 2020. But aid experts argue insurance cannot be the only financial tool to help people faced with loss and damage.Harjeet Singh of the global charity ActionAid said insurance does not work well for longer-term shifts such as sea-level rise and melting glaciers. But there is a reluctance to move beyond insurance on the part of developed states in the UN loss and damage discussions, he noted.CARE International says the WIM should develop instruments that can generate $50 billion in new cash annually by 2020. Sven Harmeling, climate change advocacy coordinator for the development agency, said there was a growing awareness that other types of funding would be needed, beyond insurance.At this stage, no one denies there is a problem, he said. There is a bit of a progress in terms of willingness to discuss what process might work, but not in terms of We will pay for the damage.ADAPTATION LIMITSThat is a key reason for this weeks hiccup in Marrakesh over the review of the WIM, which was due to be completed at these talks. Developing countries want the review to happen over the next year and cover the future of the mechanism, while developed countries fear that could trigger new demands over finance. Either way, it is clear the thorny problem wont just disappear, and needs more work.In a recent paper, Austrian researchers Reinhard Mechler and Thomas Schinko at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis said major scientific challenges remain, in particular to better understand the physical and social limits of adaptation  in other words, where loss and damage starts. Making more accurate projections of rising climate risks and the associated costs of measures to prevent and respond to loss and damage could help move the discussion forward, they added.In the meantime, Bangladesh is not waiting around. A 2010 World Bank study estimated the country would lose some $121 billion, or 5 percent of national GDP, between 2005 and 2050 due to climatic variability, including impacts such as a fall in rice production. Singh said the proposal to set up a national mechanism for loss and damage was a way of trying to speed solutions.It is saying we need to make progress faster at the international level, and we are ready to act at the national level, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

They came from a bus stand on the fringe of an SC colony, camouflaged by a giant cutout of the departed leader and temporarily converted to a mourning centre. Inside, three elderly women held a microphone and sang paeans to Jayalalithaas populist schemes as a group of younger women huddled together on the floor, wailing.It was quiet, almost as if the highway had fallen silent to mourn the death of Amma  the only traffic was that of cars and SUVs carrying AIADMK flags, ferrying party cadre to Chennai, 180 km away.At villages along the highway, temporary shelters had appeared overnight to pay tributes to Jayalalithaa.

The bigger leaders were not interested in funding this since Amma is gone and there is no one really to impress in Chennai now, said Shekhar.The death of Amma is a big loss for all sections of society, especially for us. With our meagre earnings, we could not have afforded many of the things that she gave us through her schemes.

One dollar buys nearly 1,900 bolivars on the street, compared to just 10 bolivars at the governments strongest official rate.This means that importers bringing products in on the black market are paying even more and passing those costs onto consumers, fueling inflation that the IMF says will surpass 2,000 percent next year.Anger is mounting and hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks hoping for change. Some though, are pleased with the festive respite.Its better that at least we can celebrate a little amid all these problems, at least the children, said Karina Mora, as she left a supermarket in the center of Caracas with her two small children.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo) Little cash at rural bank at Orccha, but not many are angry. (Source: Express photo)AS CASHIER Pyare Lal Sahu sorts a stack of hundred-rupee notes, a timid hand stretches out a passbook from across the counter. You will have to do with Rs 500, Sahu says. Next is an old woman, speaking in Gondi language. The man next in line translates: her granddaughter is unwell, and needs to be taken to Narayanpur, the district headquarters, 65 km away. Sahu stops laughing; his hands move faster  I cant give you more than Rs 2000. There will be others like you too, he says.Watch what else is making news:In Orccha, in the part of Chhattisgarh they call Abhujmaad (literally, the land of the unknown), with no ATM and one state-run rural bank, its two employees have to play the sole judge on who needs what.Abhujmaads 4,000 sq km that is still largely devoid of government presence. In fact, it was opened to unrestricted access for outsiders only in2009. It can be entered through Bijapur and Dantewada, but Orccha, the block headquarters, is generally seen as the gateway top Abhujmaad.At the one-room Chhattisgarh Rajya Gramin Bank, Sahu  there is only the bank manager S K Dhruv, besides him  says, The government doesnt send money here. I have to go to Narayanpur, 65 km away, to bring new currency here. I go twice a week, and the bank remains closed on both days. It takes the entire day to go and return. So when I get back, people have already been waiting for two days.Even Narayanpur, the district headquarters, is considered backward, says Dhruv, so forget money for Orccha. Sometimes we can bring back Rs 50,000; other days a little more. We can meet only 25 per cent of the demand for cash. Which is why we evaluate based on need.Yet, there is little anger for the few people in the queues. For in Abhujmaad, with almost near-absence of markets or tradable commodities other than essential foodstuff, cash has never really meant much. We have little requirement for cash. The government society gives rice at Rs 1 per kg, and those who dont avail of that, grow what they eat in the forest. We dont use oil for cooking, and everything is boiled in water. We hunt when we want to. Why do we need cash, asks Hunga, who lives in Jubada village.Kosa, from Gadadi, adds, In the rains, with no roads, we get cut off for months anyway. We survive on our own, and trade for goods with each other. We dont need much cash.Locals do have one word of warning though, which bank officials warily agree with. While cash may not be of utmost importance, the one occasion itdoes mean something of importance is during melamadi, which begins in January. This is when all villagers will come out, walk for kilometres, and reach markets in bigger centres such as Orccha and Chhote Dongar, a local teacher says. They buy utensils, new clothes, and there is festivity. If that essential part of tribal custom is put in danger, there will be anger against the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a2e317be9e033fa430356,Meet the Asurs — a marginal tribe that describes Durga as a goddess who enticed Mahishasur,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/meeting-the-asurs-a-marginal-tribe-in-eastern-india/,2016-12-08,"HRD Minister Smriti Irani expressed shock in Parliament at anyone describing Durga as a goddess who entices Mahishasur, a brave, self-respecting leader.Its true that we have never celebrated Durga Puja, says Chamru Asur. It is also true that we remain inactive during those nine days and, at the end of it, make offerings to our ancestors so that we are all safe, says the 70-year-old at his home in Sakhuapani, a village 500 metres from the Hindalco Groups Gurdari bauxite mine in Gumla district of Jharkhand.WATCH VIDEO: The Earliest Known Ramleela In Chitrakoot Preserved In Its Original FormOn February 24, after reading from a pamphlet purportedly distributed in Jawaharlal Nehru University, which, the minister said, had depicted Durga in poor light and Mahishasur as the victim, Irani had said, What is this depraved mentality? I have no answers for it.As he speaks about his traditions and way of life, Chamru is almost passive  not apologetic, not defensive, not angry, not seeking answers.Chamru is an Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group that dominates Sakhuapanis population of about 2,000 and lives in villages spread over a radius of 10 to 20 km. Besides Jharkhand, members of the tribe live in pockets of Bihar, West Bengal and a few other states. The 2011 Census put the number of Asurs at 22,459 in Jharkhand and 4,129 in Bihar.Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey) Chamru with his wife in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you, he says. (Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)The Asurs claim to be descendants of Mahishasur, the buffalo-demon whom Goddess Durga kills after a spirited fight lasting nine nights. Its this mythology in mainstream Hinduism thats celebrated in the form of the nine-day-long Durga Puja, but observed as Mahishasur Dasain among the Asurs, who hold a period of mourning during which they largely stay indoors.Chamru says that even when he was a child, though people had their beliefs and biases, nobody attacked them for it, they merely thought they were different. Those were the days of zamindari. The zamindar of Bishunpur (now the local police station) would ask us to get wood and collect leaves for making pattals for the puja. We would go there, give the zamindar all this and also give him some of our tools. We would then return home before the celebrations began and offer prayers seeking protection from our own ancestors, says Chamru.WATCH VIDEO: Dussehra Celebration At Red FortNow as these cultures are seen as offending, Chamru says these are just beliefs. I have heard we are descendants of Mahishasur. Thats all I can tell you. I cant tell you how our descendants settled down in this part of the country and so on, he says.***Sushma Asur, a tribal activist in Sakhuapani, says the community also celebrates Sohrai, which coincides with Diwali, by applying koronj (or karanja in Hindi) oil on their navel, chest and nose, and eat cucumber. The symbolism here is that when our ancestor Mahishasur was killed, he had blood oozing from his navel, nose and chest. Applying oil on those parts depicts the same. Eating cucumber is a symbol that we are avenging his death by eating the kaleja (liver) of the killer, Sushma explains.In her 20s, Sushma says she has studied up to Class XII and is working with tribal activists to revive our lost traditions, songs and skills. Over the years, she says, there are several of these traditions that have given way to modern practices of the outsiders.Asurs, she says, were once iron smelters, but now the village doesnt have a smelting unit. Chamru says he used to make small weapons, but I have forgotten all that now. According to one of the theories, the Magadh Empire benefited a lot from the weapons the Asurs made. Their iron does not catch rust. And we know there are many Ashokan-era edicts on iron that havent rusted, says Ashwani Kumar Pankaj, a tribal activist in Ranchi.Traditionally, Asurs dont drink cow milk. We want the calf to have all the milk and grow up strong so that it can be used in the fields, says Anil Asur, Sushmas brother. Villagers still dont drink much milk or tea, happy instead to down a glass of rice beer.***Carron tea estate in West Bengals Jalpaiguri district is hundreds of kilometres away from Jharkhands Sakhuapani village. Its here, down a hillock carpeted with emerald-green tea bushes, that Bargi Asur, 83, lives with his family. Reading a Hindi newspaper in the courtyard of his house, Bargi introduces himself as the oldest resident of Asur Line, a colony of about 100 mud and bamboo huts in the tea estate. Bargi says he isnt surprised that the minister said what she did in Parliament. She is not the first person to say our beliefs are wrong. For centuries, we have been afraid to talk about them openly. Now we carry out our rituals almost apologetically, says Bargi, whose son and grandchildren converted to Christianity a few years ago.At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta) At the Carron tea estate, tribals observe Asur puja twice a year; women later participate in a dance. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Bargi himself chose not to convert because he wouldnt be able to adjust to a new way of life. My two sons and my grandchildren work as tea pickers at the estate. Thats what I have done all my life too. I couldnt give them a better life, maybe a new faith will bring some light in their lives, he says.Bargi belongs to a group of about 1,000 Asurs, who moved from Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh in the early 20th Century and work and live near the tea gardens of Jalpaiguri. My father moved here in 1914 to work for a British tea planter. We have lived here ever since. Its been more than a century now, he says.Jagannath Singh, 67, a social worker who used to work as a primary school teacher at the Carron tea estate school, says the story of the Asurs is like that of most other particularly vulnerable tribal groups of the country, but with a cruel twist. Apart from abject poverty, they also have to deal with social stigma. The Asurs in Jalpaiguri were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe only in 2014, after years of struggle, says Singh.He says that of the 101 Asur families living in Carron tea estate, more than 90 have converted to Christianity. They have little choice. They feel this new identity will give them a better life, he says.Yet, some find ways to keep both their new and old identities. We observe Asur puja twice a year, once during the month of Phagun (March-April) and once during Dusshera. The puja can be performed only by men, and women later participate in a traditional asura dance, says Etwari Asur, 75.Lalita Asur, 38, who works in the estate and had converted to Christianity about five years ago, says life has taught her to be careful about revealing her true identity. Why should I claim to be Mahishasurs descendant? Am I mad? she laughs. A lot of us have taken on different surnames such as Topo and Kajur, says Lalita.Over the years, the Asurs, both of Jalpaiguri and of Sakhuapani in Jharkhand, have migrated to cities in search of jobs, most youngsters dont speak the Asuri language any more and their worries are as mainstream as any other. The only thing they hold on to are memories  of stories told by their parents, of childhood fears and anxieties.Back in Sakhuapani village of Jharkhand, Sushma recalls how over the years she began getting acutely aware of the fact that the asurs or demons were always depicted as ugly and were primarily painted black. All demons are dark-skinned, ugly and evil. Now, we trace our lineage to them. Tell me, do we look like anything like that? she asks.

(Express Photo by Prashant Pandey)Expert column: Struggle for survival, not of faithThe term tribal defies any universal definition. Between the Maoris of New Zealand, the Aborigines of Australia and the Indigenous People of North America, there is a shared historical fact. They were all there before the colonial powers pushed them to margins. This is not so in the case of all tribal communities in India.Some of the Indian tribes such as the Onges and the Jarawas of Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been entirely indigenous. Some others like the Banjaras in Western and Central India and the Gujjars in the Himalayas have been nomadic. And, some, such as several sub-groups of Bhills, have migrated in various historical phases to their present geographical locations. The stories of migration of such communities are found in their oral traditions. The diverse histories of tribes in India are seen among the Particularly Vulnerable Groups as well. The term primitive used for them at one time has fortunately been declared as pejorative.

590a301a7be9e033b96eba5c,Egypt: resentment against Sisi mounting,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/580048/egypt-resentment-against-sisi-mounting.html,2016-11-08,"Egypt: resentment against Sisi mountingBy Michael Jansen, Nov 09, 2016, 23:31 ISTEgyptians threaten to launch a Revolt of the Poor on Nov 11 to protest soaring prices, lack of clean drinking water, shortage of sugar and cooking oil, cutting fuel subsidies, and new taxes.The movements Facebook page has more than 1,00,000 followers who are urged to oust the corrupt regime and liberate the country from those who have betrayed and humiliated the Egyptian people.In mid-October, an anonymous tuk-tuk (auto) driver castigated the government headed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi for investing billions of dollars in high profile developments but spending little on providing food, education, agriculture and health care for the countrys struggling poor.You watch Egyptian television and (Cairos) like Vienna, you go out in the street and its like Somalias cousin. We had sufficient sugar and enough rice before the last presidential election and we even exported it... They squander our money on so-called national projects that are useless and education in Eg-ypt is very bad, even worse than you can imagine, he told an independent television channel.The video was picked up by social media and viewed by millions before it was removed, prompting angry Egyptians to accuse the government of repressing criticism of its rule and the authorities to mount fresh arrests of dissidents.Cairo has serious reasons for concern. The widely watched video was followed by the self-immolation of a taxi driver in the port city of Alexandria to condemn rising costs. The 2011 Arab Spring uprising across the Arab world was triggered when a Tunisian vegetable vendor set himself alight to protest police harassment.Few Egyptians believe the Revolt of the Poor could draw tens of thousands to Cairo's iconic Tahrir (Liberation) Square as did the demonstration on January 25, 2011, and over the next 17 days, topping 30-year president Hosni Mubarak.However, the volatile situation is unpredictable. Organisers of the 2011 event had told Deccan Herald at that time they had not expected more than 150 to turn up in response to the social media call for a rally. Over 50,000 took part.The crackdown on all dissent since the army ousted president Muhammad Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood stalwart, in July 2013, has united the opposition consisting of supporters of the outlawed Brotherhood and the marginalised secular revolutionaries who led the 2011 mass campaign.Army chief Sisi  who both removed and succeeded Morsi  was elected president by 97% of voters who expected him to address the demands of the uprising: Bread, freedom and social justice. He has failed to do so, turning Egyptians against him and undermining the respect enjoyed by the army.Todays conditions are very different from the days of the uprising. At that time, riot police and security officers attacked the protesters with birdshot, water cannon and lathis.The army stayed aloof, prom-pting demonstrators to shout, The people and army are one hand! Today, the army is blam-ed for the collapse of the economy, the suppression of political dissent, massive spending on trophy projects and corruption.Finally, Morsis ouster unleashed anti-government attacks by Brotherhood backers and prompted jihadis linked to al-Qaeda and Islamic State to step up violence against the army and police in the Sinai Peninsula and mount operations in Cairo and elsewhere.Getting priorities wrongSisi would have had nothing to worry about if he had halted the collapse of the economy. Enlargement of the Suez Canal, a main revenue source, has failed to bring in more money.Money invested in a nuclear power plant and a new administrative centre outside Cairo was ludicrous at a time 40% of 94 million Egyptians live below the poverty line. Sisi got his priorities wrong. Soaring prices of state-subsidised food deny Egyptians sustenance while the lack of schools, health centres, and jobs deny Egyptians a decent future.Egypt has only $19.6 billion in foreign exchange reserves. Due to the low price of oil and strained relations between Cairo and Riyadh, Egypt can no longer expect huge injections of Saudi cash  $25 billion since 2011  to keep the country afloat.The lack of Saudi funds could not have come at a worse time for the economy. Tourism has fallen dramatically, imports are being reduced, and the currency is in free fall until the governm-ent devalued it by 48% and announced it would be allowed to float. This will increase costs for manufacturers and importers, including those who bring in rice, sugar and other essentials.Faced with demands for parliament to vote no confidence in the government, Prime Minister Sherif Ismail argued Egypt's economic collapse is due to the failure of former governments to embrace radical reform or make difficult decisions.Unfortunately, the difficult decisions his government is facing include the International Monetary Funds demand to raise taxes and reduce subsidies in exchange for a $12 billion loan, moves that could fuel the Revolt of the Poor whether or not it manages to mount protests on Nov 11 or not."

I am passionate about photography. I am all excited about the fair. I wonder how so many vendors selling the same produce can attract so many people at the same time, he says. Some who have been coming year after year feel the fair has lost its charm.I started coming here when I was a kid. It was a lot of fun. Now, with the swarming crowds, the place gets dirty soon. With vendors selling everything, the authenticity is lost, said Vijaya K, lecturer, BMS College.Clay idols, utensils, ceramic dolls, and soft toys have crept in, occupying the space that would otherwise be taken up only by groundnut stalls. Some old-timers say the fair has turned crassly commercial.The government can advertise this event better and promote it for tourism.

If the cash flow woes continued, the credit facility would be extended up to December end, he said. A government order to this effect would be issued on Friday.He said that BPL ration cardholders, who do not have money on hand due to the demonetisation, may draw foodgrain on credit right away. They would, however, be required to pay up along with their next months ration purchase.The Centre demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes without taking into consideration the common man. There is no ATM or banking system in many places, including forested and backward areas, inconveniencing many people. The state government did not want people to struggle to buy foodgrain. The matter was brought to the notice of the Chief Minister, who readily agreed to extend credit, said Khader.Khader said that the government would not incur any additional financial burden, as the ration shop owners would be asked to deposit the credit amount, once they collect the same from the beneficiaries. The government spends around Rs 42 crore a month on disbursal of foodgrain under PDS. Khader said the credit facility would be extended to APL cardholders too, if the need arises.There are as many as 20,778 ration shops in the state catering to 1.08 crore BPL cardholders. While rice is supplied free, a beneficiary spends around Rs 42 for other commodities, including oil, salt and sugar.Department officials said this months rations had already been disbursed. It is expected that less than 1% of the targeted cardholders may avail this benefit. Yet, officials apprehend logistical problems during implementation.DH News Service"
590a32907be9e033b96ebc7d,Interpreting History?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2016/nov/25/interpreting-history-1542538.html,2016-11-25,"I do not adhere to a simplistic idea such as history being distorted by leftist school of history. Production of any work of history has a bias, no doubt. Basic ethics demands we try to both acknowledge it and minimise it. From the critical reading of primary sources, we historians project ourselves as interpreters of a certain portion of the past. While literature accepts the suggested, the bias the untold, the folded, the manifold or the unfolded the interpretation of its narrative at different level, history claims objectivity. It interprets the text or the source but does not call for interpretation of its own narrative. True, there is historiography  how the history is written  is there to question the very ways and aims of history but still the temptation of a linear narrative looms large over mainstream history.Let us be cognitive. Memory is a way for our brain to operate and deal with the world. Roughly put, it helps to distinguish between what we need to get familiar with and what we should beware of. It is a matter of survival and a selective process since our brain cannot afford to pay attention to every single element around us. If memory was a hardware, then history would be a software borrowing many of the processes of the former: it selects and order elements.Let us be concrete. Say you wish to write an exhaustive history of any scene at any particular point in time. For the sake of simplicity, let us chose a simple and uneventful and apparently unloaded scene close to us, such as lunch in a canteen a day during the first week of November 2016 in Delhi. You have to enumerate and describe every element, its condition as well as its interaction, also how it got to be where it is. This means considering each single history. Regarding the persons present in the canteen (customers, staff and others), among the question to solve would be by what time did they reach? Why did they come there? How do they interact with each other? For which we need to know what is their background and all. It is important also to mention the history of the building since the way it is built will influence the way people live in it. The way it is built also has to do with who built it and who got it built and their respective history again. There we may consider the land and territory where it has been built, the furniture, the material What about the air in the building? Where is it blowing from? The smoke in the air leading to the peasants and farmers in the neighbouring States, their practicesAn exhaustive and comprehensive history of any scene in the world at any point in time practically leads to writing the history of the universe. We may reasonably consider it out of the reach. As a result, we select and build an order of things. It is built according to what seems to us the most important elements. Obviously it is subjective and interpretative. By the process of layers it even becomes inbuilt. This is why apart from cross-checking sources, and spelling out the methodology used, the best way to counterbalance this bias is to clearly spell it out and state the line of interpretation adopted.Furthermore, historians concerned with the big picture have to select among millions of parameters, facts, events and lives trying to devise the mechanisms at play. They engage in the pain-staking work of collecting hundreds or thousands of scholars work to give the fragmented picture a more coherent one. Nevertheless, the general perception of history tends to become like a narrative. The past and the present offer enough evidence of the frail character of human life, and therefore we prefer playing a part in the right plot. Complexity and contradictions are the collateral damages of the macro picture. Besides invocation of the past may convey the feeling to go beyond our physical limitation travel across time, and get initiated to the secret of the great scheme of things. It may be thrilling. Some schools of thought try to draw rules from human behaviours and actions. Some prefer to believe that humans are just impersonators of forces beyond them.Critical reading of documents and data, and cross-checking are made easier on a small scale. In the process of careful scrutiny often realise that the very object of our memory are more the reflection of our affect and preconceptions than anything else. In the smaller scheme of things, the role of historian is kind of a spoiler. The narrative becomes much less linear and unidirectional, much more contextualised. Under the magnifying glass the glossy becomes more nuanced, the smooth rougher. It opens unexpected horizons and alternate directions, dilemmas and leads to complexity.Everything moves, changes constantly, even rivers, mountains and continents. It is the reason why the quest of origin in which the general history is often drawn is by and large irrelevant. It does not stand the scrutiny. Like any other thing on earth, humans are constantly on the move at different paths. Over a crop no grain of rice is similar and its genes pool evolve after every seeding. It is a rule of nature when it comes to worldly matters and history after all deals with worldly matters. We ourselves constantly change. Ways to feel, look, act and comprehend the world were different. I often tell students that history requires actually way more ability to re-imagine the world, leaving one preconception aside, than literature even fantasy novels.History tells us therefore that there are many other ways to go about todays world too and to be wary of single mainstream narrative of any kind.History is born out of movements and changes. Just as the time it is out of our reach as soon as it has gone. Our memory processes even the most immediate past just like the editing and the post production of a movie. And there will be as many memories as there are witnesses. How to give voices to the polyphony of actors with their own subjectivity and sensibility? How do we give room to unrealized or near realised possible. Some historians in France, which always had an important stream of historiography recently published a work based on the concept of uchrony, i.e. what would have happened if things went a different way?The practice of history is indeed an attempt to escape from the clutches of unequivocal narrative and the illusion created by ways of need and convenience by our memory. It is ambiguous since it has to use the very ways of memory to evade it: remembrance, selection and interpretation. This safeguard is the very awareness of those processes, of their inner limitation and of the knowledge of alternate narratives, overlapping and conflicting. Political and religious stances may have their role to play in the interpretation of history but, as much as it is epistemologically possible, not in its making.(The writer is a historian and Associate Professor, Department of Sociology, Shiv Nadar University)"

(Illustration: Subrata Dhar) The UNCs objection to SADAR Hills is that it believes this land forms part of the ancestral Naga homeland and that the Kukis. (Illustration: Subrata Dhar)The Union government has finally woken up to the dangerous situation in Manipur and sent 4,000 Central paramilitary troops to control the ethnic tensions which have been building and are now threatening to spiral out of control. It should have done this at least a month ago, when as a consequence of an indefinite blockade on the lifelines of Manipur by the United Naga Council (UNC) over the anticipated creation of two new administrative districts, signs of retaliation from those at the receiving end of the blockade began showing. Violence erupted in an unprecedented way last Sunday when a mob of locals in the Khurai area  an outlying Imphal East township  overpowered a small detachment of police escorting a convoy of vehicles to Ukhrul district while staging a counter-blockade. After making the passengers dismount, the mob burned the vehicles along with the passengers belongings. In all, 21 vehicles were destroyed. Thankfully, no humans were targeted giving hope that the bitterness of the unfolding ethnic venom is still not beyond redemption.Since Sundays violence, curfew has been imposed in the two Imphal districts, both of which have mixed populations. In Imphal West, it is a night curfew and in the outlying Imphal East, it is an indefinite 24-hour curfew. As a precautionary measure, the government has also suspended mobile internet services to prevent the spread of inflammatory rumours.The UNC blockade began nearly a month-and-a-half ago on November 1, but Sundays incident still took everyone by surprise, even though many commentators have been predicting such a cataclysm if the UNC blockade continued and common folks livelihood was constantly under pressure over and above the difficulties heaped on them by demonetisation. The UNC blockade began over the possibility that the Manipur government would bifurcate Senapati district to give its SADAR Hills (Selected Area Development and Administrative Region) subdivision full-fledged district status, acceding to the long-standing demands of the residents of this sub-division, predominantly Kukis, but also Nepalis. SADAR Hills is located in the extended foothills in the north of the Imphal valley, with arms along the narrower foothills in the east and west of the valley, touching virtually every district of the state.The mountain ranges in the Eastern Himalayas generally run from north to south and, therefore, the foothills in the Imphal valley are much wider and deeper in the north and south than in the east and west. These foothills are flatter and better irrigated than the mountains further away, thus more suitable for wet rice agriculture. For reasons that have partly to do with the Nagas love for the higher mountains and partly due to the politics of colonial times, these foothills are generally inhabited by Kukis and aligned tribes.The mutual ethnic cleansing campaigns between the Kukis and Nagas in the mid-1990s following a quit notice served to Kukis in the hills  on that occasion by the UNC as well  have also ensured the concentration of Kukis in the region adjoining the valley. After those deadly clashes, which left over a thousand dead and many more displaced, SADAR Hills virtually became a district with its headquarters at Kangpokpi as Kukis found it difficult to negotiate official matters at Senapati. The UNCs objection to SADAR Hills is that it believes this land forms part of the ancestral Naga homeland and that the Kukis  who they see as migratory  can at best be their tenants, occupying the place only so long as they enjoy the pleasure of their landlords. They also see the Manipur governments move as an attempt to fracture this Naga homeland  often referred to as Nagalim  echoing the vocabulary of the underground Naga group, the NSCN(IM), in peace talks with the Government of India since 1997.Together with SADAR Hills, Jiribam, another tiny enclave on the Assam border adjacent to Silchar in the Barak Valley, was to be given district status. Since it is predominantly inhabited by non-Scheduled Tribe populations of Meiteis and Bengalis, Jiribam was till recently attached to the non-reserved Imphal East district 220 km away as a sub-division, and not to adjacent Tamenglong, a reserved district for STs for that would have created immense administrative and legal problems with regard to land ownership and enfranchisement. The Manipur government deferred the anticipated creation of these two districts in October end, but the UNC insisted on a definite official assurance that these districts will never be created without their consent and launched its indefinite blockades from November 1, the day the Kut festival of the Kukis is celebrated. This year it was an important date for the Meiteis too, for on their traditional lunar calendar this was also Ningol Chakkouba day, a traditional festival when married women come home for a feast with their siblings at their parental home.In the meantime, those demanding the SADAR Hills district also began threatening a blockade. This pressure group too has resorted to blockades in the past and there was no assurance they would not have done so again had the governments decision not been in their favour. In its wisdom, or the lack of it, after more than a month of the UNC blockade at midnight on December 8, the government decided to go ahead to let the matter go in the latter groups favour, creating not just the SADAR Hills district, but six more, splitting seven of the states existing nine districts in the process. The new districts are Kangpokpi (the new name for SADAR Hills) bifurcated from Senapati district, Noney from Tamenglong, Kamjong from Ukhrul, Tengnoupal from Chandel, Pherzawl from Churachandpur, Jiribam from Imphal East and Kakching from Thoubal. Predictably, the UNC hardened its blockade. In response, counter-blockades began to be organised in the valley areas too.These protests soon acquired the character of loose cannons hitting the wrong targets, and the damages have been immense. Instead of the government, those who ended up suffering are ordinary people, many of whom have little or no concern on whether there should be more districts or less in the state, so long as they can eke out their meagre earnings and daily bread. The friction began acquiring a communal hue too.The valley is especially embittered. It had little stake in the politics in the hill districts, except for the fact that the UNCs insistence on consolidation and the political autonomy of Nagalim corresponded with the NSCN(IM)s pursuit of an exclusive sovereign Naga nation carved out of neighbouring states, including a huge chunk of Manipur, and merged with Nagaland. It is ironic that the NSCN(IM) and UNC, who are pursuing grand themes of shared sovereignty and shared competencies with the Government of India are averse to any idea of a shared homeland with tribes and communities who also have been inhabiting the same tracts of lands as them.What has made the current crisis dangerous is that blockades embitter entire populations. The message is, I can throttle you to death if I please, and there is nothing you can do but submit. Unfortunately, the message is now felt mostly in the valley. Counter-blockades, therefore, sprang up in the valley that carry the same message, and reciprocal embitterment.In the non-Naga districts of Churachandpur, Thoubal and Imphal East, which too have been split, the governments move was welcomed. In the Naga districts too, except SADAR Hills, this was the case initially, but whatever their compulsions, they have now begun retracting their warm embrace of the new districts.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

With Moeen Ali (50), Jennings added 94 runs for the third wicket. (Source: Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)Sit down! Dont move! Keaton Jenningss girlfriend was about to get up from the chair when she was ordered to stay put. It was the voice of Kenneth Jennings, Keatons uncle, the sports psychologist who helped turn his career around. Keatons father Ray Jennings, former wicketkeeper and the disciplinarian coach, was with his wife in Mauritius on a holiday. Back in the Jennings home in South Africa, Uncle Ken was with Dylan, Keatons oldest brother, and his girlfriend. No one moved through the entire knock, rather wasnt allowed to move  a universally cute sentiment with the family members. The tension was ratcheting up, though, as the youngest boy of the family neared his hundred. A knock that would guide England to 288/5 at the end of day one.Kenneth laughs as he recalls the moment with The Indian Express before turning emotional. His brother Ray missed the greatest moment in his sons life as electricity conked off just before the stunning reverse sweep that brought up the ton. Kenneth was luckier. I was choking up, emotionally overwhelmed when he hit that reverse sweep. Dylan and I stood up and hugged each other. Did you see Keatons face? It was the most beautiful moment- that lovely smile spread across his face  I was so so happy. Has any debutant ever hit a reverse sweep to get a hundred before? I dont think so.It was indeed a stunning shot but its the background that makes it all that more startling. The man who reverse-swept to get to a debut hundred was a crabby, stroke-less, and score-less batsman in 2015. He had a tight defense but not much else. The runs dried up, confidence ebbed, and the English county Durham had to drop him mid-season. His captain Paul Collingwood had a frank chat, telling him that he needs to free himself up and improve his shot-making skills. That winter he headed home to South Africa and holed up with his father Ray Jennings, a tough old-school coach, and uncle Kenneth who is a sports psychologist. The transformational story of Keaton was about to begin.Ray, a wicketkeeper rated very highly by his contemporary Clive Rice and who was deprived of his best years owing to apartheid in South Africa, is a fascinating character in the cricketing landscape. He has had a huge influence in the rise of South Africas latest speedster Kagiso Rabada, and as a coach in the early years of Bangalore Royal Challengers, he was one of the first people who believed Virat Kohli could become the captain of India. A hard-nosed coach, a disciplinarian who insisted his sons also call him coachy, Ray sat with his brother Ken to work out a way.The trio worked on improving Keatons technical ability to hit the ball and widen his scoring areas. Ray started on the cricketing side of the affairs. Individual shots like the reverse sweep the one he would now be associated forever  and paddles were developed against the spinners. Cut and pull shots came into the scene against the seamers. In the past, he would tap and jab and largely populate the region behind point. Now the drives came out.Uncle Ken worked on the mind. They figured out early that Collingwood was right  He had to free himself. Keaton had to be made comfortable with himself, trust himself and most importantly be happy with himself. The young man was in some ways like his father  great work ethics but very hard on himself.Ken has worked with the South African national teams for both Rugby and cricket and slowly made headway into his nephews mind. He was hard on himself. The most important thing we worked on how to make him be happy with who he was.Ray didnt interfere in the mental side of things. Keaton and I worked on it. We first worked on the fear factor. Clear up his internal conversation so that he wasnt beating himself up. Top sportsmen have a habit of feeling fearful and he wasnt different. We had to get a routine going  how he talks to himself in between balls, and end of overs. Once the communication to himself was sorted out, and fear factor erased, we moved on.The next thing the uncle-nephew sweated on was about how to remain calm. Sometimes its as simple as just breathing between deliveries. Breathe out deliberately. It wasnt just the good times but his reaction to bad times that the uncle was interested in. When it goes bad, dont isolate yourself, in good times, enjoy but dont get too high.Keaton definitely didnt get high when the magical moment came up with a reverse sweep in Mumbai. In fact, it was a pretty muted celebration  the right fist went up, so did the bat, and a chat with the partner. The sober approach had something to do with the crowds reaction as well. The ground went a little bit dull, so I thought Id kind of mucked up (my numbers) a little and got it wrong. Then I looked up again at the board and realised Id got to a hundred. In that moment, you dont really want to jump around, go ballistic but the emotion, elation, pride, the satisfaction that went over me was really incredible. Its been an incredible day, an incredible 72 hours.An incredible year in fact. The man who returned to Durham for the 2016 season was a different entity altogether.From an okay second-team player to Matty Hayden! was how Collingwood framed the change. The bowlers who were once queuing up to bowl to him because he wouldnt punish them were now surprised. Runs flooded in and he finished as the highest scorer in county that season. Hundreds on turners against Jeetan Patel, the sweeps were visible, and the defence was now tighter than before.Its incredible, even if its me who its saying obviously biased that a boy who was supposed to have turned so defensive that he had forgotten how to play shots, played a reverse sweep to get to his hundred, Kenneth says. I was really happy that he chose that shot. Did I feel surprised? No, I thought it was the most clinically professional thing he did. He was fully in control. As a psychologist, I thought the fact that he chose that shot said everything about him, especially considering his recent background.It was the defensive technique that R Ashwin noticed and talked about. Early on in the piece, Bhuvneshwar Kumar pinged him on the pad just around the off stump. Immediately, the changes started to kick in. The front leg stopped getting too far across- moved more in front and the bat started to peep ahead of the bat.When Ashwin got a couple to spin past the forward prod, Jennings again made the quick changes. Rarely did he ever chase a offbreak. Even when he was beaten, he was almost always seen pushing inside the line. He didnt stab at them as Joe Root did, he didnt go across the line as Cook did, he didnt sweep half-heartedly as Johnny Bairstow did and he didnt go for aerial sweeps like Moeen Ali. It was an extremely tightly-constructed knock.The cuts and pulls had a whiff of Marcus Trescothick about them, the cover driving was not to dissimilar to Cooks and the reverse and paddles kept coming.Back in 2015, there was a fun golf event that Jennings took part with his county-mates. A ball was put on a tee, and they just had to smash it. Jennings would hit it further than anyone, and it made Collingwood tell him, Youve got the power, why not use it?Ray and Kenneth called each other after the knock. The video clip of the reverse sweep was sent by then to Ray and the talk revolved around how the knock was constructed, the first hour when the ball moved and bounced and how the kid handled the turn. Pride, joy and emotions filled the facetime talk.Keaton woke up with a start on Thursday morning, thinking he had over-slept and missed the team bus. It was just 5 am. Back in South Africa, Kenneth, Dylan and the girlfriends (Dylans and Keatons) also had gotten up at 5 am. They had a heavy breakfast, and poured themselves cups of coffee before they turned on the television. We didnt move after that. Only during the lunch break did we got out of chairs. Ray was doing something similar in Mauritius. One of my son is in Zurich, Switzerland, and other in the US  all of us were similar. Ray and I didnt exchange any texts when Keaton was batting!Uncle Ken isnt sure whether Keaton listened to his favourite song that he normally likes to play just before going out to bat. Its Wheels from Foo Fighters, and the lyrics go something like this:When the wheels come down (When the wheels come down)When the wheels touch ground (When the wheels touch ground)And you feel like its all overTheres another round for youFrom the horrors of 2015, through the transformation with uncle and dad in the winter, and to the magical feeling of a debut hundred, there has been definitely another round of Keaton and the family. What can I say? Neither Ray nor I even spoke about it after the hundred. We didnt have to say anything. It was the most emotional proud feeling for us. Beautiful, says Kenneth.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"
590a3a727be9e033fa430a11,Mother politics,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/jayalalithaa-dead-amma-dead-heart-attack-4414151/,2016-12-07,"Sasikala Natarajan (left)  a close friend of Jayalalithaa paid her respects at the Poes Garden home. (Source: AP) Sasikala Natarajan (left)  a close friend of Jayalalithaa paid her respects at the Poes Garden home. (Source: AP)As Sivakami, our domestic help and an ardent AIADMK supporter, dropped by yesterday morning, she was in tears. Watching the thousands throng Rajaji Hall for a last glimpse of J. Jayalalithaa on television, she was worried about her familys welfare entitlements. Her mother and maternal uncle, living in a village 200 km from Chennai, feel that a proposed increase in their old age/widow pensions, from Rs 1,000 per month to Rs 1,500 per month, may not happen with Jayalalithaas death. A widow with three teenage daughters, Sivakami was also concerned that the promised increase in marriage assistance for girl children may be stalled.The adulation for Jayalalithaa continues to perplex political observers, especially since her unexpected return to power, despite being seen as a non-performer, in the recent assembly elections. Defying pre-poll predictions, a three-decade electoral history and poor management of last years floods in Chennai that resulted in huge destruction of lives and property, Jayalalithaas victory raised questions, especially about her popularity among the Tamil voters.WATCH | J Jayalalithaas Life JourneyOne factor that really requires understanding is that women voters tend to vote for the AIADMK disproportionately. Two sets of data put forth by the Lokniti-CSDS survey, conducted around the recently concluded TN assembly elections, support this proposition. In regions where the women voters outnumbered male voters, the AIADMK had done exceedingly level. The survey also suggests that it was the womens vote, transcending caste divisions, that actually tilted the scales in favour of the AIADMK, despite several pre-poll and exit polls suggesting otherwise. Though a greater share of Dalits and minorities favoured the DMK, the AIADMK also won a bulk of the reserved constituencies.Big ticket investments and mega-infrastructure projects, that are seen as synonymous with development by the middle class, were hardly visible in her last tenure. In June 2015, The Economic Times carried a piece on the flight of firms from the state on account of what entrepreneurs perceived as inordinate delays, and demands for exorbitant payments. In a state with the highest share of youth in higher education, unemployment levels, especially among the more educated youth, continues to be high. Work is increasingly becoming casualised and precarious. Expectations that the huge investments made in private education by rural households will translate into gainful and dignified employment are belied. Lack of inner party democracy in the AIADMK mirrored the slew of defamation cases against political opponents and the increasing opaqueness in decision-making. It is this context that makes Jayalalithaas popularity even more confounding. While observers perceive a continuity in womens support for the AIADMK since MGR, it is important to recognise that this support has been sustained, reworked and probably enlarged through a consolidation of a model of welfare politics that the state has come to be known for.WATCH | 5 Lesser Known Facts About Sasikala NatarajanScholars attribute the success of Dravidian politics in the state to appeals based on two strands of populism  assertive and paternalist. Assertive populism rested on a mobilisation of a range of subaltern groups around a Tamil identity and involved efforts to address questions of social justice through reservations in higher education and public sector employment. Paternalist populism sought to cater to segments that tend to be excluded from schemes of assertive populism by providing them with subsidised wage goods, the nutritious noon meal scheme being the most well known. Though both parties may have adopted the twin strands of populism at different points, the DMK has historically been more associated with assertive populism and AIADMK with paternalist populism. In neoliberal India, however, the spaces of assertive populism have shrunk. Public sector employment has shrunk and so has the appeal to shoring up of Tamil identity given the rise of a middle class whose interests are no longer confined to the state. Since 2006, both parties have sustained paternal populist appeals. While the two parties have implemented several growth measures that are suggestive of neoliberal policy shifts, they have sought to simultaneously expand the social welfare net by competitive welfare politics. While clientelist practices such as distribution of public contracts to those close to party leaders are common, this has been accompanied by an expansion of what Andrew Wyatt, a longtime scholar of Tamil Nadus politics, refers to as programmatic politics. Programmatic politics refers to appeals made on a more universalist plank and involves offer of services or goods to anyone independent of party affiliation or support. Beginning with the offer of 20 kg of free rice through the PDS, programmatic welfare by both parties has extended to include provision of free gas stoves, television sets, laptops, mixer-grinders, goats and cows to rural households and upward revision of assistance given through pension schemes for different vulnerable groups. Since 2011, Jayalalithaa also launched the popular Amma canteens providing subsidised food in various urban centres. In other words, while there has been a decline in both quantity and quality of employment, the state has managed to sustain political support through provisioning of social security. What Jayalalithaa has not done is less apparent compared to what she has.Under these circumstances of declining employment potential in terms of both quality and quantity, the male bread winner model of sustaining reproduction of households is no longer tenable. Such a model, that informs many a radical demand for jobs and employment-related social welfare, is increasingly being called into question in the current phase of economic transformations in the low-income world where non-agricultural employment has been indecent at best and absent at worst. It is in this context that Jayalalithaas appeal to women voters through the slew of welfare measures, listed above, worked. She managed to position herself as a benevolent provider of social security amidst large-scale employment and income-related insecurities. The state has in a sense therefore replaced the male bread winner.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590a3aca7be9e033fa430a3b,Am I a bad mother or is my cooking that nasty?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2016/dec/15/am-i-a-bad-mother-or-is-my-cooking-that-nasty-1549089.html,2016-12-15,"When my first born was about a year old, I took him to my former place of work to meet friends and have lunch.Strapped into the highchair, my son was the epitome of good behaviour. No tantrums, tears or throwing things at passersby. He topped all of this with an action etched forever in my mind. He ate a sprouted bean.Oh my God! Your son is too good! Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled. I wanted to stand up and crow Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw!What else do you think he eats? He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal. Its the stuff of legends. Mothers love to cook, feed children and watch their cheeks become round and flushed with good health. We preen when our children eat well and despair when they dont. We take it personally. Good food habits in a child, good parenting after all.But we sometimes fail to take into consideration one thing: some kids are a f****** pain to feed. My five-year old, meals and I are currently embroiled in a love-hate relationship that would star Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dawan if it were a movie. Mealtime starts off well enough, with my Stepford smile firmly in place as we all set the table together. By the time the rice hits the plate, the shit has hit the ceiling.The green thing, I hate it. Take it away. This is spicy. Its too chewy. Too mushy. Dont let the rice and the dal touch. My stomach hurts. Im dying. I need to burp. I need to pee. Im warning you. This is so yucky. Indian again? My five-year olds mealtime conversation is a Ginsberg-esque stream of consciousness.At school, I ask the teachers if he eats. Oh my God! Hes the best. Eats everything and so neatly. We wanted to ask you how you do it. With his grandmother he asks for seconds and thirds and praises the food in terms that would make the late AA Gill proud.With me, its Mutiny on the Bounty. I try not to take this to heart, my cooking cant be THAT bad. Right? Right???Last week, after a particularly long weekend, I had had enough. I finished eating and went to my room to read a book. I emerged half an hour later to find him burying a Lego man under the rice.I took the bowl away, told him he was done and asked him to brush his teeth and go to bed. I waited to feel like a bad mother. For him to wake up hungry and crying. For a bolt of lightening to strike me down. None of that happened. He did wake up the next morning, hungrier than usual though.So, my advice to mothers, since nobody asked, is if your kid wont eat let them go hungry once a while. I swear nothing terrible will happen. And unless you write a column about it in the newspapers, no one will judge you harshly either.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"
590a3b597be9e033fa430a96,From Anna to Amma...,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2016/dec/09/from-anna-to-amma-1547089.html,2016-12-09,"At 68 years of age, J Jayalalithaa should have been in the prime of her political career. In the Indian landscapewhere theres hardly a concept of retirement (vanaprastha being largely a matter restricted to the scriptures)its the age when politicians usually come into their own. Whether it was P V Narashima Rao, I K Gujral, A B Vajpayee or a Manmohan Singh for that matter, they matured in politics, assumed bigger roles, shaped the fate and future of the nation, all in their vintage years.It is perhaps this sense of untimeliness that made Jayalalithaas death a cause of national mourning that took the scale of a watershed event. When a politician from Arunachal Pradesh tweeted condolences and an Uttarakhand Assembly offered tributes, it was as if one of their own had departed. It was said that she has left a void and a Maya and a Mamata behind. If not in her life, in death Jayalalithaa transcended regional barriers.Even if she did not have a political career outside, there was something else that did travel. A certain signature politics invented in Tamil Nadu, a whole style of how to run a welfare state, of which she was the legatee. Unlike Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Jayalalithaa had a sense of humour. This aspect of her persona, of course, was seen only by those who got close enough to converse. (The public only saw the beatific, mesmerising smile, or the sterner aspects of physiognomy or political action.) Not so long ago, Jayalalithaa told a few Left leaders while chatting about the role of her Amma schemes, Now, I sometimes forget my real name....For the legions who poured their grief onto the streets of Chennai, who walked with her body on its last journey like disciplined soldiers, she was Amma. Not Jayalalithaa. Not merely a political leader or a chief minister. Not a matinee idol. They were mourners of a death of a relationship. And a certain kind of political imagination. Through her death, Jayalalithaa seems to have emerged as some of sort of a Mother Teresa of Indian politics. Looking at the thronging masses, the adjective iconic did not seem misplaced or exaggerated.She had given her people, and the visual news media covering her funeral, the last blockbuster of her life. Even iconoclasts praised and grudgingly acknowledged her unique legacy. Laid to rest next to MGR and not far from Annadurai, she was in same row with them accorded the stature of her mentor and the originator of Dravidian politics. Yes, in the same row in a very specific sense. For, what she retained of the political legacy she inherited in toto is not so much Dravidian identity politics, or atheism, but crucially, social welfare.A model of official state benevolence that was always frowned upon by the middle class and economic savants, it made life easier for the vast millions. If what she added to the political legacy was a touch of fierce loyalty and discipline the two crore cadre of the party had to mirror the utmost loyalty she too showed to her mentorit came not merely from the authoritarian air of her initial years. What was on display in the quiet lines at the funeral was grief at a genuine bereavement. A transmuted gratitude. For, to become a true legatee of Anna and MGR, she had to also become Ammaa bestower of good(s), salt to silicon, cradle to grave, like some unipolar political conglomerate.Her film background was transcended through this fine-tuning of welfarism the direct people-oriented politics of Anna and MGR. Policy was not an abstract thing for them, a working of the infrastructural levers that would produce good in the end. It was an immediate, direct transaction. The free mid-day meal schemes that go all the way back to the early Dravidian party chief ministers is now a policy across India. Annas rice schemes were replicated by N T Rama Rao, the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. The rice recipe lived on through various avatars, most recently with the BJPs man for Chhattisgarh, Chawal Baba Raman Singh. Nitish Kumar, Akhilesh Yadav, Mamata they have all prospered in going down the same track.So has more than one Central government found uses for the NREGA (which similarly raises sceptical notes from a certain crowd). So what Jayalalithaa leaves behind as a serious political legacya permanent challenge to the antisubsidy pro-marketeersis a simple message, secured development. A record that shows that economics does better with a dash of socialism. It works better when honed with what is often derided as populism. Jayalalithaa took this to the level of a high art. The Tamil Nadu she has left behind is a better governed state with indices outstripping the national average, because she allied economics with reservations in education and spending big in social security (freebies included).It increased the catchment area of the state, produced a healthier, skilled and more employable population. Despite the Rs 25,000 crore food subsidy, Rs 3,016 crore maternity benefits, Rs 2,852 crore health insurance, Rs 6,281 crore transport subsidy, Rs 5,941 crore solar power scheme, Rs 3,500 crore power/agriculture subsidy, and another estimated Rs 23,000 crore in material doles, Tamil Nadus GDP grew faster than the rest of Indias, with a rather enviable per capita income. This should silence everyone into awe and convince young Akhilesh to follow her footsteps religiously (he has confided in a close aide that he wants emulate Amma). A former IPS officer who knew Jayalalithaa says, Amma was Anna+MGR.

Free, lavish lunches, dinners and gifts have been an integral part of the evolution of media the world over. It was almost a daily affair in Delhi where a foreign company was announcing its entry post-liberalisation.The venue was invariably a five-star hotel and the media interaction was followed by lunch, or dinner followed by cocktails. Those were literally heady days and nights for business journalists who also went home with expensive freebies. My editor then observed: If you are a business journalist and single, your monthly food bill would have come down by 70 per cent.We were all young, single, from out of town  with exceptions like me who stayed with our parents enjoying home food  and living in bachelor pads. The PCs (press conferences) and media events were eagerly awaited. Free booze and sumptuous food were de rigueur. Suffice to say, we were a pampered lot and envy of our friends who saw only the exteriors of a five-star hotel.For me, the novelty however wore off soon even as I moved into a barsati after my fathers retirement. I simply craved for a simple home fare of dal chaval or curd rice  even as a selfcooking single. On the other hand, spoilt for choice with many invitations, some seniors often decided to go, or to give a go by to a PC on the basis of the gift. Once I overheard a conversation between two senior lady journalists of a prominent financial daily, whats the gift yaar? The other replied: Titan watch. The former dismissed, Chuck it. Not worth it.The venue was just two km away from their office. To be fair, many media houses  including our own small magazine group  have come out with their own code of conduct with clear dos and donts for their journalists and what they can and cannot accept as gifts. When novice reporters in our Bombay Bureau asked the editor what should they do with all the public relations people offering gifts, my editor sought our suggestions. Sweets, dry fruits, pens, etc. were acceptable.No liquor and other expensive items, we said. Gift vouchers and Mont Blanc pens were still unheard of. A staff writer of the respected weekly news magazine The Economist clarified the dilemma long ago. Its ok if you accept a bottle of wine for Christmas, but a case of wine is not. Thats propriety."

In fact, the cyclone has brought rains and has helped farmers in Andhra Pradesh. Water has come and rice sowing, which was slow, is picking up,"" Pattanayak told PTI.The impact on agriculture in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka still needs to be assessed. ""We have not got any report as of now. It will be very beneficial out there also,"" he said.In its latest release, the Met Department said some parts of Kancheepuram, Vellore, Tiruvallur, Salem, Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu received rainfall.In coastal Andhra Pradesh, parts fo Nellore and Prakasam received heavy rains, it added.For next 12 hours, the Met has issued a ""warning"" that it is ""very likely"" that there will be rainfall at many places with isolated heavy falls over north interior Tamil Nadu and adjoining areas of south interior Karnataka and north Kerala.Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Deputy Director General J S Sandhu said the cyclone has brought some relief to farmers in water-stressed pockets of coastal areas in south India. This will benefit rice sowing operation.The three states contribute about 30 per cent of rice to the country's total production of 104.32 million tonnes achieved in 2015-16 crop year (July-June)."

The digitisation of the PDS and linking it to Aadhaar numbers seeks to cut the leakages but racketeers were clearly a few steps ahead of the government when it came to subverting the rules.The Karnataka government stumbled upon 45,000 bogus ration cards that were linked to invalid and fake Aadhaar numbers in October. In some cases, Aadhaar numbers of unknown persons were linked with bogus cards to make them appear as genuine Aadhaar-seeded ration cards. In Mumbai, the police unearthed a racket involving a manager of an Aadhaar centre, who in connivance with two others, was issuing the unique identity cards to people who did not have valid identification documents.In Chhattisgarh, the model PDS that earned the state laurels at the national level was subverted to add more beneficiaries. While the state has only 56 lakh households eligible to receive benefits under the National Food Security Act, 2013, ration cards were issued to 70.27 lakh households. The startling numbers set alarm bells ringing in the state administration, which swung into action after the 2014 general elections and cancelled 14 lakh ration cards.Investigation by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) revealed startling details about top officials and politicians receiving a share of the spoils of the PDS scam, which according to estimates amounted to several thousand crores of rupees. The ACB claimed to have exposed the whole chain of pilferage through procurement of paddy from the farmers, addition of thousands of tonnes of paddy smuggled in from Odisha and Maharashtra, carting, storage and allotment of paddy to the millers, recovery of rice from the millers and supply of the rice to the PDS outlets.As many as 15 people, including government officials, have been arrested in the case and the matter is being heard by the Chhattisgharh High Court. With PDS being the mainstay in providing quality food grains to the weaker sections of society, any attempt to corrupt the system should be dealt with sternly."
590af2787be9e0457f521919,Bringing PDS out of the abyss,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/583314/bringing-pds-abyss.html,2016-11-27,"Anjali Bhardwaj and Amrita Johri, Nov 27, 2016 0:01 ISTSystem overhaul: Transparency measures with strong accountability mechanisms can usher in changeThe National Food Security Act (NFSA) passed in 2013 gives statutory backing to the Public Distribution System (PDS). Up to 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population is entitled to receive food grain under the Act.Beneficiaries are categorised into priority households, entitled to 5 kg of subsidised grains per person per month, and Antyodaya households are entitled to 35 kg per month. Rice and wheat are to be provided at Rs 3 and Rs 2 per kg, respectively, and coarse grain at Rs 1 per kg.While the Central government is responsible for procurement, storage, transportation and bulk allocation of food grains to the state governments, the responsibility of allocation of grains within the state, identification of eligible families, issue of ration cards and supervision of the functioning of ration shops rests with the state governments.It is widely recognised that one of the biggest challenges in the effective functioning of the PDS has been the large-scale corruption in the distribution of food grains. Estimates suggest that in 2011-12, anywhere between 32% and 47% of grains under the PDS did not reach the intended beneficiaries and was diverted to be sold in the open market. This leakage of grain takes at least three forms: quality fraud, where the PDS shop dealer replaces the good quality grain meant for distribution under the PDS with inferior quality; quantity fraud, where emboldened by the lack of action by state actors, shop keepers charge the beneficiaries for their full entitlement of grains and provide lesser quantity and issuing of bogus or duplicate cards.Global experience has shown that the best way to curb corruption is through greater transparency. The NFSA provides for all PDS related records to be placed in the public domain and kept open for inspection. There are also strong transparency provisions in the PDS (Control) Order, 2015, which require every PDS shop to display information about entitlements of beneficiaries, stock position, details of grievance redressal authorities and a sample of food grains sold under the PDS. Further, Section 4 of the Indian RTI Act requires information about the manner of execution of subsidy programmes like the PDS to be proactively disclosed in local languages and in the most accessible form.States like Bihar, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh, which have adopted various transparency measures as part of a larger PDS reform agenda, have shown huge improvement in terms of reduced leakages of grains. Comparing figures for 2004-05 and 2011-12, pilferage of grains reduced by 73% and 67% in Bihar and Odisha, respectively, (Dreze & Khera, 2015). Many of the steps adopted to address leakages were straight forward, low-cost initiatives like putting up boards clearly displaying the quantum and price of entitlements and having a well publicised schedule for delivery and sale of rations. Simple measures like sending automated text messages to ration cardholders with relevant information about the PDS in Delhi and Chhattisgarh have shown the potential impact they could have in combating corruption.To bring about systemic change, transparency measures need to be supplemented with strong accountability mechanisms. Food departments of all states have an extensive bureaucracy with officials at the local, district and state levels to supervise and monitor the distribution of grains under the PDS. Unfortunately, there is complete lack of accountability in this supervisory structure.Complaints about problems in accessing rightful entitlements under the PDS languish without any time-bound redressal and errant officials escape without any penalty. There is a need for an effective decentralised grievance redressal framework so that when a complaint about non-delivery of entitlements under the PDS is received, there is time-bound action to ensure delivery of entitlements and to fix responsibility of functionaries.Grievance redressal systemThe NFSA provides for setting up a time-bound grievance redressal system, mandates conducting periodic social audits, and requires setting up of vigilance committees at the state, district, block and shop levels. However, three years after the implementation of the NFSA, these important provisions are more honoured in the breach. In Delhi, as part of a campaign by the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyaan, more than a thousand complaints were filed under the NFSA by ration cardholders in 2015-16 - not a single complaint was addressed in the stipulated time frame, nor was any complaint disposed by a written order.Instead of implementing the existing transparency and accountability measures, governments have been aggressively propagating Aadhaar-based biometric authentication as the solution to the problem of corruption in the PDS. This involves installing Point of Sale (PoS) devices at ration shops, which verify the identity of cardholders by matching their fingerprints against the Aadhaar database over the Internet. This is totally inappropriate for a vast country like India, where even in state capitals, network coverage is often patchy and electricity supply unreliable.Experience in states like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Delhi illustrate the problems associated with requiring biometric authentication. Making Aadhaar mandatory, despite the Supreme Court orders to the contrary, has led to the large-scale exclusion of deserving people from the PDS net. Scores of ration cardholders are unable to access their rations due to lack of availability of proper Internet connection and transaction failures due to fingerprints not being recognised, especially of manual labourers and the elderly. In any case, at best Aadhaar can only address corruption stemming from issue of bogus cards. Use of Aadhaar cannot fix the pre-dominant problems of quality or quantity fraud.The need for a robust food security programme cannot be overemphasised in a country like India, which according to a 2015 report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation, is home to the highest number of undernourished people in the world - 194.6 million, about 15% of the population. The Global Hunger Index report found that 42% of the worlds undernourished children live in India. Governments have an obligation to effectively reform the PDS by taking steps which are in line with the current reality of the country.Oft suggested measures like dismantling the PDS and replacing it with cash transfers neither address the issue of hunger nor are themselves proven to be immune from corruption. What is needed to fix corruption in the PDS is political will to adopt effective transparency, accountability and grievance redressal mechanism.(The writers are associated with the National Campaign for Peoples Right to Information and the Right to Food Campaign)"
590af2867be9e0457f521922,Jaya leaves behind an enduring legacy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/587203/jaya-leaves-behind-enduring-legacy.html,2016-12-18,"Jaya leaves behind an enduring legacyKalyani Shankar, Dec 18, 2016: 0:59 ISTWhat kind of legacy has AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa left behind? Despite the corrupt image, no doubt there is considerable legacy in political, administrative, social and welfare areas.It is indeed a million dollar question as to who gets to take forward her legacies in view of the fact that her successors are pygmies compared to her. Also, can her legacy be encashed by her party just as she did with MGRs? Jayalalithaa and MGR both represented a personality cult in Indian democracy.Jayalalithaa had made no succession plan, while her rival and DMK chief M Karunanidhi has named his son Stalin as his successor. Though she had no access to MGR during his last days, Jayalalithaa quickly claimed his political legacy by sitting on the gun carriage carrying his body in December 1987, but she was pushed out by MGRs nephew.She split the party when MGRs wife Janaki was made the chief minister. However, Janaki made way for Jayalalithaa when the formers faction got just two seats, while the Jayalalithaa faction got 28 seats in 1989. Jayalalithaa became the first woman Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly. The AIADMK swept into power in 1991 and since then there was no turning back for Jayalalithaa.While MGR had some senior leaders like R M Veerappan to fall back on, Jayalalithaa made O Panneerselvam, a political lightweight, as her proxy chief minister, not once but twice, when she had to step aside while facing legal problems. Even today, Panneerselvam does not sit in the chief ministers chair in the secretariat.The party has now accepted his leadership as well as that of Sasikala, Jayalalithaas long-time companion. Interestingly, had Jayalalithaa wanted, she could have made Sasikala a minister or an office-bearer in the party, but she was not given any role.Jayalalithaa has left behind a huge political legacy. She made her party a force to reckon with in the state and in national politics. Under her leadership, the AIADMK came to power four times  1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016. She had also been part of the NDA and UPA governments at the Centre and played a role in national politics on her own terms when she pulled down Vajpayees government in 1999.In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the AIADMK won 37 of the 39 seats becoming the third largest party in the Lok Sabha. As for her personal wealth, it is not clear whether she had left behind any will. In the absence of it, legally her brothers children could stake claim to her assets  said to be worth Rs 118.58 crore - as declared by her during the 2015 Assembly polls.Surely, no one can fault her in her governance. The success was due to not only her ability to design schemes but also to deliver. Jayalalithaa had sidelined her ministers and worked through the officers which is why even after her death, the state machinery was running smooth while dealing with the recent cyclone. The fear of her omnipresence had kept the bureaucracy on tenterhooks.Her economic legacy was no less significant. No doubt that Tamil Nadu had grown under Jayalalithaas leadership. Despite 37% of the states budget going to subsidies, it is still the countrys second largest economy, with Jayalalithaa turning Tamil Nadu into an attractive destination for foreign investment.Jayalalithaas was a business-savvy government, responsive local administration, had good railways, ports and telecom network as well as adequate road connectivity and availability of low-cost labour throughout the state. Her Vision 2023 plan was aimed to achieve economic prosperity, employment generation and inclusive growth.Health, education and safety of women are other domains in which the state has made impressive strides. Tamil Nadu has largely been free of communal or left-wing extremist violence during her regimes. Also, the human development index is more than the national average.Rampant populismSilencing her critics, Jayalalithaa was able to sustain the growth while implementing her welfare schemes. For one thing, much of the huge amounts spent for subsidies went to the right beneficiaries, while conventional wisdom dictates that rampant populism, autocratic administration and widespread corruption could be ruinous. In Tamil Nadu, they have always coexisted comfortably.On the welfare side, Jayalalithaa targeted almost every section, including women, farmers, school-going children, poor and destitute through several welfare schemes like Amma water, Amma pharmacy, Amma cement, food security, Amma canteen, women self help groups, free 20kg rice for the poor and fortified salt. She even provided a scheme for the transgenders.However, it was not all rosy picture. While some social programmes were applauded, they came at a huge cost. According to an IndiaSpend analysis of state budgets, there was maximum debt increase in Tamil Nadu over the past five years.Power woes are also far from over. The alcohol prohibition, an election promise, could mean a loss of one third of the total revenue as liquor sale is worth about $3 billion. The challenge for Panneerselvam is how to take forward this economic and social welfare legacy.Jayalalithaas brand of leadership may be lacking now unless Panneerselvam evolves as his own man. So far, he has been untested as he had worked under the shadow of Jayalalithaa. Sasikala has no political experience.The biggest challenge for both will be to keep the flock together as an AIADMK without Jayalalithaa is vulnerable to pulls and pressures from its rivals. Not only the DMK, but also the national parties such as the BJP and the Congress, ousted from power since the state came under Dravidian rule back in 1967, have been waiting and watching.(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"

BPL cardholders will be given coupons, which they may redeem at provision stores for foodgrain.The objective of the new exercise is to give the beneficiary the freedom of choice while buying foodgrain, curb pilferage and also give impetus to locally grown foodgrain, claimed Khader.The coupons may be collected from franchise centres. For a five-member family card, the cardholder will have the option of purchasing rations worth anywhere between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000. However, the coupon facility will be optional as the existing system of supplying subsidised foodgrain through ration shops will continue.Now, 5 kg of rice is issued to an individual beneficiary. One kg of rice costs Rs 27. A family also gets 1 kg of sugar (at Rs 20 a kg). In the open market, the prices are much higher.Undoing Anna Bhagya?Khader said the department requires 25 lakh metric tonne of rice to disburse under the Anna Bhagya scheme. However, only 10% of rice is procured from the state farmers, while the rest is imported from other states like Punjab and Haryana. Not only are there lots of complaints about the quality of rice, beneficiaries are also demanding that other grains like jowar be provided. It has been decided to issue coupons instead of giving cash to prevent misuse, he added.Once the purchase is made, the store owner will verify it with the department, after which money will be transferred through the beneficiarys bank account to the bank account of the store owner.Online facilityAn online facility for obtaining Above Poverty Line ration cards will also be launched next month. An online applicant who furnishes Aadhaar details will get an APL card within 15 days through Speed Post. A variety of problems associated with issue of ration cards over the last 15 years is sought to be resolved through this method.The online APL card may be printed and used for purchase of foodgrain. The printout, however, will not serve as ID proof. Only the actual card, which will be sent through speed post, may be used as proof of identity.DH News Service"

Our traders will have to suffer losses because of the social media campaign but nothing can beat their patriotism, said CAIT president B C Bhartia and secretary general Praveen Khandelwal.They took exception to an acerbic op-ed in the official Chinese media, Global Times, which ranted against India, saying New Delhi can only bark and do nothing about the growing trade deficit between two countries.Bhartia and Khandelwal said, We condemn such a view. Chinas continued opposition to Indias effort to declare Pakistan-based militants as international terrorists has angered many Indians who have called for a boycott of Chinese products.Undoubtedly, they said, India is a big market for Chinese products and over the years, import of toys, furniture, building hardware, lighting and electric fittings, electronic appliances, kitchen equiment and gift items.They are low priced when bought in bulk by our traders, which is the root cause of heavy infiltration of such goods in Indian market. Indian traders who imported them will have to suffer losses and, hence, compensation may be thought of, Khandelwal said. They said the government should declare a policy for reimbursement for losses because the campaign against Chinese goods has widely spread to many places.The governments official stand is that it cannot support any call for boycott of Chinese products because India is upset with Chinas stand on the role of terrorists from Pakistan.Traders said they expect to suffer at least 30% loss due to the boycott of Chinese-made products as the campaign picks up ahead of Deepavali. Wholesalers in Delhis wholesale market Sadar Bazaar reported a drop of at least 20% in Chinese- made products.Responding to the campaign, Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said it is impossible to place a blanket ban on import of Chinese goods. ""Curbs can only be placed if there are quality issues or if the imports are subsidised or dumped,"" she said.Just because we may not like certain things about a country is not reason enough to block imports from that country. We could impose anti-dumping duties, but there are established ways to go about it and dumping has to be proved, she said.Significantly, Sitharaman, in her bilateral talks with Chinese Vice Minister of Finance and Commerce Wang Shouwen last week had raised concerns about Indias trade gap with China.Indias trade deficit with China crossed $51.45 billion in 2014-15, accounting for almost half of the countrys total trade deficit.Sitharaman had asked for Beijing's fast clearance of rice and pharmaceutical exports from India and grant of IT projects to Indian companies, in addition to greater market access for items such as oilseeds and tobacco.Liu Xiaoxue from the Institute of Asia-Pacific Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) wrote in the Global Times that a major portion of imports from China comprises essential hi-tech goods that India need for development and people need for essential use.The editorial in the official daily said ""There has been a lot of talk recently in the Indian media as well as on social media about boycotting Chinese products. It's just rabble rousing...Indian manufacturing cannot compete at all with Chinese products, for various reasons."""

Both examples of sops-driven populist politics, Didis (West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee) pain seems to have just started, unlike that of Amma (Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa).And the pain can be traced back to the dismal financial condition of West Bengal, an issue Mamata, also Trinamool Congress chairperson and Didi to her supporters  and even some detractors  has never stopped harping on.Unlike Amma, Didi was never a matinee idol or known for an ostentatious lifestyle. Despite coming from opposite ends of the spectrum, both women followed a similar brand of politics. Unlike Jayalalithaa, however, Mamata never had the means to run her drive of populism. With Bengal facing a severe financial crunch, Mamata could be facing something Jayalalithaa is not likely to ever face: bankruptcy.Two months into her second term, which Mamata entered like an unstoppable force, her government seems to have met with an immovable object. Trinamool, the ruling party in Bengal that returned with an unbelievable mandate, is often blamed ofideological bankruptcy. For Mamata, the term could come with a new meaning since Bengal is among the most cash-starved states in India.Mamata has never minced words to state that the biggest challenge before her is not holding on to power but insolvency, notwithstanding the politics of largesse she has turned into her trademark since coming to power in 2011. In the last six years that she has been in office, Mamata has given away millions of cycles to hapless girl students, shoes to others who cannot afford a pair and lakhs of rupees to neighbourhood clubs so they can pursue sporting activities.Even as her politics of largesse continues unabated, the wrinkles on the forehead of state Finance Minister Amit Mitra seems to have set deeper. The matter on top of Mitras head has to be Bengals outstanding debt of Rs 3 lakh crore, a nightmare he had to combat while presenting the state budget in June. While Mitra admitted in the Assembly that the state was facing a debt trap, Mamata went a step further and described it as a death trap.Party insiders have admitted that the mountain of debt on Bengal could go some distance to change Trinamools political priorities. Political analysts have noted with some caution that Mamatas politics of largesse to the bottom of the pyramid, funnelling crores of rupees into social and civic infrastructure  free bicycles and shoes, rice at Rs 2 per kg, metalled roads through villages  might have reaped her rich political dividends but have left the exchequer further crippled. And despite the landslide majority, money remains her top concern.Mitra has often pointed out that during its first term in office, the Trinamool government raised plan expenditure from Rs 14,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore. That, however, was not enough to keep the debt burden at bay, which is fast devouring the states resources. Going by cold statistics, in 2015-16, the Bengal government paid almost Rs 28,000 crore to its debtors, with the accumulated interest during the ongoing fiscal year likely to stand at upwards of Rs 32,000 crore.Mitra also admitted that even though the states debt stock increased by more than Rs 1 lakh crore till March 2016, around Rs 94,000 crore would go just to service existing debt. While Mamata and the Trinamool leadership are not oblivious to this scenario, with the panchayat elections scheduled for 2018, the ruling party cannot afford to deviate from its path of creating human capital, based on sops. Leaders are aware that this means spending more on social and civic infrastructure, funds for which are fast drying up.Overtakes LeftOfficials have often admitted in off-the-record conversations that even though Mamata counts the debt burden as the only legacy of the 34-year-long Left rule, her government has borrowed more money in the last six years than the Left did between 1977 and 2011. Bengals latest market borrowing came in February, when the state borrowed up a loan of Rs 2,500 crore. With this fresh loan, Bengals total open market borrowing reaches Rs 1,03,546 crore.Statistics from the RBI reveal that the quantum of open market borrowing, which attracts the highest interest rate, has far exceeded the figure during 34 years of Left rule, which between 1977 and 2011 was little over Rs 72,000 crore. In contrast, Mamatas government has borrowed Rs 1,01,046 crore in its first five years, between May 2011 and February 2016. The open secret is that her government has done little to lessen the burden during her first term, with debt repayment amount set to reach Rs 18,359 crore by 2017-2018.Analysts say that Mamata will have to find ways to keep Central funds flowing in from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom she considers her ideological rival, largely owing to her vote bank politics of keeping Muslims in good humour. It is common knowledge that nearly 80% of the states tax revenue was consumed by debt repayments in 2015-16, and even in this fiscal, the situation is no better.Although Trinamool has been able to convince voters about the governments development efforts, Mamata is aware how much the debt burden is bothering the administration and the ruling party.The Opposition parties have often alleged that high market borrowings are essentially used to service sops Mamata has been giving away. She, however, has always argued that borrowings are used to repay debt left behind by the earlier regime.What is waiting to be seen is whether she can generate enough resources to support her politics, along with necessary administrative expenditure, or if she crumbles under the mountain of debt and is forced to change her political path."

The first year in office was marked with low inflation levels  thanks to the decline in global crude and commodity prices and sluggish domestic demand. But July of 2015 brought with it the rude shock of a steady increase in prices of pulses. As the festive season of September-October approached, arhar or toor was retailing at Rs 200 per kg, forcing the government into action.The first response was to ramp up imports by tapping the usual sources  Canada, Malawi and Myanmar. But global crop failure and non-availability in international markets kept the prices high. This year too, pulses continue to cost dear to the common man who spends about 5% of his food expenditure on his key source of protein in the diet. And, the government has come up with the expected response  increase imports and build up buffer stocks to enable market intervention to cool down prices.A look at the data put out by the government clearly states that India has been dependent on imports to fill in the gap between demand and supply of pulses. The increase in rural wages in the latter part of the past decade had led to a steady increase in demand for pulses. In 2007-08, the demand for pulses was 16.77 million tonnes, while domestic production was 14.76 mt. Over the years, the domestic production stagnated at around 18 mt and the demand this year has been pegged at 24 mt.A study by Assocham in November last year has pegged pulses imports at 10.1 mt for 2015-16 raising questions whether India would need to depend on buying from global markets perpetually to meet its domestic needs of the protein source. The Indian Institute of Pulses Research has forecast a demand of 39 mt of pulses by 2050.According to a Crisil study, this would require production of pulses to grow at an annual rate of 2.2%, compared with the 0.9% growth witnessed in the last decade.The need of the hour is to dramatically increase domestic production to meet the growing demands for pulses. It needs a mix of policy and technological interventions to bridge the demand-supply gap. The Economic Survey 2015-16 had pointed out that most of the land dedicated to growing pulses in each state was unirrigated  thus leaving the output at the mercy of the rain god. It had made a strong pitch for increasing production of pulses on irrigated land to meet the high and growing demand.The recent spike in prices of pulses has sent the government scurrying to Africa and Myanmar once again  this time round exploring the possibility of contract farming in foreign nations to meet the domestic demands. Law and order issues in some African nations and high transportation costs have been cited as key hurdlesin previous attempts to explore land leasing options.The earlier attempts were made by the private sector and now India is holding government-to-government talks to explore avenues to ensure stability in supply of pulses. Top Central officials visited Mozambique and Myanmar last fortnight and are expected to present their reports to the government. This comes even as the government is pushing farmers to grow more pulses. But what ails the pulses sector? And why has India been unable to keep pace with the growing demand.The Green Revolution began in India in the early 1960s and within a decade the food grain production was on a steady increase. In 1970-71, total food grain production was 108.43 mt of which rice and wheat amounted to 42.22 mt and 23.83 mt, respectively. Production of pulses was 11.82 mt. By 2006-07, the total food grain production had doubled to 217.28 mt. While rice production zoomed to 93.35 mt and wheat to 75.81 mt, the growth is pulses amounted to 14.20 mt.Low yieldIn the absence of technological breakthrough, farmers were saddled with low yield seed varieties that help them produce about 700 kg of pulses per hectare, against the global average of 800 kg per hectare. Some states do much better than the all-India average, but even the key pulse producing state of Madhya Pradesh has yields (938 kg/ha) barely three-fifths that of Chinas (1550 kg/ha). This also makes a case for examining the viability of genetically modified variety to increase yields.Pulses are also high risk-prone crops as most of the production takes place in rainfed areas. Only 16% of pulses coverage is through irrigation thus exposing the farm output to monsoon shocks. Moreover, 70% pulses production comes from four states  Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Barring Rajasthan, the rest three states have received deficient monsoon for the past four years thus affecting the production of pulses.In June, the Centre increased sharply the minimum support price (MSP) for pulses. But farmers were not enthused by the increase as wholesale prices are almost double the MSP.There are also demands for increasing the MSP to the level of the rates at which government imports pulses. They also recall the glut in chickpea production three years back when prices had fallen below the MSP. The government had failed to intervene and procure at the support price.But the biggest intervention from the government could be in the form of setting up a procurement mechanism to buy pulses from farmers at it does in case of wheat and paddy. The government procures between 30 and 40% of wheat and paddy produced in the country. But in the case of pulses, procurement is almost negligible.The Shanta Kumar Committee on Restructuring Food Corporation of India had suggested better price support operations for pulses to encourage farmers to take up cultivation on a large scale. The government needs to act on this."

This is the 17th consecutive month of fall.With global risks mounting up, things have become even more difficult for the Indian exporters, said Chairman of the Engineering Export Promotion Council, T S Bhasin.Bhasin said the global commodity markets continued to remain in troubled water and no demand pick up was in sight.While the government has been taking incremental steps to help tide the situation, the export sector has not somehow captured the kind of attention of the policy makers, which it deserves. Besides, the cost of raw material has gone up thanks to restrictive measures on crucial imports which go into the export products, Bhasin said.In April, exports declined in most major categories including petroleum products, ready-made garments, engineering goods, cotton yarn, carpet, leather, rice and cashew. However, the fall in exports were in tandem with other economies of the globe. Exports for the United States, European Union, China and Japan have also fallen in the range of 0.04% to 25%.India has a saving grace in gems & jewellery, tobacco, electronic products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals which posted an increase."

591f27367be9e025a5d4b4e1,"Now, satellite images to pinpoint poverty",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/539904/now-satellite-images-pinpoint-poverty.html,2016-04-12,"Now, satellite images to pinpoint povertyBy Sendhil Mullainathan, Apr 12, 2016, International New York Times 0:37 ISTAn explosion of data has already changed how we market products and politicians. Now a similar innovation is beginning to change how we combat poverty around the world.Consider an unlikely problem: finding the poor. Even in a world riddled with poverty, nearly every government, nonprofit and aid agency, struggles with this issue. Where in Kigali should the Rwandan health ministry place a new health clinic? Which rural districts in India should receive rice at subsidised prices? All these decisions require not just knowing poverty exists, but pinpointing areas of greatest need.But until very recently, the data commonly used to answer these questions came almost exclusively from countrywide surveys, which are expensive and logistically challenging. It is very difficult to randomly sample people in the rural areas of Bihar or in a slum like Kibera in Nairobi where even just mapping the streets is its own project.These challenges make new kinds of data  information that can be gathered indirectly using algorithms and novel sources  particularly valuable. Google searches and Twitter and Facebook posts, which are useful in the United States, are unlikely to help in Kibera or Dhaka. But the core idea behind these sources of data  measuring without asking people directly  can be enormously helpful.Take the case of measuring the most basic of economic variables: gross domestic product. The numbers can be unreliable in countries where the statistical infrastructure is weak, the informal businesses do not want to be tracked and the numbers may be manipulated. Morten Jerven, an economist at Simon Fraser University, argues in his book, Poor Numbers, that for many African countries the lack of quality data impedes development.To see how questionable official data can be, consider that in 2015 North Korea released a budgetary report claiming its economy had grown by roughly 225%. To verify this dubious economic miracle, researchers can turn to Nasa, which has nighttime satellite images. One image shows an ocean of lights in South Korea and China. It also shows a vast darkness between them, depicting the grim reality of North Korea, where night lighting is a rare luxury. If North Korea is experiencing an economic miracle, it is a purely daytime affair.Night-time luminosity tells us not just about electrification but also about economic activity more broadly, and statistical work shows it reliably correlates with economic performance. North Korea is not the only country where satellite photos tell a story that differs from the one told by official data. A seminal paper in the American Economic Review found estimates of income growth in many places that differed from official data by as much as 3 percentage points annually. Satellite photos provide a level of geographic specificity that national accounts do not. Another set of researchers used visual algorithms (related to those that help navigate cars) to analyse these images pixel by pixel, and they were able to quantify poverty in each square km of Uganda.Satellite photos provide other useful information. In rural areas, researchers can see crops in the ground, allowing them to estimate harvest size  even before the actual harvest. This data offers a direct window into an essential part of the economic lives of many of the worlds rural poor. The information can be used to build early warning systems for crop failure, to create crop insurance or target other forms of assistance.There are many other important, unconventional sources of data. Consider cellphones. For most of the worlds poor, each call and text has a very noticeable and real monetary cost. Economist Joshua Blumenstock at the University of Washington uses cellphone metadata (who calls whom, when and for how long) to measure wealth. For instance, people who make calls at certain times of the day are wealthier, and people who make lots of short calls tend to be poorer than people who make fewer, longer ones. In a paper in Science, using data from Rwanda, he quantifies poverty at very high levels of resolution, focusing not just on individual villages but on individual people.Of course, all these data sources  satellites, cellphones and many others  work even better in concert. Flowminder is a nonprofit organisation that has taken on this challenge of combining data. Researchers are beginning to see tangible benefits. For example, GiveDirectly, a nonprofit group that gives cash to the poor, now uses satellite imagery to identify villages where thatched roofs signal that they may need help. Remote sensing data can be powerful, especially when combined with cheap classification tools like crowdsourcing or machine learning, says Paul Niehaus, co-founder of the organisation. Theyve let us strip cost and time out of the process.Combining dataThe World Bank recently held its Big Data Innovation Challenge. Many of the winners used novel data sets to improve measurement and decision making, and their titles paint vivid, if wonky, pictures: Improved Real Time Decision Making of Infrastructure Investments for the Philippines by Linking Geo-Spatial Road Network Data With Rich Geo-Tagged Social Data Collected Through Mobile Phones and Combining Taxi GPS Data and Open-Source Software for Evidence-Based Traffic Management and Planning.Some of these projects are about changing how old sources of data are used. Typically, surveys are used to determine which variables are most correlated with poverty, such as having a thatched roof or a dirt floor or not having a toilet. These variables are then added up to form a score that ranks households. Those with the highest rank may be deemed eligible for help, whether it is a microloan, a food subsidy or a cash transfer.But this kind of simple score card does not take advantage of the latest technologies. For example, in the United States, modern credit scoring agencies do not simply add a few variables. They use predictive algorithms to scour data for complex relationships most associated with default, which are then combined into a tailored prediction of credit risk.Why should the financial services industry, where mere dollars are at stake, be using more advanced technologies than the aid industry, where human life is at stake?A winning World Bank Innovation Challenge project, with which I collaborated, aims to close this gap. Melissa Adelman, an economist at the World Bank and one of the lead researchers in our project, says: Existing surveys may contain much more information for poverty measurement than is actually used. Were exploring how many more of the poor could be identified and targeted for services by using machine-learning tools. Its exciting because those better algorithms are essentially free to use, so the benefit-to-cost ratio of any gain in targeting will be very large.All of these efforts improve efficiency. It doesnt sound very romantic: Costs go down and accuracy goes up. Typically, efficiency gains like these excite only technocrats. But when these improvements truly help the neediest, all of us should be excited."

With 10 states declared drought-hit this year, the distress in agriculture and the crash in commodity prices has raised question mark on the drought resilience claims by the government.India has a historical tryst with droughts. Between 1801 and 2012, the country had experienced 45 severe droughts. The recent weak monsoons have affected agriculture, registering low growth for the second year in a row. This has caused serious setback to the economy, lending credence to the argument that only drought-proofing, and not drought-resilience which is considered manageable, can cut down the impact of agriculture on the economy.The Economic Survey 2015-16 has rightly called for a paradigm shift in agriculture, propo-sing more investment in resea-rch on hybrid and high-yielding seeds, technology, mechanisation and efficient water use via micro-irrigation. What it has missed out, though, is the need to invest in researching climate-smart agriculture technologies to raise productivity and ensuring food security as the spectre of climate change looms large.Part of the problem is that Indian agriculture has been a high investment, high risk proposition; its input-intensive cereal-centric nature has left it vulnerable to climate-induced exigencies. Unless it shifts to less water-intensive crops, especially pulses and oilseeds, supported by a favourable minimum support price (MSP) regime, productivity from 63.72 million hectares of rain-dependent farmlands may not contribute to growth in agriculture.To ensure that rainfed areas contribute to productivity gains, the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana has stressed on increasing water productivity by promoting decentralised water resources development in such areas. This is justified on the ground that big dams can expand irrigation to 50% of the rain-dependent arable lands only, as water demand of other sectors is likely to increase to 27% (from current 13%) by 2025.Having committed to reducing carbon emissions by 30-35% of its GDP by 2030, India is obli-ged to lower irrigation carbon footprints of large irrigation projects by switching to decentralised water management. And by increasing soil organic carbon through precision farming, additional carbon stocks in soil will not only help raise moisture retention but reduce clim-ate-induced crop vulnerability.It is in this context that captive water availability through community-managed traditional tank systems, and improving soil moisture regime through decentralised watershed development assumes significance. Both are critical for drought-proofing the countryside, as in situ surface water storage converts soil profile into a veritable reservoir that acts as a cushion against climate aberrations.All said, low agriculture productivity remains a formidable challenge. Since subsidised food grains are the lifeline for 67% of the population, attaining higher yields of wheat and rice seems imperative. The question that begs a considered response is: should India chase higher wheat and paddy yields achieved by China  with 40% higher yields  or be strategic in building its crop diversity to address the twin concerns of crop productivity and human nutrition?There is a compelling need for increasing investment in public agricultural research, more so as Indias current spending on agriculture research (31%) is even less than that of Bangladesh (38%). However, research ought to focus on precision agriculture which uses geo-referenced data layers to convert farms into small management zones, promotes cropping pattern which economise on agriculture inputs like seeds and fertilisers, and maximises return on investment.Farmers need research and extension support to shift from input-intensive cereal crops. They also need incentives to switch crops, backed by insurance against crop failures. Unless agriculture research develops drought-resistant, short- duration crop varieties which can cope with climate variability and an institutional mechanism that provides contingency cover for unexpected market fluctuations, the GDP of countrys biggest employer may remain stuck at current 1.1%.Nothing less than a rainbow revolution, that integrates development of agriculture, horticulture, forestry, fishery, poultry and animal husbandry, can revive agriculture and sustain food supplies with matching protein consumption in a changing climate scenario.(The author researches and writes on development issues)"

591f3e477be9e025f04e575b,Narendra Modi’s Gujarat problem,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/politics/narendra-modi-gujarat-amit-shah-anandiben-patel-hardik-patel/,2016-02-15,"Amit Shah with Anandiben Patel in Gujarat shortly after he had been elevated to BJP president. (Source: Express archive) Amit Shah with Anandiben Patel in Gujarat shortly after he had been elevated to BJP president. (Source: Express archive)When Narendra Modi headed Gujarat, the saffron family and the state government followed the unified command of the Chief Ministers Office (CMO). But within just 21 months after he moved to the national capital, the cohesiveness that marked his Gujarat model is beginning to unravel in all spheres, particularly within his own party.In Chief Minister Anandiben Patels Gujarat, there are two BJPs today. One faction is trying to build her public persona through the state machinery and failing miserably, while the other is rallying around Amit Shah, the national president.Prime Minister Modi has not taken any stand yet, but the recent allegations of impropriety in the financial dealings of the chief ministers daughter, Anar Patel, appears to be a curtain-raiser of the power struggle thats taking shape.One of the early indications of this tussle is the stalling of the reported move to nominate the mild-mannered Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, a believer of please-all politics, as state BJP president.While Modi is expected to take a final call on Chudasama, a minister, the template to take political decisions in Gujarat has changed dramatically after Patidar leader Hardik Patel polarised the two sides of the caste and reservation divide.The anti-CM section is opposed to the candidature of Chudasama, a Kshatriya, particularly because the community is known to have a traditional rivalry with the Patels. And with outgoing president R C Faldu being a Patel, the question being asked is: why provoke the community, which is up in arms demanding more rights? More so, when the Patels have shown their displeasure with the BJP in the recent local body elections.The pro-Shah faction believes that a Vaniya-Brahmin or a surprise young face from the OBC caste who is not close to Patels or Kshatriyas should be the party president.Divide suits manyYet, the divide between Anandiben and Shah appears to be suiting many within the party, especially with the cabinet packed with the CMs adversaries. For instance, realising that the party is losing ground due to an ineffective CM, two senior ministers, Saurabh Patel and Nitin Patel, are known be nurturing ambitions of a promotion.The old hawks are also aware that the game is wide open even if the 73-year-old CM completes her term. Its a widely held view that she has been unable to fill the shoes of Modi. Her face appears deadpan when she meets voters and her language is dry when she delivers political messages. And neither she nor any of the Patel ministers are able to address the public effectively in areas dominated by the community in North Gujarat.It is also believed that the CM is feeling under siege because of Shahs intimidating grip over the cadre. Shah might not have the charisma of Modi but has the network. The chief minister is seen as lacking both.However, when it comes to Anandiben, Modi finds himself in a dilemma. Since the early 1980s, she has been a loyal soldier. But the sense that the full scope of the allegations against Anar Patel and her brother Sanjay is yet to unravel would be a cause of worry. Recently, it was reported that Modi has directed Anandiben to rectify the image of her government. But those reports also signalled he continued to support her. He is also said to have met the chief ministers daughter recently.But yet, the questions that linger are: What do you do with a CM who is helpless before her own partymen; who feels that her partys president, once her junior colleague who has never been even a state-level general secretary, is now the dominating voice; who is unable to be the voice of her own caste?Recently, Anandibens supporters complained that Hardik Patels political messages were being smuggled out of jail by policemen with vested interests. But this actually speaks more about Anandibens inability to control her own administration.Bumpy road aheadInsiders believe the divide is likely to grow, particularly because the BJP resembles the Congress in many ways in Gujarat, with factionalism a permanent feature.Under Modi, the BJP fought the 2002, 2007 and 2012 elections as a united force. But today, victory no longer looks inevitable in December 2017, with anti-incumbency emerging as a big factor along with caste turmoil and factionalism. Importantly, PM Modis term ends two years later, in May 2019.With both elections so dangerously close together, how can Modi or Shah let Gujarat slip from their hands?According to government sources, Modi is keeping an eye on developments in Gujarat along with national and international issues. For him, its not just about retaining power in Gandhinagar. His roots are in Gujarat and without the state, his identity and credibility will be shaken. Gujarat is Modis Amethi, Saifai and Baramati. And that Gujarat is churning right now, with the Hindutva wave subsiding and caste identities forcing new alignments.Modi gave Gujarat its first woman chief minister but its clear now that she is finding it difficult to manage his legacy.For instance, the state government last week completed a survey of people below and above the poverty line to identify those eligible for food security under the new Act. It found that 3.65 crore, or more than half the states population, were demanding 35 kg of wheat and rice at a highly subsidised rate. And this is just one of the challenges that await the chief minister.For now though, Anandiben has been assured that she will not be replaced. But can Modi let the risk of continuing with her cloud his own future? How will he manage his campaign of 2019 if Gujarat is not in the bag?Since his days as chief minister, Modi has been known as saheb in Gandhinagar. Today, insiders say, its up to saheb to rescue the party, once again.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

On Monday afternoon, over a hundred Biafrans held a peaceful demonstration at Jantar Mantar to commemorate Heroes Day, where they remember those who died in the civil war between Nigeria and Biafra from 1967-70.Bob Otujeme (36), one of the demonstrators says, Today, our only purpose is to mourn our dead, nothing else. Of course, we condemn the attacks. But today is about letting India know that we need to be free, and to ask for the release of our leader Nmamdi Kanu who was arrested by Nigerian police last year.After the two-hour long protest, 30 of them leave for a meal and a discussion at their coordinators home in north Delhi. In the cramped living room of 46-year-old Mazi Obioha, the smell of Jollof rice  a Biafran chicken and rice delicacy  wafts in.The Biafran radio  founded by Kanu  has been running news of an alleged clash on Heroes Day in Biafra, where a few pro-Biafra protesters have been shot dead.Share This Article Related Article Nigerian police arrest more than 50 in secessionist rally to welcome Donald TrumpNigerian police arrest more than 50 in secessionist rally to welcome Donald Trump Nigeria: Military kills 150 pro-Biafra separatists, says AmnestyNigeria: Military kills 150 pro-Biafra separatists, says Amnesty We were what we ateWe were what we ate Kitchens & ConversationsKitchens & Conversations Nigeria: Security forces kill oil militants, separatistsNigeria: Security forces kill oil militants, separatists Biafra Heroes Day: Remembering fallen heroes of a country that once wasThese protesters died doing exactly what we were doing at Jantar Mantar  holding a peaceful rally.

Appealing to the people to again vote her party into power, Jayalalithaa, or Amma as her supporters like to call her, highlighted the list of schemes including Amma canteens which were not promised earlier but have been launched by her party during its tenure.In its manifesto, the AIADMK has promised things like 100 unit free electricity to every household, employment for one member of every family, free laptops with internet for class 11 and 12 students. Also targeting the women voters, it has promised 50 per cent subsidy to working women to buy scooters, raising financial assistance for pregnant ladies to Rs 18,000 among others.At Jayalalithaas campaign rally in Perundurai, Thursday. (Source: PTI) At Jayalalithaas campaign rally in Perundurai, Thursday. (Source: PTI)Ahead of the general election in 2014, the party laid out a manifesto and promised to extend its popular welfare schemes like giving away of free grinders, mixies, laptops, milch cows and goats, etc to the people. It also promised creation of around 10 crore jobs to tackle the menace of unemployment.For the people of Tamil Nadu, a bouquet of freebies is not a new thing as free electricity to the farmers was reportedly given by AIADMK in the 1980s. In 1967, DMK had promised 3 kg rice for only Re 1.A comparison between 2011 and 2016 manifesto:With some fresh welfare schemes announced by the party this year, there has also been an expansion of the older policies that were announced in previous elections in 2011.While the financial assistance promised to pregnant women in 2011 was Rs 12,000, it has now been raised to Rs 18,000. In addition, the period of maternal leave promised has been extended to nine months in comparison to four months in the past.It has also promised 8 gram of gold as marriage assistance for the public which is double of what was promised during 2011 elections.For the poor fishermen, the party had announced a financial assistance of Rs 4,000 in 2011 which has not been increased to Rs 5,000 as per 2016 manifesto.Jayalalitha and AIADMK supporters attending a rally Jayalalitha and AIADMK supporters attending a rallyA look at promises made by AIADMK and Jayalalitha over the years:2011 electionsFree mixies and grinders to women were announced by Jayalalitha while campaigning for 2011 assembly polls in response to a similar announcement made by rival DMK. The DMK had promised either a mixer or a grinder for the women in state in response to which Jaya promised to give away both along with a fan to each woman.In 2011, the party had also announced supply for 20 litre water and 20 kg free rice for the BPL families. However, the DMK had already promised 35 kg free rice in the past.Apart from this, she also promised four free sets of uniforms and a pair of shoes for the school children. The promise of free laptops for the class 11, 12 and college students was also made in 2011.Free houses of 300 sq ft to three lakh BPL families, 60,000 cows for 6,000 families and Rs 50,000 wedding assistance for women with diploma were also some of the policies that were announced.Jayalalithaa along with her aide Jayalalithaa along with her aide Sasikala waving at her supporters.

These included 10 kg free rice every month and the next 20 kg for only Rs 3.5 per kg.In addition, four gram of gold for the mangalsutra of poor women who were getting married and free laptops for students who pass 12th standard was also promised by Amma.During the 2006 elections, AIADMK also did a lot of chest thumping for reportedly distributing around 5,00,000 bicycled to the students and promised to give away one to every student in the state.Ahead of the elections in 2006, Jayalalitha announced a free textbook scheme for students of government-run and government-aided schools in the state.There have been various other schemes and promises offered by both the AIADMK and DMK in Tamil Nadu over the years. The debt for Tamil Nadu has reportedly gone up by 80 per cent in the last five years and the state has gone into a revenue deficit.

She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta) Parveen Khatoon, 12, along with her niece Noor, 7, begs for alms in trains in the Sealdah line everyday. She sings Hindi and Bengali film songs to entertain the commuters. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)Parveen Khatoon has the power of invisibility.Inside the 1.30 pm Krishnanagar local from Sealdah, in a train full of dozing college students, domestic helps and suburban housewives out on shopping trips, no one has time for a 12-year-old gaunt girl begging for alms. Her pink panda t-shirt, her tight braid, her flower-printed harem pants, everything blends with the background. All that remains is a voice. Loud, high-pitched and melancholic: Garibon ki suno, woh tumhari sunega, tum ek paisa doge, woh dus lakh dega (If you listen to the pleas of the poor, God will listen to your prayers, you give us one paisa, He will give you 10 lakh rupees). The begging anthem of the country is Parveens fallback song. People look up, coins change hands. It always works, says Parveen, adjusting a sound box around her neck. The box is her only paraphernalia, a radio-like contraption with a speaker. It has about 30 songs in it. I play it for added effect while I sing, says Parveen.Last week, a 13-year-old girl fell off a Dhanbad-Jhargram passenger train in Jamshedpur district, sustaining injuries on her face and hand. While some reports said the girl, who begged for alms by singing in trains, had been thrown off by men who were teasing her, others said she fell while trying to get off the moving train.That girl could have been Parveen. But she dismisses any hint of concern by flexing her non-existent, little-girl muscles. Nothing like this would ever happen to me. I am strong, she says.Her mother, Neelam Begum, 37, however, fears the worst. Everyday, I am worried that I might hear bad news  that she has fallen off a train or that someone did something bad to her. But what can I do? I cant accompany her since I have to go out for work, she says.She is also afraid of Parveen falling into bad company. A lot of these children get into the habit of sniffing Dendrite (an adhesive), says Neelam, who works as a domestic help and earns about Rs 3,000 a month.The family of six  Neelam, her four daughters and a granddaughter  lives in Moulali, a slum in central Kolkata. Her husband deserted them years ago, says Neelam.Platform No. 4 of Dum Dum station is Parveens base for the day. Dum Dum is an arterial station in the citys rail network, connecting Kolkatas suburban trains with its underground rail network.Sprawled on the floor at one end of the platform are Parveens aunt Khaleda, 35, sister Shama, 14, and niece Noor, 7. They are eating their lunch  rice and potato curry  straight out of a tiffin carrier.I wake up at 5.30 in the morning and help my sister cook lunch before I leave for school at 6.30, says Parveen. Her school is a special one run by the Missionaries of Charity at Joragirja, a five-minute walk from her house. We have classes till 10.30, after which I run home to collect my music box and then head to Sealdah station, says Parveen. Her sister, niece and aunt join her soon after.There are about 20 beggar-singers at Dum Dum station alone, says Khaleda, Parveens aunt. They start their day at about noon. We usually dont board trains during the peak office-hour rush. No one has time for beggars then, says Parveen.Its 3 pm now and Dum Dum station wears a deserted look. Parveen is waiting for the 15.05 Habra-Sealdah train. This time, little Noor, all of seven, will accompany her. I started this business when I was seven too. There are six people at home and we all contribute, says Parveen, clutching Noors hand tightly as she starts moving towards the approaching train. During this time of the day, there are mainly college students. They like romantic numbers, she adds, pointing to a young couple engaged in an animated conversation at one end of the train.Parveen announces her presence by breaking into the 1992 Nadeem-Shravan melody from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor: Milne ki tum koshish karna, waada kabhi na karna (Make an effort to meet me, but never make a promise). The young woman looks up and blushes. The man hands Noor a Rs 10 note. Mission accomplished.On good days, we make about Rs 150, on normal days, Rs 100, says Parveen, counting her coins at Sealdah station. Its 3.30 pm and even the ever-buzzing Sealdah station is relatively quiet.Parveen has about 100 songs in her repertoire, from Hindi film classics to Bengali devotional songs. Most of the Bollywood hits are from the 1950s-60s and Nadeem- Shravan melodies from the 1990s.I love the song Tu meri zindagi hai from Aashiqui and also songs from Dil Ka Kya Kasoor, says Parveen. She strategically keeps patriotic numbers such as Ae mere watan ke logon for special occasions such as Republic Day, Independence Day, Gandhi Jayanti and Netajis birthday. We also sing patriotic songs when there is an important cricket match, smiles Parveen.At the station, Parveen points to a group of teenagers engaged in an animated discussion. They are Sealdah beggars, we try not to encroach into their territory. We have one route, they have another. But things do get ugly at times, she says, pointing to a scar on her arm.Parveen takes the Sealdah-Dum Dum route about eight times a day. The journey of about 20 minutes each way never really wears her off, she says. What does tire her is the regular harassment by the hawkers association and the occasional threats of the Railway Protection Force.Ticket-checkers never bother us. Even the police just come and shoo us away a few times a year, but hawkers shower us with abuses ever time we walk past them. They say we shouldnt be begging here, that we are creating a nuisance, that we will be run over by a train someday, says Parveen.Sukumar Das, working president of the Dum Dum Station Hawkers Union, says, These children have no idea of the danger they are in. They rush from one platform to the other. They run on tracks. They get into crowded trains. An accident is waiting to happen. They are chased away by the RPF every few months, but they return after a few days, says Das.What else are we supposed to do? asks Parveen as she walks up to another Dum Dum-bound train  for the third time in the day.Its 6 pm and Dum Dum station is abuzz with office crowd. They are the stingiest. Even if they ever give you something, its not more than a rupee, says Parveen.Little Noor and Parveen are about to make the last trip of the day. Back home, there is dinner to be made, tuitions to be attended, homework to be finished and and episode of Sath Nibahana Sathiya to be caught. The 18.07 Bongaon local enters the platform. A surge of humanity rushes towards the train. Parveen grabs Noors hand and disappears into the crowd.Parveen Khatoon is invisible.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta) Bijay Kumar Sain, the youngest son of the Sain family, at Sainbari. (Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)It has been 46 years since the Sainbai massacre but Rekha Rani Sain still wakes up to screams in the middle of the night.On March 17, 1970, a mob of CPM workers had allegedly gouged out the eyes of her husband Naba Kumar Sain  the eldest son of the family  and killed his brothers Malay and Pranab in front of her eyes. Naba Kumar was killed a year later.The centre of the attack, the Sain residence in Burdwan, is now in ruins. Its walls are covered with wild growth and the main entrance has been blocked by a wall to keep off on-lookers. Political leaders every year visit the one-storey house to garland a martyrs dome that has been constructed.With the wound still fresh in in the hearts of the survivors, the electoral understanding between Congress and CPM has not gone down too well. The reason: CPM cadres had allegedly attacked the family as it supported Congress.Rekha Rani, now 72, had left her residence at Pratapeswar Shibtala Lane  in the heart of Burdwan district  in 1978 and shifted to a rented apartment at Buri Bagan area nearby. Living at Sainbari would have meant reliving the incident every day.My brothers-in-laws Pranab Kumar Sain and Malay Kumar Sain and Jitendranath Rai, a private tutor who had come to teach the kids, were hacked in front of my eyes. I was 26. It all began at 7.30 am people stared pelting stones on our house. Later, they set it on fire, she said.While a few thousand waited outside the house, dozens broke in and killed the three men.My mother-in-law, Mrignayana Devi, tried to stop the attackers but she was hit on her head. Two attackers mixed Pranab and Malays blood with rice and forced it into her mouth She was taken to the hospital she survived, Rekha Rani said.Asked if she would vote, Rekha Rani said: I am not well. If my health permits, I might. But what is the point? My family was killed by CPM cadres for supporting Congress. Now, the same Congress has joined hands with the CPM.Accusing the Mamata government of using the tragedy for its gain, she said: On special occasions, like July 21 Martyrs Day event in Kolkata, I had been displayed on the stage as a showpiece with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee handing over an envelope containing Rs 10,000 No one wants to find out how we are living in impunity, running from pillar to post trying to gather funds for my treatment.Bijay Kumar Sain, the youngest son of the family, said the incident has been interpreted differently by different interest groups. The ruling party wanted me to name people I dont remember being present at the time of the attack. If I followed the diktat, I would probably have got a government job. On the other hand, those allegedly involved in the murders want me to say they were not there at the time of the attack, he claimed.He added: Many of my relatives have accepted jobs and monetary help from the ruling party It is not possible to forget but I would not want to cash in on the occasion.Active in the construction business, Bijay Kumar has built a building right next to Sainbari. I am often invited to functions to mark the day of the massacre but I avoid the same. I garland the dome when everyone has left. I say my silent prayer, he said.Earlier, Bijay Kumar claimed a number of security guards used to protect his family. They were reportedly withdrawn by the Left Front government. The Trinamool government has given me one security guard. It is only a formality they want to show they have provided security to the Sain family. I urge them to take it back. There is no logic behind having one security guard. He has to go for his meals What happens then? he asked.A daughter of the family, Swarnalata, lives at Badamtala. On the fateful day, the family had gathered for a function to be organised for her son Amrit Kumar Jash  then one month old. Amrit, now 46, said he and his mother were lucky to stay alive.Udai Kumar Sain, Rekha Ranis brother-in-law, stays at Sukantanagar. His wife UmaSain is the sitting councillor of Ward 34 in Burdwan Municipality. Mamata Banerjee has promised there would be justice The Congress-Left alliance is not acceptable, he maintained.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Right in the middle of the Nabarangpur main road, for days on end, a temple chariot rests long after the festivities are over, till it is ritualistically dismantled.

Built under the Indira Awaas Yojana, the building has been modelled by the sarkari builder on an approved concrete mould.For good measure, the builder has thrown in an Om motif. Not that the Adivasi has any faith issue over it, it is a needless imposition of authority, like a rubber stamp duly affixed. All of which would have been pardonable if the roof hadnt cracked. The welfare beneficiary has had to go back to the locally baked earth tiles to plug the leak.

My parents were talking to me on the phone when I heard the gunshots, said Rahul, who was then working in Kerala as a stone crusher.WATCH VIDEO: First Only-Tribal CRPF Battalion In Naxal Zone SoonPongalapadar 2015Dhuba Nayak, 50, and his wife Bhubudi had walked 2 km from Pongalapadar to a hill to call up their three sons living in Kerala and Hyderabad. The couple were stopped by jawans carrying out a combing operation. In the next half-hour, villagers remember hearing gunshots. Then Kandhamal SP K V Singh called it an encounter with Maoists while police showed country-made rifles, jerrycans and kitbags to local journalists.How could a preacher who had voted in the 2014 election, and was seen in the village, have been a Maoist? said Rahul.Amid the outcry over the latest killings, no police officer was willing to come on record over this incident or those preceding it, except insisting that the villagers killed last week, who were travelling in an autorickshaw, came in the line of firing between the SOG and Maoists. About the Nayak couple, a senior police officer said a probe had found that the bullets in their bodies were not of the kind used by SOG personnel. But Rahul alleged, Nothing came out of a probe by the Revenue Divisional Commissioner. An ADG-ranked officer conducted a separate probe and tried to show my parents were Maoists.Rahul now looks after his two younger brothers and sister. All we got was a temporary job of peon in the Kotagarh BDOs office for my brother and Rs 2 lakh from Red Cross, he said. The money was spent in repaying my fathers loans and arranging a feast.Gumudumaha 2016CM Naveen Patnaik has ordered a judicial probe. The government has set up a special investigation team headed by addl DGP (human rights protection cell) Mahendra Pratap. The State Human Rights Commission has sought a report from the home secretary, the DGP, the IG (southern range) and the RDC. Officials said Rameswar Oraon, chairman of the National Commission for STs, will be in Odisha from Tuesday, visit Kandhamal and submit a report to the Home Ministry.The BJP and the Congress called a bandh in Kandhamal Monday, and agitated on the streets. Former Congress MP Pradip Majhi sat on a dharna outside the district collectors office demanding the arrest of the SP and IG. The BJP demanded murder cases against the policemen and compensation to the families of those killed and injured. BJD spokesman Pratap Deb accused the opposition of politicising the issue.The other cases# NOVEMBER 15, 2015. The SOG came under criticism after they allegedly shot dead three villagers including two tribals of Kalahandi in a reserve forest. Two boys too were injured. The five tribals from Nisanguda and Panchkul villages were apparently looking for missing goats of panchayat ward member Jay Shankar Naik. SOG personnel were then combing the area in search of a Maoist group. Naik, who was a Dalit, and tribals Jay Majhi and Sukru were killed.Initially, local police and intelligence officials in Bhubaneswar said the deceased were victims of a crossfire. But then Kalahandi SP Brijesh Rai said the deceased prima facie seemed to be Maoists as police had found a muzzle loader, empty cartridges and Maoist literature near the bodies. Police gave Rs 40,000 each to the families of the deceased for cremation. The Odisha Human Rights Commission is still probing the incident.# DECEMBER 27, 2010. A team of SOG and CRPF combing the jungles near Paikmal block of Bargarh district claimed to have killed two Maoists. One of these was Madhav Singh Thakur, then president of Paikmal block of the BJP; the other was businessman Ramesh Sahu. Bargarh police said they had information of a Maoist camp. They did not, however, recover any firearms or Maoist literature from the camp, only some rice and dal.Thakur was associated with Gandhamardan Surakshya Parishad for several years, said Pradip Purohit, BJP MLA from Bargarh. Three days before he was killed, he had gone to the police station to help cops find a boy who had eloped with a local girl. How could the police brand him a Maoist?In an order in 2012, the National Human Rights Commission said there was no evidence that Thakur and Sahu had Maoist links. It asked the state government to take action against the police officials; the state has filed a review petition.Situated between CPI(Maoist)s regional bureaus in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, Odisha has an estimated 500 Maoists in 10 districts. Some 25,000 policemen and 16 battalions of BSF and CRPF are engaged against them. The Kandhamal case could affect the anti-Maoist operations, an officer admitted.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Is it a populist budget on the eve of the elections?It is true that the election is round the corner, but this budget is a continuation of the five presented by former finance minister K M Mani. The mantra of the UDF government has been development and care. There should be development, but with a human face There is a section of the population that needs special, urgent care. They cannot wait for the fruits of development to reach them.Which are these sections?We have prioritised. Those who are mentally retarded, those suffering from cerebral palsy, autism etc they need special attention. We have given huge priority to the health sector. The issue Kerala is facing today is not hunger but access to affordable health-care. Kerala has the best medical treatment but it is not affordable to all The plight of women deserted by their husbands is really sad. We have announced pension for them and free education for their children.What will be your USP for the elections?Kerala has lagged in development The last five years have seen an infrastructure growth like never before. Three major projects  Vizhinjam port, Kochi Metro and airport in Kannur  have taken off. We are building 100 bridges in 400 days. The decision to shut down bars has made a qualitative change in society, flow of liquor mafia money has come down. Suicides have come down, there is a decrease in crime It was my government that started promoting start-ups. It has drawn up a start-up policy We decided to offer 25 kg free rice a month to BPL families, which will benefit 90 lakh people.How confident are you about the polls?We have been winning elections despite all these allegations. When we came to power we only had a majority of two MLAs and many thought we would not complete six months, but we are completing five years. During these five years, I have ensured my government has not functioned like a government that does not have a huge majority For instance, before the bar scandal came up, there was speculation about K M Mani, that he may leave the UDF, but I was sure nothing would happen.But have the controversies affected the image of the party and the government?The people of Kerala know the truth. What are they (opposition) raking up? Biju Radhakrishnan (main accused in the solar scam), who was accused of murdering his wife, was walking free when the LDF was in power. When we came to power, we appointed a team and a special prosecutor. Radhakrishnan had only been charged with sections relating to atrocities on women, but we added the charge of murder and today he is behind bars, awarded a life sentence. It is natural that he would turn against the government and me. There was an allegation that the Left offered Rs 10 crore to that woman (Saritha Nair) but we never attacked the CPM with that because we know we should not trust the claims of a woman who is facing 33 cases But the CPM is doing that because they have nothing else to say.What about your personal image? After K Karunakaran, no other chief minister has faced such personal allegations.K Karunakaran has nothing to do with the spy case. This controversy will in effect only benefit me because the people understand who are levelling these allegations and what their motive is. Look at the bar case. Many had advised us not to shut down bars, we did not care. A section of them said they would bring down my government, but did not succeed. They went to court, but did not get a favourable verdict. A section of them have lost their mental balanceDo you regret taking that decision?I have no regrets and my government will not go back I would not have the strength to fight if there was even one per cent truth in these allegations. I have been crucified for doing a good thing. They are trying to directly implicate me as an accused in all these cases had they said we are not implicating the chief minister directly but he has a moral responsibility, I would have been in a fix.But dont you have a moral responsibility?They (opposition) are not saying that.I am asking.Let that be. They are saying I am responsible, which I cannot accept because I am innocent. And that gives me more strength, the strength of conscience to fight back.Why didnt you file a defamation case over Sarithas claims?Who should I file against? A person who has been sentenced to life imprisonment or a person who is facing 33 cases? My son will file a case. I have appointed a commission. Let the commission decide.Had you resigned when the allegation first came up, do you think the controversy would not have come to this stage and your family could have been spared?These are baseless allegations. I had appointed the commission on their demand. But the CPM did not join, they dont even have a chit of paper as evidence against me. When the commission called them, they merely reiterated the allegations they had levelled in the assembly. I dare them to prove three things  whether the exchequer has lost even a rupee, whether the government has given any benefit to them, and whether there was an laxity in fighting the casesBut the Opposition says Saritha benefited because of your meetings with her. She advertised her so-called proximity with you to collect funds.V S Achuthanandan and (former minister) A K Balan advertised them first. They (Team Solar) sponsored their programme, attended by Achuthanandan and Balan in 2010. Kairali (CPMs news channel) interviewed him as the MD of a big company. They (LDF government) did not pursue a single case against them They were arrested but the government intervened and said these are civil cases and protected them. They (the accused) used the names of Narendra Modi, P Chidambaram and Farooq Abdullah. They say they have given me Rs 1.90 crore but could not even get a letter from my office. They forged my letterhead and they have been sentenced for that forgery.Sreedharan Nair, the complainant in the case, said he gave her money after he and Saritha met with you.Lets examine that. He entered into an agreement and gave three cheques. He came to meet me after two of those had been encashed, only the third cheque was enchased after he met me. This is a big fraud. I appeared before the commission and completed my testimony in two hours. After that I said I was ready to sit there and face all cross questions. I sat there for 14 hours.. Radhakrishnans advocate asked me cross questions, but not even a single question was asked by that womans lawyer. She had raised serious allegations and that was the platform to ask questions, but they didnt.The Opposition talks about inconsistencies in your statements about your meeting with her.I never said I havent met her. My office is always full of people. She may have come to give a representation When Radhakrishnan came to complain about her, I couldnt place her. He reminded me that they had come to give a representation. The controversy began when it came to light that two or three people in my office used to talk to her over phone. I ordered an inquiry and those three people were asked to stay away He (Radhakrishnan) spoke to me about his family matters.These allegations against you and leaders close to you, have anything to do with internal Congress politics?Nothing. The Congress is united, the UDF is united. This is a trick of a demoralised CPM.Will you be the face of Congress in the elections?I cannot say. The Congress never decides chief ministers in advance. The party leadership will decide.But you will contest?I cannot say that. The party will decide. There is no fighting in the Congress on those matters like there is in the CPM.What is your view on a possible alliance with the CPM in West Bengal?We are not opposing anything, whatever the stand in Bengal, because we have complete confidence that we will retain power in Kerala. We dont fear that an alliance in Bengal would help the BJP or the CPM here Let the high command and the Bengal unit decide.How do you see the style of functioning of Prime Minister Narendra Modi?I have difference of opinion with many of the decisions taken by Modi. The most important is scrapping the well-established, well-accepted Planning Commission without putting in place an alternative mechanism. It was a short-sighted and wrong decision. Besides, the BJP used to speak a lot about price rise. During UPA there was a huge surge in prices of crude oil in the international market. Prices have come down by a third, but the benefit has not been passed on to the people. We have passed on the benefit. We told the state road transport corporation to slash fares by a rupee. We will tell private bus operators to follow suit.Rahul Gandhi has said only the Congress can defeat the Congress. Will factionalism cost the party?I agree with him. If the Congress remains united and the UDF remain united, the people of Kerala will remain with us. We will return to power.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo by Subham Dutta) The body of Sheikh Fazal Haque, a CPM polling agent who was killed Thursday night, reaches his village Friday. (Express Photo by Subham Dutta)Simmering tension in a West Bengal village split in two political halves erupted on Thursday night when a CPI(M) worker and a polling agent of the party were allegedly hacked to death by TMC supporters, hours after voting ended in the third phase of Assembly elections in the state.According to police and residents of Lodhna village in the Khandaghosh Assembly constituency of Bardhaman, polling agent Sheikh Fazal Haque (56) and Dukhi Ram Dal (56) were attacked with lathis and iron rods as they were returning home at about 8 pm on Thursday.The two were rushed to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital but died soon after, police said.While both parties blamed each other for the clash that led to the killings, police officers traced the violence to a political upheaval in 2011 when the TMC made deep inroads into what had been a Left stronghold since 1942.So much so, that Lodhna, on the banks of the Damodar river, has since split into two halves  Gainpara, comprising TMC sympathisers, and Metepara, which has stuck with the Left. Haque and Dal were from Metepara. Thursdays attack took place on a narrow bridge connecting Gainpara and Metepara, said police.After an explosion, it seems Haque tried to flee but got entangled in some netting on the edge of a field and was killed there. Dal was chased for a while and then hacked, said Sub-Inspector Mohammad Saifuddin, who was on duty in the area at the time of the incident.One live bomb and residue from several exploded bombs were later recovered from the site, said police.According to a senior police officer, tension escalated after CPI(M)s sitting MLA Nabin Chandra Bag moved to the TMC last November and announced that he would be contesting the Assembly elections.In 2011, the TMC had won 15 of the 25 Assembly seats from the district, with the Congress winning one and the Left Front taking eight. This time, with the Left-Congress alignment threatening to eat into the ruling partys tally, the TMC has been desperate to retain control. While 40-year-old Bag bagged the TMC ticket this time, 30-year-old Asima Roy was the CPI(M) candidate from Khandaghosh, a reserved constituency.A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo) A man lying at a local hospital after some of his political rivals cut his ear after he cast his vote to CPI(M) candidate in Burdwan, Thursday. (PTI Photo)Here, politics isnt something that ends with elections. The party high command has promised us that we will win in this election. So we are fighting for our party, doing what we can. This is a fight for survival. If TMC wins the elections, we will be killed, said Bijoy Dal, the 35-year-old son of Dukhi Ram Dal.Violence is a way of life here, said an officer at the Khandaghosh police station. This village is notorious for its production of hand-made guns, bombs and fake gold coins. Earlier, when the Left was in power, such villages in Khandaghosh were impossible to enter, he said, adding that three TMC workers were killed during clashes in the Khandaghosh area last June.Most of the villagers at Lodhna  part of West Bengals rice belt  are descendants of sharecroppers who were given land in the 1970s as part of land reforms pioneered by the Left. Being a CPI(M) worker in a village like this used to be a job in itself. It was something we could fall back on in case of emergencies. That changed with the TMC coming into power. So many people are now joining the TMC and voting for them, said Mohammad Rafique, a 65-year-old farmer.Family members of the two killed on Thursday and CPI(M) workers in the village alleged that Haque and Dal were returning home after polling when they were ambushed by over 100 TMC workers armed with knives, sticks, iron rods and bombs.But police said the deaths were caused by clashes between both parties. The CPI(M) workers tried to attack TMC workers but were ambushed instead. No arrests have been made. But we have detained four men and are questioning those who were present there. We will investigate the matter, said Deputy Superintendent of Police D Bhattacharya.But family members of the deceased alleged that police failed to heed repeated warnings of an impending attack by TMC supporters. I had warned police that there would be violence. They are cooking up this story of us attacking them. The simple fact is we dont have the kind of numbers anymore to pull off an attack. About a month ago, I was attacked and had my ribs fractured. The police did nothing, alleged Dal.TMC candidate Bag and the partys block president Alok Majhi denied allegations of their workers involvement in the violence.Describing the attack, SI Saifuddin said, It was very dark about a 100-odd men appeared with knives and bombs. Apart from me, there were five other personnel from the Central armed forces. We were hopelessly outnumbered. We tried to disperse them with a lathi-charge but couldnt.What has added to the resentment among CPI(M) supporters in the village is the discovery of a live bomb from the site almost 20 hours after the attack. The bomb, weighing about 250 gm, was spotted by a TV journalist, said police.Even after we informed police about the bomb, it took them about another half an hour to remove it, alleged Ayesha Begum, a local resident.Said SI Saifuddin, I checked the site myself and found nothing. It is possible the bomb may have been placed later by some mischievous elements.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

File Photo/Agencies. Mehbooba stated that she is going to recommend at least two routes to the Home Ministry. File Photo/Agencies.Nearly a decade after the Uri-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot routes were reopened for trade and travel by people on both sides of the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, a few more routes are likely to be opened as part of additional confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan.When I met the Union Home Minister the last time, he had hinted at opening some more routes, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said Tuesday. I told him that the Suchetgarh route should be opened.Watch Video: Whats making newsSuchetgarh is on the international border in R S Pura tehsil in Jammu, and across the border is Sialkot district of Pakistan.Many routes came up for discussion  Suchetgarh, Nowshera-Jhanghar, Kargil-Skardu, Turtuk-Thapalu, among others. But he (Home Minister Rajnath Singh) said that we can consider opening one or two roads at the moment. If I am asked about two roads which need to be opened immediately, I will name Suchetgarh and Kargil-Skardu, Mehbooba said while addressing a function on the occasion of signing of an MoU between Jammu Development Authority and the Sabarmati River Front Development Corporation Limited, Ahmedabad, for management consultancy and technical assistance for development of the Tawi riverfront in Jammu.R S Pura tehsil is considered the rice bowl of Indias fine basmati rice, and Mehbooba said our basmati goes there (to Pakistan), adding that there is lot of hardware industry in on the Indian side, while Pakistan manufactures very little, and additional border routes would mean many items can be exported to Pakistan. The state will benefit the way Punjab has benefitted from Wagah boder, she said.Recalling the teamwork between former CM Mufti Sayeed and Deputy CM Nirmal Singh for the Tawi river beautification project, Mehbooba said Mufti always had a soft corner for the people of Jammu and used to call them truly secular, as they not only accommodated lakhs of Hindu and Muslim migrants from Valley but also shared their land, water and electricity with them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

PTI photo Trucks stranded on the national highway near Churaibari in Tripura. PTI photoSTRUGGLING IN the absence of supplies for two months, the landlocked state of Tripura found temporary relief Monday as three goods trains arrived from Lumding in central Assam, bringing 2,600 tonnes rice and 1,800 tonnes salt and sugar.The states lone highway link, meanwhile, remained blocked with several hundred goods-laden trucks still stuck on the state border. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 28 crore for repair of the road, but the actual work can be carried out only after the rainy season ends, in October.With the railway link restored, things have improved slightly, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Bhanulal Saha said from Agartala. But not all kinds of items are transported by train. The highway is still in a deplorable condition between Lowerpoah and Churaibari on the Assam border.Train services too had stopped for two months until the weekend, with the newly built broad-gauge track between Lumding and Badarpur in Assam snapped due to massive landslides in several places in Dima Hasao district in the first week of May. It was only Saturday that the first three goods train moved after the railways created a temporary diversion at Migrendisa.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe states only highway link with the rest of India, NH-8, was already lacking repair for years when the monsoon turned a long stretch  5 km between Lowerpoah and Churaibari  into a dirt-track with huge potholes and knee-deep slush. Hundreds of trucks loaded with supplies have been stuck on the Assam side for weeks, with the authorities managing to move the less heavy ones through a bypass.The authorities have regulated sale of petrol and diesel across the state to tide over the crisis, while raids have been conducted on shops that have allegedly hoarded foodgrains and other essential commodities.An official in Agartala said it would take at least one month to repair the alternative route, and stone chips and sand have been used as a temporary measure to keep a supply line intact by moving 50 to 60 trucks a day. The Left Front government has been pushing for funds to repair the highway, with Governor Tathagata Roy and Chief Minister Manik Sarkar writing several letters to the Prime Minister and the minister for highways over the last several weeks.The Centre last month sanctioned Rs 28 crore for repair of the Churaibari-Lowerpoah portion of the national highway but an official in Agartala said it would take time for complete repair of the road because of the procedures involved.Tripura, connected with only one highway and one railway track to the rest of the country, is solely dependent on central allocation of foodgrains to feed its 3.67 million mouths. In 2014-15, when the lone rail link underwent a mega-block for the final phase of broad-gauge conversion, the state had to be provided foodgrains from mainland India through the sea route via Bangladesh. Work on the much delayed East-West Corridor portion between Lumding and Silchar in Assam has added to Tripuras problems.Tripuras monthly requirement of foodgrains is 30,000 tonnes. It also gets 2,718 tonnes sugar, 8,500 kilolitres petrol and diesel and 3276 kl kerosene every month, all transported through the hilly roads of Meghalaya and Assam, which are perennially blocked during the monsoon.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(PTI Photo) Anjani Devi says she adopted Radhika (above) when she was a year old. (PTI Photo)On the Gurazala-Macharla road, 100 km from the district headquarters of Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, stands Sreedevi Rice Mill, 1977, a decrepit single-storey building with the locks on. The mill, which wound up operations in 2002, is owned by the Vemulas, once among the more affluent families of Gurazala village. It was to this family that Radhika came as a child bride, after her marriage to Vemula Manikumar, one of the three sons of Vemula Venkateshwarlu.Weeks after his grandson Rohith Vemulas suicide rocked Hyderabad Central University and with questions about his Dalit identity continuing to be the subject of political debates, Venkateshwarlu settles down to talk at his home in Vaddera Colony.Yes, he was my grandson but that was not the name we gave him when he was born. He was named Manik Chakravarthi, jewel of our eyes and king of the world, says Venkateshwarlu, 65, beaming with pride.In Gurazala, villagers talk fondly of the Vemulas. It was Rohiths great grandfather, Vemula Mallaiah, who got a shelter and the public wells in the village built, they say. The family once owned 40 acres but Venkateshwarlu now has two acres as his share of the ancestral property. His main source of income now is the rent he gets from half a dozen houses he owns in the area.Venkateshwarlu lives here with his wife Raghavamma and son Manikumar, 43. His other sons, Mallikarjuna Rao and Ravi Kumar, live in Hyderabad.My son Manikumar did not look after his wife Radhika and their children (Neelima, Rohith and Raja). He turned alcoholic and squandered away his share of the wealth. He would not take care of the rice mill or the few assets that he got as share of the family property, says Venkateshwarlu.In 1985, Venkateshwarlus father Vemula Mallaiah arranged Manikumars marriage with Radhika, 17, the daughter of a state government employee and school teacher living in Guntur town. So thats how city girl Radhika, about 14 years old and who had studied till her Class 10, ended up marrying a school dropout from Gurazala.Rohith Vemula, in blue shirt, with his friend Riyaz Shaikh (Courtesy: Riyaz Shaikh) Rohith Vemula, in blue shirt, with his friend Riyaz Shaikh (Courtesy: Riyaz Shaikh)Less than five years later, it was clear the marriage was failing. Not only did Manikumar drink heavily, he suffered from violent bouts of schizophrenia. The daily arguments in the Vemula family over Manikumars drinking habits and his verbal and physical abuse soon became a public spectacle in the Vaddera colony.Desperate to get out of the situation, in 1993, Radhika decided to take her three children and go back to her parents in Guntur. In 1995, Manikumar, who would travel to Guntur to see his family almost every other day, convinced Radhika to return to the village.They came back and the three children were enrolled in the village government school. Rohith must have been nine or 10 then. But in 1998, when the beatings and the arguments got worse, Radhika went back to her home in Guntur, says Venkateshwarlu.He says Manikumar kept going back to his wife and children and even tried finding a job in Guntur. He got a few jobs but would be thrown out within a day or two because he used to borrow money and get drunk on duty. The last job he did was of a security guard, but that didnt last either. When Rohith died, I went to Guntur and brought Manikumar back home, says Venkateshwarlu.I was shocked when Rohith committed suicide and I was even more shocked when it was claimed that he was a Dalit. We still dont believe Radhika belongs to a Scheduled Caste (SC). If we had known, we would not have allowed the marriage in the first place. My son says even he did not know about Radhikas caste until Rohiths suicide. I swear, he says.Rohiths paternal grandparents Venkateshwarlu and Raghavamma at their home in Gurazala village, Guntur. (Express Photo by Harsha Vadlamani) Rohiths paternal grandparents Venkateshwarlu and Raghavamma at their home in Gurazala village, Guntur. (Express Photo by Harsha Vadlamani)Manikumars younger brother Vemula Mallikarjuna, a software tester working in Hyderabad, says he was in Class VI when his brother got married to Radhika. I think they had some problems  she was from the city and my brother a villager. My brother is also to be blamed because he was alcoholic and suffered from mental illness. He can be violent and abusive during such bouts. After my brother and his family moved out of Gurazala, I did not see the children much but I know that Rohith was a brilliant child. Through relatives and friends, I would hear about how well he had done in school and later in college in Guntur. As far as I know, he never needed a caste certificate. The last time I met Rohith was in September 2014 at Nizamabad during a family wedding. We exchanged pleasantries but I dont think he told me he was doing his PhD at University of Hyderabad. We did not interact much because Radhika and the three children stayed away from us, Mallikarjun says.After Radhika left Gurazala, she first moved in with her parents, Basnala Muslaiah and Anjani Devi, to their home in Prakash Nagar and later shifted to another house in the same colony.Prakash Nagar, which stands parallel to the railway line near Railpet in Guntur district, was once a red-light area but now the trade is confined to a few houses in the first row. Inside the colony is a residential area where hundreds of families from lower-income groups live in two-room tenements.It was in one of these tenements that Radhika and her children lived, between 1998 and 2005. Though Radhika later moved to a house in Savitri Nagar and then to Hyderabad in 2013, almost everybody in Prakash Nagar knows her and her children.Ask anyone, they will tell you about Radhika. She is a hardworking woman, a good tailor and does embroidery too, says Uppalapati Danamma, in her 60s, who was municipal councillor from Prakash Nagar ward from 2000 to 2010.Danamma, who lives a few houses away from Radhikas parents, says there is a lot more she knows about the family. Radhika wasnt their biological child. The couple have four children  two sons and two daughters  and they had adopted her when she was a year old, says Danamma, adding that Radhika was ill-treated by her mother Anjani and was made to work like a servant.Of course, it was much later that we came to know that Radhika was their adopted child. Anjani often abused her, making frequent references to her Mala (SC) caste. I think Radhika was 14 or 15 when Anjani once wondered aloud why she had even brought this useless Mala girl home, says Danamma.So who are Radhikas biological parents? No one knows. Only Anjani Devi can tell, says Danamma.Radhika says she is close to her amma Anjani Devi (above). (Express Photo by Harsha Vadlamani) Radhika says she is close to her amma Anjani Devi (above). (Express Photo by Harsha Vadlamani)At her home in Prakash Nagar, Anjani Devi says, Yes, I adopted Radhika. That was some 45 years ago. Her parents were labourers who had been brought in for some work on the railway line. Radhika was their second child. Her parents had named her Bodduamma. She was fair and cute and would crawl all over the place she was probably just over one-year-old then. The family was very poor, they toiled all day in the sun, leaving Radhika under a tree. I had just lost my baby, a girl born after two sons. I was distraught. My heart went out to this baby. Even without asking them, I knew they were from the SC Mala community since most migrant labourers belonged to that caste. Anyway, I later confirmed with them. When Radhikas parents were moving out of the site after their work, I asked them if I could adopt the baby. They readily agreed. I brought her home and named her Radhika.After we adopted Radhika, I gave birth to two girls. Radhika was the fairest of my daughters and I raised her with a lot of affection. Who is saying that I mistreated her and made her do all the household work? She did household work but so did my two other daughters. I have taught all my daughters everything, from cleaning the house to tailoring. What is wrong in working in your own home? I gave sewing machines as gifts to my three daughters when they got married. That is what helped Radhika the most, she says.Anjani Devi says her relationship with Radhika changed five years after her marriage, and worsened when Radhika decided to take up her caste as SC-Mala. I had raised Radhika as a Vaddera and got her married to a Vaddera boy who came from an affluent family. The boys grandfather is very well known in Gurazala as a philanthrophist. We didnt hide the truth about Radhikas adoption and told him that she was from an SC family but raised as a Vaddera. He had no objection. Unfortunately, Radhikas husband Manikumar turned out to be a drunkard, she says.Anjani admits she knew the bridegroom was an alcoholic. We were informed by some people, but by that time we had made all the arrangements for the wedding, she says. When she could not bear Manikumars harassment, we asked her to return home with her three children. Since her husband would frequently keep dropping in and we didnt have space for all of them, Radhika moved to a one-room house nearby.Anjani Devi says the lane Radhika moved into was an SC colony and that its there that she took on her SC identity. The children had just started going to school. I do not know when and from where she got this idea but she got SC certificates for herself and for the children, mentioning them as Mala. She should not have done that. For me, she is a Vaddera. Rohith and Raja did not need SC certificates at all. Rohith was brilliant and so is Raja. It is only after Rohiths suicide that we came to know that the caste issue was being raked up, she says.Even after Radhika and her three children started living separately, she would be called to help at Anjanis household. By then, Anjanis two daughters had moved out after marriage. Radhika also cooked and cleaned at the daycare centre for the aged which Anjani Devi ran out of her home, where at least 20 people are given free lunch.Anjani admits Radhika did a lot of household work, but adds, that was like any of my daughters would.However, according to Rohiths friend Riyaz Shaikh, the children resented the fact that their mother worked like a servant at their grandmothers house. And that when their mother couldnt go, Anjani would call one of the children to work.Riyaz says Rohith, his best friend and classmate at Hindu College in Guntur where they did their BSc, hardly spoke about his family problems. But as a close friend, he knew. I know Radhika auntys problems at Anjani Devis house bothered him. Radhika aunty used to fetch water, cook and do all the work, even take care of her siblings children. They were never allowed to forget that Radhika had been adopted and that they were of a lower caste.In Hyderabad, Radhika says she doesnt want to hurt anyones feelings. She says she is very close to her amma and that Anjani Devi was the first person from the family to reach Hyderabad on hearing of Rohiths suicide. There were certain reasons I was forced to move out of Prakash Nagar (Anjani Devis house). I dont want to disclose them now. I dont want to hurt anyones feelings, she says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

591f46c97be9e025a5d4c9c1,"Growing demand for edu based on S Asian culture, language",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/523107/growing-demand-edu-based-s.html,2016-01-14,"Growing demand for edu based on S Asian culture, languageM J Warsi, January 15, 2016 23:45 ISTEfforts are being made these days to enrich teaching second language in United States schools at primary and secondary level. This has long been the standard for most schools in India, where children learn both national languages (English and Hindi) and often their regional language. Americans are now following suit in raising children to be bilingual or even trilingual.So, why do we seek to learn languages other than our mother tongue? Why spend hours memorising the genders of new nouns, different verb conjugations and how to pronounce letters in a new alphabet? Each person has his/her own answer to this question. Whether it is to communicate with a beloved grandparent, to stay competitive in a global market or simply to increase your knowledge.However, it is essential to learn the culture in tandem with the language you are learning as well. We need to understand culture in order to get the perspective of native speakers, understand the history of the language so we can visit the region in which that language is spoken.In the initial stages of learning a language, it is overwhelming enough to learn the basics such as the alphabet, vocabulary and verb tenses. At that point, being able to write and speak in coherent, grammatically correct sentences is an accomplishment in itself.But becoming an advanced beginner or intermediate student of a language requires more than just being able to county to twenty, name colours/ animals and introducing yourself. It requires you to see the language from the viewpoint of a native speaker, and for that, you need to learn the culture.According to Katherine Surko, her experience in studying Hindi at Washington University in Saint Louis has been fantastic. In September, I knew may be half the alphabet tops, but now I am able to read and write whole paragraphs, which is well beyond what I thought I would be able to accomplish within a year. It is so exciting for me to be able to see such tangible progress, and it makes me really excited for new levels I will reach within the upcoming years. I enjoy the holistic approach our class takes from focusing on writing to speaking to having scattered events throughout the semester, and I look forward to continuing my Hindi studies in the fall in order to meet both my personal and professional goals.Knowing traditions and values better allows us to understand the idioms. An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of its constituent elements, or from the general grammatical rules of a language. Idioms are used in every language but often seem foreign to non-native speakers because they cannot be translated directly. Understanding their usage requires a certain amount of exposure to the language as well as insight into the culture.Take for example, the Hindi phrase Khichdi pakaana. Literally translated to English, it means to make khichdi but this makes no sense without knowing what khichdi is. Khichdi, a mixture of rice and lentils cooked with spices and sometimes vegetables, is the quintessential north-Indian comfort food, a meal cooked on rainy days when people are cooped up indoors. Armed with this tidbit of information, it makes sense that the phrase figuratively means to scheme secretively/hatch a plan.History as linkAnother aspect linking language and culture is history. Just as culture evolves with times, so does language. Thus, the cultures past shows us the factors that have gone into shaping the language as we know it.A great example of this is the Hindi-Urdu language, otherwise known as Hindustani. In the early second millennium BCE, Sanskrit was brought to the Indus valley by those who settled there. A member of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit soon became the standard (both spoken and written) in the region.In the mid-16th century, the Mughal empire (a Muslim Persianate imperial power that ruled much of India for the next few centuries) brought Arabic and Persian languages to the region. These, combined with the Sanskrit derivatives spoken by natives, created a blended language called Hindustani. The mid-19th century saw the introduction of British Raj in India.To allow for communication with the colonial rulers, English words were incorporated into the Hindi vernacular (such as the months of the Judeo-Christian calendar). Even the partition of India in 1947 brought changes for the language.While Urdu and Hindi are written in different scripts, they share a common set of sounds, words and grammatical rules due to their common history. In fact, speakers of Hindi, for the most part, are able to understand Urdu and vice versa.Regardless of ones relation to Indian culture, it is virtually impossible to escape its influence in the United States. Open a newspaper every morning and one can find an article regarding Indias role as an up and coming economic and cultural force in the world. Turn on the television and one can find entire TV shows, such as Outsourced, related to India. Historically tied to the West, Indian culture now permeates every aspect of American life from curry cook books to yoga.At the basis of these trends are the linguistic traditions rooted in Hindi. Along with Indias role in international affairs, the demand for an education based on South Asian culture and language is growing and US universities are answering the call.The history and nuances of a language derive directly from the culture of its speakers. Thus, attempting to learn a language without learning its associated culture is to miss out on everything that makes the language unique, exciting and beautiful.(The writer, a linguist, teaches at the Washington University in St Louis, USA)"
591f60467be9e025a5d4da1a,Green Wardrobe for a sustainable future,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/564495/green-wardrobe-sustainable-future.html,2016-08-14,"Green Wardrobe for a sustainable futureSivaram Pillai, Aug 15, 2016, 0:41 ISTTirupur is a small, dusty, hot town in the Kongu Nadu region of Tamil Nadu, yet can easily be called the fashion capital of the country, and perhaps the world. For decades now Tirupur has been spinning out haute couture for several high-end international brands like Gap and Tommy Hilfiger. It nets billions of dollars every year and is a classic example of globalisation. Tirupur provides employment for about half-a-million people and exports clothes worldwide.The story of Tiurpur is an example which has motivated the government of India, to recently announce a Rs 6,000 crore package for the textile industry, which includes more flexible labour laws and many financial incentives. The government recognises the tremendous opportunity for employment generation in the industry and obviously wants to make use of this potential to achieve some its stated goals in employment generation.However, there are also many challenges facing the textile sector and one of the main issues is the pollution caused by the industry. The lush green rice paddies and coconut palms that once defined Tirupur city are now replaced with scrub forests and dry lands. The famous Noyyal River, upon whose banks the city was built, has lost all its glory and is polluted with effluents discharged by textile plants in this region.The textile industry, on an average, consumes 100 MT of water for processing one MT of stock. As several chemicals, including dyes and auxiliaries as well as significant quantities of salt are used in the different stages of textile processing, the wastewater released is very polluted and strict norms for achieving Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) are being put in by the regulatory authorities. With the current practices of using traditional chemical auxiliaries it is not possible to achieve ZLD in a cost effective manner. The functioning (or rather non-functioning) of the many common effluent treatment plants are a testimony to the reality of this situation. This is where non-chemical options can help in a big way.The need of the hour is the use of organic chemicals that are non-toxic and completely bio-degradable. Natural products have the upper hand of being eco-friendly as well as pocket friendly. While enzymes as an alternative have been in the market for very long, they have not made mark due to the inherent challenges of narrow pH and temperature required for their optimal performance. The textile chemical market in India is beginning to embrace the idea of alternative methods such as bio-degradable biochemical alternatives that are less hazardous to the environment.Using such organic chemicals also reduces the cost of processing in the textile industry as textile auxiliaries are not cheap and make up 3-4% of the total manufacturing cost. Dyes are expensive and the cost of dyeing a fabric with vat dyes is more than reactive dyes. Indian manufacturers are choosing green solutions and investing in R&D units to produce non-toxic textile chemicals. Textile Chemical producers have also realised the importance of biodegradable alternatives and have begun to invest in the development of bio-auxiliaries and use of probiotics to produce alternative materials.Probiotics, which hitherto has been linked only to human and animal health applications, is also now recognised as a path breaking technology for the production safe, non-toxic and bio-degradable formulations for multiple industrial applications including textile processing. While the current global market potential for probiotics is estimated to be around $55 billion, this refers to only the traditional applications in human and animal health. As the awareness for preventive health care increases across the globe, this market is also expected to post a healthy growth rate!Probiotics Technology for industrial application, referred in this article, utilises naturally occurring, beneficial microbes to manufacture non-toxic and bio-degradable formulations which replace chemical surfactants as well as sequestering agents. This is similar to the category often referred to as fermentation chemicals. A report published in 2014 says that the industrial application of biotechnology, such as fermentation chemicals, will not only broaden the range of raw materials used as the principal input for chemical production but also generate products and materials with new properties and applications. This report also clearly demonstrates that the ecological footprint of such chemicals is lower than that of fossil fuel based alternatives which are predominantly in use now.Many textile processors have begun to use and benefit from probiotic technology based products. Products available in the market now, exhibit features such as full bio-degradability, ability to perform under wide pH and temperature conditions and relatively long shelf life compared to enzymes. They deliver results as good as, or in many situations, better than the chemical auxiliaries currently being used by the textile processing industry. Apart from the fact that these products show measurable reduction in the pollution parameters in the effluent stream, they are also resulting in less water consumption, lesser process time and hence reduced energy consumption.Cleaner production is a smart and viable method to combat the environmental complications related to industrial production and bad material productivity. Green technology implementation in textile sector has proved effective, there has been remarkable cost saving and innovation of alternative interventions. Many case studies show that the organisations that invested in Zero Liquid Discharge before it was made mandatory were the ones who have reaped significant benefits compared to those who did not do that. Do we need more evidence that cleaner production practices result in improvement of the quality of products and reduction in the cost of production? Sustainable business practices are not only good for the world at large, but it also makes sound business sense.Additionally, cleaner production also helps in improving the industrys public image by underlining the measures it has taken to safeguard the environment. Is it possible that the Noyyal River will regain its glory and usefulness to the farmers in the region in the next decade or so?(The author is CEO of Proklean Technologies)"

It has also invited some criticism, not for its merit but for its selectiveness and limited utility. The food items which will attract the tax are mainly burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, doughnuts, pasta and like which are sold by multinational outlets and branded restaurants. The tax impost is quite high at 14.5% and it will substantially push up the prices of these food items. The state intends to earn Rs 10 crore from the tax but the aim is not just the revenue. The government expects that the high price will disincentivise the consumption of fat-heavy food, especially by students and youngsters. The popularity of what is called junk food has increased in the state, as elsewhere in the country, in recent years. It has penetrated even to the villages.It is for the first time that a state in the country has imposed such a tax and so it has attracted attention and debate. There may be a view that it curbs theright to eat and is restrictive of the eating habits of people. But the proposal has a social value and may be compared with the attempts made by governmentsto reduce the consumption of alcohol and tobacco through the imposition of high taxes. There is also the question why only some food items are targeted. Sugar-high colas are not good for health. There are also other food items like ghee rice which have high fat content and fried items like vada which are not good. It is difficult to bring all such food within the ambit of a special and deterrent tax net as most them are produced and sold in the unorganised sector. But efforts to disincentivise their consumption are needed.The love of junk food is increasing with the spread of fast food culture. This is because of lifestyle shifts and social and economic changes. The increasing incidence of obesity and diseases like diabetes is partly attributed to the changing food habits. Kerala has a high obesity incidence rate. Students and youngsters are especially attracted to junk food. They are also the sections who should be actively weaned away from the consumption of such food. But there are doubts whether high prices are good enough disincentives. Many countries have tried the high taxation method to discourage consumption of unhealthy food but the results have been mixed. Creation of public awareness about the need to eat healthy food is the best method."
591f62b47be9e025a5d4dbcc,India set to go  on organic diet,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521019/india-set-go-organic-diet.html,2016-01-03,"Mamta Bhardwaj Jan 04, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTOne of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of cultivable land under organic certification, India has an organic food market estimated at around Rs 1,000 crore. According to a study prepared by industry body Assocham and TechSci Research, the Indian organic food market is growing at a strong 25-30 per cent rate, and is set to touch the $1.36 billion-mark by 2020.The study did, however, place constraints in terms of awareness. The level of awareness about organic food products in India is extremely low and is limited to consumers in metro cities, it said. While more growth is expected in future, as the government increases support, leaders in the industry spoke to Deccan Herald about its charecteristic features.Around 15 years back, people werent very particular about what they were eating. Even when we started in 2007, the first few years saw a lot of struggle. However, now, that is seen to be changing. Over the past two years, we have seen good traction, mostly for having been there. Also, consumer interest has improved now, with mounting interest in health, wellness and fitness in India, said N Balasubramanian, Chief Executive Officer, 24 Mantra Organic. 24 Mantra Organic is a leading organic food brand based out of Hyderabad. The company claims a 60 per cent share of the organic market (which does not include tea) in India, and is followed by brands like Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Overall, organic food consumption in India is at 0.25 per cent and is set to touch two per cent by 2020, said Shailesh Mehta, CEO and Co-Founder of JoyByNature.com, quoting Dr Lorenzo Boni, project manager assistant of Bioagri Coop, an Italy-based non-profit organisation that contributes actively to the promotion and development of organic farming and sustainable development.JoyByNature.com is an online natural and organic products store housing authentic and certified organic, ayurvedic and natural products. Mehta notes that Indians have a natural tendency towards natural, herbal and organic, given that the price differential is not high. With a rich history of nature-based cures and therapies in India, awareness is there. The bigger issue is that of availability and affordability, Mehta said.Foody awarenessVipul Mittal, National Category Head, Fruits and Vegetables at Supermarket Grocery Supplies, which owns and manages BigBasket.com, concurs, saying, Over time, there has been a surge in customer awareness, and we have seen an informed shift towards some organic products.From a company perspective, Mittal said, In the market for categories like kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, which are like raw materials for cooking, branding never really caught up. Organic provides that much needed differentiation to create a niche.Indian food basics potato, onion and tomato, within the fruits and vegetables category, and rice and wheat flour, within the kitchen staples category have been found to be the most popular products across the industry. It only goes to say that consumers making the shift to organic are in it for the long haul.The reverberating move towards wellness across the healthcare and fitness domains, has improved peoples understanding of the food mechanism in recent years, with food trends like organic food, veganism, fruitarianism, among others, catching up. Moreover, large sections of the educated urban masses have begun to see that the amount of money involved in medical expenditure is significantly higher than active healthcare. While organic food is one of the prominent aids for transforming towards a healthy life, it comes at a price.Cost of honesty bears downFor organic farming, firstly it takes three to four years for the soil to transform and get organic certification, second, the yield remains relatively low due to the lack of yield-boosting supplements in fertiilisers and hybrid seeds, said Balasubramanian, about how it is just the cost of honesty that puts pressure on the cost of production and therefore, prices. Premium pricing margins in the organic foods segment can range from as low as 10 per cent and may go up to 35-40 per cent. The monthly food supplies basket for a family of four costs about Rs 4,000. If the family switches to organic wholly, the price may go up by Rs 1,200-1,400, he said.Globally, 5-7 per cent of the consumer base is believed to have gone fully organic, he adds. Affordability plays a bigger role for those consumers, who Mittal categorises as fence-sitters. These fence-sitters understand some bit about organic, but continue to be concerned about the price. If the pressure from prices can be mitigated, this lot can be converted. Amongst kitchen basics, the premium is found to be lowest for wheat flour, where it is less than 20 per cent. It is higher for pulses, honey and groundnuts, among others, and can range anywhere between 35-40 per cent.At any time competing with non-organic will be difficult, he said, adding, When people realise the benefits of organics, the price doesnt pinch so much. At 24 Mantra Organic, being market leaders, we ensure that premiums are at a minimum, because we want to help people make the switch.Additionally, the segment is harrowed by inconsistency in supply, especially for perishables. Here, Mittal calls for instituitional intervention. Testing and standardisation for organic products is absent. There are process-based and field-based certifications, but no certification for the end product. This becomes a bigger problem for perishables, he said. Price premiums range from 30 per cent to even 300 per cent. By this standard, a shift in consumer behaviour may be far-fetched. Only when accessibility and affordability are resolved, can the larger portion of the consumer base, which does not understand organic, be approached, said Mittal.Organic shines onlineMarket research firm 6Wresearch in its study has said that the online grocery market is set to grow at a CAGR of 62 per cent between 2016-2022. It further placed Bengaluru as the key market for online grocery, followed by Mumbai and Delhi. The important thing to note here is that for non-organic products, online is just another channel of distribution; whereas for organic, eCommerce is more about market creation and customer acquisition, said Mehta.With dedicated organic grocery portals, including Farm2Kitchen, MyGreenKart, GreenNGood, Down2Earth and GrocBay, vying for a share in the organic food market, the bigger online grocers are not far behind. Some 45 per cent of BigBaskets product portfolio is consumed by kitchen staples and fruits and vegetables, and of this, 20 per cent is from the organic range. Organic products contribute up to 10 per cent of the total sales on the website, led by brand like 24 Mantra, Pro Nature and Organic Tattva.Balasubramaniam finds that across brick and mortar, and online stores, at least five per cent of the consumers are buying something organic. If in the next five years, we are able to achieve even a five per cent penetration at a household level, we could be looking at a Rs 30-crore market in India, he said. Ultimately, it is about making organic the first choice of everything, he said."

Chandigarh and Karnataka not only figure among the states and Union Territories with the highest prevalence of pre-diabetes but Punjab and Karnataka also have the highest prevalence of hypertension, abdominal obesity and dyslipidemia, which increase a persons vulnerability to diabetes. This is reason for serious concern. Diabetes can kill if not controlled. What compounds this diseases deadliness is that it makes a patient vulnerable to blindness, kidney problems, cardio-vascular ailments, neurological problems and amputations. Worryingly, diabetes is a silent killer. It develops slowly and insidiously. However, advances in diagnosis and treatment provide hope. Besides, the disease does not develop overnight or emerge out of the blue. There are symptoms that people can watch out for and preventive steps taken to keep diabetes at bay.Diabetes is the fourth leading cause of death by disease worldwide and one person dies from diabetes-related causes every 10 seconds. Screening for it and timely medical intervention can save lives and protect patients and families from the costs it entails. Studies show that the average patient uses up around 70% of his savings for treatment of diabetes. India must take diabetes, hypertension and obesity more seriously. It has the largest number of diabetics and pre-diabetics and the average age of adult onset diabetes is falling. While the diabetes rate rose by 45% globally, it shot up by 123% in India in the 1990-2013 period.We do not have to wait for diabetes to develop to fight it. The ICMR study provides useful pointers. Several of the states whose populations are at greatest risk of developing diabetes are prosperous. It is evident that lifestyles that come with prosperity  people are eating too much junk food, are highly stressed and walking less  are making people obese and ideal candidates for diabetes and hypertension. A few corrective steps to adopt less sedentary lifestyles and more healthy diets can go a long way in preventing diabetes. Traditional food habits of people in Karnataka, which include consumption of ragi and coarse cereals, are known to be healthier than eating rice or processed foods. The latter have grown in popularity in our cities. Efforts must be made to spread public awareness of not only symptoms and complications of diabetes, obesity, etc but also of healthy food options and lifestyles that can prevent them."
591f883c7be9e025a5d4f583,Change cropping pattern,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/570211/change-cropping-pattern.html,2016-09-13,"Change cropping patternBy R G Subramanyam, Sep 14, 2016, DHNS: 21:47 ISTEvery third or the fourth year, river Cauvery, the lifeline of both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, embitters the harmonious relationship existing between the two southern states. The Cauvery river dispute is more than a century old but a lasting solution is eluding.Out of the riparian states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and the Union Territory of Puducherry, the first two are major players. When the river supplies are copious, there is obviously no dispute. It is only when the river supplies are low that the two states literally go to war. One can examine some basic facts about the river, its water potential, the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunals (CWDT) award and measures that could be taken to minimise or mitigate the distress in the bad years.General: About 42% of the Cauvery basin area lies in Karnataka, 54% in TN and the rest 4% in Kerala and Puducherry. In a normal year, the contribution of Karnataka and TN to the river system is 53% and 30%, respectively. In an average year, the total flow in the river is 730 TMCft (Thousand Million Cubic Feet).The CWDT allocated in 2007 a quantity of 270 TMCft (37%) to Karnataka, 419 TMcft (54%) to TN and the remaining 66 TMCft (9%) to Kerala and Puducherry.Karnataka felt aggrieved that though its contribution to the river flows was much higher than that of TN, its allocation was less than what it should get. The Tribunal also stipulated that Karnataka should release annually 192 TMCft to TN as per the monthly schedule drawn by it. It did not spell out clearly what should be the quantum of releases in bad years. There exist four major dams in Karnataka Krishna Raja Sagar, Kabini, Harangi and Hemavathi - with an aggregate gross storage capacity of 114.37 TMCft. Tamil Nadu has three big dams - Mettur, Bhavanisagar and Periyar - with an aggregate storage capacity of 136.54 TMCft.Demand: The reservoirs on the Cauvery river and its tributaries are designed to meet the irrigation needs of all the four states, generate some hydro power and meet the drinking water requirements of Bengaluru, Mysuru and many other smaller towns and villages. The farmers in TN and Karnataka grow principally rice and sugar cane. These are water-intensive crops. The area between Mandya and Srirangapatna is a sugar belt. Lush green paddy fields on either side of the National Highway between Bengaluru and Mysuru greet the visitor. Tamil Nadu raises three rice crops in a year.I suggest some measures which, if implemented, would ensure lowering of water demand and also making the riparian states less dependent on the river supplies.(1) Crop Pattern: Both Karnataka and TN at present grow water-guzzling crops like sugar cane and rice. Sugar cane is a perennial crop, which requires 3,000 mm of water all through the year. Rice requires 1,200-1,500 mm of water. In drier years, it becomes extremely difficult to meet the huge demand of both the states. The solution that suggests itself is to curtail the demand by way of replacing high water-intensive crops by light crops. Millets, oilseeds, pulses, ragi etc should replace sugar cane and rice cultivation. Unfortunately, India has still not developed a reliable weather forecasting system.If there were such a reliable system, the farmers would have a choice at the beginning of the sowing season itself to sow the particular type of crop depending upon the supply position. Till such time a reliable forecasting system is developed, it would be a gamble to grow water-intensive crops. The farmers should be educated about the wisdom in going in for light crops. The field workers of the agricultural department should do this. The TN government should dissuade its farmers from raising more than one rice crop.(2) Water-saving measures: Many farmers are under the mistaken impression that more is better. Application of more water affects the yield, spoils health of the soil and also results in wastage of precious water. Water should be applied by drip/sprinkler irrigation. Irrigation water should be charged on volumetric basis. The water conveyance system, right up to the field level, should be lined to minimise transmission losses.(3) Conjunctive use: The subsoil water levels in irrigated areas are always high. Bore/dug wells should be provided in the irrigated areas so that underground water supplements the canal supplies. This would lessen dependence on irrigation water, help prevent water logging and the consequent deterioration in the health of the soil.(4) Drinking Water issues: Bengaluru, Mysuru and other small towns, having a total population of 13 million, depend on Cauvery water. The requirement in a full year is as much as 23 TMCft. There is what is called water illiteracy among the users. A campaign should be launched to educate the users to conserve water. A good amount of water is lost due to the leakages in the distribution system. The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board as also other municipalities should plug the leakages and replace the old and rusted pipelines.Unauthorised pipe connections should be detected and penal action taken against the offenders. Rain water harvesting (RWH) should be made mandatory so that precious rainwater is not allowed to flow to the gutters. Determined efforts should be made to raise the depleting water table levels by recharging with RWH. Installation of sewage water treatment plants should be made mandatory. A number of lakes have vanished in the city, thanks to the real estate lobby. These lakes should be revived which will help ease the water problem to some extent.A national policy to deal with inter-state river disputes should be drawn. The Centre should lay down broad principles for sharing water amongst the riparian states in years of distress.(The writer is former Chief Engineer, and Irrigation and Command Area Development Commissioner, Govt of Gujarat)"
591f8a297be9e025a5d4f6e7,How is Telangana doing?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/531640/how-telangana-doing.html,2016-02-28,"Ajay Gudavarthy, February 29, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 0:37 ISTABOUT 2 YEARS AFTER BIRTH : The most visible change has been in the situation regard-ing power supply but water remains a major problem in much of thIn a few months time, Telangana will be two years old. The state was formed after a prolonged agitation and popular protest, largely as a fall out of deep agrarian crisis, growing unemployment and cultural denigration. Though the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) won a whopping 99 seats in the recent Municipal elections, we need to ask as to how Telangana is doing now.The most visible change has been in the situation regarding power supply. Power supply that was not only irregular but also contributed to agrarian crisis has improved dramatically. Today, all villages get uninterrupted power supply to the households and for six hours for the agricultural purposes, which the new government has promised to increase to nine in the next few months.The government, immediately after assuming power, announced loan waiver up to Rs 1 lakh per family. However, this was waived in installments of 25% every six months.According to the farmers, this has not really helped them to get rid of the loans and instead, they continue to reel under debts as most of the waiver is being used to pay the interests and the principle amount is being repaid only partially in small amounts. Further, they pointed out that there is no policy for providing support price or subsidies on in-puts such as fertilisers and no compensation being provided for crop failure.Water continues to be a major problem in much of Telangana. Most of the projects are either contested in water tribunal or many of the pending ones have not been cleared or completed. The government has instead taken up the project called Mission Kakatiya under which old lakes, ponds and other water bodies that had dried up are re-dug, hoping that a good monsoon will fill them up.In a few districts, free borewells are being supplied but the ground water level is too low (in most cases bores go as deep as 800 metre to strike water). Similarly, under Mission Bhagiratha, the TRS government has promised to tap water for every household.Labour and wages remain the other major problems in the agrarian sector. While wages have not risen for the landless after the formation of Telangana, farmers holding land continue to complain about the lack of the availability of labour making agriculture untenable.Many of the farmers now demand that the labour under the rural job scheme (MNREGA) needs to be shifted for agricultural purposes instead of other developmental activities, which they believe in any case, are not of much use.The policy of Re 1 a kg rice scheme with 6 kg of rice per person is a very effective scheme providing great relief to the BPL families. Along with the rice scheme, the governments pension scheme is also popular in the rural hinterlands of Telangana. The new government has increased the pension amount from Rs 200 to Rs 1,000. In the last one year, after the formation of Telangana, close to 900 farmers have committed suicides, next only to Maharashtra where 2,568 farmers committed suicide.Agrarian crisisThe agrarian crisis was the single most important reason why the demand for Telangana erupted. Questions need to be raised if it continues to be of priority for the new government. While it has disbursed a range of welfare oriented policies (much of which are a continuation of the policies formulated by the previous Y S Rajasekhara Reddys government) the agrarian crisis is yet to be averted and it needs some pressing and fast paced steps from the government to stop further suicides.Similarly, alongside the farmers are the Muslims, the other social group that remains marginalised in Telangana. Under the YSR government, Muslims were awarded 4% reservation as part of the OBC reservations. The TRS government has promised to enhance it to 12%.The Subramanium Committee, instituted in 2007, had identified 28 groups out of which 14 groups were made ineligible for reservation due to their superior social status, including sects such as Sheiks, Sayeeds, Pathans etc.These, in a sense, are perhaps the few communities that can afford higher education but having been denied the provision of reservation, we find almost 80% drop outs among Muslims. There is an impending need to provide educational loans and build social welfare hostels, which contributed in a big way towards improving literacy among the SC/STs.The most popular policy that has struck a chord among the Muslims is Shaadi Mubarak where the government offers Rs 50,000 to perform the marriage of girls from the economically weaker sections (the Hindu counterpart Kalyana Laxmi, with similar grant).Most of the Muslims continue to be self-employed and without land holding in the rural hinterlands of Telangana. They continue to live under conditions of social segregation, fear and many a time implicated in false cases of crime. Culturally, Telangana had a strong Sufi tradition and even today, besides Muslims, a large number of Hindus visit dargas. Perhaps, political parties such as the MIM are not the best representatives of this tradition. It is a literal everyday tussle between the social and political worlds.It is in this context that one can read the recent Chandi Yaga that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao performed at a whopping cost of Rs 7 crore. In order to balance his pro-Muslim policies, he has also appointed a Muslim as the deputy CM. It is also a move to capture the space that the BJP-RSS combine has been laboriously building with manufactured issues of Charminar being built over the destruction of a temple and recalling the memory of Nizams rule and role of Razakars in wantonly using physical force against the Hindus.(The writer is with the Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

591f8c3f7be9e025a5d4f872,Agriculture takes back seat,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/566925/agriculture-takes-back-seat.html,2016-08-25,"Devinder Sharma, August 26, 2016 23:17 ISTECONOMIC REFORMS : Providing rightful income to farmers is what will push domestic demand and revitalise rural economy at the same time.Come to think of it, in the past 25 years, ever since economic reforms were unleashed, the average monthly basic income of a government peon has gone up from Rs 7,500 to Rs 18,000, and of the cabinet secretary from Rs 30,000 to Rs 2,50,000. Although the wage hike of government employees has nothing to do with economic liberalisation, still I find the rise in their salaries is shown as a bright outcome of the reforms process.Now, compare this with the income a farmer gets out of agriculture. Economic Survey 2016 tells us that the average income a farmer gets from farming activities, including what he keeps for his family consumption at home, in 17 states of India is Rs 20,000 a year. In other words, the monthly income of a farmer in these states is a paltry Rs 1,666. On a national level, the NSSO works out the average monthly income that a farmer derives from farming operations to be just Rs 3,000 per family.The deplorable condition of farmers is certainly an outcome of economic reforms. Simply put, economic liberalisation or economic reforms or market economy whatever you prefer to term it as, has bypassed the majority population. Agriculture, like other unorganised sectors, has been the biggest casualty.It was in July 1991 when Manmohan Singh delivered the historic budget speech as finance minister that opened up the country to economic liberalisation. I recall the speech wherein he unshackled the industry from the control regime and showered all bounties on industries and in the very next paragraph acknowledged that agriculture remains the mainstay of the economy.But since agriculture is a state subject, he left it to the state governments to provide the much needed impetus to farming. But what he forgot to say was that industry too was a state subject and should have been left to the state governments. The bias therefore was clearly visible.This was simply not an unintended fallout of the process of economic liberalisation. It was actually part of a design. Later, in 1996, the World Bank directed India to move 400 million people out of rural areas to the urban areas in the next 20 years, saying that land is a precious asset in the hands of people who are inefficient producers, meaning farmers.Since the younger generations among farmers do not know anything except farming, World Bank suggested that India set up a network of training institutes to train these people to become industrial workers. This should be accompanied by land rentals and land acquisitions.Going by the World Bank prescription, successive governments have been blindly playing to the tune. As prime minister, Manmohan Singh had time and again said that 70% farmers in India were surplus and need to shift to urban areas. RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan is on record saying that big ticket reforms will happen when India moves a large share of the farming population to the cities. And more recently, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has blamed agriculture for not being able to provide subsistence to a large section of the population thereby increasing inequality.What he forgot to say was that successive governments had deliberately starved agriculture of financial resources and had kept the farming population impoverished. This is evident from the way agriculture remains a low priority area when it comes to budgetary allocations. In the 11th Plan, agriculture received only Rs 1 lakh crore as budget outlay for the five years. In the 12th plan period, agriculture got Rs 1.5 lakh crore.Incidentally, the budgetary support for agriculture, which employs 52% of the population, is less than the annual provisions being made for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA). In addition, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for wheat and rice had remained almost frozen, with annual increase in farm prices not exceeding 4% on an average. No wonder, 48% farmers want to quit agriculture if given an alternative.Higher labour wagesIn fact, the plight of agriculture is not only deliberate but has for all practical purposes, sustained the economic reforms. If the farmers were paid their economic due by way of, lets say, a higher MSP, the industrial and business sector would have gone for a toss because of the additional costs involved for paying higher labour wages that incorporates resulting high food prices.At the same, a higher price for farm produce would have raised the cost of production of many industries. In addition, a high paying agriculture would have also reduced the rate of migration and thereby reduced the availability of cheaper labour for infrastructure and real estate.The real cost of economic reforms therefore is being borne by rural India, of which farmers constitute the majority. The first-ever Socio Economic Census has clearly brought out the stark reality. Indias performance when measured as per the Human Development Index too shows the burgeoning inequality. India ranks 130 among a ranking of 188 countries. The economic reform that we talk about therefore has largely been pro-rich. The rich 1% own 51% of countrys wealth.Keeping agriculture impoverished all these years has sustained economic reforms. The big bang reform India needs is essentially in agriculture. Providing the rightful income into the hands of farmers is what will push domestic demand and at the same time revitalise rural economy. If the Seventh Pay Commission is being seen as an economic booster, as it is expected to create more demand for consumer goods, imagine the kind of shot in the arm a higher income in agriculture will give to the Indian economy."
591f8c547be9e025a5d4f882,Policy interventions hold key,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532520/policy-interventions-hold-key.html,2016-03-03,"Policy interventions hold keyBy Prasenjit Chowdhury, Mar 04, 2016, DHNS: 0:03 ISTIf the farmers get the benefit of Minimum Support Price (MSP) as envisaged, it might prevent many farmers' suicides.On the face of it, Prime Minister Narendra Modi put his mind where his mouth is. The higher allocation for the rural sector and farming suggests that he considers rural recovery as key to overall GDP growth. Some time ago, he spoke of the need to make agriculture employment-oriented and how it, along with manufacturing and service sectors, forms backbone of the countrys economy.The Union Budget 2016-17 introduced a 0.05% Krishi Vikas Cess on all services to fund its ambitious programme of rural welfare besides keeping aside outlays for setting up Self-Help Groups (SHGs) for rural development and for the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) to boost pulses production.Not to miss the thrust on rural road connectivity in the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and the marquee crop insurance scheme, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), launched in 2015-16 with a generous allocation (Rs 19,000 crore and Rs 5,500 crore respectively). If the farmers get the benefit of Minimum Support Price (MSP) as envisaged, it might prevent many farmers suicides.Talking about farmers suicides, the enormity of which long demanded public policy interventions, it is important to recount that more than a quarter of a million Indian farmers have committed suicide in the last 16 years  the largest wave of recorded suicides in human history. A great number of those affected are cash crop farmers, and cotton farmers in particular.In 2009 alone, 17,638 farmers committed suicide  thats one farmer every 30 minutes. Going by the official data, on average nearly 16,000 farmers committed suicide every year over the last decade or so. Every seventh suicide in the country had been a farm suicide.According to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), as many as 5,650 farmers committed suicide in India in 2014, among which five states  Maharashtra, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka  accounted for about 90% of the total farmer suicides. As per NCRB data, bankruptcy or indebtedness was the main cause, accounting for 20.6%, closely followed by family issues (20.1%), failure of crops (16.8%), illness (13.2%), while drug abuses/alcoholic addiction accounted for 4.9% cases. These five causes together accounted for 75.6% of total farmer suicides.In Maharashtra, that tops the list of states in the country in terms of the number of farmers suicide, it has been seen that frequent droughts, crop failure, non-realisation of prices for agricultural products are some of the reasons pushing farmers to take the extreme step.But what is the bigger picture? Farm-policy analysts point out how desperation arising out of a fundamental unsustainability is pushing people out of the countryside far faster than industry can create jobs for them in cities and towns. It is exacerbated by the decree that the government can force farmers to sell their land for infrastructure projects without seeking their consent.Address agrarian distressProminent environmental activists like Vandana Shiva are of the opinion that genetically-modified seeds  specifically, suicide seeds sold by the agricultural behemoth Monsanto  are driving farmers to lose control of their age-old farming practices as its proprietary policies forbid farmers from planting, selling, or even accidentally growing seeds from its patented crops thus pushing them to an edge.The perceived consensus has been in favour of the need to design interventions that can address distress among various demographic groups, and not aggravate the problem by focusing on indebtedness alone. And such interventions not merely mean offering special packages but a pre-emptive long-term policy. For instance, poor health has been found to lead to more than seven times as many suicides as compared to debt or bankruptcy.So health reform, particularly in rural areas, is a worthier interventionist goal to achieve.Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, posing himself as an agrarian activist, had been too nebulous to point out to the shortcomings of crop insurance and the imperfect rollout of bank accounts needed to receive compensation payments. He chose rather to make a fetish of his pro-farmer identity, regardless of the growing uncertainties of farming as a vocation in India.It has been pointed ad nauseam that while nearly half of Indias population works in agriculture, they produce only 14 to 18% of GDP, compared to, say, the United States, where farmers constitute around 1 to 2% of the workforce and represent an approximately equal share of GDP. The 65% of farm households owning less than one hectare of land are usually seen to spiral into debt, only to be buoyed by periodic waivers of farm loans.Addressing economic causes leading to erosion in farm income, exposed to both production and market risks, is liable to procedural error when institutions such as Agricultural Insurance Company undertake crop damage estimates at block or sub-block levels and not at the individual farm level. Any solid mechanism for market risk evaluation is not in place. The low penetration of crop insurance (not more than 25% of farmers) and the difficulty of claiming farmer insurance and settlement might not make it a panacea.Going by the nature of objections over the 2015 land bill brought in by the NDA government, the tendency to bypass the consent and social-assessment requirements of the 2013 law on the grounds that they are onerous and time-consuming is visible. On the flip side, the rich farmer with his access to free/ subsidised water and electricity, to free fertiliser and benefits from minimum support price that the government offers on the purchase of rice and wheat must be brought under the tax net.The Economic Survey points out that the implicit subsidy on electricity is Rs 37,170 crore. The farmers committing suicide are martyrs to the final, lumbering churn of India in its transition from agrarianism to industrialism. We must keep a close watch if policy interventions can really buck this trend."

However, the day-to-day management of this institution should be left to a board of directors to ensure independence in functioning.The new institution would be the designated agency of the Central government for pulses management, the committee suggested.It said the institution would help stabilise prices by making effective time-to-time market interventions in domestic as well as international markets, and also maintain a satisfactory level of operational and buffer stock of agricultural commodities.This year, the government tasked the Food Corporation of India, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium with the procurement of pulses at farmgates at the minimum support price in case of depressed prices in anticipation of a bumper harvest.However, for the future, there is need to shore up the institutional arrangements, including the creation of additional institutions with a variety of governance structures for pulses, the report prepared by Subramanian said. He presented the report to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday.Noting that pulses deteriorate faster than cereals like rice and wheat, Subramanian made a strong pitch for efficient management policies for effective stocking, warehousing, processing and disposal of pulses.Efficient stock disposal under clear protocols need to be spelt out, he said.To make the arrangement commercially viable, Subramanian recommended authorising the new institution to branch out gradually into trading other agricultural crops, including fruits and vegetables."

She also promised free mobile phones for all ration card holders this time.However, her handling of flood situation came in for criticism with DMK alleging that ""Jayalalithaa did not even meet the flood victims and console them"" and raking up issues like alleged ""insistence of AIADMK partymen to paste her sticker in relief materials.""But Jayalalithaa, who returned as chief minister a year ago after acquittal in disproportionate assets case, emerged unscathed again with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, which had won 37 of the 39 Lok Sabha seats in the state in 2014, continuing to hold sway in the Assembly election.Her victory is extraordinary given the political history of Tamil Nadu that bets often on the ""Dravidian"" theory, and regales in anti-Brahmin rhetoric.Known for her bold decision making, she famously remarked after assuming office as Chief Minister for the second time that ""I am a ringmaster"" making things work by motivating government officials.A teen starlet who made her cinema debut in CV Sridhar-directed 'Vennira Aadai' (white dress) in 1956, Jayalalithaa became a popular actress and did 30 films alone with matinee idol MGR who later became her political mentor and in 1982 inducted her into AIADMK which he founded.She worked her way up in the party though factional leaders targeted her. She was appointed propaganda secretary in 1983.In the mid 1980's, then Hindu Religious Endowments Minister RM Veerappan and Agriculture Minister K Kalimuthu were at the forefront of opposing her within the party and they did not take it lightly when she was reappointed propaganda secretary by MGR.Kalimuthu even infamously alleged once that Jayalalithaa was conspiring to end 'Dravidian rule' in Tamil Nadu.MGR later got her elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1984 and she managed to win the support of many party functionaries.She went on to lead a faction that stood by her after the AIADMK split following MGR's death in 1987. The other faction was led by VN Janaki, wife of MGR.She successfully contested the Tamil Nadu Assembly election in 1989 from Bodinayakkanur and became the first woman leader of opposition in the House and under her leadership the AIADMK group won 27 seats with Janaki group managing to win only two.When the party later united in 1989 she became the general secretary of the unified AIADMK, the top party post which she continues to hold to this day and is known for her deft handling of party affairs.As Leader of the Opposition, she decided not to go the House following the infamous episode in the House on March 25, 1989 when her saree was pulled and DMK president and then Chief Minister Karunanidhi's spectacle was broken in a clash between the AIADMK and DMK members.Jayalalithaa vowed to return to the Tamil Nadu Assembly only as the Chief Minister in 1989 though many were convinced that she could achieve it.She went on to become Chief Minister not for once but for five times (1991-96, May-Sept 2001, 2002-06, 2011-14, 2015-16).In 1991, she stitched up an alliance with Congress and a sympathy wave spurred by the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi landed her party a landslide victory, with Jayalalithaa making her debut as Chief Minister. She was elected from Bargur constituency.Ironically, her first tenure (1991-96) continues to haunt her even today as it was marked by several corruption allegations like the TANSI case and even the disproportionate assets case pending now in the Supreme Court has its origins to this period.There were allegations that her aide Sasikala's family was calling the shots in all aspects of government and the extravagant wedding of her later disowned foster son VN Sudhakaran in 1995 became a sort of an indelible imprint against her on the alleged failure and insensitivity of her first regime.Riding on anti-incumbency, she, however, came back to power in 2001 with her party winning 132 seats. But her appointment as CM was quashed by the Supreme Court vis-a-vis the TANSI case and she was unseated though she eventually made a comeback as CM in 2002 after getting elected from Andipatti.Though her party lost polls in 2006, AIADMK emerged victorious in 61 seats that year and became a powerful opposition party.DMK had won 96 seats and with the support of allies like Congress (which had won 34 seats) the Karunanidhi-led party managed to sail through. Often she taunted the DMK regime as a ""minority government"" throughout its five year tenure (2006-11).In 2011 Assembly election, issues like the 2G Spectrum Scam, and the 2009 killings of Tamils in the Sri Lankan civil war helped her to trounce the DMK and make a dramatic comeback to power.During 2011-16, she was careful to implement a multitude of welfare schemes and big ticket projects like the drinking water schemes for Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Vellore Districts.Jayalalithaa did her studies at the Bishop Cotton Girls' High School in Bangalore and later at the Presentation Convent Church Park here.Though she got a scholarship from the Central government for higher studies after completing her matriculation in 1964, she opted for a career in the film world.She went on to act in South Indian language movies including Tamil. She is well-versed in several Indian languages including Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi besides English."

(Credits: Jaipal Singh) Sewage water coming from Kansal village area flows towards Chandigarh on Tuesday. (Credits: Jaipal Singh)The sewage flowing from Kansal village is causing damage to flora and fauna of Sukhna Lake reserve forest and polluting the lake as well, reveals a report prepared by the UT forest and wildlife department.The Sukhna Lake reserve forest spread over an area of 153.90 hectare (Ha) starting from Punjab and Haryana High Court ends toward Kishangarh-Saketri road near Regulator End of Sukhna Lake.Sewerage water discharged from Kansal village passes through the lake forest area and some portion of the forest adjoining Rock Garden and Smriti Upvana remain submerged in water throughout the year. This has led to drying up of several valuable tree species in the forest area. The sewage water is also damaging habitat of sambar and other scheduled animal species found in the lake reserve forest. The reports points out that it has been noticed that a herd of sambars residing near Rock Garden are suffering from skin problems caused due to sewerage water.The sewerage water also enters the Sukhna Lake, which is a habitat for various resident and migratory birds, during monsoon season. It has led to growth of weeds in the lake. The sewerage water has also led to accumulation of harmful waste materials like plastic bags inside the forest area, posing a threat to regional flora and fauna.Pleas fall on Punjab govts deaf ears: In the past, the Punjab and Haryana High Court on a number of occasions directed the Punjab government to stop the flow of sewerage water to save Sukhna Lake. The Chandigarh Administration also wrote to the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) and Principal Secretary, Local Self Government, Punjab, to stop the flow of sewerage water into the lake forest area, but no concrete steps have been taken so far.Karan Singh, range forest officer, said that they had taken up the matter with the Punjab government on several occasions, but in vain. The matter is also pending with the National Green Tribunal, New Delhi.Sewage water treatment: A survey of the area to find an alternative solution to the problem to save the flora and fauna from untreated waste sewerage water was carried out by the forest department.To stop sewage water from flowing into the Sukhna Lake, the forest department has started bio-treatment of the sewage water by way of oxidation. The sewage water of Kansal is being collected in a large-sized water body and is being treated through natural bio-mechanism wherein the sewage water is passed through long channel having plants like Saccharum munja and rice straw and iron ores which lead to oxidation of the sewer water.Santosh Kumar, chief conservator of forests, said that they had not only stopped sewage water flowing into the Sukhna Lake, but were also treating the water through natural bio-mechanism.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The migratory birds that can be found at the Sukhna Lake include Ruddy Shelducks, White-Eyed Pochards, Common Pochards, Ferruginous Pochards, Tufted Ducks, Greylag Goose, Black Redstart amongst many other.FOR A large number of Chandigarh residents, the morning is incomplete without a walk in the serene environs of Sukhna Lake. The lake is an inseparable part of life in the City Beautiful. A steady stream of visitors continues to pour in during the day to spend time at the man-made water body at the foothills of the Shivaliks. It is one of Chandigarhs principal tourist attractions and its defining feature. Winter brings its own visitors to the lake  a large number of migratory birds flock to the water body, making it their home for a few months before flying away again.But all this could soon be history. The rainfed lake is facing a crisis. The water level has been declining due to heavy silting. Deficient monsoons have added to the problem. Sewage flows into it from nearby villages. Weeds choke the lake at one corner.The problem is not new. Seven years ago, the problem was serious enough for the Punjab and Haryana High Court to take suo motu notice of it in November 2009. There have been over 50 hearings in the case by different benches of the High Court. Over the years, the urgency to do something has grown as both climate change and the rapid growth of Chandigarh, with settlements now touching the lakes borders, have added to Sukhnas problems.On the last date of hearing on August 22, the High Court ordered the Chandigarh Administration to make the lake weed removal a continuous process. It also asked the administration to issue a public notice seeking suggestions from Tricity residents for saving Sukhna.The Punjab government was asked to inform the court if the lake could be connected with water supply pipes or by boring of wells to maintain water level.CREATED IN 1958 by Le Corbusier and then chief engineer P L Verma at a cost of Rs 1 crore, the lake was constructed across Sukhna Choe by damming it along with Kansal and Nepali Choe. The dam was a 12.8 metre high rock-filled earthen structure. Such was Corbusiers attachment to the lake that the ashes of the first Chief Architect of Chandigarh and his cousin Pierre Jeanneret were immersed here in 1970 as per their wishes.But ever since its creation, silting has plagued the lake. From the erosion-prone Shivalik hills, the water that flowed into the Sukhna Choe arrived with silt and sediments.At the time of construction, the storage capacity of the lake was 10.47 million cubic metre (mcm) and water spread area varying between 1.52 sq km and 2.28 sq km. Between 1958 and 1962, the lake lost more than 20 per cent of its capacity on account of heavy silting.In 1971, the Irrigation Department of the Punjab government took up the issue. The Kansal Choe was diverted into Suketri Choe which joined the lake at its eastern end.But this very measure to increase the water in the lake contributed to more silting, with more of it flowing in down the steep slopes of the new channel.The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, conducted a detailed survey of catchment area in 1972 and stated that soil erosion, steep sloping hills and steep bare hills were the main reasons for siltation.Following this, the Chandigarh Administration launched intensive water and soil conservation measures in 2,540 hectare forest catchment of the lake which included effective closure, plantation, and the construction of more than 190 silt-detention earthen dams.By the year 1988 around 2,600 hectares of Sukhna Lake were converted into Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary and another 880 hectares classified as Reserve Forest. The lake has a catchment area of 42.7 square kilometre of which 29.8 square kilometre falls in Chandigarh while the remaining 10.22 square kilometre and 2.77 square kilometre falls in jurisdiction of Haryana and Punjab, respectively.During the 6th Plan (1977-1978 to 1982-1983), the UT Forest Department implemented the Central government- sponsored scheme of soil conservation at a cost of Rs 73.41 lakh.These measures taken over a period of almost three decades reduced the siltation rate of the lake from more than 140 tonnes per year to 5 tonnes per year.Heavy siltation has also led to a fall in the number of fish in the lake. As per a study carried out by Prof M S Johal and Dr Y K Rawal in 2005, there were a total of 33 different species in the lake. However, due to the lake drying up in 2012, the number of species fell drastically. As per current data available with Dr Y K Rawal, there are only 19 species of fish left in the lake.In 1987, the lake bed almost dried up due to a deficient monsoon combined with silting. The administration then started de-silting of the lake bed through mechanised and manual means. City residents flocked to participate in Shramdan to save the citys landmark. This became an annual ritual till it was stopped in 2004.By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased. By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased.By 2002 the lake had lost almost 63 per cent of its original water-holding capacity. The water flow too decreased. In 2002, an average flow of 225 acre-feet water was entering the lake compared to an average flow of 7,370 acre-ft water from 1958 to 1978.Santosh Kumar, chief conservator of forests, said that with sustained measures made over the years, the administration has managed to bring down the rate of siltation. We have taken all the possible steps for saving the lake from silt and weeds. The rate of siltation was brought down with sustained measures which included extensive plantation in the catchment area. As far as water is concerned, it totally depends upon rain, said Kumar.THE CITY has been witnessing below normal rainfall for the last six years. This year, Chandigarh received about 42 per cent less than normal rain  only 286.2mm rain against the normal rainfall of 686.6mm. In 2015, 572.8mm rainfall was received which was 30.9 per cent less while in 2014, 389.2mm rain was recorded that was 53.1 per cent deficit.Low rainfall in the city plays havoc with the lake bed. Islands of silt emerge regularly, showing up the precariously low water levels. A study by the Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment (SPACE) in 2009 on Impacts of Conservation Measures in the Catchment of Sukhna Lake on Ground Water, Soil and Geology pointed out that the Sukhna Lake catchment area was practically floating in water.As per the report, around 48 water bodies in the wildlife sanctuary linked to the silt retention dams are filled with water throughout the year. The report further states that in case of normal rainfall, around 60 hectare metre (hams) water could be released into the Sukhna Lake from these water bodies. During years of low rainfall, the quantity would be around 40 hams.There is also a large low-lying area that receives spills, leakages, seepage from the water bodies located on higher elevations in drainage lines. However, due to an impervious layer, this water is not able to flow into the Sukhna.A mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up.Dr S S Grewal president, Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment. A mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up.Dr S S Grewal president, Society for Promotion and Conservation of Environment.President of SPACE Dr S S Grewal said that a mechanism to release the water into the lake needs to be found. The wildlife sanctuary has enough water to save the lake from drying up, he said.The SPACE team also visited more than 150 silt retention dams, measuring the water available in each, concluding that even as they caught silt, they also prevented enough water from flowing into the lake. The study says that when the lake becomes alarmingly shallow, the water stored in dams can be drained to augment the capacity of the lake.FORMER CHIEF engineer of the Punjab Irrigation Department Dr G S Dhillon says that there is a need for a permanent solution to the problem. Due to the construction of the silt retention dams, there is a reduction in the amount of water that enters the lake. At places like Sukhomajri and Kansal, people have put up obstructions and do not let the water flow to the lake. The right over water is not notified. There is a need for the Centre to intervene and issue a notification that the water should be used only for Sukhna Lake and not be used by people on the way, said Dr Dhillon.He added that there was no water management. There should be an engineer who is given this task. Shallow tubewells should be allowed in the catchment area and a channel be constructed to take the water to the lake. Dr Dhillon added that there was a need for rainwater harvesting in the northern sectors and the water could be diverted to the lake.Just depending on rains is not good enough. The dams at the wildlife sanctuary have reduced intake into the lake. Excess water from there can be drawn into the lake,  said S S Virdi Former UT chief engineer Just depending on rains is not good enough. The dams at the wildlife sanctuary have reduced intake into the lake. Excess water from there can be drawn into the lake,  said S S Virdi Former UT chief engineerSave Sukhna Forum was set up around a decade ago with the aim of maintaining water levels and activity in the lake. President of the forum, former UT chief engineer S S Virdi said that a detailed report was made and submitted to the UT Administration around two years ago. The forum recommended forming an independent body, Sukhna Lake Development Authority.Just depending on rains is not good enough. The dams at the wildlife sanctuary have reduced intake into the lake. Excess water from there can be drawn into the lake. There is enough sub-soil water available. Tubewells can be installed to pump water. Tertiary water can be pumped in, said Virdi.ANOTHER PROBLEM encountered at the lake is that of weeding. There are eight types of weeds that are spread over more than half of the lake. Typha, Hydrocharitaceae and Ceratophyllaceae are the most common type of weeds found in different seasons.According to assistant professor Dr Y K Rawal, from the Department of Zoology, Panjab University, who along with Professor Emeritus Prof M S Johal, conducted a study on the lake said that presence of a large number of weeds in the lake is one of the reasons for depleting water level.On Dr Rawals recommendation, the administration has put a species of fish called Ctenopharyngodon Idella commonly known as Grass Crap for weed control. Ctenopharyngodon Idella consumes a large quantity of weeds. Dr Rawal said that other measures include manual removal of weeds, which is a continuous process.Experts are of the view that rapid siltation and inflow of sewage into the lake from nearby areas are the main reasons for weeds. As per a report prepared by the UT Forest and Wildlife Department, the sewage flowing from Kansal and Saketri village is causing damage to flora and fauna of Sukhna Lake reserve forest and polluting the lake as well.To stop sewage water from flowing into the Sukhna Lake, the forest department has started bio-treatment of the sewage water by way of oxidation. The sewage water of Kansal is being collected in a large-sized water body and is being treated through natural bio-mechanism in which the sewage water is passed through long channel having plants like Saccharum munja and rice straw and iron ores which lead to oxidation of the sewer water.The Punjab and Haryana High Court has directed the Panchkula administration for taking steps to ensure that sewage from Saketri does not enter the lake.The problem of weeding and siltation was also highlighted in a study by the National Institute of Hydrology, Roorkee, conducted in 2013. The experts suggested that the primary objective of desilting should not be to increase the capacity or surface area of the lake. This could cause evaporation which is already high for the lake. The average decline in water level during October 1, 2011, to June 28, 2012, is 5.99 mm/day. Approximately 300 ham of water is lost due to evaporation.Mukesh Anand, UT chief engineer, told Chandigarh Newsline that the engineering wing removes weeds manually throughout the year. Steps have been take to ensure that sewage from Kishangarh and Kansal does not enter the lake, said Anand.DUE TO the intervention of the court, the Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana authorities were in 2012 pressed into action to deploy their labourers and JCB (excavation machine vehicles) so that Kansal nadi (rivulet) was cleaned to ensure natural flow of water into the lake. The court had also ordered the authorities to make every effort to ensure unhindered flow of surface run-off towards the lake guided by natural gradient from Punjab area.The High Court had on May 14, 2012, also put stay on the construction activities in the catchment areas of Sukhna Lake which is still in operation but the construction activities in the catchment area are continuing unabated under the nose of the authorities, especially at Kansal village falling in Mohali district.The court had also asked the Chandigarh Administration to consider the option of pumping in surplus water from UT into Sukhna between December 15 and January 15 when the demand is lower than in the summer. Also, the court had suggested that instead of wasting the storm water, it should also be channelised to flow into the lake. If these ideas have been considered at all, there is no evidence to suggest that the administration acted on them.GURDEEP SINGH Dhillon (70), who retired from the Punjab State Warehousing Corporation, said he had been regularly going for morning walks for the past 20 years. If I do not visit the lake every morning, something seems to be amiss. The residents of have an emotional connect with the lake. When the lake filled up with silt, hordes of people participated in Shramdan to manually remove it every year till the drive was discontinued by the administration, said Dhillon.Manjot Singh, who has been regularly going for morning walk to the lake for the past 15 years, said that he like a large number of residents have developed a emotional connect with the lake. Lake has become an integral part of our lives. It is imperative to save the lake, no matter what it takes. The residents should come forward to help the administration in saving the lake, said Manjot Singh.(with inputs from Sanjeev Verma)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The other reason cited by CAG for misappropriation of paddy is poor monitoring of the paddy stored in millers premises.The CAG observed that the procuring agencies, Haryana Agro Industries Corporation (HAIC) and Haryana State Warehousing Corporation(HSWC), though presented the post dated cheques kept as guarantee for the paddy of 11 millers who defaulted in delivery of rice but these cheques bounced and FIRs were lodged against millers for misappropriation of paddy.At the same time, the auditor noticed that HAIC had lost over Rs 7.8 crore due to unscientific and improper preservation of wheat. The audit stated that the Food Corporation of India had not taken over 5,974.85 Metric Tonnes of wheat for crop years 2010-12 due to damage caused by unscientific storage and were unfit for human consumption and even as cattle feed.The report states that in case of HAIC, physical verification reports were not available whereas in case of HSWC, physical verification reports were deficient. It has also been pointed out that M/s Bodh Parkash Rohit Kumar Rice Mill at Ambala was given paddy despite not being allotted by district milling committee. Also, HAIC did not initiate shift paddy from the premises of the defaulting millers namely M/s Jai Maa Sharda Mills at Naraingarh and M/s Mittal Rice and General Mill at Ambala, mentions the audit report.The audit report has brought to fore that the M/s Dayachand Rice Mill in Jind, which comes under HAIC and was a defaulter miller of earlier Kharif marketing season, was allotted paddy despite there being clear instructions not to make any paddy allotment to the Mill.Among the total 19 defaulting rice mills, located in Ambala, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Jind, Fatehabad and Yamunanagar districts, Rs 6 crore is to be recovered from M/s Shree Krishna Agro Food of Chormatspur in Ambala. A total of over Rs 5 crore is to be recovered from Mohinder Rice Mills at Ambala and around the same from M/s Jayanti Rice Mill at Kurukshetra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

State should be allocated additional quantity of 85963.544 MT of rice while allocation of 66343.216 MT of wheat for Odisha could be taken back.Earlier, Union government followed a ratio of 84.74 : 15.26 for rice and wheat in pre-NFSA regime.Odisha has 24 per cent of tribal population who prefer rice as their staple food. For them getting wheat milled to flour and then preparing rotis is an alien activity as they are not accustomed to same. Under NFSA, most of the poor tribal families have opted for 100 per cent rice against monthly entitlement. Now, if we impose wheat on their entitlement, there is every possibility that the poor beneficiaries will refuse to take it and it is likely to impact their food security, said the State Chief Secretary.In the pre-NFSA regime Odisha was lifting only about 80 per cent of wheat allocation (12.41 lakh MT out of allocation of 15.45 lakh MT from April' 2012 to October 2015) as there was less demand for same, he pointed out."

We are promoting alternative fuel like ethanol, methanol, bio-CNG...this will boost the rural and agriculture centre and create huge employment,"" Road Transport and Highways Minister said.Despite low prices globally, India at present is incurring a massive Rs 4.5 lakh crore on crude imports which was earlier Rs 7.5 lakh crore, Gadkari said addressing a conference on methanol economy organised by Niti Aayog today.India is one of the fastest growing economy in the world. At present, it is ""golden opportunity"" to cash on its agriculture, bamboo, surplus coal and power.""The time has come to diversify agriculture,"" the minister asserted stating that it has the potential to change the entire rural economy at a time when more than 10,000 farmers in Vidarbha region had committed suicide.""The socio-economic situation is not good, agriculture is facing acute problems. This alternative fuel economy is going to change socio-economic picture of agriculture and rural economy. This is time for the country to plan the way by which we can save the life of people in rural and agriculture sectors.. We can make ethanol from biomass that is cotton straw, wheat straw, rice straw and bagasse. Even from municipal waste we can make ethanol,"" the minister said.Stressing on ""waste to wealth"", he said manufacturing ethanol and biogas from waste could result in savings to the tune of Rs 5 lakh crore annually.The minister said ethanol is generated from biomass in Europe. One tonne of rice straw can get 400 litres of ethanol.In North East, bamboo could be used for making ethanol, he said.He added it will eliminate pollution too as farmers in states like Haryana burnt wheat straw which caused pollution. Besides municipal waste and waste of vegetables and fruits could be used in manufacturing bio-fuel.He stressed the need for use of science, technology, entrepreneurship and research and also said Niti Aayog is taking initiatives in this regard.""We have finalised standard norms for bio-diesel, bio-CNG and ethanol and electricity,"" Gadkari said adding the bureaucracy also needed to fast track decisions.Taking a jibe at bureaucracy, the minister said somewhere there is a need to expedite the entire decision-making process. ""If there is a will, there is a way if there is no will there is no way. There will only be committees, discussions and research groups,"" Gadkari added.The minister also stressed on the need to generate methane from coalblocks and said some of the companies who were alloted the blocks were not doing anything which is not fair.Also, he said that surplus coal from Coal India could be utilised in making gas etc which in turn can result in gas-based urea production.""We are giving subsidy of Rs 45,000 crore for urea. We are importing urea...We need a research institute and transparent policy. This is the future. It is import substitute, cost effective,"" the Minister said.He also stressed the need for flex fuel cars on the pattern of Brazil and the US.The minister said if recycled properly, methane obtained from sewage water can fuel CNG buses."

According to government estimates, the farm output is expected to be marginally better at 253 million tonnes for the 2015-16 crop year.Private weather forecaster Skymet on Monday issued a forecast of above normal monsoon this year. The India Meteorological Department is scheduled to announce its long-range monsoon forecast on Tuesday.At the conference, Pattanayak asked the state governments to make advance preparation for sowing of kharif crops such as rice and pulses by making adequate availability of seeds, fertilisers, and other agricultural inputs.He admitted that the institutional credit mechanism was not working as desired as farmers were approaching money lenders despite the government making available Rs 8.5 lakh crore towards farm credit.As a result, we have seen maximum number of farmers suicides last year, Pattnayak said asking the state governments to ensure that small and marginal farmers get access to institutional credit.The government has earmarked Rs 9 lakh crore for disbursal of short-term agricultural loans for small and medium farmers in the Union Budget for 2016-17.The government also ruled out any changes to the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and asked state governments to roll out the scheme this kharif season."

""Prices will rise if there is a gap in demand and supply"".Private traders are importing about 58-60 lakh tonnes to bridge this gap, he said, adding that there is a need to encourage farmers to grow more pulses.""We have imposed stock holding limits on pulses.

The central government can only give permission to take action against hoarders,"" Paswan said.Talking about food security law, the minister said that the legislation has been implemented in 34 states and only two states Kerala and Tamil Nadu have not rolled it out yet.""We are supplying rice and wheat at a highly subsidised price of Rs 3 and Rs 2 per kg respectively. Why states are not subsidising it further,"" he asked.""Why are the States not reducing taxes and VAT?...it will help reduce the prices of pulses,"" he said.Participating in the debate on price rise, BJP member Poonam Mahajan blamed the previous UPA governments for the price rise situation and said that whenever Congress was in power inflation has gone up.Taking a swipe at Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi, she wondered how the 'yuva raj' did not know about the price situation when UPA was in power from 2004-2014."

""The basmati rice grown in Jammu and Kashmir is now under threat from Pakistan"", an official of the Agriculture department said, adding, farmers are anxious that ""if there is no one to harvest, the crop will die in fortnight"".With the crop ripe, farmers have been risking their lives to harvest the paddy.54-year-old Sham Lal has rushed to his fields along with few family members to cut the paddy growing close to the International Border in R S Pura border belt of Jammu district.""We are helpless. We cannot afford to lose our crops. Our family is dependent on these crops. We are risking our lives to harvest these standing crops"", Lal said.Like Lal, several marginal farmers living along the borderline are working overtime to speedily complete harvesting of the crops.Bein Gallar Sarpanch Ram Paul, whose hamlet was shelled by Pakistani Rangers few days ago, says farmers in border areas are forced to risk their lives to harvest their ripe crops as they depend on them for livelihood.""In the absence of labourers and machines, they are reluctant to come with their families and undertake harvesting.The border farmers have taken it on themselves to harvest their standing crops and in the process have become sitting ducks for the Pak Rangers"", Paul said.However, like them the farmers owning big agriculture land are not so lucky as they await paddy cutting machines and labourers, who have fled the farmlands following Pakistani shelling and firing and arereluctant to return to commence farming in the border belt of Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts."

It is expected that La Nina condition will takeover, and will perhaps favour a good monsoon this year,"" Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Patnaik said addressing a national conference to launch kharif campaign for 2016-17.Met Department's predictions will be out later this month, giving a clear picture of monsoon, he added.India's foodgrain production declined to 252.02 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June) from the record 265.04 million tonnes in the previous year, due to poor monsoon.The output is estimated to rise slightly to 253.16 in the ongoing 2015-16 crop year due to 14 per cent less rains. Two consecutive bad monsoons have led to farm distress and water scarcity in the country.The Secretary asked the state governments to make advance preparation for sowing of kharif (summer) crops like rice and pulses by making adequate availability of seeds, fertilisers, and other agri-inputs.Less than normal rainfall in the last two years has left farmers and resources at stress. There is high moisture stress in soil, he added.Even the Economic Survey in February had said El Nino, which is held responsible for extreme weather events across the country last year, is unlikely to repeat this year.However, it had suggested that the government should still be ready with the contingency plan to deal with any eventuality besides announcing in advance the MSP for crops like pulses."

""She behaves like a 'shehanshah'(emperor ) these days,"" he said, as he accused her of failing to bring about any change in the state.Modi while hitting hit out at the ruling TMC on the issue of corruption from ""Saradha (scam) to Narada (sting operation)"", alleged that its leaders are reportedly asking when will they get the ""next instalment"" of bribe.""I want to ask the people of Bengal did they vote in favour of corruption? Have the people formed the government for the sake of corruption? First Saradha then Narada (sting operation). The entire (TMC) leadership in front of the camera seen taking bribe, asking when will they get the next instalment,"" he said.""It was the money of the people which is being looted, Modi said, adding, ""We (BJP government) are also in power in Delhi for nearly two years. Have you ever heard of any scam? We would prefer to starve than loot the money of the masses.""The 34-year-long Left regime had ""destroyed"" Bengal and the TMC in the last five years have broken the aspirations of the masses and their dreams, he said. ""They (TMC) have ruined Bengal,"" he added, as he sought people's support for BJP for once.""Five years back I had thought that there will be change in Bengal but our aspirations have failed,"" the prime minister said, adding no industry was coming up in Bengal and the only one flourishing in it is the ""bomb making industry"".""The state government is not taking offence to this (bomb making) industry. You can't win the hearts of the masses by blasts and using goons. The people will give a befitting reply as you have betrayed the masses,"" Modi said.Modi while launching a scathing attack on the Left and Congress said they are ""challenging and insulting"" the wisdom of Bengalis by coming together in West Bengal but fighting each other in Kerala.""Congress and Communists have challenged the wisdom of Bengal and Bengalis will not spare anyone who tries so. Communists and Congress are contesting in Kerala and Bengal. While they are fighting and baying for each other in Kerala, they are playing a game behind the curtains in Bengal. In Kerala they do wrestling and in Bengal, they do friendship. This is a challenge to the wisdom of Bengalis.""Are they not challenging the wisdom of Bengal and insulting that? Is it not an insult of Bengal's self respect? This is an insult of Bengalis. If they had the courage, they should have admitted that they are opportunists and are only hungry for power and have nothing to do with Kerala or Bengal,"" he said.Criticising the CPI-M-Congress alliance in Bengal, Modi accused the two parties of trying to fool the people of both Bengal and Kerala.The two parties are fighting against each other in Kerala and have forged an alliance in Bengal, he said adding ""They should have the guts to accept that they are not at all interested about the people of Kerala and Bengal but only in power.""""They should accept that they are opportunists and only want power,"" Modi said.The prime minister said he had a three point agenda for the development of Bengal and ""The agenda is development, development at a fast pace and development everywhere.""Modi said the CPI-M and Congress are trying to insult the people of Bengal by their different stands in the state and in Kerala.Launching a broadside at the three major political parties in the state, he said ""TMC, Congress and Communists have forged an alliance to stop BJP in Bengal. The Left and Congress did not carry out any movement against TMC. It is BJP which has lost workers and faced trouble as it is fighting TMC.""Modi said his government has proved that corruption can be controlled if there is a will.""The solution to every problem is development. The previous government in Delhi (centre) had its hands painted black in coal block scam. But after we came to power we did coal block auction with transparency. It brought a lot of money in Indian exchequer,"" he said.Modi also took a dig at claims made by Mamata Banerjee about providing rice at Rs 2 per kg to poor people.""We provide a subsidy of Rs 27 per kg for the poor. And Didi claims she is providing the subsidy,"" he said.Appealing to the people to give BJP a chance to form a government in the state, Modi said ""This destruction and devastation can't help the youth of Bengal.

United States National Security Advisor Susan Rice had a telephonic conversation with her Indian counterpart Ajit Doval on Thursday.Singh said it was a cross-border anti-terror operation with limited objectives. The operations were focused on ensuring that these terrorists do not succeed in their design to cause destruction and endanger the lives of our citizens. The operations aimed at neutralising terrorists have since ceased. We do not have any plans for further continuation, he said.The DGMO said he called up his Pakistani counterpart and informed him of Indias action. There is a military hotline between the two DGMOs and they speak with each other at least once a week. The Pakistan army as well as the foreign office denied the strikes but admitted cross-border firing.It is Indias intention to maintain peace and tranquillity in the region. But we cannot allow the terrorists to operate across the Line of Control with impunity and attack citizens of our country at will, Singh said.The announcement was made at a hurriedly called press conference within minutes of the CCS meeting where top officials from the security and intelligent establishment, including the Army Chief Gen Dalbir Singh and the DGMO, gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Cabinet colleagues Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh and Manohar Parrikar an update on the operations.Subsequently, Modi apprised President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice President Hamid Ansari and his predecessor Manmohan Singh of the army operation.The military response comes weeks after two terror strikes in Poonch (Sept 11) and Uri (Sept 18) in Jammu and Kashmir. The attack on an Army base in Uri led to the death of 18 soldiers; one police constable was killed in Poonch. On both occasions, security forces gunned down the militants. Also, 20 infiltration attempts were foiled this year.The stores recovered from the dead terrorists are of Pakistan origin and confessions from the captured ultras showed the involvement of the Pakistan army in training and arming these militants."
5920837e7be9e04a516a8dcc,Left promises rice at Rs 2 per kg,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/536019/left-promises-rice-rs-2.html,2016-03-22,"Kolkata, March 22, 2016, DHNS 1:43 ISTBorrowing a leaf from Trinamool Congress supreme Mamata Banerjees books, the Lefts poll manifesto promised rice at Rs 2 per kg, if it returns to power.Subsidised ration, focussing more on small and medium industries, and restoring democracy are some other promises the Left poll document made. It was, however, significantly silent on the recent sting operation embroiling top Trinamool Congress leaders in a controversy.The Left, which criticised Mamata for resorting to populist schemes like providing subsidised rice and other food grains, however, seemed to have fallen for similar schemes before the polls. The manifesto, released on Sunday evening, promised rice at Rs 2 kg or a weekly quote of 35 kg wheat flour, if the Left came to power. The 16-page poll document also promised to stop hunger deaths, an issue the Left repeatedly denied when in power, besides providing monthly allowance of Rs 2,500 to workers of closed industries.The manifesto said Mamata failed to bring in investments, setting back the industrialisation process started under Left regime. Even though in successive public meetings since December, Left leaders invoked the name of Singur, where Tata Group was to set up a small car factory, the manifesto did not mention such promises. Focussing more on small and medium industries, instead of heavy industries, the manifesto also steered clear off the contentious issue of land acquisition for industries.Keeping in mind the partys analysis that forcible land acquisition at Singur and Nandigram between 2006 and 2008 was a major factor in driving the Left out of power, the manifesto talked of taking cautious steps and sincere efforts to develop understanding between all stakeholders. Families giving away land will be given profitable value. Initiatives will be taken to give training and employment to one member from each affected family, it stated, taking into account demands of farmers and land owners at flash points like Singur and Nandigram for better compensation.While the manifesto asked for restoration of democracy to the state, the Left called for all secular, democratic forces to come together to fight Trinamool in Bengal and the BJP at the Centre."

For Jayalalithaa, her friend and close associate of over several decades Sasikala is always by her side. She can be seen with the chief minister during the campaign trail.During the public meeting, Sasikala is always seated in the front row, cheering her friend. Her presence is itself a huge support to the AIADMK supremo. Fondly called as Chinna Amma by the party cadres, Sasikala has always been with Jayalalithaa through thick and thin. For DMK leader M K Stalin, his wife Durga Stalin is a source of inspiration and solid support. She accompanies her husband during the course of the poll campaign. With Stalin keeping late hours after hectic campaign, it is Durga Stalin who takes care of all his needs. She also gauges public response to her husbands campaign.For Vijayakanth, the chief minister candidate of DMDK-PWF front, his wife Premalatha is not only his companion but also a cheer leader and orator, who addresses public, poll candidate and also a campaign manager.
