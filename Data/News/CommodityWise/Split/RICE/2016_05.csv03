So she needs to be under medical supervision,"" doctors at the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital said.It was at this hospital where the 'Iron Lady' of Manipur was kept under police detention and forcibly nose-fed till she broke the world's longest-running fast on August 9.Doctors said the 44-year-old, who broke the hunger strike with a dab of honey, is now gradually taking semi-solid food like oats besides boiled rice and milk shakes and juices.""Her body is responding well so far. But we have to be very slow because her digestive system, which was inactive so far for absorbing solid food, will not be able to immediately start accepting all kinds of food,"" they said.A team of doctors from different specialities like gastroenteritis and gynaecology are monitoring her health.Sharmila's brother Singhajit said she will stay at the hospital till her health condition improves in the next few days.Babloo Loitangbam, one of her associates, said the day Sharmila broke her fast some locals were very angry at her sudden decision.""There was a meeting yesterday with the women activists of Sharmila Kanba Lup where she explained that she has chosen to take a different path but her goal remains the same - repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA). Things were then sorted out,"" he said.They have advised Sharmila to start a process of reintegration with the society as she has been living in isolation from the rest of the world for the last 16 years.""She needs a reality check. The world is not the same as it used to be when she began her fast. Now she needs to first start meeting people and see the present day Manipur,""Loitangbam said."

But they are putting label and calling it as Amma Free Arisi (Rice) scheme.

592085217be9e04a516a8f5f,Karnataka at high diabetes risk,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/534795/karnataka-high-diabetes-risk.html,2016-03-15,"Karnataka at high diabetes riskKalyan Ray, New Delhi, Mar 15, 2016, DHNS: 1:44 ISTPunjab also among top three in listKarnataka and Punjab are the two states where the population is at a significantly higher risk of developing diabetes, a survey has revealed. Karnataka is one of the top three states in having the highest prevalence of prediabetic individuals.On other common risk factors for non-communicable diseasesbe it abdominal obesity, hypertension or dyslipidemia (lipid anomaly)  Karnataka and Punjab are among the top three states with the maximum prevalence.This clearly suggests that a large number of people from these two states are at an elevated risk of developing the disease. The survey also shows India has a huge hidden population of pre-diabetic individuals, who would turn diabetic unless immediate preventive measures are taken.Conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the study seeks to include 1,24,000 people from 28 states, the national capital region of Delhi and two Union territories, when completed.Halfway through, data collected from 57,113 individuals from 14 states and one Union territory (Chandigarh) threw up several interesting results, which was presented before the ICMR on Tuesday.ComparisonTake Karnataka for example. With 7.5% prevalence of diabetes, the southern state stands at the sixth position. But it is among the top three when it comes to prediabetes and risk factors for non-communicable diseases.Karnataka may be lower than Tamil Nadu (10.4%) in diabetes prevalence because people in north Karnataka consume coarse cereals a lot unlike Tamil Nadu where rice is the staple diet. But the huge number of pre-diabetic population is a big risk as little change in lifestyle can make them diabetic, said V Mohan of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation.If somebody becomes prosperous and buys a scooter, it means end of the walk to the bus stop, he said. Diabetes was taking off at an early age of 25-34 years among Indians particularly in urban areas, which was a big worry, said Mohan, who is the chief coordinator for the project.While there is a rural urban divide in the states, the gap is narrowing fast. The prevalence of diabetes in urban India is 12.2% as against villages where it is 5.7%. But when it comes to risk factors like hypertension and dyslipidemia, the difference is marginal.Rural areas are catching up with urban localities. Its a wake up call for us. Since pre-diabetes rate is so high, we need to develop new strategies for mass screening diabetes, said Soumya Swaminathan, director-general of ICMR. As reduction of non-communicable diseases is one of the priorities of the health ministry, the ICMR data would help the ministry plan different intervention strategies for various states.The prevalence of diabetes varies from 4.3% in Bihar to 13.6% in Chandigarh. Because of India's heterogeneous nature, studies done in one part of the country can not be extrapolated to another part as there is so much cultural and socio-economic differences, said Mohan. The study is likely to be completed in two years."

New roads in place of dirt roads snaked through the smallest of villages. Long-standing problem of rural electrification has been taken care of and drinking water crisis has been mitigated to some extent. Yet, the Trinamool leadership seems somewhat shaky over its chances.Since 2011, Mamata has put up a brave front, claiming to have taken care of development in impoverished districts like Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore.Welfare measures like rice at Rs 2 a kilo, laying foundation of colleges, super speciality hospitals, besides distributing largesse in the form of bicycles and educational grants to girl students have somewhat changed the face of rural Bengal. What could mar Mamatas chances is the complex arithmetic of tribal and Dalit aspirations. Constant campaign by the combined forces of the Left-Congress on one hand and BJP on the other, on the issue of graft could also leave a mark.Seemingly an urban issue, a controversial footage showing top Trinamool leaders receiving illegal cash payments, has reached villages.If the Left-Congress combine hammered the issue through poll graphiti, BJP went a step further, distributing DVDs of the footage to grassroots workers, who are screening these at street corners and markets. If that is not all, at Jungle Mahal, Mamatas strongest contender will be Jharkhand Party (Naren), an outfit with significant sphere of influence over the regions tribal populace. The outfit could cause serious damage on April 11, set aside for Jungle Mahal, owing to security concerns due to its Maoist-affected area tag.Being a region with several sensitive booths, the Election Commission has decided on aerial surveillance with two helicopters making rounds during polling hours. As per schedule, 49 Assembly constituencies across West Midnapore, Burdwan, Bankura and Puruliawill go to polls on these two days. Ground reports suggest what initially seemed like a cakewalk for Trinamool, might not be so with doubts having crept in over the last fortnight, both within the ruling party and the electorate. For now, Mamata will have to wait till results are out on May 19 and allay whatever apprehensions she might have over anti-incumbency and talks of graft overshadowing her plank of overall development."

He will soon send a detailed note to the PM in this regard.""I have told the Prime Minister how we can make use of paddy straw instead of burning it. You cannot ask farmers to stop burning paddy straw as he has to prepare his field for the next crop. You must find a mechanism to commercialise it,"" Swaminathan told PTI on the sidelines of an event here.A technology has been developed in Maharashtra for using paddy straw as animal feed, he said.""You add urea and molasses in paddy straw, you can use it as animal feed. There are many different ways, paddy straw can be utilised. The PM was very interested and I will soon send a note to him on this topic,"" he said.India produces 140 million tonnes of paddy and 280 million tonnes of rice straw in a year, he added.Swaminathan, known as Father of India's Green Revolution, was sharing dias with the Prime Minister at first ever international conference of agro-biodiversity being held here.While addressing the event, he spoke on the issue saying that when we talk about agro-biodiversity, it is not about grains alone but about the whole plant.""Paddy straw enriched with urea and molasses is a wonderful animal feed,"" he said while citing example of research work done in Mynamar in this regard.Meanwhile, the Centre has called a meeting of Environment Ministers of all neighbouring states on Monday to curb stubble burning by farmers which has made Delhi a ""gas chamber"".""There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation,"" Union Environment Minister Anil Dave had said.Cases of severe breathlessness, asthma and allergy have sharply risen in Delhi as the city remains blanketed in thick layer of toxic air due to the worst smog in 17 years, aggravated by use of Diwali crackers last week."

If one joins BJP, then all his crimes are absolved,"" he said.The Chief Minister said his former minister Himanta Biswa Sharma, who later joined BJP, was saying that if his party comes to power they will take 1951 as the base year while implementing Assam accord to solve the issue of infiltration.""This will re-awaken a solved issue and again create communal disharmony. A Nellie (where more than thousand Bangladeshi migrants were killed during the Assam agitation) like situation will again arise,"" Gogoi said.""We have also signed the Assam Accord but we won't accept 1951 as base year. Politics of BJP is the politics of conflict and we strongly condemn it,"" he added.A Prime Minister should not be scared of a ""new comer in politics like my son. Modi is actually scared of me as he knows he cannot get power in Assam while I am here,"" he said.The BJP accuses ""me of only developing my son's career. Were all universities, bridges and roads made only for my son? What is wrong in him being an MP and raising his voice on behalf of the people of Assam?"" the Chief Minister asked.Gogoi said he has always raised his voice for Assam and even in ""Indira Gandhi's term I raised my voice against any discrimination towards Assam while being a minister in a Congress government"".He said Bihar gave answer to Modi, Gujarat in Panchayat polls and Banaras showed BJP a defeat and now its Assam's turn to defeat BJP, he said.""I am not a fortune teller to tell the exact number of seats we are going to get but we will get sufficient seats to form the government. In Lower Assam, we will get more seats than earlier. We will get no less than 60 seats,"" he added.When Narendra Modi talks of Gujarat model, he forgets how child labour in Gujarat is at 31.6 per cent while in Assam it is almost one-third of that.BJP conveniently lied that they provide rice at Rs two per kg whereas, it is the Assam government which is giving rice at Rs two per kg while the Centre was supplying it at Rs three per kg.Modi quoted a song by Bhupen Hazarika and talked of development but these leaders did not even turn up when he was bed ridden.""I doubt if he even knows the meaning of the song that he quoted to impress people"", he said.Modi also said Guwahati is one of the dirtiest capitals in the country but the ""truth is that we are among the top ten capitals of India whereas Gandhinagar and Varanasi are far behind.

59208adf7be9e04a516a94ff,Harmonise global laws on conservation of agro-biodiversity: PM,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/579644/harmonise-global-laws-conservation-agro.html,2016-11-06,"New Delhi, Nov 6, 2016 (PTI) 15:33 ISTExpressing concern over extinction of some plant and animal species, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said global laws on conservation of agro-biodiversity should be harmonised in a way that they do not hamper growth of the agriculture sector in developing nations.He also cautioned against ignoring sustainable development and conversation of biodiversity while finding solutions to poverty, malnutrition and hunger through science and technology.Addressing the first International Agro-biodiversity Congress, Modi emphasised on focused research and proper management of genetic resources. As threat to genetic resources is going to increase in the coming days, there should be ""shared vision"" with pooled resources from national, international, private bodies and scientific experts across the world towards conservation of biodiversity, he said.""We will have to see how various laws related to agro- biodiversity can be harmonised so that they do not come in the way of development of agriculture and farmers,"" he said. ""People have exploited natural resources blindly in the name of development. As a result, challenges are going to grow in the coming days. In the current scenario, discussion and research on agro-biodiversity are very important for achieving global food, nutrition, health and environment security,"" he added.Modi expressed concern over extinction of 50-150 species every day and said that in the coming years there is a threat to one out of eight birds and one-fourth of animals. He added that biodiversity conservation should be more a matter of individual consciousness than rules and regulation.""World over, crores of people are fighting hunger, malnutrition and poverty. To address these issues, science and technology is very important. While finding solution to these problems, we should not ignore sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity,"" Modi said.Highlighting that India is rich in agro-biodiversity, he said the country has 6.5 per cent of the world's biodiversity and feeds 17-18 per cent of the global human and animal population with only 2.5 per cent of the land resources.""Our country is agriculture based and more than 50 per cent of the population is dependent on it. Our philosophy has been to keep natural resources intact and focus on development. Even development programmes across the world are based on this philosophy,"" he said.Stating that the problem of climate change has been due to imbalance in nature, Modi said, ""In view of global warming threat, we have ratified Paris agreement on October 2. India is playing a leading role.""In the first international conference on biodiversity held in the national capital, about 900 delegated from 60 countries are deliberating on the issue of conservation of agro-biodiversity.Stating that each nation is adopting different ways to protect agro-biodiversity, Modi said, ""It would be appropriate if we prepare a register to keep a record of all such practices and then do research to find out which practices need to be promoted."" He talked about the negative impact of science and technology and suggested ""audit of development of science"".""Science and technology is important for addressing malnutrition, hunger and poverty, but we will see to that how technology is impacting us...we need to be alert on negative impact of technology,"" he said, while citing example of usage of pesticide hindering honeybee in pollination process.On the extinction of genetic resources, Modi said 50-150 species are getting extinct every day despite adoption of recommendation of the 1992 biological diversity convention. ""In the coming years, there is threat of extinction of one out of eight birds and one fourth of animals. We will have to change our thinking. We need to focus on conserving our current resources and also strengthening it. All countries will have to learn from each other. This will happen when we focus on research in the area of agro-biodiversity,"" he said.Elaborating on the richness of India's biodiversity, Modi said there are more than 47,000 plant species and over 89,000 animal species, besides over 8,100 km of coastal areas. ""India's agriculture philosophy has been to keep natural resources intact and conserve it and utilise it as per the requirement. Even development programmes across the world are based on this philosophy,"" he said.India has been able to protect genetic resources as the ancestors linked agri-produce with our culture, he said citing various examples. The country has been able to conserve many varieties including 'Konamani' rice variety in South India, 'Agnibora' in Assam, 'Bhalia' wheat in Gujarat, he added.India has also helped other nations in conserving agro- biodiversity, Modi said, noting that Haryana's buffalo breed 'Murah' and Gujarat's 'Zafrabadi' are known as international trans-boundary breeds.He pointed out however that the country has been able to register only 160 animal species and urged greater focus on research in this area to identify more species.Emphasising on the need to widen the scope of research for value-addition in agri-produce based on the strength of biodiversity, Modi mentioned a grass variety 'Banni' in Gujarat that is helping increase milk production. This grass has high nutritional value.""Through value addition in the characteristic of this grass, we can promote this grass in the country. We need to expand the scope of research for this,"" he said, adding that value-addition can be done in castor, millets and mushroom. He made it clear however that there should not be any damage to species while doing value addition.""Human beings have created a problem of climate change by interfering in the nature. Rise in temperature is affecting life cycle of plants and animals. As per one estimate, 16 per cent of wild species will be on the verge of extinction by 2050. This situation is a cause of concern,"" he said.Stating that agro-biodiversity management is a priority for all nations, he stressed on conserving genetic resources in gene banks and making them available to farmers. ""We need to create such a mechanism so that our farmers are able to analyse desirable genes in their farm fields and for which they should get good price. Such farmers should be involved in research work,"" he said.Modi also called for blue revolution and asked scientists to focus not only on fisheries but also on cultivation of sea weeds. Addressing the conference, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh said India has rich genetic resources to face the challenges like climate change on agriculture.The country has the world's second largest gene bank with 4.29 lakh species, he added. Eminent agri-scientists and Father of Green Revolution in India M S Swaminathan urged the Prime Minister to take up with the United Nations a proposal of having an international year of agro-biodiversity. Agro-biodiversity is the foundation of food security of India, he said, adding that new varieties need to be promoted for boosting production."

The agitation of farmers has been that their dry crop is equalled with that of the farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu's need for the rice crop consumes more than twice the water which is needed for light crops in Karnataka,"" the application said.The application says that people, particularly farmers in the districts of Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya and Bengaluru, have been squatting on the roads and streets, affecting the IT industry in the state capital which earns huge revenue by way of income tax, service tax, and foreign exchange of USD 60 billion for the country.The application also referred to inputs from security agencies that said if the flow of water is allowed to continue further, the situation ""may go out of hand"".In an interim order on September 5, the court had directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day to Tamil Nadu for the next 10 days to ameliorate the plight of the farmers there.The apex court had also directed Tamil Nadu to approach Supervisory Committee, set up to implement the award of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, within three days for release of water as per the final order of the CWDT."

Their votes will go to the one local community leaders will suggest. We dont know which symbol stands for which party. Our village headman will advise us on whom to vote, admitted Jyotilal Hansda, a land tiller hailing from the Santhal community. He was speaking for his wife, Hela, and his son, Karmu, who will be voting for the first time this year. Jyotilal and his familys immediate concerns are four square meals. Their source of subsistence is a kind of gruel, made of steamed rice kept overnight in a bowl of water.The accompaniment is often one burnt tomato mashed in with chillies, both vegetables grown in the familys less than half an acre plot. As Jyotilal talked to Deccan Herald on a searing hot, summer afternoon, slurping in his share of the gruel from a plastic bowl, he said that things have always been like this for them.The village headmen instructed which symbol to cast their vote for and they pressed the button next to the suggested symbol, be it the twin flowers and a blade of grass, representing Trinamool Congress, the hammer-sickle-star of the Left or the Congresss upright palm. Jyotilal, however, finds the reigning government acceptable ever since Mamata started providing rice at Rs 2 a kg. Proper roads snaking through the village, an electricity connection, which keeps the two LED lamps, also a part of the governments largesse, and a deep tube-well that mostly provides clean water, have made him believe that this government is good. Now weve the things we need the most. The field provides us with basic vegetables and the nearby ration shop supplies us a monthly quota of 15 Kg rice at Rs 2, he said. Waving her arms around the singe-storey house, with two rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, Hela pointed at the walls and talked of how the house with public funds have helped her family survive the extreme temperatures of Purulia, where on summer days the mercury often touches 47 degrees Celsius and in winters it dips down to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius.Even though the house has been built under Indira Awas Yojana, a Central government scheme, she and Jyotilal believe the present government is to be thanked.Baleshwar Majhi, a landless worker mostly dependent on 100 days work under MGNREGA, however, does not seem happy with Mamata.Although not sure who Mamata is, he does not believe she has done much for people like him. Theres hardly any work available. We wish the government arranged for more work, he said. Like most men from his community, he finds solace in drinking undistilled country liquor, made by fermenting day-old rice in water. Political developments mean nothing for him and he does not know of the changes around, he admitted.I have never even seen this man in my life, he said, pointing at a poster of Nepal Mahato, the sitting Congress MLA, who is fighting to retain his seat. When posed the question to him, he asked, Who should I vote for? The village headman, who did not want to be named, admitted that most voters in the area are like Jyotilal and Baleshwar. Affiliated to the Congress, he hopes the villagers will cast for the symbol of his choice and help his candidate regain the seat.DH News Service"

They will continue to get their present allocation of foodgrain at the NFSA rates, ranging from Rs 1-3 per kg.Kerala will continue to get its allotted 14 lakh tonnes of foodgrain and Tamil Nadu will continue to get 36 lakh tonnes at the NFSA rates, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan told reporters here.Under the law, the government provides 5 kg of foodgrain per person, per month at Rs 1-3 per kg. Wheat is being supplied at Rs 2 a kilo and rice at Rs 3 per kilo.The NFSA will entail an annual financial outgo of Rs 1.4 lakh crore, he said.Paswan also warned state governments to refrain from taking credit for the initiative as the subsidised foodgrain were being distributed under a Central law.The Centre has digitised the entire beneficiary database in all the 36 states and Union Territories, Paswan said.He said the next target for the government was automation of fair price shops for distribution of food grains through an electronic point of sale device that would authenticate beneficiaries at the time of distribution.Paswan said so far 71% of the ration cards have been linked with Aadhaar and the rest would be done at the earliest.This has resulted in the deletion of about 2.62 crore bogus ration cards, he said."

The two states will not be eligible to receive foodgrain at subsidised rates for distribution to Above Poverty Line (APL) families through the Public Distribution System.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday decided to provide food grain for the APL category to Tamil Nadu and Kerala at the minimum support price instead of the subsidised rates, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ramvilas Paswan said.The two states will have to shell out Rs 15.25 per kg of wheat as against Rs 6.10 they would have paid at the APL rates. Similarly, for rice, the two states will have to pay Rs 22.54 per kg instead of the APL rate of Rs 8.30 per kg. However, the foodgrain supplies to these two states for distribution to BPL families and Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) would continue at old rates, Paswan said.The NFSA seeks to scrap the BPL and APL categories and provide rice and wheat to all beneficiaries at highly subsidised rates of Rs 1-3 per kg. As many as 34 states and Union Territories have implemented the NFSA either partially or fully.Tamil Nadu gets 1.4 lakh tonne foodgrain every month from the Centre, while Kerala has an allocation of 47,800 tonne for distribution to APL families. As per the official data, Tamil Nadu has a total of 195.85 ration card holders, out of which BPL and APL are 170.20 lakh. The remaining are under AAY category."

The committee was set up in the wake of the runaway rise in the prices of pulses which still maintain high levels, though they have slightly eased now. But the relief is yet to benefit the consumers because the decline in wholesale prices is not fully reflected in retail prices. The committee has recommended measures in terms of both government action and policies. They include creation of buffer stock, offer of incentives and input subsidies to farmers to grow pulse crops and promotion of research to develop high-yielding pulse varieties. The committee has also proposed measures like removal of stock limits and export bans which are imposed in times of shortage. In certain situations, they distort the market and become counterproductive.The offer of higher minimum support prices encourages farmers to cultivate pulses in place of other crops. The government has tried this and it has shown positive results. It may also be accompanied by a stoppage of increase or even a cut in the MSP of paddy. There is excess production of rice and wheat in the country. The incentives will help pulse crops, which are now grown in dry regions, to shift to irrigated areas. Timely and adequate procurement, as proposed by the committee, is equally important. At present, though the market price is less than the MSP, there is no procurement in some areas. The committee wants a buffer stock of at least 2 million tonnes and an agency other than the Food Corporation of India to undertake procurement. It does not oppose the entrusting of this task to private parties, too. However, it sho-uld be on the basis of open bidding, and the rules relating to buffer building and maintenance should be fair and transparent. Lifting of export bans and stock limits will encourage farmers and traders in an environment of adequate availability of pulses. It is also necessary that farmers get their MSPs through direct transfers, especially if other agencies are involved in procurement. The proposals to take pulses out of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees purview and a review of the Essential Commodities Act also call for consideration.Some of the proposals can be immediately implemented and others in the medium and long-term. Yet others demand more study and scrutiny. But this is the right time to start implementation because the pulse output in the kharif season is expected to be very high. The trend should be supported through government action."

We were a joint family and my two younger brothers and their families also stayed with us. We used to grow rice and maize. But October 6, 1993, changed all of that. I lost my two younger brothers. I was turned homeless and jobless. It has been 23 years, I am still in this make shift camp. I am yet to receive compensations. I had voted for the Congress and even the Bodo candidates every election till 1993. I was finally able to again transfer my name in the voters list to a centre close to this settlement. Governments have come and gone, everyone promised us resettlement and compensation, no one kept their promise, Ali says.The tale is same for 5,000 odd people living in Hapsapara camp near Rakhaldubi of Bongaigaon district of lower Assam. 2,200 among them are voters for the ensuing second phase of Assam polls. .The local MLA Bhupen Roy is from the AGP. He never visited the camp. The AGP is known for its anti-migrant stand. The Congress had for ages used us as vote bank. Since 2006 though the rise of Badaruddin Ajmal, we have found bit of solace politically. Our grandfathers were also born in Assam, yet we are treated as migrants and Bangladeshis. After the 1993 attacks, government ran camps for three months and asked us to return to our villages but we could not gather courage. The 2012 riots are testimony that things have only gone worse, Rajab Ali told Deccan Herald.After a lot of struggle, the voters in the camp were able to transfer their polling station to a centre near the camp from different parts of Bodoland region. The area falls in Abhayapuri (North) constituency.Some families had begun to leave Hapasara after receiving Rs 50,000 as compensation from the government. They had received Rs 10,000 as immediate relief earlier. Now these amounts are too less to start life afresh Rajab added.After the government washed off its hands, these helpless people rented a patch of private land outside Bodoland in Bongaigaon district. Mohammed Rofiqul Islam, the proprietor of the land, himself a Bengali Muslim, feels that Muslims across lower Assam are closely monitoring the BJPs anti-migrant campaign."

BasheerLack of rain has affected almost all crops in the regionMany streams and rivulets have gone dryWater shortage has hit towns and villagesMARAYUR: The hot summer and the lack of rain have hit life and crops in the forest-covered High Ranges, which is a major source of water and electricity for the State.Several streams and rivulets across the mountainous region, considered the spice garden of India, have gone dry and other water sources have shrunk. Residents say they have not experienced such a hot summer in the recent past. Elephants and other wild animals stray into human habitats in search of water.Water shortage has hit towns as well as villages in the region. In the interior villages, located in the mountain folds, the inhabitants usually rely on their own crude method of water supply. Water is piped directly from the little streams that run close to homes. But now that the streams have gone dry, they are forced to carry water from other places. In towns such as Munnar, water in large canisters is transported in jeeps and on motorcycles.The Idukki district panchayat and the Devikulam taluk authorities have held emergency meetings to discuss water scarcity. People blame the authorities for the poor execution and bad maintenance of the water schemes.Marayur jaggeryCrop damage has been reported from many parts of the High Ranges. Almost all crops, particularly the seasonal ones, have been badly affected. In the Marayur panchayat area, some 40 km from Munnar, sugarcane and lemon grass are the worst-hit.Marayur is known for its jaggery. `Marayur sarkkara' has traditionally enjoyed a good reputation because of its quality and purity. Of late, owing to the uneconomic nature of rice farming, farmers in the area have switched over to sugarcane cultivation and jaggery production. Marayur is the only place in the State where sugarcane is cultivated on a large scale. The summer heat has hit vast stretches of sugarcane fields. Farmers say this year's sugarcane production in Marayur and the nearby Kanthalloor and Keezhanthoor will be drastically affected. This is because the sun has squeezed out the juice from the canes. The yield depends on the level of juice in the cane. Sugarcane is harvested in nine to 10 months.Adivasis hitOne crop that has been devastated by the hot summer is lemon grass, which is mainly cultivated by Adivasis. In Marayur and nearby areas where there are 18 `Adivasi kudis' (tribal hamlets), lemon grass cultivation is the main source of livelihood for the Muthuvan tribe. Adivasi leaders say the impact of the drought on the tribal economy will be felt in the coming months.The drought has crept into the tea gardens of Munnar, Devikulam, Peermade, Vandipperiyar and other areas. Planters say hundreds of acres of tea gardens have gone partially dry. If the dry spell lasts longer, large stretches of tea gardens will go fully dry, they say.The Munnar-based Kanan Devan Hills Plantations Company (formerly Tata Tea) says that 1,600 acres of tea have been partly hit by the drought as well as frost. This has caused a production loss of 16 lakh kg of tea, with an estimated value of Rs.8.8 crore, the company said."

Poor rice and fish yields marked the season concluding now, while the new season holds out hope for better harvests.Pokkali farmers are hopeful that they will be better organised to get improved yields in the coming season. For a start, April 16 is being observed as Pokkali Day, marking the beginning of the season. The panchayats and local-level organisations are being encouraged to draw the attention of people to the unique method of Pokkali cultivation.The Pokkali Day observances are being initiated by the Pokkali Land Development Society, chaired by District Collector A.P.M. Mohammed Hanish.The low yields have been blamed on the vagaries of rain as well as the poor quality of the fish seeds.Pokkali is a method of growing salt-resistant paddy and aquaculture unique to the coastal areas of Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Thrissur districts, where an estimated 12,000 hectares used to be cultivated.Pokkali cultivation has shrunk considerably, and in Ernakulam district, less than 4,000 hectares out of the 6,000 hectares available is being cultivated. The 17 panchayats that have Pokkali fields in the district have been instructed to take steps to revive the indigenous methods of paddy cultivation and aquaculture.The district administration has drawn up plans to improve water flow in the Chathanad creek to improve the rice and fish yields. The three-tier panchayats and the Government departments are likely to be involved in financing the dredging of the creek, the cost of which is estimated at more than Rs. 2 crore.Improving the flow in the creek holds the key to increasing production in the Pokkali fields spread over Vypeen, Kottuvally, Kadamakkudy, Ezhikkara, Varappuzha and other areas.Follow-up work on the application submitted for Geographical Indications registration for Pokkali rice is on.

""In many districts which received less rain, the present entitlement of 100 days under the scheme has been enhanced to 150 days"", the official said.What could hurt the Congress badly would be the widespread perception among rural voters that MGNREGS has been implemented by the AIADMK government.Many of our leaders have failed to highlight MGNREGS for the past several years.

The festering issue can be solved if there is an emphasis on improved technologies for water conveyance, delivery and allocation. In the end, the two States have to live with each other and must forget the bitterness (Karnataka erupts over SC order on Cauvery, Sept. 13).A.J. Rangarajan,ChennaiThe mindless torching of buses and the inciting of youngsters to resort to stone throwing and arson are indicative of a planned and orchestrated affair (TN goes on high alert, SETC stops plying to Karnataka, Arson, violence shut down Bengaluru-Mysuru highway and U.S. issues advisory, all Sept. 13). The violence was allowed to escalate to a level before the police were allowed to act, which is a clear indication of political backing and instigation. The ruling Congress party and the Opposition have to share the blame. All it would have taken was for political leaders to jointly appeal for peace  but it never happened.Sunil Iyengar,BengaluruWith the southwest monsoon turning erratic each passing year, especially in the Malnad belt which is the prime catchment area for the Cauvery, planners need to have a vision for water management. How long can we keep blaming climate change and dwindling forest cover? Leaders across the political spectrum from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu need to meet and get inputs from an impartial technical committee and even foreign experts. Israel has mastered the art of prudent water management. Why not seek its help?H.N. Ramakrishna,BengaluruSeptember 12 is a black day in the history of Karnataka. We have read about anarchy in books, but we witnessed one in practice. It was a field day for lumpen elements to indulge in arson. It is shocking that political leaders have described the Supreme Courts order as unfortunate. The violence had very little to do with the water dispute. The failure on the part of the police department was exceptional and phenomenal. The fact that even the U.S. issued an advisory shows that Bengalurus image has been tarnished.K.R. Jayaprakash Rao,Mysuru.Fringe elements should vent their anger against their respective governments and State political parties for their continuous failure in finding a more dynamic solution. The issue also highlights the inability of the governments concerned to maintain harmony or take stern action against vandalism. Since the hydrological cycle and precipitation are becoming difficult to forecast, the Centre and vulnerable States must invest in global technologies that might help in averting a water crisis.Gowtham G.,Mettupalayam, Tamil NaduThe Ministry of Agriculture must announce a 100 per cent crop insurance scheme to all farmers of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in case they are unable to raise a successful crop because of a lack of Cauvery water. India is prosperous enough to make this assurance. There must also be a scheme to make foodgrains available.K.S. Venkateswaran,ChennaiIt is high time the Central and State governments enact laws to rein in the media which had a field day beaming provocative visuals and advancing their own provocative ideas and opinions. It is a pity that the freedom of speech is misunderstood and misused in order to boost vested interests.V.S. Ganeshan,BengaluruThe Cauvery Water Tribunal should evolve a suitable mechanism for the sharing of water based on different levels at the Krishnaragasagar dam  at buffer water level, 50 feet, 100 ft, 120 ft and and the full height of 125ft. The straightjacketed equation and the formula of sharing water at full-flow (based on which 192 tmc is awarded to Tamil Nadu annually) is not working.A.V. Narayanan,TiruchiThe intensity of the violence in Karnataka especially stems from fears of a water crisis in summer. These are not misplaced. Environmental factors are to blame. The two States need to think of large-scale water management, and, if necessary, build new and larger reservoirs across the State just for drinking water.Thomson Rappai,Ollur, KeralaPolitical parties of both States have chosen to ignore best water-saving management practices. In the Cauvery command areas, unauthorised irrigation for high water consumptive crop like paddy has got out of hand. Command area development authorities, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research supported institutions and agricultural universities have also failed to educate farmers downstream to use research outputs relating to best water management practices. Various experimental stations and projects sites have demonstrated the success of the system of rice intensification method without the use of pesticides. It can lead to water savings of up to 60 per cent. Both States have competent water management experts. The Centre should think in terms of supporting a national project on integrated water resource management in the Cauvery basin with support from an institution such as the Asian Development Bank.N.R. Jagannath,BengaluruPinarayis visionThe article, There is a peoples alternative, by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, read more like a Governors address in the State Assembly highlighting the achievements and ambitions of the elected government. Kerala has not had a stable government for a long time with people voting for the UDF or LDF alternately. Successive governments have done nothing to gain investor confidence and promote the economy of the State. Hartals and political murders have become a way of life in Kerala. While the social security and social justice schemes are laudable, Mr. Vijayan needs to strive hard to achieve comprehensive development.C.R. Ananthanarayanan,BengaluruIt is clear that the Chief Minister is confident even as he has observed that though our finances are limited, we are particular to not let that become a hindrance in achieving our objectives. It can be seen in the disbursement of all pensions in the stipulated time, as proclaimed in the LDF manifesto. His assurances on water transport development are bound to hit hurdles. His silence on action taken against corrupt Ministers and officials is disturbing as the electoral verdict was primarily against corruption and the misdeeds of the UDF. This was missing from the article.B. Prabha,Varkala, KeralaFading NAM?For all his faults, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehrus policy of non-alignment prevented India from being caught in the web of the Cold War. NAM helped many countries to gain a voice at international fora. It may have suffered a setback but it is by no means irrelevant (The Margarita mirror, Sept.13). It can still play an important role on international fora to meet goals in health care, sustainable development, curbing global warming and terrorism. India was one of the main pillars on which NAM stood and the Prime Ministers absence will send out the wrong signals.Akshay Viswanathan,Thiruvananthapuram"

5922db877be9e01fd59ac0f9,1.25 lakh new tube wells may deepen Punjab’s groundwater troubles,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/1-25-lakh-new-tube-wells-may-deepen-punjabs-groundwater-troubles-2842180/,2016-06-09,"Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper. Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper.For over a decade, the Punjab government has been taking steps to save underground water reserves by introducing policies like the Contract Farming (CF) programme (2002), New Agriculture Policy for State (2013) and passing the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act (2009) to divert areas under the water guzzling rice crop towards other kharif crops. However, all efforts of diversion seem to have fallen flat and the area under rice cultivation still remains between 27-28 lakh hectares.Against this backdrop , the governments initiative to pledge nearly 1.25 lakh new tube well connections this year is likely to deal a major blow to the already depleting underground water level.Currently, out of 141 agricultural development blocks in Punjab, 102 fall in the dark zone, where water is 200 ft or deeper.The initiative raises several questions: Is the government not giving farmers a reason to choose rice cultivation by providing free irrigation facility? What is the need of increasing the number when there already exists 12.76 lakh electricity operated and 1.50 lakh diesel operated tube wells for an agricultural land area of 42 lakh hectares, of which around 11 Lakh hectares is irrigated through canal network? Why have the schemes to promote less water consuming kharif crops fallen flat? And , most importantly, why do 11 lakh farmers in Punjab need over 15 lakh tube wells?Around 10,000 new tube wells have already been sanctioned this year and connection for another 5,000 would soon be released. Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has been given the task of installing the new tube wells by the end of this year.KD Chaudhri, chairman-cum-managing director of PSPCL, says that the company is trying to release the new connections as soon as possible. The release of 1.25 lakh tube well connections would cost over Rs 500 crore and the power subsidy in the state would rise to around Rs 6,000 crore, Chaudhri said. In the current year, the state government has already waived off Rs 5,484 crore as power bills of farmers.Each tube well would cost farmers about Rs 2-2.25 lakh with an average of 7.5 to 12 horsepower (HP) motors.The new connections would encourage farmers to go for more paddy cultivation which has an assured market and price, say experts in the states Department of Agriculture, adding that the diversification scheme  aiming to divert area from paddy to other crops  will receive a major setback.Already, the area under cotton in the state has gone down by over 1.5 lakh hectares compared with last years on fears of whitefly attack, and now a major portion of this cotton area may go under paddy. The figures procured from the Department of Agriculture, Punjab, reveal that while the number of electricity-operated tube wells increased from 5 lakh in early 1980s to 12.5 lakh in 2001-02, around 3.25 lakh tube wells were installed in just five years during1996-01 as the state government had announced free power to farmers in 1997. The figures also reveal that the number of diesel-operated tube wells has been more or less same since early 1990s and currently stand at around 1.5 lakh.Manmohan Kalia, an engineer with the Department of Agricultures tube well wing says that a 5 HP motor is installed for irrigating two hectares of land which costs anywhere between Rs 60,000 to Rs 65,000 to farmers. However, farmers mostly go for deeper tube wells due to depleting groundwater, and for that, high-capacity motors of 7.5-12 HP are preferred which cost between Rs 1.5 to 2.5 lakh depending on the depth.Rajesh Vashishth, joint director at the Department of Agricultures hydrology division says that during paddy season, when the rainfall is in deficit, running of 14 lakh tube wells simultaneously puts huge pressure on the ground water of the state that has been witnessing an average level of 200 feet or deeper in major portions of central Punjab which includes the entire Majha, Doaba regions and some districts of Malwa region, including Patiala, Moga, Sangrur etc. (nearly 80 per cent of the state).He admits that over drilling of land is not a healthy trend.In the last 4-5 years, the average fall in groundwater level across the state has been between 1.2 and 25 metres, but in areas like Sangrur district it has been recorded at more than two metres in the past. Even in 2015, five districts (Bathinda, Tarn Taran, Nawanshahr, Sangrur and Mansa) witnessed a drop in water level post-monsoon due to deficient rainfall. Water level has gone down between 1 and 9 metres in these districts in the last 4-5 years.Experts say increasing the number of tube wells would deepen the groundwater crisis as Punjab has hardly received above-normal rain for the past one decade.The state witnessed drought in 2014 as rainfall was (-)50 per cent. Rainfall was deficient in 2012, 2009 and 2007 as well, but farmers saved their crop by running all 14 lakh tube wells, says Vashishth, adding that they had applied for these connections.One should not forget that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) of the US had warned that agriculture output in Punjab and Haryana could collapse if groundwater is extracted ruthlessly, says Amrik Singh, agriculture development officer, Pathankot, adding that even the Central Ground Water Board has been issuing warning to Punjab for many years now.Why is the government highlighting its free power subsidy of over Rs 5,000 crore? Why not promote less water consuming crops and support their marketing with the power subsidy amount, questions Avtar Singh, a farmer from Char Ke village in Jalandhar.The ground water which was available at 60 to 65 feet earlier is now found at 200 feet and every time farmers have to spend more on getting deeper the bores, says Singh. He questions as to what is stopping the government from regulating underground water usage.The government has led the farmer community in a wrong direction by its vote-bank policy, and now the return is difficult, but not impossible if serious efforts are made in a phased manner, says another farmer, Devinder Singh of Adrahman village in Jalandhar, adding that due to overdose of fertilisers and pesticides the ground water has also turned polluted over the years. Another farmer questions the logic behind having a tube well for every two hectares of land. Has our government got any explanation for all this, he quips.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: PTI)SLAMMING THE Trinamool Congress for conducting the lavish swearing-in ceremony at the traffic-heavy Red Road, state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury on Tuesday said the party will boycott the programme and launch a protest movement when Mamata Banerjee takes oath as Chief Minister on Friday.We will not attend the swearing-in ceremony of Mamata Banerjee on Friday. There is no meaning in attending the programme when our partymen are attacked by Trinamool Congress workers in post-poll violence, Chowdhury said at a press conference ahead of a meeting with party MLAs and district presidents here.He questioned the need to spend crores of rupees for the swearing-in ceremony of the new government and said it was in sharp contrast to the severe financial crisis faced by the state. At a time when Bengal has been rated as the number one debt-ridden state in the country and is heading for financial bankruptcy, was there any necessity of a celebration of this magnitude at the cost of the state exchequer?, he asked.Referring to the preparations for the ceremony on Red Road, for which vehicular traffic has been closed on the stretch for at least five days, Chowdhury said, Red Road is the lifeline of the city without which the traffic movement is chocked. The celebration is the orchestration of the ruling partys victory and is a splash of power and grandeur.We are in the process of obtaining permission for a protest movement on May 27, the day when the new government would be sworn in. It will be at the Y Channel in Esplanade, the WBPCC president added.Chowdhury further attacked the state government over the alleged post-poll violence and said the Trinamool should ensure that it keeps the promises it made to the people, riding on which it came back to power. Maintaining law and order should be the top priority at the moment. No investment will come here if potential investors see that the condition here was not conducive enough for investment. Already availability of rice at Rs 2 per kg has been stopped at public distribution centres soon after elections, he said.On who could be the Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly from Congress, which won on 44 of 294 assembly Chowdhury said a list of MLAs along with their detailed CVs has been sent to AICC which will take a decision soon. It is a legislative process and the name would be determined by the central leadership. I think it would be prudent to leave it up to them. I will give my suggestions only I am asked to, but I cant disclose it to the media now, he said.Asked if the Congress would be present at the Left Fronts two-day sit-in on May 25 and 26 at Esplanade in protest against post-poll attacks on its supporters, Chowdhury said, Obviously we will be there After all we are in an alliance.[with PTI inputs]For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

We pray for his family and look forward to the opportunity he has to show what is in his heart when he goes before the nation tomorrow night,"" the Indiana Governor said in a statement.His remarks came after cancelling an appearance scheduled at Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, both of whom had condemned Trump's remarks the day before but stopped short of withdrawing support altogether.Trump, however, put up a defiant show. In an interview to The Wall Street Journal, he said ""there is zero chance I'll quit."" He said the same thing in an interview to The Washington Post, which was the first to release a video of his lewd comments against women.""I never give up. The support I am getting is unbelievable, because Hillary Clinton is a horribly flawed candidate,"" he said. ""I'd never withdraw. I've never withdrawn in my life. No, I'm not quitting. I have tremendous support.""Trump, who has spent his last 24 hours in his Trump Tower in New York with his closest allies, also cancelled his appearance at a rally in Wisconsin.Trump who made a brief appearance before his supporters at the lobby of his Trump Towers would face a confident Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, for the second presidential debate at St Louis on Sunday night.A number of Congressman and Senator yesterday announced that they were withdrawing their endorsement of Trump. Top Republican Senator John McCain announced that he is withdrawing his endorsement of Trump.""Donald Trump's behaviour this week, concluding with the disclosure of his demeaning comments about women and his boasts about sexual assaults, make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy. Cindy, with her strong background in human rights and respect for women fully agrees with me in this,"" McCain said.""Cindy and I will not vote for Donald Trump. I have never voted for a Democratic presidential candidate and we will not vote for Hillary Clinton. We will write in the name of some good conservative Republican who is qualified to be president,"" he said.""Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw,"" former secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in a Facebook post.According to reports, some nine top Republican lawmakers have revoked their endorsement of Trump, while nearly two dozen others have asked him to withdraw from the race.""Donald Trump is wrong about his level of support. He needs to withdraw from the race,"" said Senator Jeff Flake.""Enough is enough. Donald Trump should withdraw in favor of Governor Mike Pence. This election is too important,"" said South Dakota Governor Dennis Daugaard.""If I support him for President, I will be telling my boys that I think it's okay to treat women like objects - and I'll have failed as a dad. Therefore, I can no longer support Donald Trump for President and will not be voting for him or Hillary Clinton,"" said Congressman Tom Rooney.""While I cannot vote for Hillary Clinton, I will not vote for Trump,"" said Utah Governor Gary Herbert.Senator Ron Portman said: ""While I continue to respect those who still support Donald Trump, I can no longer support him. I continue to believe our country cannot afford a Hillary Clinton presidency. I will be voting for Mike Pence for President.""Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal said the Republican National Committee will redirect its funds meant for Trump for other Congressional candidates. Politico reported the party directed a mailing vendor to hold off on all projects related to the Republican National Committee-Trump joint ""Victory"" fund.The backlash came even as Trump's immediate family hoped that people would accept the apology of the real estate mogul, who is now facing the prospect of a humiliating defeat in the November 8 general elections.""The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me,"" his wife Melania Trump said in a rare statement yesterday evening.""This does not represent the man that I know. He has the heart and mind of a leader. I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world,"" Melania said.His son Eric Trump sent an email to his supporters asking them to support his father and help him raise funds.""My father has been preparing for tomorrow night's debate and I know you're going to be proud. To ensure he delivers a tremendous victory for the American people, I will once again hand him a list of supporters who made a contribution in honour of our great movement,"" Eric said.His other son Donald Trump Jr also came out in his support on a day when Trump was facing the worst political crisis of his life, saying: ""These false, negative ads are going to start coming quickly now that there are only 30 days left. And we absolutely need to make sure we are fully funded, or else we wont be able counter each and every one of these false attacks with the truth."""

At the same time I read a number of references to the 2006 race that were, frankly, inaccurate,"" former diplomat Tharoor said in an article today in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post.""While some things have been published, particularly in India, that I have preferred not to respond to out of respect for the conventions of confidentiality, one point is worth clarifying, particularly for readers in East Asia. It is simply untrue that my run for the secretary generalship, as India's official candidate, was scuttled by China,"" he said.His article coincided with the election of former Portuguese prime minister Antonio Guterres as the new UN Secretary General to succeed Ban, the former South Korean Foreign Minister who defeated Tharoor in 2006.Referring to the importance of China's stand towards him before the election, Tharoor said ""this was an obvious concern when the Indian government first mulled my candidacy. I mentioned it myself in my first conversation on the subject with then prime minister Manmohan Singh,"" he said.""Beijing and New Delhi had not seen eye to eye for years over many issues, and there was an increasing perception that Washington, as well as some ASEAN capitals, were seeing newly resurgent India as a plausible counterweight to the overweening (and growing) international prominence of China,"" he said.""Though India firmly disavowed any intention of playing such a role, there was always a possibility that China would see an Indian secretary general nominee as a tool in a broader strategy to cut China down to size on the world stage,"" Tharoor said giving a lengthy account of how he established contact with then Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing.Narrating his meeting with Li in Beijing, Tharoor said ""as the meeting drew to a close, his tone turned grave. He spoke slowly and clearly in English - 'Please convey to your government that China will not stand in your way. China will not stand in your way'. There was only one possible interpretation of these words: China would not use its veto to block me,"" he said.""If China had already made its mind up in favour of another candidate, there was no sign of it. It was obvious to me that my nationality would not render me their preferred choice in the post, but this was a clear message that they would not explicitly oppose me either. It was now up to me to fare better than the other contenders,"" he said.""The foreign minister was as good as his word. When the first 'straw poll' took place at the Security Council in July, Ban led with 12 votes and I was second with 10. One of my 10 votes was China's,"" he said.But at the same ""as we subsequently learned, China had voted positively for all the Asian candidates, including me,"" he said.Pointing his finger at the US, Tharoor said US did not want a strong candidate as UN Secretary General following its tiff with outgoing Secretary General Kofi Annan.""We know the rest of the story from American sources, notably from 'Surrender Is Not An Option', the no-holds-barred memoir published by the then US ambassador to the UN, John Bolton, who disloyally revealed that his instructions from then US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice were 'We don't want a strong secretary general',"" Tharoor said.""Bolton's book confirmed that Wang had voted for all the Asian candidates on the first ballot; China then abstained on my candidacy on subsequent ballots but, as it promised, it never used its veto against me. That was done by the United States, which, Bolton reveals, backed Ban to the hilt and lobbied on his behalf with other Security Council members,"" he said.""The bilateral relationship with (South) Korea, a perception of a lack of conviction on India's part, and the Bush administration's desire not to repeat the Annan experiment of a 'strong' secretary general  combined to ensure the US veto that scuttled my candidacy,"" he said.""It had nothing to do with India's size, India's Security Council aspirations or indeed any political skulduggery at home,"" he said.""Least of all did it have anything to do with China. Even if Beijing, as Bolton's memoir indicates, was quite happy with the outcome, China never did oppose me,"" he said.Touching briefly on the present state of India-China ties, Tharoor said ""current relations between India and China are complicated"".""On the positive side are a burgeoning USD 70 billion in bilateral trade (skewed heavily in China's favour), and promises of increased Chinese investment in India's growing economy, amid a relaxation by the Modi government of restrictions on Chinese involvement in such sectors as ports, power and telecom,"" he said.""On the negative side are the continuing lack of progress in resolving their six-decade border dispute and Chinese diplomatic actions in support of Pakistan. Global geopolitics continues to pit India and China against each other on some issues even as they cooperate on others,"" he said.""It is in the interest of all Asians that the two regional giants should manage their complicated relationship constructively. But there is no reason at all to add to these complications a problem that never existed. Ten years ago, China did not stand in my way,"" he said."

This is our airport!"" at White House staffers as they tried to help American reporters position themselves to film Obama's arrival.The outburst was caught on camera, in an awkward prelude to face-to-face talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his American guest.Both leaders are eager to smooth over their differences and find areas of common cause as they seek to bolster their leadership credentials both abroad and at home.The incident was not a first for China, Obama said during a press briefing with new British Prime Minister Theresa May.""We think it's important that the press have access to the work that we're doing. That they have the ability to answer questions,"" he said, adding ""we don't leave our values and ideals behind when we take these trips.""The differences are also on display in discussions with his Chinese counterpart, he said.""When I bring up issues like human rights, there are some tensions there that perhaps don't take place when President Xi meets with other leaders.""Kerfuffles over press access are common in China, where the ruling Communist Party sees the media more as a tool for forwarding its political agenda than an independent check on governance.The country tightly controls its journalism, regularly censoring reporting on issues it deems sensitive or unflattering.Its approach is particularly apparent in Hangzhou, where a suffocating security presence is designed to avoid any disruption and protect China's large political and financial investment in the summit.Nevertheless, Obama took the tarmac incident in good rumour, noting that the travelling White House juggernaut can be intimidating for any nation.""Part of it is we also have a much bigger footprint than a lot of other countries,"" he said.""We've got a lot of planes, a lot of helicopters, a lot of cars, a lot of guys.

""World should walk on the path of peace that brings happiness and prosperity, while war only brings transient greatness,"" the prime minister said.""The advent of Buddhism from India to Vietnam and the monuments of Vietnam's Hindu Cham temples stand testimony to these bonds,"" Modi said. He said the India-Vietnam ties were 2,000 years old.Modi emphasised that his visit to Vietnam - the first by an Indian premier in 15 years - was to ""nurture a relationship between our two societies and nations."" ""These cultural bonds reflect themselves in many ways. Most prominently, in the connect between Buddhism and the monuments of the Hindu Cham civilization,"" he said.""Some people came here with the objective of war. We came here with a message of peace which has endured,"" Modi said. Modi said Buddhism, which took the sea route, travelled to Vietnam in its purest form from India.He invited all the monks to visit India - the land of Buddha - and especially to Varanasi ""which I represent in the Indian Parliament."" He said he is fortunate to visit the Pagoda temple after first President Rajendra Prasad in 1959.The Quan Su Pagoda, also known as Ambassador's pagoda, is said to have served emissaries that were sent from Champa and Laos to Vietnam in the past. The pagodas - a Buddhist heritage and popular toursit sites - are at the heart of Vietnamese Buddhism and are a precious treasure of Hanoi.The pagoda is said to have served emissaries that were sent from Champa and Laos to Vietnam in the past. Earlier today, Modi visited Ho Chi Minh's stilt house at the majestic presidential palace. He was accompanied by Premier Phuc and thanked him for his generous welcome.""Earlier this morning, you made the special gesture of personally showing me Ho Chi Minh's house... Thank you, Excellency, for extending me the privilege. Let me also congratulate the people of Vietnam on their national day that you celebrated yesterday,"" he said.The stilt house was the residence of Ho Chi Minh from 1958 until his death in 1969 and is located inside the majestic Presidential Palace in Hanoi. Modi also congratulated the people of Vietnam on their national day yesterday and laid a wreath at the Monument of National Heroes and Martyrs of Vietnam located across the Ba Dinh Square, across the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum.""Homage to indomitable will of a leader. PM @narendramodi pays respects at the mausoleum of Ho Chi Minh. Beginning with the memory of Vietnam's Martyrs. PM @narendramodi lays wreath at Monument of National Heroes & Martyrs,"" Swarup said in a series of tweets.Earlier today the prime minister was given a ceremonial welcome at the palace as he became the first Indian prime minister to visit the communist nation in 15 years.""For people of my generation, Vietnam holds a special place in our hearts. The bravery of the Vietnamese people in gaining independence from colonial rule has been a true inspiration. And, your success in national reunification and commitment to nation building reflects the strength of character of your people,"" Modi said.He said India believed in sharing knowledge, experience and expertise with other developing countries.""The Cuu Long Delta Rice Research Institute, is a prime example of the enormous impact of our cooperation.India helped set up the institute in the Mekong Delta, sending agricultural experts and training its faculty in India,"" he added."
59230b007be9e01fceefe69e,'Give them a bloody nose': Xi pressed for stronger South China Sea response,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/561536/give-them-bloody-nose-xi.html,2016-08-01,"BEIJING, Aug 1, 2016, (Reuters): 10:31 ISTChina's leadership is resisting pressure from elements within the military for a more forceful response to an international court ruling against Beijing's claims in the South China Sea, sources said, wary of provoking a clash with the United States.China refused to participate in the case overseen by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.It denounced the emphatic July 12 ruling in favour of the Philippines as a farce that had no legal basis and part of an anti-China plot cooked up in Washington.The ruling has been followed in China by a wave of nationalist sentiment, scattered protests and strongly worded editorials in state media.So far, Beijing has not shown any sign of wanting to take stronger action. Instead, it has called for a peaceful resolution through talks at the same time as promising to defend Chinese territory.But some elements within China's increasingly confident military are pushing for a stronger - potentially armed - response aimed at the United States and its regional allies, according to interviews with four sources with close military and leadership ties.""The People's Liberation Army is ready,"" one source with ties to the military told Reuters.""We should go in and give them a bloody nose like Deng Xiaoping did to Vietnam in 1979,"" the source said, referring to China's brief invasion of Vietnam to punish Hanoi for forcing Beijing's ally the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia.The sources requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.President Xi Jinping has assiduously courted and thoroughly cemented his leadership over the PLA and faces no serious challenges to his command.While he is overseeing sweeping military reforms to improve the PLA's ability to win wars, he has said China needs a stable external environment as it deals with its own development issues, including a slowing economy. And few people expect any significant move ahead of Xi's hosting of a G20 summit in September.But the hardened response to The Hague ruling from some elements of the military increases the risk that any provocative or inadvertent incidents in the South China Sea could escalate into a more serious clash.MILITARY ""HARDENED""Another source with ties to the leadership described the mood in the PLA as hawkish.""The United States will do what it has to do. We will do what we have to do,"" the source said. ""The entire military side has been hardened. It was a huge loss of face,"" he said, declining further comment.Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Yang Yujun, asked whether the PLA was pushing for a stronger response, repeated that the armed forces would resolutely defend China's territory and maritime rights, and peace and stability, while dealing with any threats or challenges.Retired military officers and army-linked academics have pushed home a strongly martial message.""The Chinese military will step up and fight hard and China will never submit to any country on matters of sovereignty,"" Liang Fang, a professor at the military-run National Defence University, wrote on his Weibo microblog about the ruling.It is not clear exactly what steps military hardliners are considering.Much attention has been focused around the potential establishment of an Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) for the South China Sea, which would require international aircraft to identify themselves to Chinese authorities.Other options floated by those linked to the PLA include putting missiles on bombers patrolling the South China Sea capable of hitting targets in the Philippines or Vietnam.Yue Gang, a retired colonel, said China's announcement promising regular air patrols over the region showed it was seeking to deny the U.S. air superiority afforded by aircraft carriers. China should be confident enough to provoke an incident and drive the U.S. out, he added.""China is not intimidated by U.S. carriers and is brave enough to touch off an inadvertent confrontation,"" Yue wrote on his Weibo account.China's military build-up in the region looks set to quicken regardless of any action.""We must make preparations for a long-term fight and take this as a turning point in our South China Sea military strategy,"" Li Jinming of the South China Sea Institute at China's Xiamen University wrote in the Chinese academic journal Southeast Asian Studies.WARY OF CLASHDespite the sabre rattling, there have been no firm military moves that could cause an escalation of tensions. Diplomats and sources said the Chinese leadership was well aware of the dangers of a clash.""They're on the back foot. They're very worried by the international reaction,"" said one senior Beijing-based diplomat, citing conversations with Chinese officials.""They are genuine about wanting to get talks back on track. The leadership will have to think long and hard about where to go next.""Within China's armed forces there is a recognition that China would come off worst in a face-off with the United States.""Our navy cannot take on the Americans. We do not have that level of technology yet. The only people who would suffer would be ordinary Chinese,"" said the source with ties to the military.Those voices appeared to have the upper hand for now, the source said, pointing to a realisation that the 1979 border war with Vietnam did not go as well for China as the propaganda machine would like people to believe.Even setting up an ADIZ, like the one Beijing set up over the East China Sea in 2013 to anger from the United States, Japan and others, would be difficult to enforce given the distance from the mainland.China has repeatedly said it has the right to set up an ADIZ but that the decision depends on the level of threat it faces.A second source with leadership ties put it bluntly: ""War is unlikely"".""But we will continue to conduct military exercises,"" the source said. ""(We) expect U.S. naval vessels to continue to come,"" and ""miscalculation cannot be ruled out"".Foreign Minister Wang Yi has stressed the importance of dialogue, saying it now was the time to return things to the ""right track"" and to ""turn the page"" on the ruling.The United States has responded positively to these overtures, sending U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice to China this week with a call for calm.Washington is also using quiet diplomacy to persuade other regional players not to move aggressively to capitalise on the ruling.China has been angered by U.S. freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, but its forces have responded only by shadowing U.S. vessels and warning them, showing China's unwillingness to goad the U.S. military unnecessarily, according to Western and Asian diplomats.China is also wary of any incident overshadowing the G20 summit in Hangzhou in September, the highlight of this year's diplomatic calendar for Xi when he will be host to the leaders of most of the world's economically most powerful countries, the sources said.The Beijing-based diplomat said it was more likely China would choose the period between the end of the G20 and the U.S. presidential election in November to make any move.""But that is a misjudgement if China thinks the United States will just sit back and do nothing,"" the diplomat said."

He briefly quit politics in 1994 to work for media company Carlton Communications as director of corporate affairs.He concluded his final day as Prime Minister after six years in office today on a light note, exchanging banter with fellow MPs and Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn in the House of Commons."

Images said to be of emaciated residents have appeared widely on social media.At the same time, another convoy began entering two Shi'ite villages, al Foua and Kefraya in the northwestern province of Idlib 300 km (200 miles) away. Rebel fighters in military fatigues and with scarves covering their faces inspected the aid vehicles in the rain before they entered.Madaya is besieged by pro-Syrian government forces, while the two villages in Idlib province are encircled by rebels fighting the Syrian government.A Damascus-based U.N. official who entered Madaya and oversaw the entry of the convoy of 44 trucks gave an eyewitness account of the plight of people in the rebel-held town of around 40,000 people.""We have seen with our own eyes severely malnourished children ... so there is starvation, and I am sure the same is true on the other side in Foua and Kefraya,"" Yacoub El Hillo, U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Syria, told Reuters by phone from Madaya.Women cried out with relief as the first four trucks, carrying the banner of the Syrian Red Crescent crossed into Madaya after sunset, with civilians waiting on the outskirts of the town as the temperature dropped and it began to get dark.The full aid operation was expected to last several days, the ICRC said.Images said to be from Madaya and showing skeletal men with protruding ribcages were published by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a group that monitors the war, while an emaciated baby in a nappy with bulging eyes was shown in other posts.Dr Mohammed Yousef, who heads a local medical team, said 67 people had died either of starvation or lack of medical aid in the last two months, mostly women, children and the elderly.""Look at the grotesque starve-or-surrender tactics the Syrian regime is using right now against its own people. Look at the haunting pictures of civilians, including children - even babies - in Madaya, Syria,"" Samantha Power, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said on Monday.""There are hundreds of thousands of people being deliberately besieged, deliberately starved, right now. And these images, they remind us of World War Two; they shock the conscience. This is what this institution was designed to prevent.""The United Nations said last Thursday the Syrian government had agreed to allow access to the town. The world body is planning to convene peace talks on Jan. 25 in Geneva in an effort to end nearly five years of civil war that have killed more than a quarter of a million people.But Syrian opposition coordinator Riad Hijab accused Russia of killing dozens of children in a bombing raid on Monday and said such action meant the opposition could not negotiate with President Bashar al-Assad's government.There was no immediate comment from Russia, which denies any targeting of civilians in the conflict.WATER AND SALTMadaya residents on the outskirts of the town said they wanted to leave. There was widespread hunger and prices of basic foods such as rice had soared, with some people living off water and salt, they said.One opposition activist has said people were eating leaves and plants.The blockade of Madaya has become a focal issue for Syrian opposition leaders, who told a U.N. envoy last week they would not take part in the proposed talks with the government until it and other sieges were lifted.The siege began six months ago when the Syrian army and its Lebanese ally, Hezbollah, started a campaign to reestablish Assad's control over areas along the Syrian-Lebanese border.Hezbollah responded to accusations it was starving people in Madaya by denying there had been any deaths in the town, and accusing rebel leaders of preventing people from leaving.SIEGE WARFAREBlockades have been a common feature of the civil war. Government forces have besieged rebel-held areas near Damascus for several years and more recently rebel groups have blockaded loyalist areas including al Foua and Kefraya.Aid agencies welcomed Monday's deliveries but called for regular access to besieged areas.""Only a complete end to the six-month old siege and guarantees for sustained aid deliveries alongside humanitarian services will alleviate the crisis in these areas,"" a joint statement from several international agencies said.The areas included in the latest agreement were all part of a local ceasefire deal agreed in September, but implementation has been difficult, with some fighting around Madaya despite the truce.Each side is looking to exert pressure on the other by restricting entry of humanitarian aid, or evacuations, in their areas of control, the Observatory says.The last aid delivery to Madaya, which took place in October, was synchronized with a similar delivery to the two other villages.Aid agencies have warned of widespread starvation in Madaya, where 40,000 people are at risk.Hezbollah has said rebels in the town had taken control of aid, which they were selling to those who could buy. The people of Madaya were being exploited in a propaganda campaign, it said.Syria's National Reconciliation Minister Ali Haidar said on Sunday that rebels had ""disrupted"" the entry of food supplies.""They wanted to escalate it as a humanitarian issue ahead of the Geneva talks,"" he told Al Manar TV.A U.N. commission of inquiry has said siege warfare has been used ""in a ruthlessly coordinated and planned manner"" in Syria, with the aim of ""forcing a population, collectively, to surrender or suffer starvation.""One siege is by the Islamic State group, on government-held areas of the city of Deir al-Zor.A U.N. Security Council on Dec. 18 set out a road map for peace talks calls on the parties to allow aid agencies unhindered access throughout Syria, particularly in besieged and hard-to-reach areas.A newly formed opposition council set up to oversee negotiations has told U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura that this must happen before the talks he plans to hold on Jan. 25.They also told him that before negotiations, Assad's government, which has military support from Russia and Iran, must halt the bombardment of civilian areas and barrel bombing, and release detainees in line with the resolution."

Express At the Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park. ExpressAT THE Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park here, Chirag and Laksh are right now getting a lot of official attention. Chirag, a royal Bengal tigress, and Laksh, a white tiger, have been placed side by side in two big-sized enclosures, separated by one in between.The challenge for Chhatbir Zoo authorities is to bring them closer so that one day they are comfortable sharing the same enclosure.We have been trying to develop affinity between the two. The objective is to expand the tiger population of zoo. This is the animal that visitors like to watch most, said Manish Kumar, director of the zoo.The zoo has one tiger pair already, Aman and Dia. Officials maintain there is a need for another pair. It is not an easy job to develop compatibility between a tiger and tigress. To do so, the zoo authorities have to work for months because every tigers natural instinct is to prevent another tiger from entering its territory.Watch Video: Whats making newsOn bringing a tiger and tigress together, a zoo official explains that first their behaviour is monitored for several days. Sometimes, a tiger may behave violently when he senses the presence of another tiger or tigress close by. But the regular presence of the two in adjoining enclosures could make them tolerate and accept each others presence.We keep some space vacant between the two enclosures housing the tiger and tigress and steadily start moving them to the vacant enclosure by turn to smell each other and for an eye-to-eye contact, a zoo official said. Zoo guards keep watch on the developments. Once big cats get used to each others smell, it does not take much time for an affinity to develop between a male and a female, he said.There is no time limit for compatibility to develop. Sometimes it takes only few days and sometimes it happens in several weeks. And sometimes it does not happen at all, he said.Asked how he rates the chances of compatibility between Chirag and Laksh, the zoo official said: We are keeping our fingers crossed and hopeful of a success. But how much time it will take cannot be said.Monsoon preparation in zooZOO officials are also busy making arrangements for the protection of birds and animals from the possible side effects of monsoon. While there are animals and birds which like rain, others tend to develop various infections due to high level of moisture and humidity.A zoo official said, Polythene sheets have been put on enclosures to avoid any leakage from the shelter during the monsoon period. They also have put dry stone crusher, rice bran, paddy straw and wheat husk to keep the surface dry for herbivore animals and birds.Prolonged monsoon can become a source of infection for the feet of these animals, so these measures become important and act as a preventive measure, said the zoo official.The common ailments during the monsoon include parasite infection, fungal infection, gastro-related problems and foot and mouth diseases. To control some infections, vaccination is done, it is learnt. There can be various other communicable diseases too. During the monsoon season, extra care has to be taken to protect animals and birds from various ailments, claims a zoo official.Mouse deer shelter in the pipelineTHE cheverotain, also known as mouse deer, which was among the new animals that arrived at the zoo in April, will soon have its own shelter. Zoo director Manish Kumar said, The work for an accommodation is in the pipeline and will be put on display once the weather conditions get better and more suitable for their nature.The animal because of its unique appearance and very small size cant be kept in an open shelter like other animals. It can become an easy prey. So a proper cage with full safety measures will be prepared for them, said the director.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It had received Prime Minister Narendra Modis backing last month.Two international Sikh organisations, Akhand Kirtani Jatha and EcoSikh, will organise a four-day Baisakhi mela from April 10 to 13 in various gurdwaras in Amritsar. They will also prepare the langar on all these days using organically farmed ingredients. The event, they hope, will encourage farmers to take natural farming more seriously.We have already procured wheat flour, rice and pulses grown following organic methods. Over 150 farmers from Jalandhar will send their produce a day before the mela at Sewa Singh Hall on Sultanvind road where the langar will be cooked, said Gurjeet Singh, Incharge of EcoSikh from Amritsar said. Daily more than 10,000 people are expected to attend this langar. This is a baby step towards helping farmers in doing marketing of their products as well, he added.We will also have stalls in the hall so that people can be made aware of the benefits of organic farming. They will also be encouraged to make organic langar in community gatherings, said Ibadat Singh, board member, EcoSikh. Akhand Kirtani Jatha will organise eight hours of Kirtan Darbar in various Gurudwaras during the four days.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

So, he set the entire field on fire. He was also joined by the field owner, Mahinder Singh (name changed) as both wanted to clear the straw as soon as possible to prepare the field to sow wheat. Wheat sowing, which has already begun in the state, will continue till November 15.Singh owns 10 acres of land on which he sows wheat, paddy and potato every year. We have harvested paddy a couple of days back and now we are left with less than two weeks to complete wheat sowing for which fields are to be prepared and there is no alternative available with us to remove the stubble. To clear the field for sowing the next crop, we have to burn the straw, he insisted.Government is imposing fine on us but not giving any solution on how to manage the straw. We do not want to spoil the environment as we too live in the same polluted environment, which we create by burning straw, but have no option, said another farmer.Ploughing the stubble costs us around Rs 1,500 per acre which is not viable and the government should support us in clearing the field as the machinery required for stubble management is beyond the reach of more than 70-75 per cent farmers of Punjab, said another farmer, adding that machinery required to manage straw is costly and without government support, it is not possible for majority farmers to use it.Despite the ban on straw burning in the state, one could see a large number of burnt fields and fires every 100-200 metres in Kapur village. It was the same at over two dozen villages in Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts that The Indian Express visited on Thursday.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, which measures stubble burning through satellite images, Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials maintained that it has increased this year.According to agriculture department sources, out of over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw, which Punjab produces annually, nearly half has already been burnt. Around 70-75 per cent (nearly 15 million) of the 20 million straw is burnt to clear land for the next crop.This year, 30.10 lakh hectares are under rice cultivation against 29.75 lakh hectares last year. Now, the burning fields of Punjab have resulted in a dense smog cover over Delhi, for the past couple of days. Incidentally, the National Green Tribunal has summoned Punjab for creating environment pollution not only in the state but up to Delhi thereby resulting in serious health issues in the national capital.PPCB has formed several teams along with officials in every district of the state this year to take action against those burning straw and even booked over 500 farmers. They are being fined Rs 2,500, Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000 for setting on fire two acres, five acres and over five acres, respectively. In Jalandhar alone, around 90 farmers fields have been raided by these teams.Our officials have already raided over 500 farmer units, said PPCB Chairman Manpreet Singh Chatwal.Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, Director of Punjab Agriculture department, said paddy is sown over a huge area in Punjab for which we have to make a large number of machines available to every farmer in the state. Though big farmers can afford to purchase machines on their own, that cannot be expected of the small and marginal farmers. So, the Centre has to help farmers purchase the machines at nominal rates. In Punjab, not more than 10 per cent paddy stubble can be manged with the available machinery. We are also changing the mindset of farmers through Kisan Mela so that they can adopt the new technology, said Bains. Though awareness is increasing, we still have a long way to go, he added.Second generation ethanol production plant in SangrurIndian Oil Corporation, in association with the Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion (PBIP) and the Punjab government, is also going to set up an ethanole plant by using surplus crop residue and other biomass as feedstock. Sangrur district has already been identified as one of the potential locations where surplus biomass is available. And this plant will reduce carbon emission produced by traditional burning of crop residue by farmers, informed Chatwal, adding that a 50-acre plot has already been identified to set up this plant, which will help to manage the straw as well as provide additional income to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The said amount , he said, was the amount incurred towards costs such as transportation cost, labour cost and other costs incurred by the state government while procuring food grains for centre.He said the amount due from the Centre was the result of balance amount due to provisional cost sheet prepared by the FCI and the actual costs incurred by the state.Sandhu said that banks who advanced the CCL to Punjab were taking that pending amount by the centre as the one against the grains stocks in Punjab and hence an impression that stocks were missing.He said out of 90 lakh tonnes of rice, only 50 to 60 thousands of rice were left to be delivered to the Centre.Kairon said a joint committee constituted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and headed by Union Food Ministry Additional Secretary and also comprising Food Secretary Punjab was looking into the matter and a final report was awaited.In its draft report, Kairon said, the committee had agreed to pay Rs 4300 crore towards transportation and labour costs. But we want the money with interest since the amount is pending since 2003, the year since the issue has been hanging fire, Kairon said.Responding to a query, Kairon said he would not go into any political aspect.Out of Rs 26,187 crore, Principal Secretary Sandhu said Rs 8113 crore was the principal amount and remaining Rs 18,074 crore was the interest amount.Kairon and Sandhu said procurement was not at all a profitable proposition and the state found itself at the receiving end while procuring grains for the Centre. For example, Pungrain has no other source of revenue. From where will it pay, if it is paid [by the FCI] less than what it incurred on procurement of grains, Sandhu said.Kairon said the issue relating to CCL would be sorted out in three to four days and payments would be released.On April 18 meeting of banks, he said it was internal meeting of the banks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

PTI Photo Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. PTI PhotoAsking voters in Assam to reject BJP in the Assembly polls, Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said if it came to power, the state will be run from the RSS headquarters in Nagpur or the PMO.He also warned the people that BJP will only stoke violence in the state and end the atmosphere of peace ushered in by Congress.We want everyone should think and should act for ones culture, language and that no one is suppressed in the country. What does BJP want in Assam. First they will come and ask for your votes and then Assam will not be run from here, but will be run from Nagpur or the Prime Ministers Office, he said addressing a poll rally here in Karbi district.Gandhi said wherever BJP has gone it has brought violence and has disturbed peace and cited the example of Haryana where within months of its coming to power there was violence between jats and non-jats.The truth is wherever BJP goes, it tries to make people fight with each other. For example in Haryana, for 10 years there was peace and no violence or anger was there when Congress was in power, but within months of BJP coming to power there was violence and jats and non-jats are fighting with each other.You have seen what has happened in Gujarat. In Bihar they tried to bring violence before polls and in Assam too they are trying to spread violence. They will end the peace that has come here after violence stopped. They dont think about you or Assam, they just want to impose one ideology and thought on the entire country, what RSS people say, he said.Gandhi also accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of making false promises and said the people of Bihar have sent him packing in a direct flight from the state as he failed to fulfil any of the promises made to them during Lok Sabha polls.While BJP wanted one kind of thought to be imposed across the country it was Congress that took everyone along and did not want anyone to be suppressed irrespective of ones religion, caste or area, he said.If one thought is imposed across the country, what will happen to your language, what will happen to your customs, your history. Because this country is not of anyone or one thought, but crores of people of different languages, history live here and this country belongs to all.Attacking the Prime Minister and asking people to reject BJP as they did in Bihar, Gandhi said, the next time Modiji comes to Assam, ask him about the promises he made to you for bringing back black money, tackle price rise, funding of Assam and providing MSP for farmers, ask him as to which promise he has fulfilled.Because this question was posed to him by people of Bihar, as he made a lot of promises during Lok Sabha polls and when he returned during assembly polls a few months later, people of Bihar asked about these promises none of which were honoured and said he is deceiver and decided to teach him a lesson. They sent him packing to Delhi in a direct flight. Now people of Assam also have to do the same.Rahul accused Modi of not fulfilling his promises of bringing back black money, bringing down prices or addressing the plight of farmers and the poor and instead allowing people like Vijay Mallya and Lalit Modi, who possessed black money, to escape from the country.When I asked him in Parliament about his unfulfilled promises, he did not answer me, Gandhi said, asking people to pose these questions to Modi now when he comes to seek their votes.Rahul, however, made a host of promises himself from providing 10 lakh jobs to youth, filling up all vacant government posts, giving jobs to 2 lakh teachers, providing rice at Rs 2 a kilo, cold storage facilities and agriculture banks to farmers and housing for all.Apart from Rs 1,000 crore package announced by Tarun Gogoi, he also promised to open a medical, engineering and nursing college in the area.We make promises and fulfil them. In the last 15 years, Congress party and Tarun Gogoi has worked for you and will work faster in the next 5 years. We will not leave behind anyone, be of any religion, caste or region or place and our government will be of all religions, castes and places and will take everyone along, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

However, the huge crowds at each of these meetings were enough to show that Jayalalithaa Jayaram wasnt facing any strong anti-incumbency wave in this state that hasnt voted back a government in three decades.Eventually, the 68-year-old, who earlier tasted victory in the disproportionate assets case, appeared to have coasted through on the strength of her governments achievements in governance and policy formulations, even if many of these were criticised for being populist.WATCH VIDEO: Elections 2016: Three Reasons Behind Each State VictoryIn contrast, the DMK held hundreds of meetings addressed by M K Stalin, apart from 36 by M Karunanidhi.In her poll rallies, Jayalalithaa would mostly just read out her governments achievements, apart from ridiculing Karunanidhi and the DMK for a brief few minutes in her exact 40-minute speeches.Apart from her governments achievements and sops, what helped Jayalalithaa was the multi-cornered fight, especially the presence of the Vijayakanth-led PWF-TMC alliance that appears to have split DMK votes.WATCH VIDEO: Elections 2016: Big Winners & LosersIn the Gounder-majority Kongu belt and Madurai, where the Thevars are in a majority, the AIADMK did well.Leaders of the socially and politically powerful OBCs hold important portfolios in the AIADMK Cabinet.Social welfare schemes helped Jayalalithaa retain her support among women, who represent more than half of the state electorate, about 2.1 crore voters.Besides, the Jayalalithaa government distributed four goats and a cow to each BPL family, three free sets of uniforms, shoes, bags, notebooks, geometry boxes and pencils to all children in government schools, and cycles to Class 11 students, besides the laptop scheme.Some six lakh women got 4 grams gold each and Rs 50,000 as marriage assistance and 20 kg free rice monthly.A 2015-16 policy note of the Special Programme Implementation Department of Tamil Nadu shows that 5.50 lakh students in the state had benefited from the governments free laptop scheme, costing Rs 1,100 crore. Around 26 lakh school students had gained from the scheme in 2011-16.The scheme of distributing mixies, grinders and fans reached 1.85 crore women. A special provision was made to give induction stoves instead of fans to households in hilly areas such as the Nilgiris, Kodaikanal and Dindigul, where fans are not of much use.

Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons.Tearing into the ruling Trinamool Congress government, BJP national president Amit Shah on Wednesday said the Mamata Banerjee-led dispensation was worse than the previous Left rule.Five years ago people of Bengal voted for a change because it was required to end the 34 years of misrule by the Left. But after five years we see that the TMC government had been worse than the Communist rule. Now they want another change, Shah said while addressing a public rally at Bhawanipur constituency from where Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is contesting.Shah alleged that the only thing that flourished during the TMC rule was syndicate raj, which was directly responsible for the collapse of the Vivekananda Road flyover that had killed 27 persons. He said the Trinamool government could have cancelled the contract for building if, as they said, they were unhappy with the project.The flyover didnt fall down due to wind. It collapsed because of the syndicate. All materials  cement, iron, etc are supplied by Trinamool. The flyover is a symbol of corruption, he alleged.Syndicate is a racket for milking builders in the name of supplying inferior construction materials at a premium by people backed by political parties.Continuing his attack against the Mamata government, Shah said the TMC had changed the names of many central schemes and claimed they were being sponsored by the state government. Jan Dhan Yojana is being touted as a state government scheme as is the Rs 2-per-kg rice for the poor. The fact that the Centre pays a subsidy of Rs 27 a kg of rice is never spoken of, he charged.Further, he said, I dont know what else Mamata is but the whole country knows that she is a great painter whose work had been sold for over Rs 1 crore, likely bought by those involved in the Saradha scam .Slamming the Congress-CPM alliance in West Bengal, Shah said that while Rahul Gandhi and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee were sharing stage here, they were criticising each other in Kerala. It proves that these parties are not for any principles but only for their political interests, to retain their seats, he said.The CPM-Congress poll understanding is not a joth (alliance) but a ghot (nexus). We are waiting to see what these parties do in Rajya Sabha, Shah added.Urging people to vote for Netajis grandnephew Chandra Kumar Bose, who is the BJP candidate from Bhawanipur constituency, Shah said, This is your opportunity to pay tribute to Netaji. Defeating the TMC in this seat can change the whole state as CMs loss at her home turf will send the required message across the state.If voted to power, Shah claimed that BJP would stop infiltration from neighbouring Bangladesh into West Bengal. Neither Trinamool nor CPM stopped infiltration of Bangladeshis to India as it is part of their agenda for creating votebank, he said.The BJP president said the party wants fencing along the porous Indo-Bangladesh border to stop infiltration. If the BJP forms its government here, not even one Bangladeshi can enter India (illegally). That is why we had a border agreement with Bangladesh. We want fencing in the border so that there is no infiltration, he said.Ahead of Shahs speech, BJP national secretary and co-convenor for Bengal Sidharth Nath Singh reiterated his trademark quote Bhaag Mamata Bhaag, and said he has vowed to ensure that Mamata is ousted in this Assembly election.Actor-turned-MP Paresh Rawal, who also shared the stage with Shah, said that similar to the previous UPA government which had let all the agencies loose against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah, Mamata too has conspired against the Opposition here. They hate the Modi government so much that when they got nothing against him, they coined a word called intolerance and instigated student leaders in the conspiracy, he said.Former state BJP president and national secretary Rahul Sinha alleged that Mamata was not taking any action against her party leaders named in the Saradha and Narada sting cases because she would end up in jail.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Gurmeet Singh Farmers sell organic produce directly to customers in Ludhiana. Gurmeet SinghThe union budget has proposed increasing the area under organic farming in the country to five lakh acres in next three years. However, Punjab does not appear to be geared up to take full advantage of the governments initiatives in this regard, given the dismal progress it has made till date.The current certified area under organic farming in Punjab is a negligible 2,000 acres only and nowhere near the target of 3,000 acres set for the end of March 2016, as per data available from Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAICL).Punjabs laidback approach in organic farming, which can bring substantially higher dividends to farmers for their crop, can be gauged from the fact that a much smaller state, Sikkim, which recently declared itself fully organic state, has more than 1.85 lakh acres of area under organic farming.With no scheme of its own till now, the Punjab government depends on Paramparagat Krishi Vighyan Yojna, which was launched by the union government last year to promote organic farming with a budget of Rs 300 crore.Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal had announced in May 2015 that an organic farming Board, solely dedicated to promote chemical free farming in state, would be setup. However, the announcement has remained only on paper and no progress has been made in this regard.Even Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana, which is one of the 20 research centers across India under network project on organic farming of Indian Agricultural and Research Center (ICAR), New Delhi, falls short of expectations in the field of organic farming. It has been a party of the network project since 2004 but has failed to bring out any substantial research since the last 12 years.PAICL officials, however, claim that since past one year, when the state officially started promoting organic farming, it has achieved a lot. We have a separate organic farming cell with 12-15 employees and 5,000 organic farmers are in touch with us. We have tied up with a German firm to get certification of organic farms for farmers. We are clustering them under Paramgararat Krishi Yojana of the center. We procured 400 tons of organic wheat 400 tons and 250 tons of rice for the first time this year and also helped farmers in marketing them, said KS Pannu, Managing Director, PAICL.Pannu also said that work on the composition of advisory board announced by CM is also under progress.CS Aulakh, a senior agronomist from PAU and author of a book, Organic Farming: Prospects and Constraints in Punjab, said that the biggest constraint is the non-availability of the organic manure for the farmers required for the procedure.It takes minimum three years for a farm to be completely organic. But we have insufficient organic manure which comes from animal and agriculture waste. Farmers would need to keep more animals if we want organic manure to provide similar amount of nutrients to the crop as it gets through chemical laden fertilizers. Another constraint is lack of response from market. Farmers do not adopt organic farming when produce is not sold. There is no organized markets for organic products, said Aulakh.Umendra Dutt, Director, Kheti Viraasat Mission and member of national task force on organic farming said Punjab stands way behind when it comes to organic farming. There has been no clear-cut policy to promote organic farming in Punjab, either from state department or PunjabAgro. PAU is still conducting research on the lines of green revolution which led to degradation of Punjabs soil and overuse of water and fertilizers. Punjab which was pioneer in every agricultural aspect stands the most backward in organic farming, he concluded.It is only due to the efforts of NGOs, individuals and farmers groups that a few Kisan Huts (shops that directly sell organic fruit and vegetables, without involving middlemen) were started in districts like Hoshiarpur, Mansa, Ludhiana without any support from the government. Farmers allege officials ask for bribes when approached for certification for their organic farms.Most organic farmers have not got certification. It is because bribes are demanded openly. This is the reason why there are no accurate number on how much area is under organic cultivation in Punjab. It is the lack of trust and communication between Punjab Agro and farmers, said Harnek Singh, a farmer.Despite the lack of state patronage, the concept of organic farming is being given a boost by self motivated individuals who are making the maximum of what is on offer. According to Joga Singh, project officer, Skill Training Center, Guru Nanak Dev Polytechnic College, who recently hosted a direct selling fair for farmers said, There is a scheme called Community Development Through Polytechnics (CDTP) offered by HRD Ministry to promote organic farmers and help them in selling their produce directly to the customers. I decided to use this scheme and host farmers. We offered them free of cost platform to sell their products and response was overwhelming. Such schemes need to be optimized well to help farmers, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

When my friends from here taste our dishes, their reaction is wow. They really love it. We have invited a few to the fest and they will have one hell of a feast, she said.In another corner, Derrick Kharkrang from Meghalaya was busy setting up his food stall. Apart from traditional Khasi (a tribe in Meghalaya) dishes such as janeiong, rice with sesame seeds and beef roast, what attracted attention was the people serving food in their traditional dresses. It feels good to be around people of the region, he said. It feels as if I am at home.There was representation from almost all states of the region, with 17 girls taking part in the beauty pageant and almost all seven states in the food fest. Two rock bands made the people groove to their beat.A number of locals who were at the fest relished every bit of the food, fashion and music. A hardcore foodie, Danston John, a local who was at the fest, gorged on chicken rice porridge, a traditional dish from Mizoram, and washed it down with tamarind juice.

Restaurants, pubs and bars will now have the option to run their businesses longer, something which they were allowed to do only in the weekends so far. But does Bengalureans have the enthusiasm to keep the party going all night?Hangover, a bar and diner in Indiranagar, has seized the opportunity, deciding to remain open for business till 12.30 am daily. Desmond Rice, Managing Partner, explains, By keeping the place open for one extra hour, our average daily revenue has increased by five per cent and we are expecting it to go up to at least 7.5 per cent.The customers are happy because even if they come in late, they have enough time to relax and enjoy their food and drinks. Rice ensures that the last orders are placed by 12.30 am so that he can clear the resto-bar by the deadline, 1 am.Ankit Aggarwals Tippler on the Roof has also been seeing a good number of people coming in on weekdays. Most guests on weekdays are from the IT crowd, above the age of 25 or so. Earlier, when we had to close by 11.30 pm, it didnt give them enough time to go out for a drink after work, says Ankit.What surprises Ankit is that with the extended deadline, his business has seen a marked improvement on Tuesdays, earlier considered a slow day. I have events and offers from Wednesday to Sunday. If the crowd on Tuesday continues to be good, I may consider organising laidback live acoustic music.Overstaying guestsToit, a well-known brewery on Indiranagar 100ft road, notorious for being impossible to get a table without reservation, is not too excited about the extended deadline. A senior in the management who did not wish to be named, explained why. By keeping it open till 12.30 am, we wont be getting new guests. The ones who are already inside will just stay longer. It will be taxing on our staff too who will get back home even later. He adds that they have not taken a call on the matter yet and would have to discuss the costs and benefits of staying open an hour longer.Other players in the market are unsure if the pub-goers, too used to turning in early, will show up for drinks and dinner on weekdays. Karthik Reddy, HR Manager of Jimis Beer Cafe, says they are closing at 11.30 pm as usual. On an experimental basis, the outlet in Koramangala is being kept open. The response there has been quite good. The management will make a decision after three to four months by which time people will get used to nightlife on weekdays.As for the pub-crawlers and party-goers, they agree that it will take them a few months to tweak their body clocks. Amarendra Singh, CEO of an advertising firm, says: It certainly is a boon for people who always complain that Bengaluru is boring because it goes to sleep earlier than other metros such as Mumbai and Delhi. However, it will take us time to get accustomed to waking up for work after a night out. He thinks that youngsters will be most delighted by the extension.Excited college studentsAmarendras guess is quite right. It is the young college-going crowd which is most excited about the extension. Preetam Ganj, in the final year of degree college, says, I am very thrilled because usually, pubs close just when the party is at its peak and we have to go to someones house for an after party.Though the new deadline is applicable to restaurants too, they are not too keen on keeping their outlets running beyond 11.30 pm. Vijay Kumar, Manager of Rayalaseema Ruchulu, a restaurant which offers cuisines of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, says,  Right now, we are open only till 11.30pm every night, irrespective of the day. We are discussing a proposal to remain open till 12.30 am on weekends.They are concerned about the possibility of getting unruly crowds if they remain open late. The area manager of an outlet of California Pizza Kitchen feels that most people who stay out late will be going to pubs or bars and their business is not likely to be benefitted if they extend their hours."

Mohan Kumar, who had come from Hubballi along with his father, said: We came to Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday morning thinking that we would get tickets. I waited at the venue till 4.30 pm hoping to hear good news. I was desperate to catch the action live as my favourite team RCB is in the final. But I am disappointed.Venkat, (name changed on request), who came all the way from Kerala to watch the all-important game, said that he has spent over Rs 40,000 for travelling and hotel booking. The stadium management told me that tickets were sold three days back. Having spent so much money, I wish to explore Bengaluru, at least.Sweltering heat didnt prevent Sandeep B, an IT professional and an avid cricket fan, from standing in queue for a ticket to final. When I visited the stadium to get tickets for finals on May 20, I was told to come after May 25. I couldnt come on Wednesday as I was busy with the work. I came here today (Saturday) only to find match tickets were sold out, he added. Many disheartened fans were seen asking security guys and the officials Do you have ticket for IPL final A few cricket fans are still hopeful of getting a ticket to final, One of my friends has managed to get bulk tickets and I am hoping to get one for Sundays final, said Samarchitha S, a student.Now then, heres some good news for those who have failed to get ticket to final. They can experience an ambience close to the one seen at Chinnaswamy Stadium during IPL matches at one of those pubs or restaurants with giant screens. They can head to one of the several pubs and restaurants in the city, more so in Central Business district, to watch Virat Kohlis boys with Warners men battle for the silverware on big LED screens with motely crowd.Beyond the boundaryIPL T20 matches in the city are the harbingers of all good things for vendors, autodrivers, cabbies. Most of them do brisk business when the IPL caravan returns to the city.

We will keep the outlet open till midnight on Sunday, he added.Street vendors have reasons to dread IPL matches in the city.

When asked about the reason behind starting this initiative, Bismi Anil said, Being a puppy mill product, the pet we got started having his own share of health issues once he became an adult. Some of these issues made him a fussy eater.I started packing the leftover food and throwing it to one malnourished pup on my way to work, who started waiting for me everyday. One day, when Anil was coming back from office, he noticed a deformed dog dragging her way through our lane. Wanting to rescue it, we started feeding her. Slowly, the rest of her gang joined. We started feeding them and treated them of their ailments. Observing the behavioural and health changes one meal brought out in them, we started looking at weak dogs around our home and started feeding them, she added.The couple feed around 120-140 dogs in a 10 km radius of Whitefield every night. Initially, it was leftover dog or human food but as the numbers increased and we also felt they need at least one nutritious meal, we started cooking for them. We give them rice, chicken bones, mutton fat with turmeric, all cooked together. Veggies are not regular but added them whenever possible, said Bismi.Talking about the feeding process, she said, In case of emergencies and when cooking cannot be done, they are fed dry dog food. Each area has some volunteers who help in emergencies. Friends also step in at such times. We feed them only six days a week so that they dont become completely dependent on us and forget their original food source, even though it may be garbage.They also look after the dogs medical needs by getting them sterilised and vaccinated.Good meal for Rs 15Bismi, speaking about the expenses, said, The cost of feeding one dog a good meal a day comes around Rs 15. We need about 17 kgs of rice and seven kgs of chicken, mutton fat everyday. They have a registered trust and donors can contribute to Dumas Animal Welfare Trust. For details, visit Dumas Animal Welfare Trust page on Facebook.The couple also attend rescue cases outside their feeding gang, work on re-homing abandoned dogs, conduct awareness sessions within communities on how to coexist and help communities to sterilise dogs."

The couples son Dheeraj, the prime accused, had hired a gang of five from Bengaluru to murder his parents, Additional SP G B Manjunath told reporters at a press meet here on Friday.The police have arrested Anand and his accomplices R S Harish, Chandramouli, Ravi and Ramachandrareddy, all residents of Bengaluru, in connection with the murder.During questioning, Dheeraj told the police that he had an affair with a Tumakuru-based girl belonging to a different caste. He wanted to marry her, but his parents had opposed the inter-caste marriage. His father Gopal Shetty threatened to consume poison if he went ahead with his plan.Dheeraj, hell-bent on marrying the girl, hatched a conspiracy to kill his parents. He hired Anand and his associates to execute his plan, Manjunath said.Anand and four others had given a bottle containing poison to Dheeraj and told him to lace the food with it and give it to his parents. But he dropped the idea as he thought the smell of the poison would give away the plan.Dheeraj and the gang of five then hatched a plan to hack the couple to death. They closed the deal for Rs 9 lakh. As agreed, Dheeraj gave the first instalment of Rs 5 lakh after the gang executed the murder, the police officer said.The police recovered a Toyota Fortuner car and an imported car worth Rs 20 lakh, which was gifted to Dheeraj by his father on his birthday, two daggers and Rs 1.5 lakh in cash from the arrested.

Sadly, there is no talk of issues as basic as sanitary pads for women.This focus on the social disconnect, as highlighted by Magsaysay Award winner and Goonj founder Anshu Gupta, was what made the opening day of the Changemaker Week 2016 stand out.The event was formally kicked off at the St Josephs College of Arts and Science here on Monday. Arranged by the Ashoka Innovators for Public, the Week is supported by Deccan Herald.Critiquing the system, Gupta said how, even to this day, a majority of women in rural areas used anything but sanitary napkins, simply because there was none available.There is absolutely no discussion about this in the country. Some of the things women use are dirty cloth, ash, used papers, rice husk and even cow dung. While there are primary health centres (PHC) in rural areas, we all know their condition, he said.In her address, Teach for India founder Shaheen Mistry talked about Indias youth, the ones set to take the reins of its future are still grossly uneducated. As much as four per cent of children never start their schooling and around 50 per cent never even complete their basic school education.Shaheens initiative, however, aims to change things. Already, there have a number of bright spots since they started nearly 10 years ago.Mistry drew attention to the inspiring journey of Jyothi Reddy, a slum dweller from Mumbai. Reddy was shown in a video, speaking in flawless English at the TEDx Nariman Point event in Mumbai in 2011, recounting her journey in her own words: I am a slum dweller but education sets me apart. I chose education over marriage and over dependency, she said.But Reddy is just one among many. Over a thousand Teach for India Fellows work in various remote corners of the country not as teachers but also as people trying to bring about equity in education, said Mistry. Inaugurating the Changemaker Week, Arghayam founder Rohini Nilekani said, If we want a society without inequalities where everyone contributes, we have to begin with ourselves. What binds us together is our ability to empathise. We are absolutely designed to be altruistic. But we have lost it somewhere.Responding to an audience query, she voiced her support for free access to the Internet, free of any big corporate positioning. In an indirect reference to the Free Basics initiative of Facebook, Nilekani said free Internet access was as basic as getting freedrinking water."

The statistics of poha consumption here are Bradmanesque.When they arent busy swallowing spoonfuls of their beloved treat  which is slightly sweeter than the type you find in Maharashtra and is laced with sev and other add-ons that include dry fruits and rogue pieces of pomegranate  theyre raving about it.The gushings on food are comparable only to the effusions on the other love  cricket. CK Nayudus city still boasts the cricketing swagger when the sport gets incessantly discussed.History and food is what Indore thrives on. And they are both decorated and celebrated with equal vigour. And theres no shortage of people to wax eloquent about the citys royal and culinary pursuits. If youve heard of Indore then youve definitely heard of Sarafa  the jewellery centre that transforms into the only food bazaar in the country that never sleeps  initially a security venture for all the gold and silver but later as the food identity of the whole of Madhya Pradesh. Then theres Chappan Dukan, which true to its name, is a series of 56 shops selling Indores finest street food though some of the items tarnish the exoticism of the place, pasta alfredo and Manchurian, in particular. And its at Madhura, the most popular of the shops at Chappan that you start your journey with a bowl of what else but poha with close to 50 around you doing the same. And its just 7.30 am.The connection between food and history doesnt end there. You find it of all places inside the canteen at the Holkar Stadium. Cricket being as much a part of Indores history as any part of the country, its apt that the venue that hosts the first ever Test in the city is named after the rulers of the erstwhile princely state. The Holkars had their own Ranji Trophy team in the 1940s, which won the title on four occasions between 1946 and 1953 no less. It doesnt end there. The first captain, CK Nayudu, came from Indore and so did the first Indian to face a ball in Test cricket-Janardan Navle  and the first batsman to score a century overseas, Syed Mushtaq Ali.Padmanabh Rao Guddu was never a cricketer. But he is still very much a part of Indores cricketing folklore. For, hes the only man whos been present for every international match that the city has hosted to date  both at the Nehru Stadium and over here.Guddu has owned and run the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA) canteen at both venues from 1978. Its a family business that he took over from his father Narayan Rao, who came here from Mangalore, and catered to the likes of Mushtaq Ali among others. But according to Guddu, even some of the slightly more contemporary Indian cricket luminaries got a fair taste, literally, of Indore long before they became stars.You just have to look at the picture that hangs proudly on the wall behind Guddu, who rarely moves from his spot behind the counter. Its a sepia-hued image of a bunch of fresh-faced teenagers with two faces encircled. You dont have to even ask before Guddu starts recalling the summer of 1985-86 season and the tough time he had with one diminutive cricket aspirant.Sachin (Tendulkar) would come in and start throwing all the lemons at the other boys. Or on days when there was mutton, he would chew the piece up to the bone and start throwing it at the others. He was a menace, Guddu recalls, still shaking his head. When he couldnt take the indiscipline, as he puts it, anymore a complaint was lodged with manager Vasu Paranjpe, who had organized the under-14 camp. Arey yeh chhotu hai na, ek din India ka sabse bada star banega dekh lena, is the response he got. Guddu was made to admit his lack of foresight by Paranjpe when Tendulkar scored a century in an ODI against Australia in 2001.Its the Ganguly brothers, Sourav and Snehasish, though that Guddu remembers more fondly. They were from a rich family and back then paid Rs 17,000 and came here in a flight via Bombay. Their grandfather accompanied them and wasnt happy with the lodging facilities at Nehru stadium. But he was asked by the secretary to not interfere, he recalls. To make sure that the boys didnt feel out of place, Guddu would take them on his newly-purchased moped to a Bengali sweet shop for sandhesh. Last year Ganguly was called to Indore as a chief guest by the MPCA and he made it a point to seek out Guddu and tell the people gathered about the wonderful hospitality hed been shown by this complete stranger three decades ago.Guddus narrative is interrupted constantly though. For, theres a stream of cameramen and handymen walking in and claiming to have been asked by their respective bosses to have lunch at the canteen. And he has to repeatedly ward off the unexpected requests and turn them down.The average Indorean can have poha for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The average Indorean can have poha for breakfast, lunch and dinner.Three days remain for Indore to brace up for a new chapter in its otherwise truncated cricketing folklore. Test cricket is on its way but the Indian and New Zealand teams will only be arriving later that evening. Not that the close-to-hundred locals who have shown up outside the stadium are aware of the teams travel plans yet.When is the team coming for training bhayya? asks one kid tucking his backpack under his armpit. Its obvious that a classroom somewhere nearby has a few benches without any suitors, one of them being the slender youngster who now has moved on to the next person he sees with an accreditation card around his neck with a request for passes. Tickets have been selling like hot cakes, or lets say bowls of poha, ever since New Zealands Test tour schedule was announced a few months back. And there are barely a 1000 left and the match only starts on Saturday.Youre then told by another college kid whose classes have conveniently finished early on this Wednesday about some of the other hangers-on in the crowd. The people of Indore take life easy. Nothing starts before 11 here, even the coffee shops. And there are more people in this city who have nothing much to do during the day than in the whole of Madhya Pradesh, he tells you. But theres no malice in what he says. You realize the people of Indore love to talk up the city, even its sluggishness.But the BCCIs recognition last year of Indore as a Test venue finally was only a small part of the image makeover that the fastest growing city in the subcontinent has been experiencing in recent times. In some parts, unfortunately, its started taking the moniker of mini-Mumbai a bit too seriously especially in terms of the towers that have started appearing in the midst of the otherwise archaic landscape. Its apparent in the attitudes of the young generation too. Youre soon approached by a young biker who has only request for you. Can you please suggest what pills or shampoo I can use to grow my hair that long? When asked about his reasons for the highly cumbersome exercise, pat comes the reply. Indore mein bhi aaj kal style ka zamaana hai bhayya.The gully were on  the one you take to approach the main gate of the Holkar Stadium  incidentally is where the pitch used to be when cricket was played in the golden days of the Holkar empire.The Yeshwant Club, named after the last king of the dynasty  Yeshwantrao Holkar  is located on the road adjacent to the stadium behind where the Tennis Association building stands today. Back in the day, the entire area belonged to the royal family. And it is here that the likes of Nayudu and Ali would hold audiences and their senses to ransom with their scintillating strokeplay. Ali in particular was the Virender Sehwag of his day or as the great Keith Miller referred to him, the Errol Flynn of the cricket world.You meet Syed Gulrez Ali, son of the late Mushtaq, outside the tennis courts of the Yeshwant Club. Gulrez was an all-rounder who bowled left-arm spin and represented Madhya Pradesh in 74 matches in a career that spanned 20 years from 1964-85.His mornings through the week are spent here playing tennis with the likes of veteran cricket administrator Sanjay Jagdale and others talking about the good old days.He speaks about his Papa with the same awe as the rest of the cricket world has always done. But Gulrez insists that he can never start talking about his father before mentioning Col Nayudu.They use the term tuning a lot in Indore. Its supposed to mean two people being on the same wavelength. And as Gulrez puts it you couldnt have found two people jiski tuning ek jaisi thi like the two names that are synonymous with Indore.To the extent that when Sushil Doshi-the veteran radio voice of Indian cricket on whose name the commentary box at Holkar Stadium is called-on his first visit to Australia was asked which city he came from and he said Indore, his counterpart immediately replied, Oh the land of Nayudu and Mushtaq. But as Gulrez tells you his dad might not have taken to cricket if not for Nayudu, who played a father-figure to Mushtaq.We were just lucky to be neighbours. Tukoji Rao Holkar built a team by signing up players from outside like Nayudu sahib and others. It was like building an IPL team for him. And every morning the Colonel would ride his scooter past our house greeting my grandfather. One day he noticed my dad playing cricket on a nearby ground and the next day he wanted him, even though he was just 16, to come to Hyderabad with him, says Gulrez. The rest as they say is well-publicized history. That chance meeting in many ways set off a chain of events that made Indore the first breeding ground of cricket superstars in India.Gulrez is carrying a heavy album with him, one that was maintained by his late father, who passed away in 2005. It is a window into a fantasy land of cricketing legacy and has pictures of the whos who of the sports Hall of Fame, many of them being dwarfed by the towering Mushtaq. It also contains pictures of all his fans that ranged from Bollywood stars Ashok Kumar, Johnny Lever to Madhubala and also future Pakistan prime-minister Zulfiqur Ali Bhutto.They simply loved him. One day KL Saigal the great singer turned up at CCI, in rather high spirits, to see Papa bat. He had already gotten out though. But Saigal sahib kept insisting that since he had come all the way to see him bat he would convince the umpires to give him a second chance before being asked to calm down, says Gulrez, his wide frame bouncing with his laughter. Papa always stayed with Bhutto whenever he went to Bombay. During partition, Yeshwantrao Holkar kept my entire family in the palace for a month so that we were safe. Bhutto kept asking my father to come to Pakistan promising him any position he pleased. But Papa said hell never leave his Hindustan, Indore or his fans, he adds.The fans and their love were the teetotalling Mushtaqs intoxicants and Gulrez insists that his Papa would have scored many more centuries had he played for himself like many batsmen of that period.He was the only batsman who would charge down and stand pretty much at half-crease while facing a fast bowler.He started playing T20 shots 70 years in advance. When he scored his century in Manchester, the English were sniggering at the start when he started hitting balls from off-stump to midwicket. Then suddenly he was in the 90s and they realized that he was redefining batting, he says. Gulrez adds that his father was a style icon back then and all his teammates would come to his room to indulge in his collection of perfumes.The joke in later years was that if ODI cricket had existed back then, Papa and Vijay Merchant would have opened with Lala Amarnath padded up. The rest of the team could have gone to Connaught Place to shop, he says with a guffaw.It was Nayudus brutal assault on the MCC bowlers at CCI in 1926 that paved the way for India to get Test recognition.And though the second World War didnt allow mentor and protg to play much cricket together, they remained great friends before Nayudu passed away in 1967. The two now are side by side at the Holkar Stadium with the two pavilions rightfully named after Indores famous sons. To their credit the MPCA has ensured that one side of the ground is dedicated to all the other stalwarts who won titles during the Holkar Era.His greatest regret was not seeing Madhya Pradesh win a Ranji title. We came closest in 1998-99 when Abbas my son was the main batsman and we lost agonizingly to Karnataka, says Gulrez.Ironically, Mushtaq was also the last player from Madhya Bharat to represent India before Narendra Hirwani shocked the world with 16 wickets on Test debut in 1988. Guddu for one can never forget that dream debut.Hiru had come to Indore in 1985 as this rotund Sindhi boy with specs. Because he was an outsider we kept him at our house and we grew up like brothers. The day before his debut I called Taj Coromandel and said only one thing, Get Viv Richards out. He did it in both innings, says Guddu almost jumping out his seat.Like with most things in Indore, every event has a multitude of additional anecdotes attached to them. Take the Holkar Stadium. Once Usharaje Holkar, daughter of Yeshwantro, decided to gift one part of the land to the MPCA, they converted the open space into a cricket ground. Even the likes of Tendulkar have come and practiced here back in the day when there was dump on one side and cows grazing on the other. It was only at the turn of the century that the MPCA decided to construct a spanking new stadium. And though they havent always had their own homegrown stars to cheer for, the Indoreans havent left their traditional interest and knowledge of the game slip. Cricket coverage is vast and extensive in the large number of newspapers, both English and vernacular. Visiting journalists are constantly prodded with doubts and even interview requests. Thousands have turned up to see the teams practice. Even the Kiwis were surprised to find close to 500 for their nets. Now theyll get a chance to soak in their own maiden experience of Test cricket, a format that two folk heroes from their own land helped popularize in a country still looking for its own identity under the colonial rule.So much so that, even the otherwise reticent Guddu is excited. He takes pride in not having watched a single ball live at either ground despite his envious work location  he has not left the canteen premises during matches.India and West Indies played the first ODI in Indore and I got to see and meet heroes, from Clive Lloyd to Richards to Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. Id got my hearts worth and never felt the urge to see anymore, he explains. But as Indore readies to add a new chapter to its fabled history  not to forget the supplementary narratives that will emerge from it Guddu is thinking of breaking his self-imposed exile.He says, Ok fine its Test cricket after all. I might actually go and see a ball or two.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

Sadly, there is no talk of issues as basic as sanitary pads for women.This focus on the social disconnect, as highlighted by Magsaysay Award winner and Goonj founder Anshu Gupta, was what made the opening day of the Changemaker Week 2016 stand out.The event was formally kicked off at the St Josephs College of Arts and Science here on Monday. Arranged by the Ashoka Innovators for Public, the Week is supported by Deccan Herald.Critiquing the system, Gupta said how, even to this day, a majority of women in rural areas used anything but sanitary napkins, simply because there was none available. There is absolutely no discussion about this in the country. Some of the things women use are dirty cloth, ash, used papers, rice husk and even cow dung. While there are primary health centres (PHC) in rural areas, we all know their condition, he said.In her address, Teach for India founder Shaheen Mistry talked about Indias youth, the ones set to take the reins of its future are still grossly uneducated. As much as four per cent of children never start their schooling and around 50 per cent never even complete their basic school education. Shaheens initiative, however, aims to change things. Already, there have a number of bright spots since they started nearly 10 years ago.Mistry drew attention to the inspiring journey of Jyothi Reddy, a slum dweller from Mumbai. Reddy was shown in a video, speaking in flawless English at the TEDx Nariman Point event in Mumbai in 2011, recounting her journey in her own words: I am a slum dweller but education sets me apart. I chose education over marriage and over dependency, she said.But Reddy is just one among many. Over a thousand Teach for India Fellows work in various remote corners of the country not as teachers but also as people trying to bring about equity in education, said Mistry. Inaugurating the Changemaker Week, Arghayam founder Rohini Nilekani said, If we want a society without inequalities where everyone contributes, we have to begin with ourselves. What binds us together is our ability to empathise. We are absolutely designed to be altruistic. But we have lost it somewhere.Responding to an audience query, she voiced her support for free access to the Internet, free of any big corporate positioning. In an indirect reference to the Free Basics initiative of Facebook, Nilekani said free Internet access was as basic as getting free drinkingwater."

If we look at the present health condition of the majority of people, the population growth in the country will add only to human misery.The Global Nutrition Report 2016 ranks India at 114 out of 132 countries in stunted growth. Stunting in India is at 38.7% compared with Germany (1.3%) and Chile (1.8%). It ranks 170 out of 185 countries in prevalence of anaemia among 48.1% of women in their reproductive age. India is home to one third of worlds malnourished children. In Global Hunger Index 2014, India ranks 120th among 128 developing countries.Its an irony that India, with 20 agro-ecological regions and 60 sub-zones which produce the worlds largest variety of crops, fails to meet the nutritional needs of its people. It is one among the 17 countries which have nearly 70% of the worlds biodiversity. The worlds largest variety of aquatic food is found here. Though nature has blessed India with the widest range of food, it has depleted its backup due to ignorance, mismanagement and infatuation with foreign development concepts.In the 1970s, US official William Gaud coined the word green revolution which propagated the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides. In the 1960s and 1970s, Indian farmers were persuaded to use chemical inputs to increase their productivity and in the process lost much of their edible herbs and shrubs which once served as food backup in drought situation. Continuous loss of buffer food stock resulted in severe drought situation in 2016 which affected 330 million people across 10 states.Excessive use of chemical fertilisers, insecticides, weedicide, pesticides and unscientific farm mechanisation erode away 5,334 million tonnes of precious top soil every year. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) found the non-judicious and imbalanced use of inorganic fertilisers has adversely affected the soil fertility which let disappear many edible plant species.Over the years, the aquatic food has depleted very fast. The International Union for Conservation of Nature listed 39 species from Kerala as endangered which include the Periyar Latia, Nilgiri Danio, Cardamom Garra, Periyar Garra and Anamalai Sucker Catfish. Over-damming of rivers and the use of advanced deep sea fishing technology maximises profit for traders and makes protein-rich aquatic food costly for general public.Small and marginal farms still cover about 85% of the operational land holdings and 44% of the total cultivated area in the country. Dedicated agricultural research, proper input management, quality extension services, transparent marketing facility and combined bargaining power of farmers can only restore the food back up. Gone are the days when small and marginal farmers preserved the crop diversity which once met the nutritional need of the people.Change in food habits also causes nutrition loss among the people. The protein rich korak-kan kali, methi ragi roti, the angaya podi, sesame rice of south India, the energetic dal bati churma of Rajasthan specially made for Rajput soldiers, rice and flattened rice with red husk containing rich fibre, vitamin B1 and B2, iron and calcium, the highly nutritious pakhal bhaat, mandia jau, chuda-dahi, chhatua, palua of Odisha and hundreds of other nutrition-rich indigenous foods of different states are no longer eaten by the new generation.Junk foodEntry of fast and junk food, sedentary lifestyle, disappearance of playgrounds and stressful urban life reflect on peoples health. Peoples loss of interest in labour intensive economic activities like agriculture, horticulture, animal rearing, handloom and fishery etc also attributes to health crisis.According to the Global Status Report on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD)-2014, NCDs contributed to 5.8 million deaths accounting for 60% of all deaths in India. Major NCD diseases include: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes due to unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol use etc.Indians poor health reflects in their performance in the Oly-mpic Games. Norman Pritchard represented India in 1900 Oly-mpic alone and won two silver medals. After 116 years, in Rio, a 118-member Indian contingent won a lone silver and a bronze. The performance in the Games speaks a lot about the countrys honesty, discipline, strength, stamina, endurance, motivation level and, above all, patriotism.Though India is top producer of milk, livestock, fish and the second largest producer of fruit, vegetables, rice, wheat and sugarcane in the world, the per capita consumption is very low. The National Sample Survey Organisation figures found continuous rise in the prices of rice in the open market has forced households to lower their consumption. Price rise in basic amenities compels people to save on food.Food adulteration is one of the reasons why India has the largest number of people in the world with organ failure. Union Health Minister J P Nadda fou-nd 18% of the food samples tested in the past three years were adulterated. Adulterated samp-les went up to 19.9% in 2014-15 from 18.8% in 2013-14. It is high time the government addresses Indias looming health crisis."
5923bbe27be9e01fcef0581f,The GM controversy: not for a Nobel cause,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/563324/gm-controversy-not-nobel-cause.html,2016-08-09,"The GM controversy: not for a Nobel causePandu Hegde, August 10, 2016 23:23 ISTOur political leaders, bureaucrats are keen to serve the interest of companies propaga-ting GM technology.Recently, more than 100 Nobel prize winners signed a letter in support of Genetically Modified (GM) crops, addressed to the United Nations and governments across the world where it claimed that the campaign against GM technology led by Greenpeace was misleading and unscientific.The signatories called upon Greenpeace to abandon its campaign against GM cropsin general and in particular its opposition to golden rice that infuses vitamin A, whose deficiency affects children in the developing countries. The letter claims that the world food production has to double by 2050 and the only way to achieve this is through adoption of modern plant breeding technologies like GM crops and precision agriculture.This assumes significance in countries like India, that is on the verge of fast tracking widespread use of GM technology to solve the problem of hunger and malnutrition affecting the majority of its population. The NDA-led government has recently given permission for field trials of GM food crops, ignoring the caution of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture. Ironically, the present BJP-led government at the Centre has clearly mentioned in its manifesto that it will ban the introduction of GM crops if it comes to power.Solving the problem of world hunger is very much related to how food is produced by majority of farmers. A World Bank commissioned study says agro ecological approaches and not the GM, can provide the solution to food crisis. It categorically says that given the access to land and financial support, small farmers have the capacity to grow enough food to meet the increasing demand without harming soil and water.It is interesting to see how the introduction of GM crops in various countries has notreduced the hunger but has increased the number of people who are hungry. In the US, food insecurity has increased form 12% prior to introduction of GM crops to 15% now.In Paraguay, with 65% of the land under GM crops, hunger increased form 12% in 2004 to 25% in 2012. In Brazil and Argentina, the widespread use of GM crops has not reduced hunger, but on the negative side, the farmers have lost control over their seeds.Back home, the Indian experience of GM crops is a testimony to the widespread negative impact on small farmers and how they lose food sovereignty. The introduction of Bt cotton in 1992 was claimed to be a turnaround in the history of the countrys agriculture.But today, farmers have lost almost 95% of the local cotton seeds. They have no other option but to depend entirely on the Bt cotton seeds manufactured by multinational seed companies.While the seed companies reaped windfall profits, the failure of Bt cotton seeds leading to the bankruptcy of farmers has been one of the major causes of farmers suicides in the country. Though the government or the seed companies will not accept the direct linkage of the historical figures of farmers suicides to introduction and failure of Bt cotton, it is obvious that farmers have taken their lives in those regions where Bt cotton is grown on a large scale.The impact of the GM soya cultivation in the Latin American countries, especially Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay is shocking. Mothers miscarry and children and workers in the soya plantations die of poisoning due to the pesticides used by GM crops.The Indian sceneIs India keen to learn from these experiences or will it blindly give into the claims of Nobel laureates who are deliberately ignoring the ground realities of the negative impact of the GM crops?They have ignored another fact  only six seed multinationals control all the GM seeds in the world, 61% commercial seeds and 76% pesticides market. As Silvia Ribeiro, Latin America Director of ETC group (Erosion Technology and Concentration) asks, how much lack of ethics and honesty is necessary to hide that your proposal on precision agriculture is the business of a handful of trans-nationals, each with a long history of violating health and env-ironmental and human rights?The Bt cotton fiasco and the situation in the Latin American countries, that are witnessing the impact of GM technology, clearly show that the transnational seed companies are keen to reap more profits at the cost of sacrificing human health and lives. By taking control of the seeds of food crops, they foresee the phenomenal increase in their profits by sale of seeds. And obviously, they will control the farmers, what they grow and what we eat.Our political leaders and bureaucrats are keen to serve the interest of GM crops and those companies that propagate this technology. The Nobel laureates have not only shown their ignorance in signing this letter but they have also vouched for the profit motive of seed companies, ignoring the dangers to humanity. This is not a noble cause; it would be better if they stood up for the principles of Alfred Nobel."
5923bc047be9e01fcef05835,Redressal policy for water dispute hazy,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/553627/redressal-policy-water-dispute-hazy.html,2016-06-21,"Redressal policy for water dispute hazyBy Bhaskar Parichha, Jun 22, 2016, DHNS 0:28 ISTExperts feel the need for an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in India.As recent as in March, the National thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) had to shut down its 2100 MW capacity power plant in West Bengal because it hadnt enough water to be used as coolant for the equipment.The level in the Farakka feeder canal which supplies water to the thermal plant had shrunk to hopeless levels. That was also the reason why electricity supply to five states was disrupted and some 40,000 families had to remain without power for days together.Drinking water was in short supply in Farakka town. Plying of boats on river Ganga had to be suspended and around 13 barges carrying coal were stuck in the mid-river because of low levels of water. This demonstrates that the Ganges is drying up faster than estimated.According to different reports, in the last decade itself, water level in 91% of countrys water reservoirs has come down. The Central Water Commissions findings are even more frightening  only 29% of water is left behind against their carrying capacity. Whats more, ground water which is the major source 85%  of water in India is depleting endlessly.Across states in India, dependence on water tankers today is greater than before. Water-related scuffles nowadays are common place. Recently, in the villages of Latur district of Maharashtra, prohibitive orders had to be clamped. Water supply to swimming pools has been cut off in Maharashtra.According to NASA, the ground water level in India is diminishing by 0.3 metre annually. Paradoxically, when there is a severe shortage of water, farmers in desiccated areas are encouraged to produce water-guzzling sugar cane. Same is the case with wheat and rice which are water-intensive.On the other side of the spectrum, water disputes are constantly on the rise. In addition to the fact that there isnt enough water for irrigation because of the myopic policies of successive governments, water is causing bad blood among people. In Punjab, after the Sutlej link canal bill was passed in the assembly, fissures have surfaced between Haryana and Punjab over division of water. In Haryana, farmers owning agricultural fields are screaming for water.Of late, state after state seem to be relying on the principle of Harmon. State governments are fostering a gut feeling that they have full control over the water that flows down from the state line.In order to trim down water disputes between states, the Inter-State Water Dispute Act was enacted in 1956. But the water dispute tribunals have consistently failed to implement the accords reached between states.In as much as the tribunal doesnt have coercive powers and its judgments are not binding on the states, the pronoun-cements are flouted and states straightforwardly refuse to abide by the agreements reach-ed. Even the Centre is toothless, as it happened in the case of Ravi-Beas river water dispute.Institutional safeguardsIn reality, the water dispute redressal mechanism in India is a lot ambiguous, hazy and muddled. Those involved in the water row, time and again, has recourse to bullying. Resolution of water dispute is a hell of a job because of the sheer number of players  the Centre, the state governments, the water dispute tribunals, the civil society and so on. Even institutional safeguards meant for development and progress is becoming ineffective.Take for example, the Cauvery river water dispute. From 1968 to 1990, there were as many as 26 minister-level talks between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka; but there has been no answer to the row. Because of increasing politicisation, the Cauvery river dispute tribunals proposals have become some sort of a wild goose chase.Experts feel the increasing need of an agency which will design, harmonise and control water conservation in the country. This Central regulatory body must know how to undertake water upkeep seriously. In the same way, we need a mechanism to share our water in the best possible way keeping in mind the social equity, need and lots of common wisdom.Industries, farmers and the common citizenry should be the partners in any talk of water distribution and conservation. We also need a couple of new laws and make stronger the present ones to maintain the ecological balance of Indias rivers. A new law to maintain minimum levels of water too is considered necessary. Politicisation of water is the last thing to be wished.All that is looked for is an attitudinal change among stakeholders. A long time solution to Indias water problem is enormously significant and the sooner we find an answer to the vexing problem of depleting water sources and the corresponding feuds the better. Water is one commodity which can never be put to buy and sell. Commercialisation of water can happen only in the depths of despair."
5923be517be9e01fcef05996,Limit subsidies on LPG and kerosene,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/525522/limit-subsidies-lpg-kerosene.html,2016-01-27,"Limit subsidies on LPG and keroseneBhaskar Parichha, Jan 28, 2016, 23:19 ISTThe Central government has set apart Rs 4,55,145 crore for interest payments in the fiscal year 2015-16. This takes into account, for the most part, the subsidy on food, fuel as well as fertiliser (the 3Fs).Subsidy to the fertiliser companies are in the range of Rs 73,000 crore. Of this, one-sixth goes for import of urea. The food subsidy bill is somewhere around Rs 1,24,500 crore. Out of this, about Rs 65,000 crore comes under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).With the governments control over retail prices of kerosene and LPG, there is an additional burden of Rs 30,000 crore. The food subsidy has many dimensions: stability in prices, ease of access by poor families to food and incentivisation of food grains production. Unfortunately, there is a disquieting seepage in the subsidy programme and many ineligible beneficiaries hive off the subsidised grains with delight.A study undertaken in 2002 by an international agency reveals that for making available $1 of subvention to the poor, the governments spends $3.1. In another study done in 1998, it has been found that 31 per cent of rice and wheat is siphoned off through illegal ways.The earlier avatar of NITI Aayog  the Planning Commission - in 2005 had acknowledged that 37 per cent of the food grains are drained off through dishonest means.In 2001, it was made public that inefficient government agencies squandered 27 per cent of the subsidy budget for purchase, transport and distribution of food grains.According to the 2010 Government of India Economic Survey, because of incompetent and wasteful handling, only 10 per cent of the food subsidy reached the poor. In other wo-rds, Indias massive subsidy programme can do wonders only if it is competently managed.Chhattisgarh has recently devised a better system for disbursement of subsidy. In a novel method, the whole process  from purchase of food grains from the mandi to their arrival at ration shops  has been digitised. This makes sure that the supply chain is corruption-free.The transfer of subsidies - both direct and indirect- all over the world has singularly proved that direct benefit transfer is easier and winning. In the whole of Latin America, welfare schemes have been stitched into people-centric policies. It starts from education and ends in food grains and LPG. Between 2003 and 2009, Brazil was able to bring down its poverty by 15 per cent and the objective of eliminating poverty within five years could duly be accomplished.In India, as we have seen, there was a superior impact on fuel subsidy when the government introduced the dual-pricing system in kerosene. So also is LPG. So far, about 13 crore consumers have been connected to the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system and it has acquired the status of being the largest DBT in the world.Thousands of crores of rupees have been saved and about six crore fake consumers have been driven out of LPG subsidy because of DBT. There also has been a purging of the black marketers. The adulteration of petrol and diesel with cheaply available kerosene was so much ingrained into the system that a separate class of mafias had taken roots.Corrupting public lifeOur fraudulent Public Distribution System (PDS) has yet another facet  corrupting public life. Dishonest traders hand in glove with local politicians have been sullying the PDS and this has had been adversely impacting the governments anti-poverty policies. Obviously, in the context of our colossal welfare measures, a crooked and bungling distribution system is an anathema.Many committees have, in the past decades, given precious recommendations to put an end to the shady PDS. The Rangarajan Committee (2006) had said that retail pricing of subsidised LPG should be revised and subsidy payments should go straight from the budget.Similarly, the Parikh Committee had recommended that pricing of PDS kerosene should be linked to agricultural growth. The Kelkar Committee, on the other hand, recommended complete withdrawal of LPG subsidy in three years and further curtailment of LPG beneficiaries by 33 per cent.Indeed, there is a need to limit subsidies on LPG and kerosene. Futuristically speaking, alternative source of fuel energy should be explored. Solar lamps could be a better alternative given their inexhaustibility and clean energy constituents. Whats more, solar power will need only one time subsidy unlike kerosene where subsidy is a perennial obligation.In the last Union budget, the government had promised a total overhauling of the subsidy regime. Accordingly, all the three subsidy components - food, fertiliser and cooking fuel  were brought into one single expenditure structure.The Expenditure Commission was given additional responsibility of reviewing the allotment of subsidies so that its maximum impact can be felt at the societal level.All said and done, in order to have a robust economy, we need a clear road map to control, manage and re-organise the subsidy system."

At Tamil Nadu Bhavan, enthusiastic state officials opened a canteen to showcase the CMs trailblazer model for urban food security by selling idlis with sambar for one rupee, and lemon rice and curd rice for Rs 5 a plate. Cooks and provisions were flown in from Chennai to run the canteen for three days.With Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal deciding to follow her model and open such restaurants in the capital, there was a lot of rush though the Tamil Nadu Bhavan officials had not publicised their show. They also put up stalls to showcase Amma Marundhagam (Amma pharmacy) that makes available drugs at a cheap rate, as well as Amma Salt, which sells fortified salt at Rs 10 a kg. With the state going to polls in three months, Amma Unavagam is not just a talking point in Tamil Nadu but also in Delhi, thanks to the festival.Shekhar Iyer, New DelhiFlying kites, and rumoursOn Makar Sankranti, along with the entire state of Gujarat, political pundits and a section of media too joined in the celebrations by flying kites, albeit not literally. They spread the message that the current nati-onal president of the BJP, Amit Shah, would be taking oath as Gujarat CM on Sunday, January 17, replacing Anandiben Patel. RSS man and general secretary of BJP Ram Madhav, was tipped to take over as the BJP president. And Subramanian Swamy  seen by many as trying hard to find a berth in the Modi government  would finally make it as Indias new commerce minister!What fuelled the fire was the fact that Anandiben Patel has been facing an uphill task in the wake of the Patel quota stir in the state, that saw the BJP lose its rural stronghold in the state after a gap of over two decades. But it seems Anandiben is staying put as CM of Gujarat, after all. At least, for now.Sunil Raghu, AhmedabadAge no barA day before Lalu Prasad was elected president of the Rashtriya Janata Dal for the ninth consecutive term, the party amended its constitution to allow even a 15-year-old to become an RJD member. Earlier, the age limit was 18 years, in adherence to the Indian Constitution that has fixed 18 years as the minimum age for voting. The RJD has thus become the first political party in the country to have members at 15 years of age.Explaining the rationale behind such a move, Bihars Deputy CM Tejaswi Yadav said during the Assembly election, he met several youth in the age group of 16-17 who wanted to become RJD members but could not do so due to age bar. Having watched the eagerness among young budding leaders, we decided to amend our constitution, he put the record straight.Abhay Kumar, PatnaNagpur bondTransport Minister Nitin Gadkari cannot but recall his association with CPI leader A B Bardhan, who passed away at the age of 92 on January 2. Gadkari not only credits Bardhans inspiring and fiery speech, which he heard as a schoolboy, as one of the reasons behind his decision to pursue a career in politics, but also recalls that when he became the BJP president, he went to seek Bardhans blessings at the CPI office.Today, we dont have many leaders whose feet we would touch for blessings. But Bardhan was one, said Gadkari. What brought Gadkari and Bardhan together is their fond association with the orange city of Nagpur. If Gadkari began his political life as a boy who pasted posters during the Emergency, Bardhan started with trade union movement out of Nagpur.SI, New DelhiCostly mistakeSenior BJP leader and Union Tribal Welfare Minister Joel Oram is known for his critical comments against Naveen Patnaik and the BJD government in Odisha. However, recently one such comment boome-ranged and hit his party hard. The CBI investigation into the mining and chit fund scams would have consumed the BJD by now but for the mercy of our government at the Centre, Oram told a local TV channel clearly indicating that the Modi-led NDA government had extended a helping hand to the Patnaik administration on the issue.The senior tribal leaders remark gave an excellent opportunity to the main opposition party, the Congress, to reiterate that BJD-BJP were having an under the table deal on the twin scam despite their public opposition to each other. Oram made an attempt to rectify his statement later but the damage had already been done.S T Beuria, Bhubaneswar"

Tomorrow being a holiday, the bench will sit only to hear the matter.Karnataka's decision to move the Supreme Court comes ahead of the Cauvery Supervisory Committee's meeting here tomorrow to decide on the quantum of the river's water to be released to Tamil Nadu and other states.The application has sought that instead of 10 days, the apex court should restrict the release of water to only 6 as the state itself was facing a distress situation due to a massive agitation which was causing a loss of Rs 500 crore per day to Karnataka.In the plea, Karnataka has said there was ""huge public pressure"" and the state police, with great difficulty, have been able to prevent attempts to damage public property.""Even the minimum arrangement mentioned by your lordships has caused distress and havoc in the entire southern part of Karnataka, paralysing civil life. The agitation of farmers has been that their dry crop is equalled with that of the farmers in Tamil Nadu.Tamil Nadu's need for the rice crop consumes more than twice the water which is needed for light crops in Karnataka,"" the application said.The application says that people, particularly farmers in the districts of Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya and Bengaluru, have been squatting on the roads and streets, affecting the IT industry in the state capital which earns huge revenue by way of income tax, service tax, and foreign exchange of USD 60 billion for the country.The application also referred to inputs from security agencies that said if the flow of water is allowed to continue further, the situation ""may go out of hand"".In an interim order on September 5, the court had directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day to Tamil Nadu for the next 10 days to ameliorate the plight of the farmers there.The apex court had also directed Tamil Nadu to approach Supervisory Committee, set up to implement the award of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal, within three days for release of water as per the final order of the CWDT."

Those affected were put on saline support and rushed to nearby hospitals.About 2,000 members from Dawoodi Bohra community suffered serious bout of food poisoning after consuming dinner served at a local community hall in Indore on Sunday night.According to Juni Indore Police station, the incident occurred on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday when close to 5,600 Bohras were observing the month of Ramazan at a local community hall in Saify Colony.A senior citizen succumbed to cardiac arrest at Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital, Monday morning, the night after attending the dinner.The deceased, Haider Ali (65), was also a patient of renal cancer and suffered stomach pain on Sunday night after he accompanied his family to the community hall. While his family has alleged he did not eat the sweet suspected to have caused food poisoning, doctors at the hospital have requested a post mortem for confirming the final cause of death.The patient was admitted in ICU and had a history of chronic illness. When other patients were being brought to the hospital and he felt uneasiness, his family also brought him along, said hospital superintendent Dr VS Pal.The food samples, mainly suspected to be raw material mawa, sweet called khopra paak, and other ingredients used to prepare the sweet along with Bohra dish halim, mutton, rice and daal were collected by food inspectors and sent for laboratory analysis at Food and Drug Administration in Bhopal. We are now investigating how the stale food was procured and used. Till now, no case against the caterer has been registered but we suspect the mawa used to make the sweet was stale, said Thane Inspector Pawan Singhal.Watch Video: Whats making newsAccording to community members, the meal was consumed after iftaari, when Muslims break their fast. For the community, Sunday was the 30th night of Ramazan when they gather in mosques to pray throughout the night. On July 5, the Bohras observe Eid celebrations.The dinner, served in community hall, was being prepared every night since Ramazan began. According to patients, they consumed the meal at 9.30 pm on Sunday. Authorities also distributed the food amongst poor people.Those affected were rushed to several hospitals in the city, including Choithram, Maharaja Yashwantrao, Apple, Pulse, Anand hospital and Malik Nursing Home.Almost all members in my family ate the mithai and suffered vomiting and lose motions, said Husain Koser, 25. Koser experienced dehydration and severe lose motions few hours after eating the sweet. His nephew, three-year-old Shabbir Theliwala, is currently admitted in Apple Hospital. He is under observation but stable. He experienced severe vomiting, added Koser.Another community member, Ali Husain, made a lucky escape. I ate a little portion of the sweet. Everyone started rushing to the mosque few hours after they ate the meal once they experienced uneasiness, he said.According to eye witnesses, the mosque and community hall was filled with affected patients who started vomiting before being rushed to nearby hospitals. The mosque premises had to be washed thoroughly, said authorities.According to local police, all close hospitals near the Saify Colony mosque have been occupied following the food poisoning incident. Those affected are mostly women, senior citizens and children, added Singhal.Septuagenarian Shirin Dewaswala was admitted in Choithram Hospital and required saline support throughout the night to control lose motions and vomiting. According to her grandson Huzefa, her condition stabilized by Monday morning.According to police, the mosque has contracted a permanent caterer who has been preparing meals throughout Ramazan. The mawa suspected to be spurious was prepared by the same caterer by reportedly using Amul milk.In 2014, a similar food poisoning episode was reported from New Saify Colony, adjoining the Saify Colony, where Bohras had suffered from vomiting after consuming spurious sweet in the community hall.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Source: Subham Dutta At the rally ground in Agartala on Tuesday. Source: Subham DuttaON TUESDAY, when Mamata Banerjee sounded the clarion call for the 2018 Tripura elections, her rally was at once familiar and unfamiliar. While her speech was peppered with references to her governments achievements in West Bengal  what Trinamool Congress has deemed the Bengal model  the rally also marked her return as the firebrand Opposition leader.Mamata declared that for her party, the fact that the rally is being held in Agartala on the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, was not accidental. Usually, I go to Midnapore. But this time, I am here. It is because we are starting a new movement in Tripura today  independence from the communists. There is no space for them in India, she said.The underlying thread throughout her speech was not merely her relentless criticism of the Left Front government in Tripura, but its juxtaposition with her governments achievements in Bengal. While alleging that the Left in Tripura has failed to provide jobs, she invoked the pension schemes in Bengal and claimed her government has given jobs to thousands. Claiming that people of Tripura still needed to travel to Kolkata in order to treat major ailments, Mamata spoke about her government setting up multi-specialty hospitals in Bengal.When CPM was defeated in Bengal, it was found that it had left a huge debt which Trinamool was clearing now, she said. But we are distributing rice at Rs 2 per kg, giving stipends to girls and students, creating livelihood amenities for the poor and have constructed 41 super-speciality hospitals in the last five years. What has the CPM done here? There is no job, no work, no agricultural facilities, no university and no teacher. There is only loot, conspiracy, false assurance and no justice Mamata claimed.She added that while CPM was boasting that it had brought rail to Agartala, in reality, the project had been sanctioned when I was the union minister for Railways in 2010. She also raked up corruption charges against Tripura Chief Minister Manik Sarkar.No party from Delhi will understand Tripura or Bengal. The problems here are different. All they understand is Dilli ka ladoo and Delhis politics The West Bengal government will be with Tripura and aid the state in its development. If we are elected, we will bring about industry, jobs, employment, education and medicine, she said while floating a Bengal model of development, which will be sensitive to the unique needs of Tripura.Introducing Mamata to the audience was dissident Congress leader Sudip Ray Burman, the son of former Tripura CM Samir Ranjan Burman, who prior to 1988 had campaigned alongside the Bengal CM.Mamata began with a reference to her days as a Youth Congress leader, campaigning against the Left regime in Tripura prior to the 1988 Assembly elections that Congress coming to power in the state. I am not a stranger to Tripura. I had campaigned here extensively when Santosh da (Santosh Mohan Dev) had asked me to come here. Today, those who had campaigned with me are sitting on the stage, she said.Earlier, the Congress had extended its friendship to the Left in Delhi that is how the Left formed a government here and I realised that I needed to leave Congress. Now, they have again done the same in Bengal and they have realised that they needed to join me, she added.Watch Video: Whats making newsMamatas rally was planned after Trinamool emerged as the majority Opposition party in Tripura, when six dissident Congress MLAs joined the party in June. This, Mamata, said was the beginning of creating a collective team to oppose the CPM in Tripura. Without such a team, there is no point, she said.She also criticised the BJP  which in the last five years has made inroads into Tripura  claiming that the party was only concerned with spreading hatred and communal strife.What do they do? They cant even pass the GST Bill without our help. During elections, they will suddenly start chanting Hare Rama, Hare Krishna to try and spread communalism. Since we have spoken out against them, about how they are undermining the federal structure, they try and intimidate us with their agencies. But we dont fear them. We have stared into the guns held by the communists in Bengal. The BJP cant stare us down, Mamata said.But in spite of Trinamools exuberance, the path to the 2018 elections would not be easy. While explaining the noticeably empty patches in the rally ground, Mamata alleged that the Left had prevented people from attending the event and cut power in villages to stop them from seeing her.Trinamool insiders, however, said the partys lack of an organisation in Tripura would pose the biggest challenge. There were already four Trinamool Congress factions in Tripura. Now, with Congress leaders joining, there is a fifth one. A lot will depend on Mukul Roy, who has been tasked with fixing the organisational structure in Tripura. If he cant do it, it will effectively help CPM, with Trinamool only cutting into BJPs votes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Padkai method of agriculture involves making steps on the slopes and levelling these steps to plant crops.It is now an undisputed fact that excavation was done for Padkai farming system using earth movers and heavy machinery on the slopes of the hills of Malin, wherein 115 people died in landslides two years ago.However, a complaint application filed by an activist pointing to criminal culpability of the officials from the Department of Agriculture went unheard after the department conducted its own inquiry and gave a clean chit to its own officials.Days after the landslide occurred at Malin village of Ambegaon taluka on the morning of July 30 two years ago, Right to Information (RTI) activist Suresh Talekar had filed a complaint application at the local Ghodegaon Police Station demanding that agriculture department officials be booked for culpable homicide for deaths of villagers.Watch Video: Whats making newsThe Padkai method of agriculture involves making steps on the slopes and levelling these steps to plant crops. Traditionally, only tools such as plough are used for this. However, over the years, the Department of Agriculture had allegedly started using heavy machinery, including earth movers, to cut portions of hills to make small plots for rice cultivation.As part of the inquiry into the complaint application, police wrote to the Department of Agriculture asking them to give a report on the issue. Speaking to The Indian Express, Talekar said, The departments role should have been probed for negligence leading to deaths at Malin. It conducted the probe and gave a report to the police stating that no heavy machinery was used at the spot, which was a lie. The police, in turn, corroborated it and closed the issue. The state has been in denial since the beginning. The practice of using heavy machinery is unscientific and there is large-scale corruption in the use of these earth movers. In its own records, the Agriculture Department states heavy machinery was used on the slopes. We have photographic evidence that indicate this. The criminal culpability for the deaths of 115 has to be decided so that it does not happen again.Dulaji Zanjare, who owns a piece of land right next to the patch that came down on the morning of July 30, 2014 said, At my own patch, and also on the patch that came down in the landslide, JCB (earth mover) was used for two years for levelling the step.

The Padkai method of agriculture involves making steps on the slopes and levelling these steps to plant crops.TWO YEARS since the tragedy of Malin, the tribal practice of creating small fields by cutting portions of the hill seem to have discontinued from the Ambegaon taluka in Pune.A change in governments policy has led to the scheme being abandoned mid-way with many being left in the lurch in want of unpaid bill.Called Padkai, the practice of step agriculture involves small cuts being made on the hill side, which is subsequently flattened and levelled to grow rice. Across the Western Ghats, tribal farmers are known to have cultivated rice in this way. Since 2010, Padkai has been introduced in the list of works to be undertaken in the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) and Ambegaon had seen work worth Rs 45 crore being sanctioned under the scheme. In fact, Malin was one of the villages where such works were undertaken.Watch Video: Whats making newsNorms of MGNREGS and the traditional method of Padkai forbid the usage of heavy machinery, which apparently was flouted in Malin. Local villagers and members of tribal cooperative Shashwat said that heavy machinery, including earth movers, were used to cut on the hill slopes to prepare the fields. The landslide, which saw the death of more than 115 villagers, was triggered by the usage of heavy machinery.Two years later, Padkai is hardly practised. Significant changes in the pattern of payment have made the scheme unsuitable for the region with many complaining of unpaid dues. In 2015, the Central government changed the payment pattern for Padkai and now, only families under the poverty line are eligible for payment for the padkai work they have undertaken under the MGNREGS. This change in criteria has effectively stopped new work of Padkai being undertaken anywhere in Ambegaon.Towards the end of 2014, there were more than 1,100 labourers who had worked on Padkai-related work under MGNREGS. The total payment due to them was around Rs 2 crore and not a single person received a payment. Budhaji Damse, member of Shashwat, said only below five per cent of the labourers fell under the poverty line and thus, many were ineligible for payment. The tribal commissioner has the right to change the payment scheme but so far, nothing has happened, he said. Local agriculture officers also confirm that they are yet to get any new demand for Padkai from the tribal areas of Ambegaon.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

M Karunanidhi, 91. What makes the oldest candidates in fray in Kerala and Tamil Nadu the most sought-after by their parties? Shaju Philip & Arun Janardhanan find outAddressing an election rally in Assam last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dismissed the competition posed by Congress Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi, saying he is so senior to me and, in a few years, he will be 90. Gogoi is 81.In two corresponding elections, there are two 90-plus contenders whom no one can dismiss in a hurry. If V S Achuthanandan is spearheading the CPM comeback campaign in Kerala, M Karunanidhi is doing the same for the DMK in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.This is Achuthanandans eighth Assembly election. He first contested 49 years ago, in 1967, from Ambalapuzha. In all this time, he has been chief minister just once, though few may be able to stop him should the CPM win on May 19.V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M Karunanidhi V S Achuthanandan (Photo courtesy: Mathrubhumi) and M KarunanidhiKarunanidhi is fighting his 13th Assembly election. He has not been defeated once in nearly 60 years of contesting polls, having begun from Kulitalai in 1957, and has been the CM five times. He has also been a member of the (now-abolished) Tamil Nadu Legislative Council once.Achuthanandan is now the only surviving leader among the founders of the CPM. Both VS and Karunanidhi are the oldest candidates in the fray in the two states.Heres something more to put that in perspective: in the year 1957, when Karunanidhi won his first polls, Feroze Gandhi won from the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha seat. 1967, when VS contested the first time, was the year the Congress fought its first general elections without Jawaharlal Nehru at the helm.V S Achuthanandan: Strict regimen, controlled diet, unsheathed ambitionWayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI Photo Wayanad: VS Achuthanandan arrives to visit the drought hit areas at Pulappalli in Wayanad on Friday. PTI PhotoAt 7.45 am, the government rest-house in Palakkad is deserted, except for a police constable lazing in a chair near a room on the ground floor. Minutes later, an elderly man emerges from the room, his mundu folded above the knees. Escorted by an assistant, he carefully climbs down a small ramp to a courtyard.Here, the crimson sun of Kerala politics, Velikkakath Sankaran Achuthanandan, stands facing the sun  eyes closed, lips pursed. After a few minutes, he turns around for his back to soak in the morning rays. About 10 minutes later, he returns to his room.Achuthanandan, popularly known as VS, will turn 93 in October. Before the Assembly elections of 2011, VS, who was then chief minister, had been denied a seat by the CPM on health grounds. After widespread discontent among party workers and the public, the CPM gave in. That election battle was reckoned to be the 87-year-olds last. Here we are, five years later, with VS a natural contender for the CMs post.Apart from being the Left Democratic Front candidate from Malampuzha constituency, the veteran is shouldering the LDF campaign across the state  proving once again his ability to reinforce his relevance. All this doesnt come easy. VS begins his day at 5 am. By 6 am, he is out for his regular morning walk, dressed in track pants and a white T-shirt. While at his official residence in Thiruvananthapuram, he usually goes to the university stadium for a half-an-hour walk, but now that he is in Palakkad district for campaigning, he makes do with the tarred road near the rest-house. As VS walks, two aides keep a careful watch, with one of them showing the way with a torch. VS walks for about 50 metres, taking slow, measured steps, then turns around and walks back. His assistant Kunhikannan says he walks this way for nearly 20 minutes, without exchanging a word with his aides.After the walk, VS rests in his room for a while. This is when he reads the newspapers. He wants all the local Malayalam and English dailies on his table when he returns from his walk, says Kunhikkannan, who has been with VS for four years. This is followed by a bath and a 20-minute-long yoga session. VS took to yoga 12 years ago and does his asanas without anyones help, says Kunhikkannan. It is after yoga that he soaks up the sun.Kolkata: CPI(M) leader V S Achuthanandan, CPI(M) General Secy Sitaram Yechury, Former West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Left Front Chairman Biman Bose Former Secretary Prakash Karat, State Opposition Leader Surya Kanta Mishra and others in an open rally during their Kolkata Plenum in Kolkata on Sunday.

PTI Photo by Ashok BhaumikBreakfast comes next. His aides say VS flips through newspapers as he eats his usual steam-baked puttu or idiyappam or appam. VSs fitness at 92 is attributed in part to his diet regimen: No tea or coffee for him; he only drinks hot water or tender coconut water. He has also largely stuck to vegetarian food, though he occasionally eats fish curry. A couple of years ago, VS famously broke this regimen when he went to greet estranged comrade, K R Gouri, on her birthday. Gouri is said to have chided him, Since when have you turned vegetarian?, and forced him to eat fish curry.By 9 am, the veteran CPM leader is ready to receive visitors. Local leaders start trickling in, including A Prabhakaran, the LDF election committee convenor of Malampuzha constituency. Prabhakaran briefs him about the days schedule and tells him he will have to attend a few panchayat-level CPM conventions.I have been coordinating Achuthanandans election in Malampuzha since 2001. This time too he will win with a thumping majority, says Prabhakaran. In 2011, VS had won by 20,017 votes against Congress candidate Lathika Subhash.Half an hour later, VS is ready to leave for the first convention. Two assistants help him into a car, which sports the party flag on its bonnet. As he sinks into his seat, VS slips into the past: of those days without cars, with a lot of ground to be covered on foot. He started out as a strident labour union leader in Alappuzha who went on to become one of the most popular faces of the CPM in Kerala.I became a member of the Communist party in 1940, at the age of 17. I worked among fishermen, toddy-tappers and coconut climbers in Alappuzha. I later joined a coir factory, organised workers there and brought them closer to the Communist movement, he says.There were tough days. In the early 1940s, I would stay in a house at Cherukara in Alappuzha for party work. The house was located in a paddy field with streams. I would walk kilometres along narrow ridges to reach workers. There were no bridges across these streams, only wooden planks, he says. It was in the late 1950s, when he was district secretary of the united CPI in Alappuzha, that his office got its first car.The VS motorcade reaches Kodumbu, 6 km from Palakkad city. The town is decorated with flags and festoons. Hundreds of party workers have gathered at the community hall to hear him. The hall erupts as party workers push to catch a glimpse of the veteran and shout slogans hailing him. VS has to jostle through the crowd to reach the stage, helped by his security guards. As mobile phones go up one by one to record his speech, the 92-year-old greets the audience with folded hands and starts speaking. With his voice ringing through the hall in his famous, much-mimicked style halting and winding  the years fall away.We want to bring back the previous LDF government, which implemented several welfare initiatives, says Achuthanandan. You can realise my responsibility. I have to campaign across the state for LDF candidates, it is your duty to seek votes for Achuthanandan. Think of yourself as V S Achuthanandan when you go campaigning. Thank you, namaskaram.There is fresh sloganeering as VS makes his way back to his car. The next convention is at Mundur, half an hour away. At Mundur too, hundreds of party workers, including women, have been waiting for Achuthanandan. Kanne Karale Viyesse (loosely translated to Our eyes, our heart, oh VS), they shout as the CPM leader reaches.Prabhakaran addresses the crowd here, and makes no effort to hide the ambition of the VS camp should he win. People of Kerala are looking at VS with great expectation and enthusiasm. If an LDF government led by VS does not come to power, Kerala will collapse, he says.When its his turn to address the gathering, VS again tells the party workers to go to the voters as VS and garner votes for him. Its midday by the time the event at Mundur is over, and VS returns to the guest-house in Palakkad for lunch.A few spoons of rice and vegetables make his lunch, says son V A Arun Kumar. What he misses while he is out campaigning is the buttermilk made from goat milk that he has without fail while in Thiruvananthapuram. He has a goat at his official residence in the capital, says VSs additional private secretary K V Sudhakaran.After lunch, VS rests until 3 pm. He then meets visitors before leaving for a second round of campaigning in the evening.Human rights activist Joy Kaitharam has brought along a few guests, including Lakshmi Bhai, the widow of P Satheendra Kumar, an employee of Malabar Cements who died under mysterious circumstances in 2013. The moment Kaitharam introduces Lakshmi to VS, he says, Oh the Malabar cements case! He promises Lakshmi her demand for a job for her son would be met if the LDF government came to power.VS grasps things fast, Kaitharam smiles. If we give written material, he gets the points in one reading. A Suresh, the personal assistant for VS for 12 years, says the veterans popularity can be attributed to this quality and the causes he identifies himself with: social evils, corruption, land encroachment and sex mafia. He patiently hears out everyone who meets him. VS is quick to grasp an issue and understand its gravity.CPM central committee member Thomas Issac underlines what VS means for the party. People, particularly the poor, easily identify with him. There is a huge demand from the party and the public to include VS in as many campaigns as possible.Around 4 pm, VS leaves for two more meetings in his constituency, returning around 7.30 pm to the guest-house.Before turning in for the night, VS again goes for a walk, this time for 30 minutes. Even after a long journey or a busy schedule, he does not skip this routine. During the last Lok Sabha elections, he once stayed on the third floor of a hotel in Malappuram which did not have a lift. He would walk down the steps, come down for his evening walk and again take all those stairs on his way up, says Sudhakaran, his additional private secretary.Dinner is light  a few pieces of papaya and three or four kadali bananas. Most days, he is in bed by 9 pm. Son Arun Kumar says VS usually never discusses politics with family. Controversies do not upset him. His initial years of struggle have given him the strength to stay like a rock when political storms hit him.He is travelling with his father this time because of his age, Kumar adds. I am here just to monitor his food.So what keeps him going at 92? VS, who since last fortnight has also joined social media, smiles, I do my best to remain fit. I have a strict and disciplined life, just like my clean political life.The perpetual rebel* Born on October 20, 1923, in Punnapra village in Alappuzha district, V S Achuthanandan lost his parents early. When 12, he dropped out of school and started working at his elder brothers tailoring shop. He joined the Congress when he was 15, but became a CPI member two years later.* In 1964, he was one of the 32 leaders to walk out of the national council of the CPI to form the CPI(M). He is the only one of the 32 still alive.* VSs biggest strength has been his ability to reinvent himself at crucial moments. As Opposition leader from 2001 to 2006, he associated himself with issues such as womens empowerment, Dalit rights and land encroachment, which sent his popularity soaring.* Within the party though, he has been a perpetual rebel, locking horns with Pinarayi Vijayan over control of the state leadership. In 2007, VS and Vijayan were both suspended from the Politburo for some time.* In 2015, the CPM passed a resolution against VS for his alleged anti-party activities. But his fortunes have since brightened. With the BJP joining hands with Hindu Ezhava leader Vellappally Natesan, VS as an Ezhava is even more important now.M Karunanidhi: A family close by, some prayers next doorM Karunanidhi M KarunanidhiITS APRIL 23, three weeks to go for what is likely his final electoral battle, and M Karunanidhi is getting ready for his first poll rally. Inside the DMK chiefs two-storey house, made in the traditional Tamil style, distinctive only for the party flag atop, there is hectic activity.Personal secretary K Shanmuganathan has been busy in the visitors section since 8.30 am. Another aide walks up and down with a phone, looking on as senior party leaders arrive and four armed commandos of the National Security Guard take positions. A sniffer dog checks Karunanidhis customised Toyota Alphard standing in the lobby.A dozen security personnel conduct a routine drill, checking each vehicle parked on the street with metal detectors.In his trademark safari suit, Karunanidhis aide Shanmughanathan, who has been with the DMK chief since 1976, is turning away people seeking appointments. Others can be seen decorating the door leading to his inner house with garlands, but the freshly drawn kolam (rangoli) in front of No. 15, 4th Street, Gopalapuram, has already been smudged by the people walking in and out.As media cameras wait restlessly outside for Kalaignar, as Karunanidhi is fondly called by his followers, to emerge, news comes that the DMK chief is still having his favourite breakfast  dosa and chutney.Information about what the 92-year-old eats though is tough to come by. It requires a formal mail before a close aide reveals, Minimum four coffees a day is a must. By around 11 am, he will have chicken soup or vegetable soup, before a mini-lunch. He eats a little rice for lunch. Though there are some restrictions these days, gulab jamun and cutlets are his favourites.Around 9.30 am, eldest daughter Selvi is the first to step out, her hands full of flowers. Next to Karunanidhis house, in a narrow lane, is a temple. Rivals say the famously atheist leaders family conducts pujas there. His loyalists insist Karunanidhi stops for no one, not even god.Thats saying much for a leader confined to a wheelchair since 2009, and carrying the weight of his splintered party and family on his shoulders. Apart from the frugal meals, one way that keeps him going is daily yoga at 4 am, followed by the first coffee of the day. According to a close aide, he does all the possible sitting yoga postures he can for 20 minutes. The self-declared rationalist found the middle path when he embraced yoga in 2009.He started doing yoga after he was forced to give up his morning walk, which he would do mostly inside the sprawling compound of Anna Arivalayam, his party headquarters, says the aide.Karunanidhi finally leaves around 3 pm. He first stops at a CIT Nagar residence to pick up third wife Rajathi Ammal and daughter Kanimozhi before the convoy heads for a rally on the banks of Adyar, marking the start of a road trip that will cover half of the states districts and involve at least 35 rallies.Since he cant go to all the 234 constituencies, the party has planned for each rally to cover a dozen or more seats. Some of the rallies are stage events, at others, he would be delivering speeches sitting in his caravan. On the road though, he may not be able to indulge in the one leisure activity aides confess about him  watching old songs on TV, some of them from his films, others bound to be from bitter rival J Jayalalithaas.His campaign van is a customised Force Traveller with a sliding door and a high roof, that can easily accommodate Karunanidhis wheelchair. He has been using similar vans for several elections now. Those who have seen and heard the Karunanidhi of old say the speech delivery is no longer as effortless, but it remains spontaneous, with the leader not referring to any paper during his 20-odd-minute addresses.Instructing a youth who is part of the DMK social media team, Karunanidhis personal secretary Rajamanickam, who is well into his 70s, says the DMK chief knows just what to highlight from his speeches for YouTube and Facebook. Karunanidhi has had own Facebook and Twitter accounts since March 2014.On a Monday evening, as Karunanidhi arrives for a rally at his Thiruvarur constituency, near native village Thirukkuvalai, there are over 10,000 cheering people gathered. The sight is reassuring for a leader who many have been saying should retire.He starts his speech listing the names of Tamil Nadu Congress chief EVKS Elangovan sitting next to him, other alliance leaders and the DMKs district leaders individually, triggering an applause each time. Rajathi Ammal sits behind him, while former Union telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran, who was named in the 2G scam, is to his left and never takes his eyes off the DMK supremo. The presence of both sends a message. In the war of supremacy within the Karunanidhi clan, it is Rajathi and Kanimozhi who are by the DMK chief in this campaign. Kanimozhi too carries 2G taint, and Dayanidhi is a surprise inclusion given his absence from public view for a long time.Ignoring this fact, the DMK chief focuses on the alleged corruption of the Jayalalithaa government, talking about money seizures from her partymens houses and demanding a CBI probe.If the presence of Kanimozhi is remarked upon, so is the curious absence of M K Stalin, while eldest son M K Alagiri is more or less silent now. Alagiri remains unpopular, and there is talk still among cadres and voters of him coming back if Karunanidhi returns to power. Others say how Stalin, who is running a virtual parallel campaign with professionals and a strong social media presence, should have been projected as the CM candidate by the DMK.Older leaders close to Karunanidhi say some of his own relatives have asked him to hand over the baton to Stalin. However, says a close aide, Karunanidhi doesnt want to be a father who made his son a CM. He follows Maos theory  I dont want to support anyone, let them grow on their own.READ: The Dravida Family TreeOthers point out that Karunanidhi still remains popular among colleagues, and for the reason that in a state with imperious leaders, surrounded by powerful coteries, he is open. If I call him now and ask for an appointment, he would ask me to come immediately. That is Karunanidhi, says Anbumani Ramadoss, leader of the PMK, and incidentally now a bitter rival.Before the Trichy rally, the DMK men thronging outside his room are all carrying photographs of party leader K N Nehru. Partymen point out that unlike the AIADMK, the DMK also allows its second-level leaders to bloom.Closest friend and advisor M Naganathan, former head of economics at the University of Madras and ex-vice chairman of the state planning commission, says his memories of Karunanidhi revolve around their morning walks together for almost 25 years, until he became wheel-chair bound.Naganathan also vouches that unlike Jayalalithaas actions against him  including sending police to arrest him at midnight in June 2001  Karunanidhi never expresses any kind of venom towards her. She is too junior to him, he has seen her since she entered the film industry as a child. When Kalaignars police went to arrest Jayalalithaa in 1996 (for alleged corruption), she kept them waiting for one-and-a-half hours. Karunanidhi asked the officers to arrest her only when she came out.Dismissing talk that Karunanidhi step down, an old-timer who meets the DMK chief off and on, says Stalin too bows before his father still. Unless there is a constitutional framework imposing an age limit for leaders, it would be foolish to judge a leader by his age. Is V S Achuthanandan at 92 incompetent? Was Jyoti Basu a failure at 96? R Venkataraman was in his late 80s when he became the president of India.Still, even the leader of a party formed with a rationalist agenda can do with some prayers now. Four hours before the Trichy rally is to begin, a brief prayer is held at the hotel Karunanidhi is staying in. Party leader A Raja, another 2G scam survivor, is among the dozen or so leaders gathered as a priest holds prayers for Karunanidhis health.Ask him about his contemporary Achuthanandan, and Karunanidhi is brief, I wish him all the best for his success.The scriptwriter* Muthuvel Karunanidhi was born on June 3, 1924, in Thirukkuvalai, a village near Thiruvarur. A school dropout, he was a screenwriter in the Tamil film industry before entering politics. The film circle in which he was active had political links with the Dravidian movement against Brahminism, and Karunanidhi was a founding member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).* Along with C N Annadurai, he organised local protests against powerful north Indian men imposing Hindi names in 1953.* He won his first election from Kulithalai in Trichy district in 1957, winning a seat in the Assembly of Madras Presidency.* After the DMK parted ways with Periyars Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), won the elections in 1967 and Annadurai became the CM, Karunanidhi became public works minister. After Annadurais death in early 1969, Karunanidhi succeeded him till 1971. He returned to the CMs office in the election in 1971.* The DMK faced a vertical split in 1972 after MGR decided to float AIADMK following a tussle with with Karunanidhi. In five years, MGR captured power from DMK and ruled the state till 1987.* He returned to power in 1989."

The government should act immediately and respond to the demands, suggested former Director General and Inspector General of Police Shankar M Bidari.Former DGP D V Guruprasad opined: The police cant go on strike and the government should make all efforts to prevent it. The government should immediately consider the demands and redress issues of salary, weekly off, and set up grievance redressal mechanism and proper communication channel between subordinates and higher upsDr Guruprasad warned: The problems cant be brushed aside by invoking disciplinary action. A disgruntled force will lead to serious consequence in future.Echoing similar views, former IGP Gopal B Hosur said: The government should immediately redress at least a couple of demands and amend the Karnataka Police Act to set up a grievance redressal cell having legal sanctity.Bidari said that certain demands of the lower rung staff have been ignored though many initiatives have been taken by the successive governments over the years. There was hardly any difference between the salaries of police inspectors, tahsildars and assistant executive engineers in 1970, but over a period of time a great injustice has been done to inspectors in terms of salaries. The National Police Commissions advice of having one police station for 50,000 population has not been followed, he added.Though Home Minister G Parameshwara recently listed out welfare measures initiated by the government for the lower rung staff, the truth appears to be different.Many senior serving officers acknowledge that initiatives like canteen facility, supply of rice and wheat at subsidised prices, Arogya Bhagya scheme and housing facilities have not been implemented properly. They admitted that constabulary is against orderly duties.Regarding workload, they said that its not about filling up of the vacancies, but about increasing sanctioned strength of the department. The government has not taken the suggestion seriously, they said.Many of the recently recruited constables are postgraduates and are unwilling to discharge non-policing duties. The top brass has failed to sensitise the constabulary about welfare measures initiated particularly during the last two years. They should realise that the protest will have serious consequences on many constables who dont want to be a part of the stir. They should also realise that their act has already disreputed the department, said an ADGP.The police top brass decided to rope in Home Guards to face any eventuality on June 4 and about 200 Home Guards have been deployed for duty on Friday and Saturday.The Home Guards from Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts gathered at the City Traffic Management Centre and received the instructions from higher ups about the duty and places of duty on Thursday."

The report recommended ordering a departmental inquiry after issue of show-cause notice to the two officers. It has also recommended shifting them to non-executive posts, he added. The 191-page report has found that then DC Mir Anees Ahmed and SP Varthika Katiyar failed to take precautionary measures. However, the report has not been able to ascertain the exact reason for the death of Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist, Kuttappa.It has only stated that further investigation needs to be done to ascertain whether Kuttappa died because of shock or stone-throwing or assault, the law minister said. The probe, done by Mysuru Deputy Commissioner C Shikha, was ordered after the opposition BJP raised a hue and cry on the incident and charged the government with trying to hush up the VHP activists death. The government had been claiming that Kuttappa died due to shock.Jayachandra said the report had found that the then DC and the SP failed to take precautionary measures like holding peace meetings to prevent the clash. Besides, the report has recommended that the government seek clarification from the then Inspector General of Police, southern range, B K Singh, for remaining absent on the day of incident.The meeting also approved a proposal to allow Akshaya Patra Foundation to provide midday meals to schoolchildren using fortified rice. The move is aimed at tackling malnutrition among children. Rice contains mainly starch. The Foundation will add necessary nutrition and proteins to the rice while preparing the midday meal. About 4.5 lakh children covering 2,600 schools will benefit from this decision, he added. The Cabinet also gave its nod to grant 5.7 acres of kharab land at Harohalli in Kanakapura taluk to Mahatma Gandhi Vidyapeet Trust for educational purposes. The Trust will open a hospital and a nursing and pharmacy college. The land will be given at the current guidance value of land, the minister said."

Girish claimed that Prafulla used to turn violent and used to complain against him to his higher-ups.She used to even ill-treat their son, Shashank. Girish had also filed for a divorce a few months ago, the SP informed.Prafulla was also eyeing on Mahadevammas money and pestered her to give her Rs 2 lakh. When Mahadevamma refused to part with the money, Prafulla burnt her sarees.Upset over Prafullas harassment, Girish and Mahadevamma decided to eliminate her with Chidanandas help. Chidananda had tried to serve her rice laced with sleeping pills a month ago. But a suspicious Prafulla had thrown away the rice.Girish then gave Chidananda Rs 50,000 to eliminate her. On June 4, Chidananda took Prafulla to his place for dinner. While returning after nightfall, he halted his two-wheeler on the pretext of checking petrol.He struck her with a machete though Prafulla pleaded him to spare her. He hid the machete below a tree and fled the spot.Girish was previously married but the marriage lasted for only two months. He had divorced his first wife and had married Prafulla."

While the muhurat for the reshuffle is yet to be finalised, many senior ministers have already begun lobbying to somehow retain their position.Political circles are abuzz with speculation on the ministers who are going to be axed and those who are going to make it to the ministry. But neither Siddaramaiah nor State Congress chief G Parameshwara has dropped any hints as to who would be shown the door.However, Siddaramaiah on Wednesday ruled out seeking resignation of all the ministers at Wednesdays council of ministers meeting which he has convened. He insisted that the meeting would focus only on policy matters. There is no Kamaraj or Anna Dorai plan to take mass resignation of ministers, he told reporters on Tuesday.Ministerial aspirants are many and incumbents are in no mood to step down to make way for others. All the 33 berths are full. The chief minister while picking his team has considered various factors including his likings, caste and regional representation.Going by the reports, Siddaramaiah is not too keen on continuing Labour Minister B T Parameshwar Naik and Minor Irrigation Minister Shivaraj Tangadagi.Both belong to the Scheduled Castes. But it would be difficult to remove both of them at once because of caste considerations.It is said that senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge wants the newly elected MLC R B Thimmapur to be made a minister. But that would be difficult because Social Welfare Minister H Anjaneya as well as Thimmapur belong to the SC (left). Anjaneya is close to another senior leader Oscar Fernandes.The list of non-performer ministers who may be shown the door include Qamarul Islam, Baburao Chinchansur and Kimmane Ratnakar, it is said. But even senior ministers H K Patil, R V Deshpande, S R Patil and Roshan Baig are on tenterhooks and were in Delhi to convince party leaders as to why there should be no large-scale changes.RD&PR department headed by H K Patil has witnessed major financial irregularities, while Ratnakar had to face tough time due to PU chemistry question paper leak.It is said that Speaker Kagodu Thimmappa and senior legislator K R Ramesh Kumar, who have been nurturing the hope of becoming ministers, may meet their goal. It is also said that Siddaramaiah has sought the high commands approval for roping in some senior ministers for party work and induct youngsters in the council of ministers. Among the youngsters, the names of newly elected MLC Rizwan Arshad and MLAs Dr K Sudhakar, Priya Krishna and Priyank Kharge are doing the rounds.The reason for convening the council of ministers meeting (wherein those with minister-of-state rank also attend) on Wednesday instead of the state Cabinet (where only Cabinet ministers attend) is to ensure participation of all ministers. Six subjects including supplying fortified rice to schoolchildren under the mid-day meal scheme are on the agenda.Siddaramaiahs weekend visit to Delhi to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi stays, according to the sources in the Chief Ministers Office."

Only Aadhaar number has to be disclosed and there is no need for any other documents under the new system, he added.The department is still working on the new system, and it will in, all probability, be introduced in a months time. Currently, the department is supplying five kg rice and wheat each at a subsidised rate to the APL card holders every month.On a proposal to supply tur dal and urad dal at Rs 120 per kg to people, the minister said the Centre has not allocated sufficient quantity of these pulses to the state.The state has been given 1,000 metric tonnes.An estimated 10,500 metric tonnes is required per month to supply one kg of tur and urad dal per ration card under the public distribution system (PDS). We will take up the offer if the Centre allocates at least 5,000 metric tonnes per month, he added.The Centre recently offered to supply unmilled tur and urad dal to the state at Rs 66 and Rs 82 per kg respectively and asked to ensure availability of the pulses to people at not more than Rs 120 per kg. The Centre made this offer with an aim to give some relief to people from rising prices of pulses.The state has to bear the cost of processing (milling), packing and transportation and distribute to consumers at Rs 120 per kg.Rao said he will soon meet Union Food and Civil Supplies Minister Ramvilas Paswan and urge him to increase the allocation to the state."

The MLCs were asked to have dinner at a room adjoining the Council hall, while it was served in the lobby for the MLAs. In the Assembly, vegetarian food including chapati, rice dishes and gravy were served.The secretariat also deputed medical staff, aside from ensuring medicine and ambulance services. Jammers in both the Houses were switched off to facilitate phone calls by members. Media was not allowed into the lobby. Both the parties allowed their women legislators to go home.As the members were given access to cable TV in the lounges of both the Houses, they spent their time watching panel discussions and news updates on TV channels.

The BJP and the JD(S) members had stayed in the Assembly for one whole night on March 17, 2015 seeking a CBI probe.In November 2013, B S Yeddyurappa, who was then the KJP president had staged an all-night dharna for two nights demanding an extension of Shaadi Baghya scheme to all communities. The session was then held in Belagavi. Prior to that, the Opposition parties had staged a night dharna on July 12, 2010 over the illegal mining issue.However, JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy did not take part in the overnight dharna as he left for Mysuru to resume his sons film shooting.Session may end on FridayThere was speculation in political circles on Wednesday that if the Opposition continues with its day-night dharna until Friday, then the government may get the budget proposals and bills passed amid the din and adjourn both the Houses sine die. The budget proposals have to be passed before July 31 as the legislature had only given its approval for a four-month vote-on-account in March."

However, a state-government survey has found the farmers were prompt in loan repayment.Faced with criticism from his own party legislators over lethargy in administration, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had recently got a rapid assessment survey done of flagship programmes of his government  Anna Bhagya, Krishi Bhagya, Ksheera Bhagya and interest-free farm loans. And he has ensured that his government got a pat on its back with its survey finding efficient implementation of these programmes.The Planning, Programme Monitoring and Statistics (PPMS) department has done the survey, covering all 784 hoblis of the state. The sample size of the survey, conducted between December 2015 and March 2016, was, however, not impressive compared to the total number of beneficiaries. The chief minister had announced all the four programmes even before properly settling in his chair.About 94% of 2,335 farmers surveyed said they were repaying farm loans, and only about 6% of them said they had not been able to repay the loans extended by various cooperative societies. The survey, however, did not cover farmers who have borrowed money from private moneylenders.A record 1,324 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka in 2015-16. One of the main reasons cited by the government was debt burden. Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda had informed the Legislative Assembly in the last session that about 447 farmers had committed suicide due to debt burden.The government's decision to cut the quantum of rice under Anna Bhagya has apparently not gone down well with the beneficiaries. About 73% of 2,256 BPL families have said the monthly supply of food grains was not sufficient. Even 50% of 2,232 Antyodaya Anna Yojane (AAY) families have said food grains given to them under Anna Bhagya was insufficient. BPL families get five kg rice per person free of cost. AAY families get 35 kg rice per month free of cost. Both categories of families get 1 kg each of sugar, palm oil and salt, every month at a subsidised rate.An interesting finding of the survey is that many schoolchildren have said they do not consume milk provided under Ksheera Bhagya because of bad smell. Of the 642 children who said they do not drink the milk, 174 children cited bad smell as the reason."
