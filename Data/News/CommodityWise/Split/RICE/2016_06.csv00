This includes three kg of rice and two kg of wheat/ ragi/jowar.Karnataka is also bringing in a protein component under the public distribution system scheme for the first time by introducing tur dal. Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader told Deccan Herald that tur dal would be sold at a subsidised rate of Rs 30 a kg.Additional burdenKhader said supplying free rice would cost the exchequer around Rs 1,450 crore annually. With the introduction of the coupon system and Aadhaar seeding, the government will save nearly 40,000 metric tonnes of rice per month. Karnataka will request the Centre to sell the surplus rice back to the state at a subsidised rate of Rs 8 or Rs 8.50 per kg. If the Centre agrees to the proposal, the expenditure will then come down to around Rs 240 crore annually, he said.By subsidising tur dal, the government will incur an expenditure of Rs 360 crore annually. The decision to distribute more rice and sell subsidised tur dal follows demands made by BPL families, he said."

The governments subsidy expenditure has almost doubled after Siddaramaiah came to power. But the chief minister justified the schemes, saying they have helped improve the human development index.Siddaramaiah avoided celebrations for commemorating his three years in office citing severe drought in the state. The event was organised to get a feedback from beneficiaries, who were all selected by the government itself. Interestingly, a majority of the beneficiaries who were allowed to speak, heaped praises on Siddaramaiah.Some of them even said the Congress should come back to power in the 2018 Assembly polls and that Siddaramaiah should be the chief minister for a second term.Siddaramaiah also said he will complete his five-year term and hit out at critics, especially the opposition.If my government had not taken off as charged by opposition parties, so many beneficiaries would not have expressed satisfaction. They (opposition parties) have a prejudiced mind...They have no right to speak about corruption. They should be ashamed of themselves, he said."

They had ordered jeera rice and vegetable biriyani. While there was no problem with the jeera rice, the vegetable biriyani was in fact chicken biriyani. Some of the members grew suspicious when they saw some strange pieces on the platter, which did not look like vegetables.Khinwasara said, When we enquired with the waiter, he convinced us that it was basically paneer and mushroom. This made some of us start eating.What some women perceived as mushroom had bones. This angered the members who unleashed their anger at the hotel management.The family sought an explanation from the management to how non-veg food was cooked in a vegetarian restaurant and demanded an appropriate bill with details of chicken biriyani served to them. The apologetic restaurant did not provide any bill and waived the charges.The manager told them that although Rangoli was a veg restaurant, they do cook non-veg in their kitchen for guests in the adjoining Hotel Akshaya Aura. The waiter might have messed up and supplied the chicken biriyani to the family, he said.The Upparpet police confirmed receiving the complaint, but said they had registered the case as non-cognisable. The Khinwasara family has objected to the police registering it as a non-cognisable offence.Our religious sentiments have been hurt by the breach of trust. This should be treated as a wilful attempt to hurt religious sentiments of a community, said a member of the family.When contacted, the hotel management said the hotel had been opened recently and the family was blaming them to malign the hotels reputation."

But they are dying one by one due to the unavailability of green grass.The lack of proper maintenance of the goshala has resulted in the calves being fed dry grass, which cannot be digested easily, thus weakening them physically, said Sunil Garal, a resident of the village.Calves also feed on cooked rice offered by devotees. Their stomachs bloat as cooked rice is not considered good for their health and there have been deaths of calves due to this, said Ashok Veerappa, president of the Changalera Gram Panchayat. He says that there are many staffers in the temple, but no one has an idea as to what their work is.Two calves died on Friday evening and a number of others have been ill, creating panic among the village residents.A number of cows have injury marks on their bodies due to lack of proper care or treatment.The goshala is home to 30 cows and 80 calves and the temple is under the care of the assistant commissioner of Basavakalyan, who is the temple administrator. The temple comes under the department of religious endowments.No arrangementWhat is adding to the problem is that there is no arrangement to shift the carcasses of the calves out of the goshala. This has resulted in stray dogs feeding on the carcasses, raising the risk of epidemics. People in the village are of the opinion that it would have been better for the cattle had there been no goshala as they would then not have been gifted to the temple by the people.Efforts by the village residents to contact the assistant commissioner and the Humnabad tahsildar in this regard have proved futile.They say it would be better to close down the goshala. The government had closed down all goshalas in the district last June, but spared this one."

In absolute terms, the hike will result in petrol costing more by Rs 1.89 per litre and diesel by Re 0.98 per litre. The hike will come into effect from April 1. Karnataka is among states which levy the highest tax on petroleum products. In addition, five% entry tax is levied on every litre of petrol or diesel coming into the State.The chief minister defended the move to hike sales tax of fuels by stating that the Centre increased the excise duties on petrol and diesel thrice during the last one year to compensate for the loss in revenue due to slash in crude oil prices, but the State government did not increase the tax rate.Siddaramaiah has also tinkered with the commercial tax rates on a number of commodities. The Value Added Tax (VAT) on soft drinks has been increased from the present 14.5 to 20 per cent. If the manufacturer decides to pass on the hike to the consumer, a 200 ml bottle of soft drink would cost more by a minimum of Re one.Two staple food products of north and south Karnataka jowar roti and ragi roti respectively have been exempted from VAT. Also aluminium household utensils (except pressure cookers and cutlery) have been exempted from VAT. Exemption from VAT for paddy, rice, wheat, pulses and products of rice and wheat has been continued for one more year.VAT cut on helmet, LEDThe VAT rates on a number of items has been reduced from 14.5 to 5.5 per cent.

We have also cut the VAT rates on helmets as the safety gear has also been made mandatory for pillion riders, commercial taxes commissioner Ritvik Pandey said.Agri income tax scrappedThe State government has decided to do away with Agricultural Income Tax (AIT). The commercial taxes department used to collect AIT on commercial crops like coffee, tea, rubber as per the provisions of the Karnataka Agricultural Income Tax Act, 1957.It was a long-standing demand of planters that AIT be abolished as it led to multiple taxation. The department had collected AIT to the tune of Rs 19.77 crore in 2014-15.What they say...This is the worst budget of all times. The borrowings are increasing by the day. There should have been an increase in plan expenditure and additional grants for developmental projects. But the reverse is happening. This could leadto economic disaster.B S yeddyurappa, BJP leaderIt is a very disappointing budget. Hike in sales tax on petrol and diesel and additional tax on private vehicles will burden the common man. Its a lifeless budget and the concerns of the people of North Karnataka have been ignored.

She was, however, acquitted of charges of murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy.The quantum of punishment will be decided on August 29.The only other accused in the case, Mina Devis husband Arjun Yadav alias Arjun Rai, was acquitted of all charges.The victims parents expressed shock at the verdict. Raju Shah, who lost his son Krishna (6) to the tragedy, said: If there was no criminal conspiracy, who would take responsibility of serving the poisonous food. This way, any school principal can get away with mild punishment for an act of negligence.Krishna, who liked soyabean curry, had stayed back for the lunch served at the school on Mondays. He had died a few hours after eating food along with 22 other children. Krishnas sister Lakshmi had a providential escape as she had left to eat at home.Overall, 80 children had eaten the meal of soyabean curry and rice at the school, which was run from a single-hall community centre.As books had to be distributed that day, attendance at the school was higher than on usual days.

Her body was found naked with deep gashes on her face, leading the police to suspect that she may have been sexually assaulted before being killed.A resident of Pimpri Pada, a hamlet of tribal families, spotted the body in the forest and rang the police control room at 8.45 am. By the time the police reached the spot at 9.30 am, a large crowd of locals had gathered.The unidentified woman is believed to be around 25 years of age. Her body was found in a nude state. There was sindoor (vermilion) applied on her forehead, said M Ramkumar, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone XII.He added that there were deep cuts and scratches on her forehead, eyes, nose, cheeks and chin.Ramkumar said the injuries may have been caused with a stone.There are also red marks on the neck and a post mortem will tell us exactly what happened, he said.A sniffer dog also found a pair of grey-and-red slippers, a sari and a pink handkerchief, which the police believe belonged to the woman, in addition to two beer bottles close by.In the afternoon, the womans body was sent to Bhagwati Hospital in Borivli for a post-mortem.Ramkumar said it appears that she was killed on Thursday evening.The police have sent out descriptions of the woman across the city and are examining all complaints of missing women lodged in the past 24 hours.The area where the womans body was found is a ten-minute walk away from an entrance gate to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park and a large BMC water tank.In 2011, four men were killed allegedly by gangster Uday Pathak not far from here.Hanuman Tekdi, so named because of its proximity to a Hanuman temple and also a mosque, is a rocky plateau.Bhangibai Birari, who grows rice and millet on a plot nearby, believes the dead woman is not a local.Women living here do not apply sindoor.

The Supreme Court by order dated 28 December, 1995 requested the Prime Minister to resolve the issue of implementation of its order, which was then duly done to the satisfaction of all parties, he said.Watch Video: Whats making newsComplying with the apex courts order, Karnataka government has been releasing 15,000 cusecs of water to Tamil Nadu since Tuesday, triggering a wave of protests particularly in the Cauvery basin districts with Mandya being the epicentre of the stir. While maintaining that the release was inevitable, Karnataka government has said it would seek modification of the apex courts September five order to spare water for 10 days because of the difficulties in implementing it given that the live storage in four reservoirs in the Cauvery basin now was 46.7 TMCFT against their capacity of 104 TMCFT. The present live storage is 45 per cent against the live storage of 104 TMCFT in the Krishnaraja Sagar, Harangi, Hemavathi and Kabini reservoirs, the government has said.READ | Karnataka hit by bandh over Cauvery dispute, schools, offices shutSiddaramaiah, in his letter, has invited the Prime Ministers immediate attention to the stark facts already in the public arena about extreme unrest in the Cauvery basin, especially in Bengaluru against the courts interim order on release of water. He said the daily release of 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water at the inter state border, Biligundulu, which, if continued, would completely deprive the drinking water not only to the residents of Bangalore City but also to farmers of Cauvery basin and water for the only crop they grow.

And they were told at the homes of the five tribal and Dalit villagers who were killed, allegedly in crossfire between Maoists and the polices Special Operations Group (SOG).The initial count was six dead until villagers and police realised that one among that group, Luta Digal, a Dalit, had survived with injuries.

The teams chief maintains that they came under fire and had to fire back. But let me make it clear that the deceased were not Maoists, said Mishra.Asked why the SOG team could not determine through their night-vision devices that the villagers were unarmed, Mishra said the heavy rains that night had hampered the policemen.The killings also triggered a political firestorm with the BJP declaring a bandh in Kandhamal on Monday.

Things were then sorted out, he said.They have advised Sharmila to start a process of reintegration with the society as she has been living in isolation from the rest of the world for the last 16 years.She needs a reality check. The world is not the same as it used to be when she began her fast.

The SP was accused of attempting to aid the accused through re-opening of investigations.The case related to embezzlement of paddy worth about Rs 5 crore, allegedly by the owner of Jagmohan Enterprises Rice Mill, Jagmohan Singh. The challan was presented in court on December 17, 2013.On a complaint by Jagmohans wife, Salwinder conducted another inquiry on September 15, 2014.

If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

Disturbing TV visuals of her ministers taking bribe, collapse of a Kolkata flyover killing over 20 people prior to the election had little impact on the results in West Bengal as Mamata Banerjee stormed back to power for a second consecutive term, leaving many political pundits baffled and fumbling for words to explain her unbelievably massive victory both in terms of seats and vote share.How can one explain Mamatas triumph? Is the mandate a yes in favour of her governments development activities or a no to a hastily conjured alliance of two ideologically opposed partners, the Left and the Congress? The story contains both.The no factorTrouble was brewing within the Left-Congress alliance since its inception. Many CPM leaders, from the Polit Bureau to the district committees, were ideologically opposed to the idea of joining hands with the Congress. It is no longer a secret now that many Left voters chose NOTA (None Of The Above) instead of an alliance candidate. Similarly, a large number of Congress supporters refused to vote for Left candidates, they voted for the Trinamool instead. In short, neither the arithmetic nor the chemistry worked for the alliance.The Left-Congress partnership emerged too late, barely two months before the polls, giving it too little time to bloom. Also, after repeated electoral debacles, first in the 2011 Assembly polls and then in the municipal and Lok Sabha elections, the powerful organisation of the Left, which won them so many elections in the past, collapsed completely. So, while Trinamool workers were busy campaigning in the villages, the Left leaders had little option but to use air-conditioned studios of news channels as their primary vehicles of campaign.The silent voters, whose votes finally determine the outcome of every election, did not trust the alliance. Many believed the Left-Congress bonhomie would not last long even if the alliance came to power. As a result, the government would fall, requiring another round of elections. These silent voters chose stability and voted for the Trinamool.The Muslim community influenced electoral outcome in at least 80 of the 294 seats by supporting the Trinamool. The Left could be credited for preventing communal riots, but they virtually did nothing for the Muslims during their 30-year rule. True, Mamata promised much and delivered little, but unlike the Left, she delivered something, felt the Muslims, particularly those in the rural areas.Finally, the Left-Congress leaders expectations on the possible swing in the BJPs vote share in their favour went horribly wrong. True to their calculations, the BJPs vote share came down from 17% to 10%, but the swing entirely favoured the Trinamool.The yes factorStrange though it may sound, but many of the accusations against Mamata in fact helped her. The Trinamool was accused of running a syndicate raj in West Bengal. True, the syndicates fleece realtors, supply low-grade building materials at prices much higher than the market rates, but syndicate members, mostly men in their 20s and 30s, have no other source of livelihood.There are at least 30,000 syndicate members in the Rajarhat-New Town area alone, and the Left-Congress alliances promise of action against syndicates if they came to power worried these young men and they worked body and soul to ensure a Trinamool victory. Syndicates exist in all urban areas in Bengal and all of them worked for the Trinamool. Similarly, the Oppositions charge that the government was wasting tax payers money to give donations to the local clubs alienated the club members, who doggedly worked to ensure Mamatas victory.On the other hand, in spite of the financial constraints and the resulting shoe-string budget, Mamatas government successfully implemented a slew of development projects, particularly in the rural and semi-urban areas. In spite of repeated incidents of violence against women, Mamata managed to win them over by distributing cycles to girl students. Owning a cycle in a village is like possessing a Maruti car in a city. Interestingly, the idea of distributing cycles was floated by a chief secretary during the last leg of the Left Front rule, but the proposal was bluntly shot down by the then finance minister Asim Dasgupta.Finally, distribution of rice at Rs 2 per kg came as Mamatas masterstroke. Better road connectivity, availability of water and medicines increased the Trinamools vote share. Though corruption was clearly visible, local Trinamool leaders were pardoned by the rural voters. Issues like the Saradha chit fund scam, Narada sting operation, flyover collapse and campus violence eroded the Trinamools vote share, but the erosion was confined to urban seats and every Narada-tainted minister won, albeit with a lower margin.So, where does Mamata go from here? Insiders say Delhi is her next target. If the Third Front takes shape after the Uttar Pradesh elections, she hopes to play a major role at the Centre. Till then, she will concentrate on the next panchayat election in West Bengal to further consolidate her position.(The writer is a senior journalist based in Kolkata)"

Government has earmarked `1.30 lakh crore budget for the current financial year but in six months (April to September 2016), it spent around `47,000 crore, which means the budget may not cross `97,000 crore for 2016-17, Jana Reddy said and wanted a short discussion on the issue.However, Rajender said the state has achieved revenue surplus in last two years, ie, `369 crore for 2014-15, `3,128 crore for 2015-16. He said the Centre allowed borrowing upto 3.5 percent for the current financial year.Rajender said the revenue receipts have been good till now in the form of sales tax (increased by 22 per cent), tax on vehicles (35 per cent), stamps and registration (56 per cent) and income from Excise increased too. If there is any deficit due to demonetisation, the Centre will come to the rescue of the state,he said."

This has also helped in increasing attendance of students in schools, Rajender said.Replying to a question raised by TRS members G Balaraju, G Kishore Kumar and others, Rajender, reacting to the demand of members for introduction of fine rice in meals for Intermediate and college students, said a decision would be taken after discussing the matter with Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao.During 2015-16, about 29,86,010 students in 34,319 schools and 5,39,315 boarders in 3,069 hostels benefited under the Sanna Biyyam scheme. `662.23 crore was spent on the said scheme for 2015-16. As many as 1,35,93 college students will additionally be covered. The department is purchasing three superior qualities of fine rice like BPT and sona masuri etc.On the directions of CM, government has decided to do away with restriction on quantity of food being supplied to students as it was not ideal to limit the quantity of food for children to 175 grams or above of rice, considering their nutritional needs at the growing age. It would be unfair on our part to restrict their intake, he said."

She was very weak and had white patches on her face indicating vitamin deficiency, said Radha, who works at the Telangana State Tribal welfare school at Lokari.K village some 336 km from Hyderabad.Arju belongs to the Gond village of Ganeshpur, Narnoor mandal of Adilabad district. Her step-mother neglected her and her father, a farmer, never intervened. Her birth mother had passed away two years ago.I would be hungry but my step-mother would not give me food. When I asked for food, she told me to work and only then I would get to eat, said Arju.There are 150 girls between six and 11 years at the residential school. When they first arrived their health was not very good either, noted Radha. The school has helped. They are given food three times a day here. We give them rice, roti, dal, curry, and rava. Eggs too are a part of the menu, said Radha. Arjus health has improved significantly after she was brought here.Walk 500 metres from the school and the situation at the villages anganwadi centre is completely different. The children here fall sick all the time. The quality of food supplies we get is poor. Often we have to throw out the eggs because they are rotten, said J Subadhra, who has been an anganwadi worker for over 25 years.The biggest problem Subadhra faces is the lack of a steady supply of cooking essentials to the anganwadi centre. She said the problem was not restricted to her centre. The last time we got stock was a quintal of rice in Sept, she said. She sometimes has to borrow provisions from other anganwadis or from nearby schools.The Lokari.K anganwadi serves midday meals to 38 children in lower primary classes. The anganwadi also feeds 16 lactating women. The road leading to Lokari.K is the entry point to many of the 53 villages of Narnoor mandal. If our anganwadi, which is at the start of the road, doesnt get rations, you can imagine the state of those down the road, Subadhra added.Mid-day meal schemeMid-day meal schemes in India have a long history. First introduced across three states in the mid-eighties, the scheme got Central funding in 1995. The Integrated Child Development Service scheme, under which the anganwadis fall, serves approximately 100 million children. The funding pattern for the scheme until 2015 was 90:10 with Centre bearing 90 pc of the costs. But that changed in Nov 2015 with the funding pattern becoming 60:40, with states taking on a larger share. The 2015-16 budget saw a 7 pc cut in funding for the sole scheme.Dr Ambika Patel of the village Public Healthcare Centre (PHC) said there was no serious health problems for the children as there was higher school enrolment in the tribal belt. She is one of only two doctors serving the population of 48 villages from Narnoor and Gandiguda mandals. It is difficult to manage with just two doctors, she admitted.The children here are prone to common cold and viral fever and there are cases of malnutrition in this belt but it is still better than other districts, said Patel. Of the 214 pregnant women registered with the PHC since April this year, 51 in numbers or 24 pc of the women were found to be anaemic, revealed the hospital records.The National Family Health Survery-4 (NFHS-4) 2014-15 puts the women in Adilabad as the most anaemic among TS districts (before reorganisation) but no data is available on the number of anaemic children. Maternal anaemia is one of the reasons for high infant stillbirths in the state and country. Nutritional factors too play a role.India is among the high-ranking nations when it comes to maternal deaths, neo-natal deaths and stillbirths. All the three are related to anaemia in women.Over 10 pc of the children are anaemic in this area, said Girija, the staff nurse at the hospital. If the mothers are anaemic, their children will be too.The anganwadi workers said even though they provided the mothers with nutritious food, they shared it with their other children and family members.The PHC maintains links with remote villages through the ANMs who have a crucial role to play in achieving last-mile connectivity in delivering health services to children. One such ANM is P Triveni, who works at the tribal welfare school at Arjuni.K village. She has not been paid her full salary since June. She has been paid only `8,000 whereas she is entitled to receive `5,000 per month. Its better to work rather than not work. At least I will be paid someday, said Triveni.We are able to provide mid-day meals to the children as the food ration is supplied by education department, she explained. But as anganwadi next door does not do that well, we share our rations. We provide them with good quality rations. If the food quality is not good we send them back, said M Umadevi, Adilabad district welfare officer (ICDS). The department has been facing problems in last few months with the billing of food supplies. Whatever (supplies) we get we send across. We dont get rice, dal and oil in a go so we are able to send as and when it arrives, said Umadevi. The budget gets sanctioned only once in three months. The bills have all been frozen by state government, she added.Sanitation facilities nilIf the food supply in rural Adilabad is inconsistent, sanitation facilities are almost non-existent. Few houses have toilets.Ask Atram Lachu, the village chief of Arjuni.K how many toilets his village has and he chuckles. For the 48 families in this village, there are only six toilets and none in use, he admitted.The main problem is water. During summers there is no water here, he said. The village does not have a water distribution system. This is a hilly region and soil here does not retain water, said Srikanth S, project coordinator with Mahita, an NGO working with tribal women and children at Adilabad. We used to conduct medical camps but people were hesitant to approach the doctors...There are no awareness programmes on health and hygiene for the people of these areas, he added.It is a problem with not just Adilabad but across the state,he said.Lets be committed to reaching every last childThe five-day Child First campaign by The New Indian Express and Save The Children, that concludes today, has been an attempt to highlight ground realities in Telangana. Children constitute about 39 per cent of population of TS. The state has a high tribal population as well. There is need to address malnutrition, school drop-outs, child labour, early marriages, teen pregnancy, migration and child poverty. No child should be excluded from the opportunity to survive and learn, yet millions of children globally are being left behind simply because of who they are and where they live. India aspires to be a superpower largely with the confidence that in coming decades it would have a large young population. But, what if the youth of tomorrow are not healthy, educated and happy? The Sustainable Development Goals, agreed upon by 189 member countries of UN, commit us to make the world a happier and healthier place by 2030. The Child First stories were an attempt to hear from TSs children and know their aspirations. Today is Childrens Day. Lets make it a special one by realising responsibility in our individual and institutional capacity.The writer, Alka Singh, is GM - Telangana & AP State Programme(Save the Children) state has much more to achieve on nutritional front: Save the ChildrenThe real problem today in persisting poor health and nutrition status appears to be outreach. There is a need to strengthen service delivery of health, nutrition and education to reach Every Last Child.Malnutrition is a serious impediment to a childs well-being and is the underlying factor for morbidity as well as death. Despite numerous Centre and state-funded Reproductive and Child health programmes in operation, the data shows that state has much more to do on the health and nutritional front. Special focus has to be on the poorest performing regions that come under districts such as Adilabad, Warangal, Khammam and Mahbubnagar.Age at the time of child birth needs to be observed as a social as well as a health issue. Data show that 24 per cent of the children born in the state were to young women in the 15-19 age groups. This puts the state at the eighth rank in the country. This is undesirable as it exposes young women to early pregnancy and is a health risk both for mother and child.Recommendations"

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power talks to the media as she arrives for United Nations Security Council consultations, Thursday, Feb. 25, 2016. A U.N. resolution proposed against North Korea after its recent nuclear test and rocket launch will affect exchanges with its traditional ally China, that countrys top diplomat said Thursday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)The United States on Thursday introduced a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that it said will significantly increase pressure on North Korea in response to its latest nuclear test and rocket launch.Ambassador Samantha Power said the draft, which for the first time would subject cargo ships leaving and entering North Korea to mandatory inspections, goes farther than previous sanctions and is meant to ensure North Korea will be held accountable for its actions.It is a major upgrade and there will be, provided it goes forward, pressure on more points, tougher, more comprehensive, more sectors. Its breaking new ground in a whole host of ways, Power said before heading into a closed-door meeting where the U.S. planned to circulate the draft to all 15 council members.The draft is the result of an agreement between the United States and China, North Koreas main ally and Beijings involvement signals a policy shift with regard to its often erratic neighbor. The council is expected to vote on it over the weekend.WATCH VIDEOWe are opposed to any nuclear testing and the launch testing of ballistic missile technology and we hope this resolution will help to prevent further occurrences of this nature, Chinas Ambassador Liu Jieyi said following the meeting.Jieyi said China was working very closely with other members of the Security Council and that he hoped the resolution would achieve the objective of denuclearization and result in peace and stability.In Washington, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the resolution praised Chinas cooperation.I do think that it is indicative of how productive diplomacy can be. Its not easy, but it certainly is an indication that the United States and China, when our interests are aligned, can cooperate quite effectively to advance the interests of citizens in both our countries, Earnest said.Power said the sanctions would also prohibit the sale of small arms and other conventional weapons to North Korea, closing a loophole in earlier resolutions.Power said sanctions would also limit and in some cases ban exports of coal, iron gold titanium and rare earth minerals from North Korea and would prohibit countries from supplying aviation fuel, including rocket fuel to the country.In addition, the resolution imposes financial sanctions targeting North Korean banks and assets and bans all dual use nuclear and missile related items.These sanctions, if adopted, would send an unambiguous and unyielding message to the DPRK: The world will not accept you proliferation. There will be consequences for your actions and we will work relentlessly and collectively to stop your nuclear program, Power said.She stressed that the sanctions targeted the ruling elite and not the North Korean people.The North Korean people have suffered so much already under one of the most brutal regimes the world has ever known, Power said.Items such as luxury watches, snowmobiles, recreational water vehicles and lead crystal were also added to a long list of luxury goods that North Korea is not allowed to import.We remain clear-eyed about the prospects of an immediate change in DPRKs behavior but we have seen how robust sanctions can alter a governments dangerous nuclear ambitions in other contexts, Power said, referring to North Korea by the abbreviation for its official name, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea.North Korea started off the new year with what it claims was its first hydrogen bomb test on Jan. 6 and followed that up with the launch of a satellite on a rocket on Feb. 7 that was condemned by much of the world as a test of banned missile technology.Over the past 20 years, North Korea has conducted four nuclear tests and launched six long-range rockets  all in violation of Security Council resolutions.The U.N. draft follows a flurry of activity in Washington, including meetings between Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday, and with National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Wednesday.Jeong Joon-Hee, a spokesman of Seouls Unification Ministry, said the measures included in the draft would significantly hurt the Norths foreign currency income because its estimated that minerals account for nearly 40 percent the countrys exports.The U.S., its Western allies and Japan, also pressed for new sanctions that go beyond the Norths nuclear and missile programs. But China, Pyongyangs neighbor and supporter on the council, is reluctant to impose measures that could threaten the stability of North Korea and cause the countrys economy to collapse.The United States has taken tougher steps of its own against North Korea, tightening sanctions and announcing it will hold formal talks with South Korea on deploying a missile defense system that China fears could be used against it as well North Korea.South Korea and Japan have also announced new measures against Pyongyang.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: AP)The fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old Columbus boy who officers said pulled a BB gun from his waistband that looked like a real weapon will be investigated thoroughly to determine if charges are warranted.In a killing with unavoidable echoes of the Tamir Rice case out of Cleveland, a Columbus officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot a young boy Wednesday night after he pulled out a BB gun that looked practically identical to the weapon that police officers use, authorities said.Evidence from the shooting will automatically be presented to a grand jury to determine whether the officers actions were justified.Mayor Andrew Ginther appeared to choke up Thursday as he called for the community to come together and questioned why an eighth-grader would have a replica of a police firearm.There is something wrong in this country, and it is bringing its epidemic to our city streets, Ginther said Thursday. And a 13-year-old is dead in the city of Columbus because of our obsession with guns and violence.Dozens attended a vigil Thursday night near the shooting, including members of Tyres youth football team. Some carried signs calling for justice for Tyre, while candles spelled out RIP Tyre King.The boys family called for an investigation conducted in a manner that ensures fairness and truth, and said people shouldnt rush to judgment about Tyres activities that night.Police and city authorities also promised a full investigation, while rejecting comparisons to the 2014 killing of 12-year-old Tamir in Cleveland.Officers investigating the robbery report east of downtown Columbus spotted three males who matched the description of the suspects, authorities said. Two of the males ran away when officers tried to speak with them.The police chased the pair into an alley and tried to take them into custody. Tyre pulled out a gun with a laser sight, and an officer fired, hitting the boy multiple times, police said. Tyre later died at a hospital.The officer was identified as Bryan Mason, a nine-year veteran of the force. Police records show that in 2012 he shot and killed a man who was holding another person at gunpoint. The Columbus Dispatch said investigators cleared him.In keeping with department policy, Mason has been placed on leave while Tyres shooting is investigated. A call to the head of the police union representing him was not immediately returned.An attorney for Tyres family, Sean Walton, called for an independent investigation. Walton would not discuss any previous dealings Tyre had with police but said the boy had no violent criminal history. He said the family believes Tyres involvement in an armed robbery would be out of character.Tyre played several sports, including football, and was in the young scholars program at school, Walton said. He had a slight build and, if anything, was on the small side for his age, the attorney said.In Tamirs case, a 911 caller reported someone pointing a gun at people near a recreation center. A rookie officer shot the boy almost immediately after pulling up in his cruiser. The officer and his partner were cleared of wrongdoing.The 911 caller had said the person with the gun was probably a juvenile and the weapon was probably fake, but that information was never passed on to the officers.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Brian Rice, the Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams was unequivocal in his ruling on July 18. In acquitting Lt. Brian Rice, the Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams was unequivocal in his ruling on July 18.A judge further hollowed out the case against six police officers charged in the death of a young black man, delivering a third consecutive acquittal and ruling once again that prosecutors failed to prove officers intentionally hurt Freddie Gray.In acquitting Lt. Brian Rice, the highest ranking officer charged, Baltimore Circuit Judge Barry Williams was unequivocal in his ruling on July 18. He told prosecutors they failed to establish that Rice was aware of his duty to buckle Gray into a seat belt, and more importantly, that he deliberately breached his duty in order to put Gray in danger.There are a number of possibilities this court could entertain, some that are innocent and some that are not, Williams said. However, the burden of proof rests with the state, and the courts imaginings do not serve as a substitute for evidence.Gray was arrested in April 2015 when he ran from police in a high-crime area. He was handcuffed and shackled but left unbuckled in the back of a police van and suffered a critical neck injury. Grays name became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, fueling outrage nationwide over the treatment of black people by the criminal justice system and prompting the worst rioting in the city in decades.Also Read| Baltimore judge clears second officer in Freddie Gray deathWatch Video: Whats making newsThe US Justice Department launched a patterns and practice investigation into allegations of widespread abuse and unlawful arrests by the Baltimore Police Department.Rice was cleared of manslaughter, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office. Earlier this year, officers Edward Nero and Caesar Goodson, the van driver who was facing a murder charge, were also found not guilty. Officer William Porters trial ended in a hung jury in December and his retrial is scheduled for September. The last two officers have trials this month and in October.Gray died April 19, 2015, a week after he suffered a critical spinal injury in the back of Goodsons police wagon. Prosecutors say the officers were criminally negligent when they failed to buckle Gray into a seat belt or provide medical attention after he indicated that he wanted to go to a hospital.With no courtroom victories, activists are focusing on protests and police department reforms. A protest Saturday that blocked the interstate through downtown resulted in more than 60 arrests. Activists said they were demonstrating in support of having civilians sit on boards that review police misconduct cases, and spending more public money on community programs instead of policing.Im disgusted, as usual, and theyre sending a daily message all across the world that our lives dont matter, and thats sad, said Tawanda Jones outside the courthouse Monday. She was there marking the third anniversary of her brothers death in a separate case involving Baltimore police.Also Read| Baltimore: Experts explore ethics of more trials in Freddie Gray caseWere more than hashtags and body bags, she added.The Gray case hasnt fit quite so neatly into the narrative of white authorities imposing unfair justice on minorities.Three of the officers charged are white and three are black. The victim, judge, top prosecutor and mayor are African-American. At the time of Grays death, so was the police chief.In his verdict, Williams said the failure to seat belt a detainee in a transport wagon is not inherently a crime.The state failed to show that the defendant, even if he was aware of the risk, consciously disregarded that risk, the judge said.Prosecutors and defense attorneys are barred from commenting due to a gag order.During the trial, prosecutors had said Rice was most responsible of the six officers charged for following police procedures to fasten a prisoner in a seat belt, citing his 18 years of experience on the force.The officers attorney said police could use discretion, if they believe their safety is at risk. Rice attorney Michael Belsky said officers had concerns because Gray was not cooperative and they werent sure what onlookers would do if extra time was taken to fasten Gray in the van.Prosecutors and defense attorneys gave different characterizations of the onlookers. Prosecutors described them as concerned observers, while Belsky said officers heard threatening comments during the arrest.Williams said Monday that the definition of a crowd is not set in stone, however it is clear from witness accounts that emotions and tensions ran high, and information did not flow efficiently.The reality of what happened is not clear cut, he said.Baltimore States Attorney Marilyn Mosby vowed to bring justice to an aggrieved citizenry when she announced the charges last year. But she has yet to find success in court, and is being sued for defamation by five of the officers.Warren Alperstein, a prominent lawyer in the city who has been observing the case, questioned whether the other cases should go to trial.There are no more theories to put forth to a judge or a jury for that matter, and the state really has to think about, you know, not prosecuting anymore, Alperstein said outside the courthouse.Despite increasing pressure from critics to drop the three remaining cases, it is unlikely Mosby will dismiss the charges.At a news conference, Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 President Gene Ryan called for the remaining cases to be dismissed, calling it malicious prosecution against the remaining three officers.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said Monday he doesnt see the point of moving forward with trials against the three remaining officers.Matt Clark, a Hogan spokesman, said the Republican governor responded to a question after the acquittal of Lt. Brian Rice. The Washington Post reported Hogan said: Its a waste of time and money, adding but thats up to the court system to decide.At the Republican National Convention on Monday night, one of the speakers, Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke, called Rices acquittal good news.The comment from Clarke, who is black, was met with rousing applause from the GOP audience.Grays family received a $6.4 million settlement from the city.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Narendra Vaskar With no local train station on the Panvel-Kajrat line, villagers in the area have to spend almost five hours a day to commute to the city. Narendra VaskarABOUT 15 kilometre away from Panvel, in a cluster of 11 villages, a small sea of people heads towards Mumbai city every day to work and study. Bhingarwadi, Bhingar, Shedung, Belavali, Vardoli, Bherle and Moho are little villages where villagers have traditionally been engaged in the cultivation of rice and vegetables to sell in nearby markets. Today, a sizeable number of these villagers seeks employment in the city  those who are educated, find jobs in the service sector, and the rest work as watchmen and labourers.Watch What Else is Making NewsHowever, these commuters face a major problem as the closest local train station is in Panvel, on the Harbour Line of Central Railway , making the daily commute a struggle. The commuters need to travel from their respective villages in shared rickshaws and buses to Panvel station, from where they head to Navi Mumbai, Thane and Mumbai for work.Bharat Patil, sarpanch of the Belavli-Vardoli group gram panchayat, said, It takes the villagers around two hours every day just to reach Panvel station because they need to wait for a long time for the rickshaws and buses. This means that well over five hours are spent every day just commuting. This daily shuttling is costly too  for one trip to Panvel, the cost is Rs 10-12. According to Patil, his panchayati area has a total population of around 3,500 people of whom around 500 make this daily commute.There has been a long-standing demand in this area for the establishment of a local train station here to make access to the city easier. This has also been taken up by Lok Sabha MP Shriranga Barne who has been conveying the need for a local railway station at Bhingarwadi on the Panvel-Karjat line to Union Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.The railway lines were laid several years back and goods trains and trains going to Pune function on these tracks, but the suburban railway system has not been extended here. This has been a sustained demand of the villagers and their panchayats for around two years now with no result so far. Now, that the project has got a nod from Prabhu, hopes that it will be implemented are high.This is a public requirement. The villagers, especially students, who have to travel so much every day really suffer a lot. It will benefit not only the people of my villages but all the adjoining villages as well, said Patil.The number of villagers heading out to work has accelerated with the creation of work opportunities with the development of Navi Mumbai. Better connectivity with a new station will benefit not only current commuters but will also open up new opportunities.Shiv Sena worker Kiran Chavan said: Currently, a lot of people are not able to go to the city for small jobs because most of their salary will be spent on travelling; better train connectivity will open options. Those who sell vegetables they grow, can only go as far as the markets of Panvel, but cheap travel will enable them to go further if needed.The construction of a suburban railway station here is likely to prompt new construction and development activities in this area. Big builders have initiated large residential projects in this area over the past one and half years. With a railway station on the anvil, this scenic green rural landscape on the outskirts of Mumbai may be up for a big transformation soon.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In an exhaustive menu, the restaurant gave options of South Indian delights such as Pongal (rice pudding) and Avial (vegetable mix) for breakfast, and idly or dosa ( both made of rice batter), with unlimited sambhar.The owner has another branch running in the vicinity for over 80 years, started by his late father V S Mani. Narayanaswami now plans to open another branch to replace the one shutting down.Mani had started an Onam feast tradition called Thiruvonam Sadya, when the restaurant operated from Sion.The feast, Narayanaswami said, started in 1976 and included meals priced at 65 paise. Narayanaswami religiously carried out the ritual at the Matunga branch on Tiruvonam. The meal would be served on tender banana leaves, from which food is to be consumed by hand.Typical preparations such as Pachadi, Kichadi, Erissery, Kalan, Thoran, Olan and Avial would be part of the many-course meal.

(Source: File PTI photo)A delegation of opposition parties in Tamil Nadu on Friday met President Pranab Mukherjee and sought his intervention in the setting up of Cauvery Management Board, a demand Karnataka is opposed to. The leaders belonging to these parties later lashed out at the defiant attitude of Karnataka in complying with the apex court orders over release of waters from Cauvery and alleged they are making the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu into a begging bowl.A delegation of Peoples Welfare Front (PWF) leaders, headed by CPI national secretary and Rajya Sabha MP D Raja,submitted a memorandum to the President containing their demands. Cauvery does not belong to any particular state. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are riparian states and they have same rights over the river. We requested the President to safeguard the rights of Tamil Nadu and to speed up the Constitution of Cauvery Management Board, Raja told reporters outside the Rashtrapati Bhawan.MDMK leader Vaiko, who was part of the delegation, said that the alleged denial of water has resulted in a loss of Rs 8,000 crore to Tamil Nadu this year. Karnatakas denial of water, which was legitimately alloted to us, has resulted in a total loss of Rs 8,000 crore to the state this year. We fear that our rice bowl is becoming a begging bowl due to this, he said.The Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunals final verdict came in 2007 and the state of Karnataka remains defiant even after the apex court had ordered to release of water for us, Vaiko added. The PWF leaders criticised Karnataka also over its plans of constructing two dams on the river, expressing apprehensions that it will result in a drought-like situation in 16 districts of Tamil Nadu including its capital Chennai.We requested the President to consider our concerns regarding these issues to which he assured to take necessarysteps. Vaiko said. When asked about the Fronts silence over the issue for the past two years even after the publication of award in the Central government Gazette, Vaiko said the Front had not taken up the issue in the way it has now as the previous UPA government had not ruled out the formation of the Board.But now, its the Modi government which is saying that it wont constitute the Board.

Translated, it means Vashi is a noose.The village was surrounded by water on all sides. There was no electricity, no schools, not much employment apart from fishing. There would be trouble finding brides for the men of Vashigaon. Thats how the saying came to be, explains 70-year-old Rambhau Patil, whose father Shantaram Patil is a former sarpanch of Vashigaon.Then, a bridge was built across the Thane creek in 1970, and suddenly the village was close to Mumbai.Patil, who has authored several books on the history of Vashigaon and on that of a Shiva temple in the village, recalls that work began on the bridge, now a part of the Sion-Panvel Highway, in 1963. Old timers recall how they would have to take a boat to cross the Thane creek to reach Mankhurd, from where they would connect to the Mumbai suburban train network.The small community of fishermen would sell fish in the Mumbai markets and cultivate rice on patches of the island.Vashigaon locals were very involved in the making of the bridge. It gave men and women from the village the first job opportunity not connected with fishing, Patil says.The bridge was completed in 1970, paving the way for the development of Navi Mumbai. Villagers say they were initially skeptical about the promise of development.City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited (CIDCO) was then formed, which bought land around 95 villages to develop the township.Villagers recall how many of them had protested in 1972 against CIDCO for better compensation and employment for youngsters. The demography of our village changed after that. With secure jobs and better facilities, our village became part of the city, says Rajaram Joshi, a fisherman born here.The village with around 600 families till six decades ago now has over 3,000 homes, mostly of migrants. In the area, 75 per cent was water and only 25 per cent was land. The order has reversed now, said another resident, Anand Bhagat, who was born in the same year as the protest against CIDCO.The residents do, however, lament the depletion of fish and the high level of pollution that development has brought with it. My nephew broke his shoulder bone after a coconut was flung from the local train into the creek when he was fishing below the bridge. Now, he wears a helmet while fishing, Bhagat laughs.The saying about Vashi too has been tweaked around. As Patil says, people now believe, Vashi mhanje Kashi.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Prima facie it appears the food was spoilt due to a delay but who is responsible has still not been revealed from our investigation, said a senior police officer.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday carried out an inspection of Box8 factory in Thane from where the food parcels, containing rajma, rice and tomato curry, were prepared. We are inspecting how the food was prepared, if any sub-standard procedures were followed. The premises are being checked for hygiene, said Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner of Food at FDA.On Thursday, samples of food and vomit were collected from the event venue and sent for lab analysis at Kalina, police said.According to Jinay Sheth, a 15-year-old student from Green Lawns High School, he experienced stomach pain half-an-hour after lunch. He could smell something foul in the parcel but he was so hungry he did not suspect the food had gone stale, said his grandfather Mukesh Sheth.Jinay first later vomited. By 3.30 pm he was rushed to Jaslok Hospital by event volunteers. On Friday morning, he was discharged. According to doctors, he was put on intravenous drip but did not require a stomach wash.Divya and Vanshika Rajpariya, in sixth and eighth classes of Whistling Wood school, were lucky. They got delayed at lunch and were later given pizzas when organisers realized the food was stale. By the time my children reached for lunch, they realized something was wrong with the food packets as other students had started complaining, said their mother Trupti Rajpariya.The organisers stopped the remaining students from consuming the food and subsequently ordered pizza for lunch. On Friday, pizzas were again ordered for participants but the number of students who turned up for the event had reduced by half, organizers claimed. Of the four admitted to Jaslok hospital, two were discharged on Friday. According to medical director Dr Tarang Gianchandani, no one was critical but two students will be kept under observation for another day. At Bhatia hospital, two students remain admitted but were said to be stable and recovering well.Meanwhile, a statement from Box8 read, We are deeply concerned about news report of illness caused to some students yesterday. Box8 maintains rigorous quality process through preparation of food and delivery system, including tasting the food before serving, which too was followed yesterday without any adverse results. Matter is being inquired by the authorities and we have been fully co-operating to identify the cause. Once the cause is identified Box8 will spare no efforts to deal with the same.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Maximum sales of musical instruments take place during Ganeshotsav, say Dabghars.SITTING amid teeming commotion in his shop, with tools to mend the broken ring of a tabla, Suresh D Chauhan works hard to bring it to the desired size. Suresh, who keeps a close watch on his subordinates work and customers in his century-old Lalbaug shop, belongs to a community of Dagbars, whose expertise in making musical instruments is well-known.With his life spent as a skilled artisan, Suresh cherishes the age-old art of making musical instruments, particularly related to the origin of Marathi music.Dabgars come from Indias western belt that includes Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Uttar Pradesh. Having long practised and promoted the art of making quality musical instruments, they specialise in nagadas, dhols, pakhawaj, mrudungs, tablas, dholkis, tuntunas, halgis and other instruments.My grandfather would make the jheels (leather strips tied on the tablas) of tablas and get a bag of rice in return. He, and other Dabgars, would also get silver coins which they would use to come to Mumbai, Suresh reminisces, seated around an ensemble of instruments.What keeps him going is the satisfaction of putting his hard earned skill to practice in his shop.For Ishwarlal Chauhan too, another one from the community, the profession is where he derives his identity from. He has been running the shop for over five decades now and takes pride in passing on the art to his sons. His son Atul says, I have been making dhol-tashas since I was a nine-year-old, and I completely adore my job. I think the market still holds importance for recognising the work of artists like us.However, with preferences substantially tilting towards electronic instruments such as keyboards, electric guitars and recorded sounds at processions and devotional functions, Suresh says its future is bleak. Nobody likes to work in this field now. From about 12 shops in 1940 of dhol-tasha makers in Lalbaug, just three or four remain. I frankly believe the following generations would not even want to touch these instruments, he fears.But Dabgars believe they are better-off. With maximum sales of musical instruments happening during Ganeshotsav, musical events and repair works keep accounts running for the rest of the year. As electronic items are a bit expensive and tougher to use, connoisseurs of classical music and musicians who cannot afford to spend more become the target audience for Dabgars.It takes ten years at least for any artisan to learn the job perfectly. In our community, we do not care about artisans class, as whoever masters the skill and performs the work perfectly is the winner, says Suresh.With popular Lavanis or folk music of Marathi films making use of instruments made by these Dabgars, the community has not lost hope, yet.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

While providing toll-free helpline round the clock to facilitate immediate relief to citizens, Fadnavis ordered the district collectors to crack the whip on individuals/groups lifting water from villages and illegally selling it to drought-hit families.Fadnavis held a marathon meeting with 21 district collectors on Monday morning through video conference to set a roadmap for the next three months, complete with provision of water supply and fodder. The chief minister also asked every district collector to make a weekly plan and closely monitor results and requirements and assured support from the headquarters in Mumbai. At the end of March, the governments biggest concern relates to water levels plunging to almost dead stock in most big dams. There are 25,000 villages reeling under drought out of the total 40,000 in Maharashtra.To ensure water supply in Latur, worst hit by drought, the government has decided to get railways to provide water supply. The CM hinted that they are working out a route to minimise water transportation distance.According to Fadnavis, The war rooms in every district will help us rise to any challenge that confronts the administration and reach out to people in the vicinity. While acknowledging that government is set to provide all necessary help, he said, I have asked district collectors to take strict action against those found selling water illegally.Fadnavis said, In these hard times, when people and farmers are reeling under water scarcity, commercialisation and exploitation of resources whether water, fodder or foodgrains will not be tolerated.The local administration will have to rise to meet the situation. Wheat at Rs 2 and rice at Rs 3 kg are being provided through ration shops to ensure nobody goes hungry. Simultaneously, district administration has been asked to scale up Jalyukta Shivar Abhiyan (water conservation) to generate more employment under NEREGA. The government has received 69,986 applications for farm ponds which are allocated to every farmer who demands one. Under this scheme, the government provides Rs 50,000 to a farmer who seeks a farm pond. The purpose is to generate water holding capacity in fields and ensure water percolates to the ground and helps in raising the water table. The collectors have been asked to exercise their powers across the departments and comply with requirements in their respective region. The collectors have been asked to submit district-wise plans for Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchan Yojna. A detailed review of groundwater survey and development agency (GSDA) will help in identifying feasibility of a farm pond at a particular location.While maintaining that officials should exercise flexibility in deployment of water tankers to override water scarcity, Fadnavis said the compensation for crop loss and crop insurance schemes cannot be compromised and have to be effectively implemented at the grass roots. Every district has been asked to keep adequate stock of water and fodder. The CM has also urged officials to double the target of Indira Awas Shabri Schemes to fast-track the governments housing for all scheme.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The other two deaths took place on Tuesday, where two children died in separate incidents. In both these cases, the children were out with their parents on a ride when their necks were slit by kite threads while peering out of the car sunroof. When the two children were rushed to the hospital following the incident, they were declared brought dead.Even a Delhi Police sub-inspector (SI) Manoj Kumar was injured after a kite thread grazed his neck on Monday, while he was returning to Anand Vihar police station on his bike after patrol duty on account of Independence Day.READ: Killer kite strings claim 3 lives during Independence Day festivities in DelhiThe Delhi High Court, in the meantime, had only last week asked the government, MCD officials and police to raise awareness about the threat posed by sharp manjhas. In its judgment, the court had brought up 15 different cases in UP, Delhi and Rajasthan in the last two years due to injuries caused by sharp manjhas.The court, in its judgment, had mentioned 15 separate cases reported from Delhi, UP and Rajasthan in the last two years of deaths due to injuries caused by manjha. The court, in its judgment, had mentioned 15 separate cases reported from Delhi, UP and Rajasthan in the last two years of deaths due to injuries caused by manjha.The judgment had been issued on a PIL filed by one Delhi resident Zulfikar in May this year, which sought a ban on the use of the synthetic Chinese manjha in Delhi.Speaking to The Indian Express, Hussain said last year, a neighbours son, who was riding his bike, was seriously injured by a manjha. I had also read news reports about several other injuries and deaths caused by the string, said Hussain. On the August 10, the court in its judgment had declined to immediately ban the use of Chinese manjha but instead directed the Delhi government to expedite the process to issue the required notification under the Environment Protection Act.ALSO READ: Why Chinese manjha sells more: Cheaper, tougherMore material and adequate data requires to be collected and evaluated and opportunity is to be given to raise objections, before prohibiting or restricting the handling of hazardous substances in accordance with the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Rules, the high court bench observed.Last year, BSES area had reported 48 disruptions due to kite flying Last year, BSES area had reported 48 disruptions due to kite flyingHowever, despite the Delhi High Courts decision to clamp down on the use of nylon threads for kite flying, also referred to as Chinese manjha, numerous shopkeepers in Old Delhis Lal Kuan area have been illegally selling the glass-coated thread.READ: Delhi government bans Chinese maanjha after kite string kills twoBut what is this Chinese manjha and how is it made?It is the market name for nylon/synthetic threads which are treated with glass/metal to make them sharper. It is not made in China but manufactured in India. The cotton manjha used to break easily. Instead of breaking, the Chinese manjha cuts through the skin.Sachin Gupta, president of the Kathkargha Laghu Patang Udyog Samiti, a body of kite sellers, explained why nylon manjha is tougher than regular ones. He said that the nylon string is coated with chemicals to make it tougher and sharper so that it does not break easily. Bareilly cotton manjha, on the other hand, is made from rice flour and a mix of desi masalas, and break easily.The police, however, say that its difficult to look into who is buying manjha and will try to look into shops where sharp manjha is sold. Rani Bagh Police Station SHO Indira Rathore said they will investigate nearby shops to see if they can find who is selling such hazardous manjha. But it will not be easy to figure out who had bought the manjha or who exactly can be held responsible for the deaths of the child, Rathore said.Noting the number of injuries caused to people on account of pucca thread made of plastic or similar material, the governments notification regarding the manjha is noteworthy. The notification proposed a complete ban on the sale, production, storage, supply and use of nylon, plastic and Chinese manjha and other kite flying threat that is laced made out of glass, metal or sharp objects. Kite flying will be permitted only with a cotton thread or natural fibre, free from metallic and glass components.Many injuries are caused due to such material. These injuries can be fatal. It is therefore desirable to protect people from these kite threads, stated the notification.The notification, though, came in a bit late. Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, however, explained the delay behind the notification saying the environment secretary had been sitting on the file. Writing to LG requesting him action against Environment Secretary for gross negligence in duty and insensitiveness in Chinese manjha caseEnvironment Secretary took 7 days to issue notification though file was cleared by my and Env Ministers office within minutes on 9th AugustChinese manjais dangerous. Safety of citizens non-negotiable, he said in a series of tweets.READ: Manish Sisodia seeks action against Environment Secretary for delay in banning Chinese manjaThe government has further said that the notification was being issued according to the Environment Protection Act and that it will be taken up for consideration on 60 days after seeking comments from the public. The violation will attract a 5-year jail term, a fine that can be extended to Rs 1 lakh, or both. IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

ExpressIF DHURUP Chand is to be believed, the Guru Nanak Sweet Mart in Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Nagar of Sion Koliwada is the only place in Mumbai to buy anarse, a Punjabi-style confectionary made with rice and jaggery.Anarse heralds spring, signalling the coming of Baisakhi, informs Chand, who hails from Punjab, and has been making the sweet for nearly 45 years. The Guru Nanak Sweet Mart is just one of the many authentic Punjabi eating joints set up in the Sion Koliwada area, where any food lover worth his salt would gravitate to for the roadside chhole kulche or samosa chana.GTB Nagar, a microcosm of the Sikh community, several of them families of refugees who came to India at the time of Partition, continues to celebrate the communitys reputation for hearty meals. In the Sion Koliwada area, the competition between Mini Punjab at the north end of the JK Bhaseen Road and Hazara Restaurant and Bar is an age old one, say old-timers.Both outlets that operate primarily post evening compete especially on who makes the better fish koliwada. Mini Punjab, started by one Hukum Singh, and Hazara, known to be one of the oldest restaurants in the area, both started out as modest stalls, which now have separate AC and non AC rooms and mezzanine floors to separate the family crowd from the young crowdA waiter at Hazara restaurant claims that their fish koliwada  fish marinated in spicy Koli masala and fried  was originally their adaptation of Maharashtrian coastal cuisine that is now popular in every restaurant down the road.But if sea food is not your thing, there is paya, lush tandoori chicken, mutton and other delicacies from the tandoor. A local legend goes that actor Sunil Dutt was known to come looking for a man who would set up his stall near a lane off Hazara restaurant at nightfall, from where he would sell the most delicious mutton served across the city.There is plenty for the vegetarians too, starting with enough Chole Kulche outlets to ensure they return home with a full stomach. And to digest it all, there is Kashmiri Soda available at the roadside carts. Or pop into a restaurants like Hardeep Punjab, which has its own special touch for minty chaas, served in large electric bulb-shaped glasses.Once the chaas is downed, of course, its time to head to Guru Nanak Sweets to watch as Dhurup Chand prepares his anarse, and eat them hot out of the wok.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Fadnavis, who himself toured a few villages and interacted with farmers, told The Indian Express that the government has gone all out to initiate a slew of measures to alleviate the miseries of the villagers and farmers in eight districts of Marathwada. Yes, the situation is extremely critical, but the steps we have initiated will surely help in easing the sufferings of people in this region, he said.He said never in the past has an entire cabinet landed in a region facing a most difficult time. All my cabinet colleagues are in Marathwada. I dont remember that it has ever happened in the past that an entire cabinet was directed to tour drought-affected talukas and take stock of the situation. The ministers have been told to tour all talukas and find out whether the steps taken and government schemes being implemented were reaching the farmers and whether the villagers had any grievances to make, he said.When specifically asked as to what he found out after interacting with farmers, Fadnavis said, When I spoke to farmers and villagers, they seemed satisfied with schemes being implemented by the government. Our Food Security plan offering wheat and rice is reaching the maximum number of farmers. Maharashtra was the first state in the country to implement the plan and it is doing just fine, he said.However, in Lambota village where the CM inaugurated the governments much-publicised water conservation scheme, the villagers did not seem enthused. The chief minister came to inaugurate the scheme, delivered a speech and left. When we placed our grievances before him, he made no promise except saying ok. He folded his hands and left quickly. He did not even have the time to tour our village.Whoever said he toured the village is lying, said M Mugale, a farmer from Lambota village.Several farmers this correspondent spoke to had similar grievances against the CM. All our crop has been destroyed. The interest on loan we took is piling up, we want the government to give us a loan waiver. But the CM had no time to listen to our plight, said another farmer Chakradhar Deshmukh.At a meeting in Nilanga village, where the CM addressed officials, ministers and local politicians, Fadnavis said the government was banking heavily on Jalyukt Shivar Yojana as it will ensure that every farmer in a village gets enough water to cultivate crop and villagers get sufficient stock of water. The plan will change the entire scenario of drought-affected region, he said.Meanwhile, a farmer Baban Kamble stumped the chief minister shouting slogans, Not daru, we want water Kamble, a villager from Devni village of Latur district, alleged district officials had sanctioned a country liquor shop in Vidyanagar area where schools and colleges are located.When we are fighting for water, they are sanctioning liquor shops, he said while submitting a memorandum to the CM who did not respond to his agitated sloganeering.

(Vasant Prabhu) The restaurant that had started in 1944 folded up in the late 1990s. (Vasant Prabhu)BACK in the early 1990s, when Farokh Irani launched the Chicken In Wine at his much-loved open air restaurant, he reluctantly agreed to share the recipe with one of his most loyal customers, a senior banker and fellow Parsi. I told him that when we received an order for Chicken In Wine, a staffer would rush from the basement kitchen to the area where we kept fowl, open a chickens beak, pour in a good measure of wine, wait for the bird to start tottering, and then rush it, freshly slaughtered, to the chef, says Farokh Irani, a former owner of Cafe Naaz, the restaurant that stood in the 1980s and 1990s atop Malabar Hill, forerunner of all Mumbai cafes where writers, film-makers, artistes, journalists and others lounged for hours. The funnier part of Iranis story is the footnote: He actually believed me.Maybe what was truly intoxicating was the view. From Cafe Naaz, one could see the curvaceous Marine Drive beyond the lush greens of Malabar Hill. Or maybe it was company you kept there  Mahesh Bhatt, Shobhaa De, Sanjay Dutt, Sheetal Mafatlal, theatre personalities, artistes, writers, journalists, film-makers, this was where the hip crowd gathered.King Kong visited once. The Shah of Iran did too. Vinod and Kavita Khanna are said to have thrown a grand wedding party here. A young socialite rented the three-level cafe for a private party, liveried waiters setting up the food before she arrived, a rather elaborate affair for a solitary guest  a textile magnate she would later marry.Over 100 Bollywood movies had scenes featuring Naaz. Sanjay Dutt, during the shooting of Aatish for which the cafe was let out to the producers for a month, laid a wager with Irani on whether it was still possible to source Ice Cream Soda. The Iranis won that bet.Naaz is the stuff of urban legend, as were its chelo kababs, succulent meat on a bed of rice fragrant with Iranian saffron. Our Cafe Naaz was for the guy who drove up in a Cadillac as much as for the handcart-pusher who would stop for chai, says Irani. So if the Chelo kababs were priced at Rs 250 a plate, there was always a Rs 5 cup of tea to be enjoyed, the view came free. Whatever it was that drew them to this Irani cafe, it kept them returning for more.The restaurant was started in 1944 by another generation of Iranis, when Malabar Hill was thickly forested with only a mud path leading to the top. In the late 1990s, following years of litigation, the restaurant had to fold up with the BMC ousting its tenant over an expired lease. The BMC had taken the land back ostensibly for its water works department. A few years ago, the authorities also floated the idea of an observatory, a vantage point to look over the city, for a fee. Now, well over a decade later, part of the property is used by a municipal union as office space, the rest of the once-bustling cafe and sit-out reduced to a large litterbin and an overgrowth of weeds.Today theres no signboard, no anticipation of a turnaround, nobody to claim the space as the citys. Cafe Naaz keeps its desolate vigil over the bay, standing over interments of memories of a different city, another ethos.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The move is being read not only as an attempt to put pressure on the ruling BJP, but also on the state Congress leadership, which has been embroiled in a bitter war of words with Amit Jogi and former CM Ajit Jogi.Following the row over Antagarh tapes, in which purported voice recordings suggested that financial deals led to the withdrawal of the Congress candidate for 2014 Antagarh bypoll, Amit Jogi was expelled by the state party unit for six years, pending appeal. While the state unit recommended to AICC similar action for Ajit Jogi, no punitive action has been taken so far.Speaking to reporters, Amit Jogi said he believed in the politics of issues. Every year the state government holds Gram Swaraj or Lok Swaraj Abhiyan. It receives thousands of applications, but all these suggestions are consigned to the dust bin. There are seven demands that bind villagers across Chhattisgarh. These demands will be taken to each sarpanch, who will hold gram sabhas on them. Considering the constitutional validity of gram sabhas, these demands will have to be addressed by the state government. I will take up these issues in the next Assembly session. The demands include free rice for drought-hit areas, paddy bonus for farmers, removal of outsourcing of employment and filling up of medical posts in villages.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)Mamata Banerjee, the stormy petrel of West Bengal politics, once again proved a master strategist decimating the new Left-Congress combination and the BJP all of whom sought to checkmate her return to power.The 61-year-old feisty leader, who had single-handedly wrecked the red bastion in West Bengal in 2011 ousting Left Fronts uninterrupted 34-year-old rule, was unfazed by the coming together of Left parties and their once bitter rival Congress ahead of the Assembly polls.She also faced an all out attack by BJP which fielded top party stalwarts led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, a battery of Union Ministers and state leaders for campaigning but they finally found that there was no way to stop her Trinamool Congress from romping home to victory.Founder and chairperson of the Trinamool Congress which she set up in 1998 after falling out with the Congress Party in West Bengal, Banerjee, fondly called `Didi` (sister) by her supporters, has been the nemesis of the ruling CPI(M)-led Left Front and has earned the reputation of being a tough street fighter.Watch Video: Election Results 2016  Reading Into The Early TrendsBanerjee earned laurels for various development initiatives in the state but also faced criticism over Saradha chit fund and Narada scams. After taking over as the chief minister in 2011, she had steered Trinamool Congress through victory in subsequent elections to panchayat, civic bodies and 2014 Lok Sabha.Among various development schemes undertaken by her as the chief minister were Kanyashree schemes for girls and Sabuj Sathi under which cycles were dsitributed among the students, besides Rs 2 kg rice for the 8 crore people in the state.However, multi-crore scams like Saradha and Narada had dented the image of her party as the opposition had made it a prime issue.Born to a middle class family and daughter of a freedom fighter and student of law and education, Banerjee in her initial years in public life was mentored by veteran Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee  now ironically a senior minister in her state cabinet.Banerjee, baptized into politics as a student leader in Chhatra Parishad  Congress student wing in the 1970s, shot into limelight by pulling off a stunning victory over CPI-M heavyweight and former Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee in the 1984 Lok Sabha elections in from Jadavpur constituency to become one of the youngest MPs.She soon became a rallying point for the anti-Left Front forces which saw in her an uncompromising, incorruptible and credible fighter in comparison to various senior leaders of state Congress of nineties. After parting ways, Banerjee had often dubbed Congress as the B team of CPI-M.Perfecting the art of the impossible, the maverick and emotional politician, first hogged the limelight by blocking Jayaprakash Narayan`s convoy by throwing herself on the ground when he came to Kolkata to organise the masses against Indira Gandhi before Emergency.Defeated in 1989, she was back in Lok Sabha in 1991 from Kolkata South and retained the seat in 1996, 1998,1999, 2004 and 2009. Banerjees first tryst with the corridors of power came in 1991 when she became became union minister of state for human resources development, youth affairs and sports and women and child development in the P V Narasimha Rao government.Later on after forming TMC, Banerjee aligned with the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government and became Railway Minister in 1999 and Union Minister for Coal and Mines in 2004. Banerjee resigned as Railway Minister and left NDA just ahead of the 2001 assembly polls in Bengal after the Tehelka scam and allied with Congress for the assembly elections but could not dethrone the Marxist party.In 2004 Lok Sabha election Banerjee was the only one from TMC to win. In 2006 asembly polls in Bengal her party managed to win just 30 seats in the 294-member assembly. But being a fighter, Banerjee refused to be cowed down and led the protest against farmland acquisitions in Singur and Nandigram which finally catapulted her to the seat of power in the state.A firebrand orator, she had coined a catchy slogan Ma, Mati o Manush (Mother, Land and People) before the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and played on the anti-incumbency factor after more than three decades of Left rule and the creeping disillusionment among several sections, like Muslims, to decimate the Left in partnership with the Congress.Known for her humble lifestyle, the seven-time MP successfully sold a vision of development, cashing in on thedeep resentment among the middle classes and unemployed youths, promising jobs and development. Her nondescript residencea tiled single-storey house in a dingy lane close to the Kalighat templeand equally simple attire comprising cotton saris, jhola bags and cheap hawai chappals, endeared her to the masses.It has not been an easy journey though for Mamata who turned her call for `Parivartan` (change) into a reality with Congress, her ally then, throwing its full weight behind her. Her energy, charisma and political astutenes made Banerjee one of the few mass leaders in the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

These are hard times and we have to support one another, said Abdul Gaffar Banday, who leads prayers at a local mosque. We collected more than 300 quintals of rice from our village, and have distributed around 20 to 25 quintals among the needy so far.In various places across Kashmir, residents worked out their own ways to try and help their neighbours with supplies.Also Read: Kashmirs longest curfew ends, not crackdownAt Chhota Bazar in Srinagar, a charity set up by residents over a decade ago came into play during curfew. We have categorised people in our locality, said Firdous Amin, a volunteer. Our first priority is daily wagers, people who have lost their source of income. In the past, we have helped people in neighbouring areas too. But during this curfew, we have focused only on our own locality.At Batamaloo in Srinagar, a local trade association was running a charity from a mosque. We have made public the phone numbers of our volunteers. If a volunteer gets a call, he takes a pack and drops it at the callers home, said a volunteer. Each volunteer keeps the assigned beneficiary totally secret, even from other volunteers.It is not just food that was being provided by these voluntary groups  they provided medicine too. In Anantnag, the most affected district, youth set up a medical camp at the district hospital. Ours is a joint effort by people from different walks of life and different religious ideologies. We have united under the banner Youth of Islamabad [a local name for Anantnag], said Asif Dada, one of the volunteers. Though we focus mainly on healthcare, we also provide food to patients and attendants.Until Sunday, Youth of Islamabad had donated 124 pints of blood, provided free medicines to more than 450 civilians injured by pellets and bullets fired by security forces, and given medicine to around 7,000 people in the town, volunteers said. People of the town came forward and donated money to us, Dada said. Chemists and medical representatives helped us get medicine.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Starvation doesnt need to be imagined in Bengal, its not a distant memory  the word still conjures up images of gaunt ribs, filthy rags and lethargic limbs with unnerving clarity.The reasons for TMCs confidence that their rice politics in the state will surmount all other criticism are rooted firmly in history. In the list of achievements that Mamata Banerjee reiterates at every election rally, is her extension of the National Food Security Act  increasing its reach from 3.5 crore people to 6.5 crore  that is, over 70 per cent of the states population  as her prime achievement.The Bengal famine of 1943 and consequent cases of what the government euphemestically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections. The many representations of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad, Somnath Hore, Ramkinkar formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal.In 1944, the Indian Peoples Theatre Association (IPTA) toured Bengal with their dramas documenting famine, hunger and the struggle to live  prime among them was Bijon Bhattacharyas play Nabanna (New Harvest). Images from filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen have combined to form the backbone of Bengals collective conscience. Even today the names of these artists, their stories and work are passed on from generation to generation, in some cases even substituting bedtime tales, embedding hunger into the very culture of Bengal.It comes as no surprise then that hunger has traditionally been the electoral issue that rises above all else. The Tebhaga movement initiated by the Communist Party in Bengal from 1946-1947, demanding the rights for landless peasants formed the foundation of the partys future dominance in the state. This was followed by the Food Movement of 1959, a turning point in the political history of the state when food insecurity threatened yet another famine in the state. Protests at Writers Building saw clashes with the police, leaving 80 dead. As young Jyoti Basu compared the incident to Jallianwalabagh in the Bengal Legislative Assembly, cornering the Congress government and cementing his own political status.After coming to power in 1977, the Left Front government amended the Land Reforms Act, making cultivation absentia an exclusionary clause for eviction of sharecroppers  they were to be provided rights and the place of crop share was shifted to sharecroppers homestead plots.Even in the days of its decline, West Bengal politics saw hunger taking centre stage. Subsidised rice was introduced by the Centre and the Left Front government in Bengal in 2009, covering 2.64 crore people living below the poverty line. It soon became the prime incentive offered in areas affected by Left-wing extremism to wean tribals away from Maoists.Mamata Banerjee is not unaware of this. At Silda, an hour away from Belpahari where many had died of hunger in 2004, Mamata Banerjee is introduced as the Anna Data  goddess of food  by her party members. She speaks in detail of the Belpahari famine in 2004, squarely blames the previous Left Front government and reiterates her governments promise of providing food to all. It is no accident that the new secretariat in the state is named Nabanna  after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine, nor was it was a mere knee-jerk-reaction when she delinked ration cards from the food distribution scheme.Concerns have been raised in all quarters over whether the available stocks would keep pace with meeting the demand. By March, 300 rice mills had shut down, citing falling prices, shrinking exports as the key reasons. But these are questions that the Mamata Banerjee government is content to leave for later.Right now, as conversations in tea shops and street corners are dominated by du takae chal (rice at Rs 2), some uncomfortable questions are already being asked  how long can this last, where will the money to pay for the rice come from and most importantly what happens if the rice runs out?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Dipankar Ghose) The Tricolour is hoisted in Gompad, Monday. (Express Photo: Dipankar Ghose)There was silence. The kind only broken by the faint sound of crying. About 50 people stood in a circle inside a forest, their heads bowed. In the middle was an upturned cot on a bed of rocks. To its left, three empty steel vessels. Hanging from the tree above were some clothes and a tattered umbrella. Buried in the earth was Madkam Hidmes body. Around her, all that she used to call her own. Rice and flowers were placed at the site in remembrance. Nearby, two young adivasi children stood with small tirangas in their hands. In Gompad, deep in what is considered a liberated zone by Naxals, August 15 was a day of many firsts.On June 13, the Chhattisgarh police had said that Hidme, a woman Maoist according to their records, was killed in an encounter in the jungles around Gompad, in Sukmas Konta block. In the days that followed, Hidmes family and AAP leader Soni Sori alleged she was an innocent villager, picked up by police from her hut, possibly raped and killed in a fake encounter. They pointed to the neat Maoist uniform on Hidmes body, which seemed to suggest few signs of a struggle.An AAP team led by Sori and representatives of the Congress attempted to reach Gompad, but said they were prevented from doing so by the administration. Madkam Lakshmi, Hidmes mother, eventually stepped out of Gompad for the first time in her life, appealing to the Bilaspur High Court forAn exhumation of her body was ordered, and a second post-mortem was conducted.The two post-mortems did not suggest rape, but defence lawyers pointed to doubts that emerged on the authenticity of the encounter. Taking the investigation away from police, the high court ordered a probe by the Dantewada district judge.In the latest chapter in the Madkam Hidme story, some AAP leaders and activists travelled 180 km on foot from Dantewada to Gompad between August 9 and 15, taking out a tiranga yatra across Bastars Naxal affected zone.At 8.30 am Monday, as the two-minute silence around Hidmes grave was broken, AAP leaders Sori and Sanket Thakur spoke. They said Hidme had become a symbol, and that her fight for justice would be fought till the end.We have come here today to Gompad, on this Independence Day, to appeal to the country and the government that justice must be delivered to Madkam Hidme. The adivasis of Bastar are part of our country too. Hidme was a sister and a daughter of Bastar. She will not just fade away, Sori said.In the hours before the small remembrance meet, as the group readied itself for the day and mingled with villagers of Gompad, where they had spent the previous night, the day of Hidmes killing was recounted several times over.She had been married for eight days, but had fallen ill. On the morning of June 13, some police personnel arrived. Some spoke in Gondi, others in Hindi. Hidme was sleeping at home because she was ill. She had never been a Naxal and we protested as they took her away. But the police threatened us and dragged her into the forests. Villagers from close by told us they heard screams. The next day, her body was returned to us in a plastic bag. We know some of the people that took her away. They used to be Maoists and used to beat us then. Now they work with the police and do this. Our lives are trapped in between, a villager, who did not wish to be identified, alleged.After the remembrance meet, at around 9 am, those who had gathered walked back to an open field next to the village, where a solitary pole stood waiting. For many an Independence Day, the pole had only seen a black flag flutter, hoisted by Maoists against the state. But on Monday, Gompad saw a sight it had not seen in over a decade. The Indian national flag was placed on the pole. Locals, many from nearby villages, holding small plastic Tricolour flags in their hands, watched as it was unfurled.Many placards were held up. Some read Bastar mein shaanti lao, others read Samvidhan amar rahe. The speeches that followed focussed on what the flag meant for this part of the country. Sori and Thakur both spoke about the flag being a symbol of peace.But the most powerful speech came from Hidmes mother Lakshmi. She spoke in Gondi, her words translated by Sori and the few villagers adept at Hindi. She said the flag was a symbol of peace, that they were citizens of India, too. She said they deserved attention from Chief Minister Raman Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and that money from government schemes was being siphoned off, with no benefits reaching the poor in the jungles.There was no hospital and no pension for widows, she said. As she spoke, villagers in the crowd shouted in approval. Gompad has no electricity, no road, no school and no healthcare within a 25-km radius. The government thinks we live only to die or be killed, a villager said.Later, speaking about the death of her daughter, Lakshmi said, Even when a dog goes mad, we think a great deal before ending its life.Not just Independence Day, but the entire yatra has seen a subversion of what is considered normal in Bastar. Police and pro-establishment groups have constantly labelled Sori and anyone who speaks against the Bastar administration as Maoist sympathisers. But this time, the Tricolour seemed to be their security shield.When the yatra was first announced, there were threats of protests against it, and even of an aamne saamne by AGNI, a group largely comprising people that belonged to the now disbanded Samajik Ekta Manch, and are considered to have police backing.But over the last few days, their stance shifted. On several social media platforms, they took the position that while they would continue to oppose any pro-Maoist activity, there could be no protest against people carrying the Tricolour. Which is why, on Monday, even Gompad rang with chants of Bharat Mata ki Jai.Maoists, too, made a departure from the norm by allowing the yatra to go through without incident, despite national flags being carried in an area they call their own. Maoist spokesperson Vikalp released a voice note in the days leading up to August 9, backing the issues of fake encounters, arrests and surrenders that had been raised by the Bastar Sanyukt Sangharsh Samiti, the umbrella body that organised the yatra. But he also exhorted them to refrain from carrying the Tricolour, calling it a symbol of state suppression. And yet, on Monday, it flew.By 2 pm, those who were part of the yatra started to leave Gompad. There were whispers that the Naxals were on their way, that they would fly their own black flag. The flag that was hoisted was brought down after much deliberation, with respect and after following all norms. We cannot afford that they do something to the flag, or fly their black flag next to it. That would be disrespectful, an organiser said.But the small plastic flags and one larger Tricolour remained in Gompad. It was one that Lakshmi had asked for. As she held it in her hands, she was asked if this could attract the wrath of Maoists. I am not afraid of them. If this flag will bring peace, I will fight for it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: File | Reuters) More than three lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh cultivate basmati on over four lakh hectares of land and were hoping for a favourable order, which would have earned them more in exports. (Source: File | Reuters)Madhya Pradeshs battle to get the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for basmati rice grown by its farmers in several districts has hit a hurdle, with the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) ruling against it.The assistant registrar of the Geographical Indications Registry had ruled in favour of Madhya Pradesh on December 31, 2013. But the Delhi-based Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) challenged the order. The Chennai-based IPAB has now sided with the APEDA, which had argued against allowing GI tag for basmati rice grown by MP farmers.More than three lakh farmers in Madhya Pradesh cultivate basmati on over four lakh hectares of land and were hoping for a favourable order, which would have earned them more in exports.We will move the Chennai high court. We will eventually succeed, Madhya Pradesh Agriculture Minister Gaurishankar Bisen told The Sunday Express, a day after Justice K N Basha and technical member Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal gave their ruling.Principal Secretary (Agriculture) Rajesh Rajora said the state and other applicants had submitted detailed documentary evidence, such as the gazetteers during the British rule, to shore up the states case. He said the appeal will be filed in the next few days.Though there are hundreds of varieties of long grain and scented rice grown all over the world, basmati is the best known due to its unique properties attributable to agro-climatic conditions prevailing in a geographical area.The assistant registrar had asked APEDA to include some districts in Madhya Pradesh that grow basmati before giving GI tag to the rice grown in parts of seven states, including Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The APEDA, which functions under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, had challenged the erroneous order on several grounds. While arguing against MPs inclusion, APEDA claimed to have legally challenged in 40 countries third party attempted registrations in the name of basmati or any deceptive variations.Saying MPs evidence was based on improper verification and illegible and unreadable documents, it was argued that the state does not fall in the Indo Gangetic Plain. In the 235 goods granted GI tag by the registry, only two have been challenged so far.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: File Photo) Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar said that a scheme is being developed to tackle issues related to tackle pollution in the state. (Source: File Photo)To check the menace of stubble burning in Haryana that causes air pollution, the state Pollution Control Board Friday announced a multi-pronged strategy which includes satellite monitoring, education of farmers and taking punitive measures under the law. The state government has, on the initiative of Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, also formulated an action plan for utilization of paddy straw.While stating this here, a spokesman of the Pollution Control Board said during the year 2016, till date, 48 cases of wheat straw burning have been approved for prosecution. Also, during the year 2015, the Board had filed 46 complaint cases against the violators in the Special Environment Courts at Kurukshetra and Faridabad, out of which 24 cases have already been decided against the violators and 22 cases are pending.He said the Haryana government had issued a notification dated September 16, 2003 under section 19 (5) of Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 prohibiting the burning of left over straw in whole of Haryana. The HSPCB is enforcing the same through its Regional Officers and is filing cases against the violators with photographic and video graphic evidences in the Special Environment Court on a regular basis.He said all Deputy Commissioners have also been advised to enforce the above provisions stringently and issue necessary directions and statutory warnings to all the Revenue field officials like BDPOs, Tehsildars and Patwaris to instruct the Sarpanches and Panches in the villages for persuading and educating the farmers on the ban and on the harmful effects of such acts.All DCs have also been advised to direct the Gram Sachivs and Patwaris to bring all the incidents of burning of wheat stubble or paddy straw and other agricultural waste in the open fields to his notice within 30 minutes of the occurrence of such incidents and in case they fail to do so, without sufficient cause, it shall be treated as dereliction of duty and disciplinary action be initiated against them.He said the Haryana State Pollution Control Board has already engaged the Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) to monitor the seasonal rice stubble burning in areas where rice is grown. It has now decided to get the incidences of burning of wheat stubble monitored through HARSAC for the year 2017 in 10 major wheat growing districts of Haryana has sought the daily report from HARSAC in the form of satellite imageries and other remote evidences on the activities captured in the State for effective monitoring and enforcement purposes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: File) Satnam Singh Bhamara is the first Indian to be drafted in the NBA. (Source: File)Phirjinder Singh Brar remembers watching nervously as son Palpreet lined up on the basketball court at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy five years ago. The nervous father was further zapped when after two sprints and a few jumps, the then 16-year-old was called forward by Indias legendary basketball coach the Late Dr S Subramaniam and the master merely bent over and felt Palpreets calf muscles. It was a bit strange, but after that he came up to us and said that Palpreet will become a big star one day, Phirjinder recalls. Now 21, the towering 6-foot-9 Centre will travel to the John Lucas Academy in Houston, Texas to train ahead of the NBA Development-League tryouts in August. Should he make the cut, hell follow in the footsteps of his former roommate Satnam Singh Bhamara, who became the first Indian to be drafted by an NBA Team, Dallas Mavericks, and currently plays for D-League outfit Texas Legends.The opportunity of the trials came after Palpreet won an NBA-organised talent hunt. He recently underwent a 45-day physical conditioning camp in Kochi. Most of it was on fitness, Palpreet explains. His initial physical assessment rated him 5.5 out of 10, which went up to a commendable 8.6. The calves now had stronger glutes and abs to complete the package.Growing up in Doda village in the Sri Muktsar Sahib district of Punjab, Palpreet loved working the land in the familys 20 acre farm of wheat and rice fields. Since he was six, hed sow seeds, cut the grass, but pulling out unwanted weeds was his favourite. Hed do it with his bare hands, not a sickle. It gave him more strength, Phirjinder says.The middle child out of three who showed remarkable stubbornness in de-weeding, had done a runner before though. Immediately after Subramaniams assessment, Palpreet was admitted to the academy. I was learning the game, but I missed home. In two months, I left and went home. But about six months later, I returned, explains the Northern Railways Ticket Collector.Circle kabaddi was the main sport in the village, but at 6-2, Palpreet was far too tall. Meanwhile a family friend had stumbled upon a newspaper advertisement announcing trials in Ludhiana  150 km away. Just over a year after the youngster re-joined the academy, he debuted for the India juniors at the U18 FIBA Asia Championship in 2012, recording an impressive 21 points per game a record for an Indian player at the event. After that, I could tell the coaches were keeping a special eye out for my development, Palpreet recalls. There was this one time he ran away again  at Kochi but to return well fed and hearty. He used to complain about the rotis. So I told him to get permission and go to a Gurudwara for langar. But Phirjinder knew Palpreet was ready for the big leap soon after. A few weeks after the program started, he told me he was avoiding fatty foods, and sugary items. This was new for us to see in him, the elder Brar adds.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Archive)Despite forecast of a good monsoon, around 50 per cent districts of Punjab, which account for the highest contribution of rice crop, around 30-35 per cent (one-third of the country) to the central pool, and neighbouring Haryana are still dry in the season of the water-guzzling paddy rice growing crop.Although the states had witnessed almost normal pre-monsoon showers, which was an indication of the good monsoon this year, now insufficient rain in several districts has put an extra burden on the underground water of the state, which is growing 29-30 lakh hectares of paddy rice this year.Till July 20, around 152.2 mm monsoon rain was received by the state against the normal 162.0 mm which is -6 per cent departure from the normal rainfall. However, the main concern is that around 50 per cent districts of Punjab are facing deficit of rain despite over all good rainfall.The information procured from the Met department revealed that of 23 districts, four recorded much above normal rainfall while over 10 districts, including Faridkot, Firozpur, Fathegarh Sahib, Mohali, Patiana, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Ludhiana etc have been facing the problem of rain deficit even in full monsoon season. Firozpur is witnessing -70 per cent rainfall on monsoon the district had also witnessed -93 per cent pre-monsoon rainfall. Against the 110.4 mm normal rainfall which the district should get by now, it has received only 33.6 mm, a departure of -70 per cent from the normal.Mohali and Patiala also got -62 and -50 per cent rainfall respectively.

Against the normal 142.2 mm, the district received 257.1 mm during June 1 to July 20 period. Similarly in Amritsar district saw an increase of 56 per cent more rain was seen where 268.2 mm rainfall was recorded against the normal 172.3 mm.It may be noted that with the missing of first three weeks monsoon showers results in the heavy exploitation of groundwater during paddy season in state where 102 of 141 Agricultural development blocks have already gone dry and ground water is available at around 200 feet down.Though overall monsoon is almost normal in Punjab till date but we need it all over the state, not excessive in some pockets and deficit in other portions of state, said Punjab Agriculture department director, Dr J S Bains.We are not getting rain across the statein some districts there is heavy rain while others are dry, said Amarjit Singh, a farmer from Jalandhar.The situation in neighbouring Haryana, which also grows rice on around 12-13 lakh hectares, too is not good. Of 22 districts of Haryana more than 50 per cent districts have been facing deficit monsoon rain till date. These districts included Kurukshetra (-81 %), Panipat (-66%), Panchkula (-61%), Karnal (-42%), Kaithal (-53%), Ambala (-59%), Rohtak (-38%), Sonepat (-36%) , sirsa (-40) etc.Overall-10 per cent deficit rain fall recorded in Haryana till date.

Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Saminathan, Superintendent of Police, CS-CID, Collector S. Natarajan on Tuesday ordered the detention of the accused, P. Seenivasan (48), under the preventive Act.The accused who had been indulging in ration rice smuggling was arrested on July 30, when a Food Cell special team, headed by Inspector of Police Rajesh Kannan, intercepted a lorry on RamanathapuramParamakudi National Highway during a vehicle check, and found him illegally transporting 120 bags of ration rice.The team arrested Seenivasan, who owned the lorry, while the driver, Senthilkumar (32), escaped. Seenivasan was arrested under Sections 6 (2) (3) (4) of the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Order, 1982, read with Section 7 (1) (a) (2) of the Essential Commodities Act.Later he was lodged in the District Jail here. On Tuesday, Mr. Rajesh Kannan served the detention order on him, after which he was shifted to Madurai Central Prison.Enquiries revealed that the accused had bought the ration rice illegally from two rations shops located at Siragikottai and Kamankottai in Nainarkoil block after conniving with the salesman, Murugan (45), attached to the two shops.After the arrest of the accused, Murugan was absconding and the police had launched a hunt for both the salesman and the lorry driver, Mr. Rajesh Kannan said. The accused, who hailed from Villapuram in Madurai, was already facing cases for smuggling ration rice in Pollachi and Madurai, the police said."

India, continues to blow hot and cold when it comes to accepting GM technology even in agriculture.India missed the industrial revolution. Centuries later, we are still trying to catch up. Todays developed nations are beneficiaries of that revolution, which deployed modern science and technology in manufacturing. They thought progressively, while ignoring misconceptions or arguments against new technologies not backed by strong scientific evidence. This approach laid the foundations of their current economic strength.The danger today is of history repeating itself and India missing the boat again, especially in agriculture. An overwhelming majority of developed  and also developing  nations have embraced technologies like Genetic Modification (GM) in crop breeding. Some have embarked upon exploiting its potential even in living animal species.India, though, continues to blow hot and cold when it comes to accepting GM technology even in agriculture. This, despite the huge success of its first commercially approved GM trait  Bt cotton, which, within a decade, made the country the worlds largest cotton producer and doubled its share in global production of the fibre to 25 per cent.Watch Video: Whats making newsAny GM technology-based product has to pass through regulatory approvals, including stringent safety and efficacy tests based on internationally accepted norms, before its commercialisation. Recently, the WH O recommended the use of GM mosquito technology to combat the global outbreak of the life-threatening Zika virus. The UK-based Oxitec, which developed this technology, has partnered with Gangabishan Bhikulal Investment and Trading Ltd (an associate company of Mahyco) to introduce it in India. The technology can, moreover, provide the tools to counter even other vector-borne diseases likes dengue and chikungunya.Another recent breakthrough based on GM technology relates to addressing lysosomal acid lipase or LAL deficiency, which leads to a build-up of fatty material in the liver, spleen, guts and other important organs. The breakthrough technology has involved developing a genetically engineered chicken that produces a protein substance in its eggs, which functions in place of the missing/inactive LAL enzyme. In 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration approved it as the first treatment for patients with LAL deficiency.The USDA, likewise in November, approved a fast-growing GM salmon developed by AquaBounty Technologies. This would be the first ever transgenic animal to be allowed to enter the human food chain. The point to be noted in all this is that the world has moved to the next level of genetic engineering, taking the technology beyond GM crops that dominated the first two decades of the biotech revolution.In India, what we are seeing, by contrast, is a lot of positive pronouncements in support of technology adoption in agriculture. Yet, there is till date no conducive, consistent and encouraging policy environment on the ground that encourages cutting-edge research and innovation in agriculture. The glaring inconsistencies and policy flip-flops on approvals for even field trials of GM crops have made it practically impossible for the agri-biotech industry to take research beyond labs and greenhouse areas to test for safety and efficacy. Government policy, far from supportive, has been held hostage by a few groups with presumably vested interests and most definitely utter disrespect for the huge money and energy spent by both private as well as public institutions in developing GM technology.The contrast with nations, including those not so developed, is striking. Indonesia has approved GM sugarcane incorporating the drought tolerance trait that enables the crop to grow with less water. Just imagine how much water we can save in India by using this trait in sugarcane or rice cultivation. Similar is the case with other GM traits like salinity tolerance and nitrogen use efficiency (which will reduce urea consumption). Why are these traits not being allowed in India?As a country, we must decide the crops and the applications where GM technology can bring benefits. It is not a silver bullet, but has to be positioned properly in the interest of our farmers and consumers. What the government is currently doing is quite the opposite  putting further hurdles to increasing research investment through policy moves like the Cotton Seed Price Control order that allows fixing of even royalty/trait fees on GM technologies.Such decisions have cascading effects on investment sentiment and perceptions regarding ease of doing business. Recently, three large companies wound up their GM rice research in India, as they saw no future returns on their investments in an uncertain policy environment. This comes even as the Philippines has, only recently, approved regulatory guidelines for commercialisation of GM crops in a record three months time, while our own Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India bill has been lying in cold storage for the past 12 years.The lack of an enabling environment for adoption of GM technology is creating a global perception of India being a laggard in agricultural knowhow, which it can ill-afford in the midst of a serious farm crisis. Such a perception has been sharpened at a time when our biggest global competitor and neighbour, China, is moving ahead with GM technology  a fact made most obvious through the acquisition of a global agri-input and technology giant, Syngenta, by one of its state-owned companies.It is time policymakers take decisions on cutting-edge technological solutions to pressing problems based on science, rather than irrational emotions. They can at least pay heed to over a 100 Nobel laureates who, have released a signed letter vouching for the safety and efficacy of GM technology and its potential benefits to mankind. The ultimate losers of not doing so are ordinary Indian farmers and consumers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Prashant Ravi Clamour for breakfast, which is always the most difficult meal to manage, say volunteers. Prashant RaviShanti Devi from Raghopur bore her fifth child, a boy, at a flood relief camp on the Hajipur-Chhapra Road. She wants to name him Manjit to rhyme with Ranjit, her elder son, but she is also tempted to call him Gangesh, after the flooding of the river.Who knows, Mother Ganga might bring better luck for him, said Shanti, whose husband Raju Bhagat sells bananas in Hajipur.A stretch of one-and-a-half kilometres along the road is lined on one side with plastic tents for humans and animals. The displaced people sleep next to their most prized possession, cows and buffaloes, which they evacuated to safety first.Our only worry for the last 15 days has been if we would get get food thrice a day, said Bhagiddan Bhagat, Shantis father-in-law. Seven members of my family are living in this camp. Though the water of Ganga is receding, it may take another 10 to 15 days to go back and raise our home.Over 2,500 people from Raghopur and Hajipur assembly constituencies have been in relief camps for the last 15 days. Raghopur is a high-profile constituency: it is represented by deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, and VVIPs frequently travel along the road, the main link between Patna and north Bihar. Among the 12 Bihar districts affected by the floods because of surplus water discharge into the Ganga and the Sone from MP, UP and Jharkhand, the Vaishali district administration has been particularly conscious about ensuring smooth distribution of flood relief.For all its care, the distribution of breakfast has proved a challenging task. The government has entrusted an NGO, Ekta Shakti Sangathan, with the task of distributing the breakfast  soaked gram and jaggery, alternating with chuda (beaten rice) and jaggery.Women sitting in queue stretched out one end of their sarees and NGO volunteers started distributing chuda and jaggery. After just five minutes, all stood up and started complaining they had not got enough or got nothing it at all. As the volunteers went back and forth, some people could be seen taking two or three helpings and stocking it into their polybags. Hands remained stretched for another half-hour, with the man distributing the jaggery looking clueless. Finally, NGO volunteers convinced the people to stay in queue and it worked.We do not face this problem with lunch and dinner. Then, they sit and eat, said special magistrate Arvind Kumar. Both meals comprise rice, pulses and vegetables.Settlers at the camp constantly fret about rebuilding their homes. Devilal Mahto, living in a tent with two cows, pointed towards his half-submerged thatched house. It will be like starting life all over again. And after the floods, there will be the fear of snakes.Rajmuni Devi, Gudiya Devi, Kanti Devi, Umesh Das and Sahdeo Das came from Chakmadma Chisti village. We dont know if the government will give us money to raise homes. We are happy to get government food, though, and hope we keep getting it. Our only concern is get food two times a day for now, said Rajmuni Devi.Umesh Dass son Badal, 5, was eating beaten rice soaked with water and salt. There was little jaggery but he ate with relish.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593cc5997be9e00e964d3919,Technology and business: When a global Swiss agribusiness giant becomes Chinese-owned,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/chemchia-syngenta-swiss-agribusiness-becomes-china-owned-2762969/,2016-04-21,"On February 3, Syngenta said that it was being bought by China National Chemical Corporation for over $43 billion in cash. The announcement sent shockwaves as the Swiss agri-science major had, only last August, spurned an acquisition offer from the US life sciences giant, Monsanto. The move, had it gone through, would have merged the worlds biggest agrochemical/crop protection company (Syngenta) with the global leader in seeds and genomics (Monsanto). Meanwhile, on December 3, DuPont and Dow Chemical, also with interests in both crop protection as well as seeds, decided to undertake what they called a merger of equals.In such an environment of consolidation involving Western ag-science giants  driven by the global commodity downturn impacting demand  a Swiss MNC becoming a 100 per cent subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned enterprise naturally surprised many.Syngentas global CEO, John Ramsay is, however, clear why his company chose ChemChina over Monsanto. A Monsanto-Syngenta deal resulting in the creation of a single entity with a dominant global position in both hybrid seeds and agrochemicals, he believes, is most likely to have encountered regulatory hurdles across jurisdictions.Read | Farm policy: A game-changing acquisition that India should learn fromOne thing people havent really taken into account is the fact that there has been no major consolidation in thisindustry since 2002. The anti-trust regulators, thus, have not had a big deal to look at for some time now, says Ramsay, in an interview he gave to The Indian Express while on a visit to India last week.The last big merger the ag-science industry saw, he notes, happened in 2002 when Bayer acquired Aventis CropScience to form Bayer CropScience (which is the world No. 2 in crop protection behind Syngenta). Even Syngenta was the product of a merger, in 2000, of the agribusiness divisions of Novartis and AstraZeneca.But that does not still explain, why ChemChina? Ramsays answer to it is that Syngentas existing shareholders  basically asset management firms and hedge funds  are the kinds who want consistent returns in an industry prone to crop cycles. The level of financial returns they expect year after year, according to him, is not in the companys long-term interest, which lies in investing in research & development even during periods of commodity downturns and currency volatility such as the present one.In 2015, Syngentas R&D investment at $1.36 billion was marginally below the $1.43 billion for the previous year, even as the drop in sales was sharp from $15.13 billion to $13.41 billion. This is an industry that, despite the crop cycles, clearly has an excellent future because of the needs of the world in terms of food security and the continuity in demand for agricultural produce globally. What we have in ChemChina is a new shareholder, which understands the cycles. It knows that the winners here are those who will continue to invest in technology through the cycles. This is different from the traditional western fund management mentality of seeking consistent returns, Ramsay points out.For the Chinese authorities, the investment in Syngenta is also of great strategic value, given their high anxiety about food security. For a country with 22 per cent of the worlds population and only 7 per cent of its arable land, it is no wonder that every time they produce a new five-year plan, youll find food security is right on their radar.Read | Monsanto patent under cloud as Bt cotton prone to pink bollwormThe Syngenta buy will give ChemChina access to all its ag-science know-how and patents. Ramsay claims that there would be no fundamental change to the Basel-based company, except that we will be enhancing our Chinese resources to bring technology to China in a more aspirational way, perhaps, than we had done previously. ChemChinas own agrochemicals portfolio is not really of relevance to us. The companys relevance will be only as a shareholder and even there, it wouldnt be an industry participator in the way that Monsanto would have been.Crop protection generated $10 billion of Syngentas global sales of $13.41 billion in 2015, with seeds contributing $2.84 billion. The companys revenues in India amounted to Rs 2,904.75 crore for FY15, with an estimated 60 per cent coming from crop protection and the balance 40 per cent from seeds.Syngenta has the second largest share (after Bayer CropScience) of Indias roughly Rs 14,000 crore agrochem market, which also has other majors like DuPont, Rallis India, UPL Ltd, PI Industries, BASF and Dhanuka Agritech. It also claims to be No. 1 in hybrid sunflower and vegetable seeds  especially of tomatoes, cauliflower, sweet and hot pepper, sweet corn, radish and watermelon  apart from having No. 3 position in corn (behind DuPont Pioneer and Monsanto) and rice (behind Bayer CropScience and DuPont Pioneer).How MNCs have taken over Indias agrochem marketWhile much of the public focus when it comes to farm inputs is riveted on fertiliser and seeds  more so with the brouhaha over Monsantos Bt cotton technology  agrochemicals largely escape attention. The dominance of multinationals in this segment is far more than even in seeds, where there is still a reasonably strong presence ofIndian breeders, both in the public as well as private sectors.Whether it is DuPonts Rynaxypry (Coragen and Ferterra brands), Bayer CropSciences Flubendiamide (Fame) or Syngentas Thiamethoxam (Virtako), these and many such other insecticide products of MNCs, incorporating proprietary new chemistry, have captured a significant share of Indias crop protection chemicals market.The main characteristic of the new generation molecules with novel modes of action for controlling target pests  apart from their being mostly patented  is their low levels of spraying.Read | Monsanto threatens to exit India over govts show cause noticeTo understand this, take Isoproturon, which is used for control of phalaris minor grass weeds (gulli danda) in wheat. Farmers typically had to apply about 500 grams per acre of this herbicide that was originally introduced in the 1970s. But with Sulfosulfuron, which Monsanto launched under the Leader brand in the 1990s, this fell to barely 10 grams per acre.Similarly, Bayer CropSciences Imidacloprid and Syngentas Thiamethoxam seed treatment insecticides  both based on a family of compounds called neonicotinoids  require just 40 milliliters per acre of application in cotton and rice, which used to earlier be 250-400 ml with Monocrotophos, an old generation organophosphate molecule.The new crop protection products have less toxic effect on the environment, humans, flora and fauna. Also, they are less hazardous, being mainly water-soluble concentrate formulations. The earlier formulations were emulsifiable concentrates using petroleum-based solvents, says Sarjiwan Singh Manhas, Syngentas South Asia R&D head. But introduction of new products based on proprietary chemistry is only one part. Equally important is the aggressive way in which the MNCs are pushing these among farmers.Syngenta, for example, has sought to popularise Gromore, which is supposedly an integrated crop protection solution for paddy covering all its four key growth phases.Thus, for the seedling phase, which is up to 30 days from the date of transplanting, the company is promoting Rifit, a herbicide mainly targeted at the Echinochloa species of weeds, and Virtako for control of early-stage rice stem borer insect pest. For the vegetative stage lasting from 31 to 60 days, it is similarly offering Amistar Top against sheath blight fungus and Virtako for both stem borer and leaf folder insects. Then, there is Chess for brown plant hopper and Tilt, a broad-spectrum fungicide, to be both applied during the reproductive phase between 61 to 90 days.By selling a range of its own branded pesticide products for all stages of the crop under a unified Gromore protocols solution, Syngenta has vastly increased its business among paddy growers in India. The cost of implementing Gromore protocols ranges between Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,500 per acre, depending on whether the farmer opts for the light (4-5 sprays in all) or full (7-8 sprays) solution. This is more than the normal Rs 1,500-2,000 per acre that paddy growers spend on crop protection.By following our protocols, the farmer harvests 4-5 quintals more paddy per acre. At Rs 1,400 per quintal, this translates into an additional income of Rs 6,000, as against the Rs 1,000-1,500 extra he may spend, claims Manhas. That may be some value proposition for the farmer and, of course, the company.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo) Students at the Gandaman primary school in Chhapra, where 23 children died of food poisoning on July 16, 2013. (Source: Express Photo)A Chhapra court on Monday sentenced principal Meena Devi of the government primary school in Dharmashati Gandaman village to 10 years and seven years of imprisonment in connection with the 2013 midday meal tragedy, in which 23 children had died of food poisoning after eating a midday meal. The court treated it as rarest of the rare case and awarded maximum punishment to the school principal Meena Devi for culpable homicide, not amounting to murder and criminal negligence.The court of additional district judge II found Gandaman school principal Meena Devi guilty on 24 August. The court, however, acquitted her of murder charges, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy even though the Special Investigation Team had claimed there was a strong case against her. The court acquitted Meena Devis husband Arjun Yadav alias Arjun Rai of all charges.On July 16, 2013, children aged between four and twelve ate the midday meal that consisted of rice, pulses and soya beans. About half an hour later, the children complained of stomach pain, had diarrhoea, and started vomiting. Some of the sick children were sent home, while 16 children, between classes I to V, died on the spot, four were declared dead upon arrival at the hospital, and the others died while in the hospital.While officials said 23 children had died from eating the contaminated lunch, parents and locals said the number was at least 27.While eating the lunch, the children had complained that the food tasted odd, and the schools cook had earlier informed the headmistress that the new cooking oil she was using was discoloured and smelled odd. The principal, Meena Devi, however, had said that the oil had been bought from a local grocery store and was safe.Initial reports showed that the food was contaminated by an organophosphate, which is a class of chemicals commonly found in insecticides. Bihars state education minister at the time, PK Sahi, had said that a preliminary investigation suggested that the food served to the children contained an organophosphate used as an insecticide on rice and wheat crops. He said it was believed the rice had not been washed before it was served to the children. Patna Medical College hospital superintendent Amarkant Jha Amar had said that the post-mortem reports of the children who died confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil.Local villagers, however, said the problem appeared to be with a side dish of soya and potatoes, and not the rice. Children who did not eat the side dish were fine, even though they had eaten the rice and pulses.The day after the incident, officials had said that they believed the cooking oil had been stored in a container formerly used to store insecticides. State officials said that the oil had been purchased from a shop owned by the headmistresss husband.Days after the incident, Meena Devi was suspended and an FIR was lodged against her. Protests had erupted following the deaths, with villagers demanding strict action against the officials responsible for the incident. The school building was shifted to another village where Gandaman children refused to eat their meals for months. The school was later reopened at its designated building near the site of the tragedy in 2015. Though villagers later agreed to allow their children to eat lunch at school, the service remained erratic.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

We will examine their demand. It is a policy issue which we will keep it before the Cabinet.Many states are making such demand after rolling out NFSA, but the Centres policy has been very clear. If any state needs extra grains, it can buy through open market sale scheme (OMSS) at Rs 24 per kg rice and Rs 16.40 per kg wheat.Under NFSA, the Centre has allocated 7.51 lakh tonnes of grains to J&K to cover 74.13 lakh beneficiaries via the public distribution system (PDS). Foodgrains are sold via PDS at a highly subsidised Rs 1-3 per kg.Noting that J&K is a consuming state and depends on the Centre for grains to meet its PDS demand, Ali said, The state was compelled to launch a new food programme as there was unrest. We need 4.30 lakh tonnes of foodgrains to run this programme and this would cost Rs 358 crore to the state.So, the state government has demanded allocation of foodgrains for this new programme at APL rates. Paswan-ji has said it is a policy issue and will be examined in the interest of J&K people, he said.The state had to launch a new food programme as the Centre maintained foodgrain allocation at 7.51 lakh tonnes under NFSA even as population rose as per the 2011 census, he added.Besides, the J&K government asked the Centre to maintain single rate for wheat being sold via OMSS, which Paswan said will be looked into it seriously.The state also demanded that fund allocation for end-to-end computerisation of PDS should be provided in the ratio of 90:10 which is being given to other north-eastern states, instead of the existing 50:50 ratio.Construction of silos and quality checking labs, among others, were discussed in the meeting.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: PTI Photo)NEARLY a decade after the Uri-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot routes were reopened for trade and travel by people on both sides of the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir, a few more routes are likely to be opened as part of additional confidence-building measures between India and Pakistan.When I met the Union Home Minister the last time, he had hinted at opening some more routes, Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti said Tuesday. I told him that the Suchetgarh route should be opened.Suchetgarh is on the international border in R S Pura tehsil in Jammu, and across the border is Sialkot district of Pakistan.Watch Video: Whats making newsMany routes came up for discussion  Suchetgarh, Nowshera-Jhanghar, Kargil-Skardu, Turtuk-Thapalu, among others. But he (Home Minister Rajnath Singh) said that we can consider opening one or two roads at the moment. If I am asked about two roads which need to be opened immediately, I will name Suchetgarh and Kargil-Skardu, Mehbooba said while addressing a function on the occasion of signing of an MoU between Jammu Development Authority and the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited, Ahmedabad, for management consultancy and technical assistance for development of the Tawi riverfront in Jammu.R S Pura tehsil is considered the rice bowl of Indias fine basmati rice, and Mehbooba said our basmati goes there (to Pakistan), adding that there is lot of hardware industry on the Indian side, while Pakistan manufactures very little, and additional border routes would mean many items can be exported to Pakistan. The state will benefit the way Punjab has benefitted from Wagah border, she said.Recalling the teamwork between former CM Mufti Sayeed and Deputy CM Nirmal Singh for the Tawi beautification project, she said the late CM always had a soft corner for the people of Jammu and used to call them truly secular, as they not only accommodated lakhs of Hindu and Muslim migrants from Valley but also shared their land, water and electricity with them.5 soldiers injured in J&K encounterFive soldiers were injured in an encounter between militants and the Army in North Kashmirs Machil sector near the Line of Control. The encounter was still on at the time of going to press.Army said that troopers spotted a group of militants in the forests of Katwara near Jet Gali in Machil sector.

Pilgrims at the stretch under the Lodhi flyover.Near a pavement at Lodhi Road off the Nizamuddin Dargah in southeast Delhi, 30 buses are parked in a long line while its occupants get down to explore the city. Scores of men, women and children amble across the busy road. Some stop to buy shawls and socks from vendors who mill around them while others can be seen sitting down on mats spread on either side of the pavement and eating.Saimun Khatun, a Madhesi Muslim from Nepals Dhanusa district, said she paid Rs 7,000 for a seat on a bus to make the annual journey to Ajmer-e-Sharif to commemorate Sufi saint Fariduddin Masud Ganjshakars death anniversary. A Kabaria from the community of fruit and vegetable sellers, Saimun has been making the pilgrimage to India for the past four years. I saved through the year for the 12-day Urs festival from the money my husband and I make from our crop, she says, stirring the pot of rice she and her daughter are cooking on a pavement.Watch what else is making newsBuses filled with hundreds of men, women and children  from across the sub-continent and states such as Bihar and Jharkhand  have been travelling to Ajmer through the capital this month for the festival. Many of them make the stretch under the Lodhi Road flyover their home for a day.Arif Khan (50), a farmer from Bihars Muzaffarpur district, says, The Urs pilgrimage is our way of saying thank you to our Baba for all the blessings and prosperity he has bestowed upon us. We also ask for our muraad (wishes) to be fulfilled. He adds that the bus has been his mobile home for the last one week.Unlike Saimun, who can afford only one trip a year, Arif and those from the countrys northern belt make two trips  the first to commemorate saint Fariduddins death anniversary and the second to commemorate sufi saint Moinuddin Chishtis death anniversary. As saint Fariduddins mausoleum is in Pakistan, pilgrims visit Moinuddin Chishtis tomb in Ajmer during both pilgrimages.The pilgrims progress across the northern belt includes stops at dargahs in Lucknow, Bareilly, Devasharif, Behrai, Panipat and Delhi, before they reach Ajmer.Clothes, gas cylinders, stoves and bags full of rice and vegetables make up each mans luggage on this trip. But most have to find a way to use their mobile phones judiciously during their long road trip. I switch on my phone only to make a call home and then I switch it off. I save enough power till I reach a city where I pay Rs 10 for an hour to charge my phone, says Ishaq Khan, from Jharkhands Lohardaga. Mohammad Aftab, from Bihars Motihari, interjects saying he carries a power bank. While the faithful take a break from their long journey in Delhi, many of them complain about the lack of toilet facilities and food.There are only four toilets in the Sulabh complex nearby and there are hundreds of men and women, says Amina Khatoon (40) even as the stench of urine and rotting food hangs heavy in the air.The authorities have not been cleaning the pavement for days, forcing us to sleep and eat in the dirt. The government never sets up transit camps to accommodate us. If we refuse to drive away quickly, police deflate tyres of our bus, says Doma Kabari, who works as a contractor.Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sandeep Goel said a few additional personnel have been pressed into duty to manage traffic in parts of the city where Urs pilgrims have been camping. However, he said no traffic diversions have been made.Salmi Nizami, who says he is a descendant of Nizamuddin Auliya and a member of the Office, Dargah Sharif, Nizamuddin, says the scores of buses parked carelessly throws traffic out of gear for days during the Urs. He added that sometimes, the crowd too is difficult to control.Police cooperate with the faithful. But when things get out of hand, they have to take strict measures, says Nizami.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express Photo by Ashutosh Bhardwaj)DURING THE time RSS sarsanghchalak Mohan Bhagwat was delivering his Vijaya Dashami address in Nagpur Tuesday, several thousand Dalits  participants say lakhs  from across the country had assembled in the city for the 60th anniversary of the day B R Ambedkar had left Hinduism.Every year, two events happen in Nagpur coinciding with Vijaya Dashami, said Ritesh Bahadure, a B Com student of Nagpur attending the Dalit event at Diksha Bhoomi. The RSSs event sees a few thousands in the morning. This event begins two days before, continues a day later and several lakhs come from all over. This is the 60th year.Bhagwat praised the government for enhancing Indias glory with surgical strikes across the LoC. Many of the Dalits this reporter spoke to, on the other hand, said they had not heard of the strikes. All they asked for, they said, was a place to live, a job, and some respect. They raised slogans and staged plays about the discrimination they faced.It was clearly a political gathering, if an unorganised one. It had hoardings of Dalit parties, small outfits and leaders including BSP and Mayawati, RPI (A) and Ramdas Athawale, but was without a leader to steer the proceedings. Participants come a day or two in advance and spend nights on the ground or footpaths. They have been getting free food at stalls set up by Nagpurs Dalits.I come here every year. I dont know why, maybe I get peace here, said Maske Kishor, a mason from Adilabad, Telangana, who has not heard of Rohith Vemula in Hyderabad.At midnight, the stalls of books and Dalit mementos were still full of visitors. Kiran Gaikwad stood in a long, hungry queue at a stall distributing plain rice on a leaf. He came from Parbhani in Maharashtra with wife Sunita, 32, who sings Dalit songs at functions. Songs of Ambedkar, Rama Bai (his wife), Jyotiba Phule, said Sunita, who wore beads of Ambedkar around her neck. The Gaikwads had vaguely heard about the RSS.Dalits who knew about the RSS dismissed its views. Why do they want to include us among Hindus? Babasaheb left Hinduism. Our caste certificate mentions Buddhism as our religion, said Prashant Ramteke, who runs school vans in Nagpur.About the recent Maratha rallies, he said, The entire Maratha community is protesting after the rape of their girl, which they should, for it was bad. But what about the rapes and assaults on Dalit women?Rajnikant Ramteke, 32, working at a bank in Nagpur, took part in a band that took out a rally to the Ambedkar memorial. I always got a scholarship in school and college. Others taunted me that it was because I am an SC. Theres a constitutional provision for us. Why do you scorn us? he said.At 1.30 am, the crowd was still pouring into the ground.Those from outside Nagpur said they hadnt bought a rail ticket. Some claimed the railways had exempted those travelling to and from Nagpur for five days with Vijaya Dashami in the middle. But one youth said, Its just the power of Dalits. Whod ask for a ticket from us?Prashant Ramteke claimed the Dalit event has been a counter-narrative to the RSS event for six decades. The RSS dismissed this notion.RSS ideologue MG Vaidya, who joined the Sangh in the early 1930s, mentioned Article 25 of the Constitution that says the Hindus include Jains, Sikhs and Buddhists. Ambedkar drafted the Constitution. He also drafted the Hindu Code Bill, in which Buddhists are among Hindus, said Vaidya, now in his 93rd year. He said the RSS is working to bring Dalits into its fold.Dalits have their own explanation for Ambedkar embracing Buddhism on Vijaya Dashami. Its actually Ashoka Vijaya Dashami. On this day King Ashoka gave up weapons and embraced Buddhism after he got disillusioned following the Kalinga victory, said Prashant Ramteke.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Last year, as per the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) 30.78 lakh tonnes of Basmati was procured in the state, which was sown at 7.63 lakh hectares area of land.Owing to a poor rate fixed for the basmati crop last two years, the farmers this year has decided to curtail the area to a significant level. The decision means that there will be around 35 per cent less production of the basmati crop in Punjab.Farmers have demanded that government must fix a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for basmati on the lines of paddy crops as it will save significant underground water and bring more foreign exchange to the country.Though there is a possibility that less production may hit the export this yea, however exporters said that last years stocks are available which will be carried forward. There should be some fixed system and for every Rs 100 crores purchase of basmati Rs 10 crore must be kept for the welfare of farmers to provide them farm implements free of cost through a lottery system as it will encourage them to grow more basmati, said Vijay Setia, former president and current governing body member of All India Export Association Area.Last year, as per the Punjab Mandi Board (PMB) 30.78 lakh tonnes of Basmati was procured in the state, which was sown at 7.63 lakh hectares area of land. But with the area being curtailed to 4.96 lakh hectares this year, the production will automatically reduce by 35 per cent.Around 19-20 lakh tonnes basmati production is expected in the state this year.It may be noted that Punjab is among the five states which falls under the traditional Geographical Indication (GI) area for export of basmati rice along with Haryana, some part of UP, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Massive stubble burning by farmers cause pollution that deteriorates air quality significantly.THE HARYANA government has asked Haryana Space Applications Centre (HARSAC) in its Department of Science and Technology to monitor stubble burning in 10 districts where the practice is widespread.HASRAC will inform Haryana State Pollution Control Board who will then initiate action against the farmer concerned.The districts to be monitored include Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.What what else is in the newsWith the paddy harvest on and stubble burning looming, the Central Pollution Control Board at New Delhi called a meeting on September 30 attended by representatives of Punjab and Haryana apart from other paddy growing states, to discuss how to prevent it.Member Secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board, S Narayanan said, A meeting was called by Central Pollution Control Board at Delhi last week where representatives of several states were present. We have given orders to the regional officers incharge of all districts to monitor cases of stubble burning and report these. Awareness activities will also be conducted.Officials of the Board rue that there is a lack of staff in the districts that makes it difficult to monitor such cases. At some places one regional officer has the charge of more than one districts. Another hindrance is the long-drawn process of prosecuting farmers.The board does not have powers for imposing any penalty on farmers. It can only recommend cases for prosecution. During the last paddy season, a total of 46 cases were recommended for prosecution, while during the wheat season, 48 cases were recommended.Farmers adopt this practice to clear the fields quickly and make these ready for sowing the next crop. The Department of Agriculture is also involved in checking the practice.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said alternatives are being explored so that farmers are encouraged not to burn stubble. He said that the government is contemplating a proposal under which stubble can be converted into power. There are provisions for penalty and sentencing, he said.A report by HARSAC states that there is a decline of around 21 per cent in this practice in the past three years. The report states that in the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares in 2015, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 per cent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 percent of the rice cropped area in 2013. The report suggests that total rice burning area in the 10 districts reduced by 3.5 percent as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percent as compared to 2013.As per the study, while there was a decline in stubble burning in eight districts, in two districts namely Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar there was an increase.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Its 10 pm in this village, 1.5 km from the India-Pakistan border, on Friday, 32 hours after the evacuation orders were first announced over the village gurudwara. Its a still night, and silence has fallen over the village, not unusual because most people turn in for the night by 9 pm.In Rajaoke, where most families have left the village, leaving one person behind to look after their house and cattle, those who remain are hoping that this comforting, routine silence of the night will never be shattered.Parwinders two sons and daughters-in-law, and their children, left immediately after the evacuation orders, going to their relatives outside the 10 km evacuation zone. On Friday morning, only her sons came back to tend to the fields, and left the village again in the evening.I decided I would be the one to stay back. Someone has to feed the buffaloes and look after the house. Saving the young women and children is the first priority. I can look after myself, says Parwinder, 68.She has come to spend the night with a family, whose four oldest members and two young boys decided to stay back after seeing off seven others of the family. They have put out cots in the yard and are getting ready for the night.Attacks never happen in the day time, they always come late at night or early in the morning, says Jiaoun Singh.From the terrace of his one-storeyed house, a glow of yellow from the floodlights is both a comfort for the family that the BSF is not far away, as well as a reminder of their proximity to potential trouble.We are not worried about the big bombs, if Pakistan fires those, they will fly over Rajaoke and hit some other place. Those are meant for big cities. What we fear is the possibility of smaller shells, says Kulwant Singh, Jiaouns brother.Chamkaur Singh, one of the younger men, says he could not sleep the other night. I kept going up to the terrace to check if anything was happening, he says.It is too early to say how the tension that has gripped Punjabs border villages over the last few days will play out during the assembly elections.

But the real power centre is Nirmal Singh, who introduces himself as the sarpanch and describes himself as an Akali worker, and who owns the best house in the village.Nobody wants to take political advantage of this situation. Chief Minister (Parkash Singh) Badal has told Akali MLAs not to sit around in Chandigarh, to go and be of help to people. You can see, the ministers and MLAs are going everywhere. Yesterday, the SP, BDO, DSP, SHO, everyone came to check on the parts of the village that are on the other side of the defence line, he says, referring to a drain that runs through the village, and into which water is released to the brim should there be a threat from across the border.It boosts the morale of the people. They are also providing free transport to poor people who have no vehicles to ferry them back to the village in the morning, and take them to the camps at night, says Nirmal Singh.Most of the villagers who have gone to the camps are Dalit families, while the upper caste families have gone to stay with relatives.Everyone is happy that (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi has given a mooh todh jawab (befitting reply) to Pakistan. They were taking us for granted. Even the zamindars in this village are happy, despite their concerns about their fields and harvest, declared the de facto sarpanch.Nobody can tell how long the situation will continue, he says. Even when farmers fight, its takes a week for people to calm down. This is a matter between two countries, he adds.But Satnam Singh, who says he is an Akali worker, is angry with the government. There is no problem here, so tell me why are they driving people out. I have built a Rs 2 crore house, can I just leave? Maybe Badal thinks this will help in the elections, but hes forcing us to become homeless. I havent seen a single soldier. If there is such a big threat, why cant we see the Army in this village, he asks.Worried about his rice crop, Satnam says the government now has the perfect alibi to put off quick procurement.Another farmer, Karaj Singh, who, according to villagers, nurses the ambition of becoming the first AAP sarpanch of Rajaoke, says the mood of the people will become clear only after the code of conduct comes into effect. Everybody is an Akali now, many for their own reasons, he says.The Akali Dal may benefit from the Centres strong response to Pakistan, says Karaj, adding that this is the right reply.But that will be offset by the delay thats going to hit grain procurement. Last year, the procurement got delayed because of all the trouble over the desecration incidents, we had to sell our basmati at rock bottom rates of Rs 1,500 per quintal. But the traders were still selling it for Rs 3,200- Rs 4,500 per quintal. This harvest season, theres a new problem, he says.Swaran Singh, who also describes himself as an AAP worker, has a contrary theory. The government will do everything to procure the paddy on time. And they will say that despite all the troubles they did not let the farmers go hungry, he says.Back in Jiaoun Singhs yard, the conversation shifts to what people took with them. One family even took their buffaloes, laughs Kulwant. But can anyone take his land or his home? he asks.His brother retorts: We made these houses to live in them. We cant go and live with relatives indefinitely. They will get tired of us, or worse, they might expect something in return.A few houses away, Sukhwinders family is proud that none of the 13 members have left the village. Sukhwinder points to the tractor trolley in a dark corner of the yard. It is loaded with suitcases and large aluminium trunks.Sukhwinders loaded tractor has become the talking point of the village, but it is also symbolic of the atmosphere of uncertainty that has taken over the border villages since the evacuation began, and the reluctance of people to abandon their hard-built lives even in the face of possible danger.We are all packed, and we can leave at a moments notice, but we are not leaving just yet, says Sukhwinder. Not till we hear the sounds of shells falling. And when we go, we are taking only our rations and clothes, he says.He and his 85-year-old father, Ajit Singh, give a guided tour of the five rooms in the house, each with massive box beds, other furniture, television sets, a fridge. If we have to go, we will be leaving all this behind, says Ajit Singh.He declares that he will stay behind to look after the house. I can also help the soldiers when they go to the front, he says. The younger boys also declare that if war comes, they will stay on in solidarity with the soldiers.That sentiment is voiced by many of those who remain in the village, even as people express confidence that nothing will happen. Swaran Singh and Rajwant say one night at a relatives place was enough. Theres no place like home, she says. The couple also brought their two young sons back with them.People in the village would rather wait for the first signals.There are no signals yet. We have seen earlier, in 1965, 1971, 1999 and 2001, that the Army becomes very visible at the first sign of trouble. We havent seen any soldiers, its still only the BSF. Next, the Army breaks all the bridges over the drains, and then they increase the water level in the drain to about 7-8 feet. None of those things have happened, says Jiaoun, predicting that as the initial tension wears off, people will begin to return.About 1,000 acres of land owned by people in Rajaoke lies beyond the wire fence. Farmers are given access to these fields six days of the week.The day BSF reopens the gates to those fields, that will be the sign that people can come back and stay for good, says Gurmit Singh, a young farmer whose land lies close to the fence.For now, though, the young farmer says he wants to take photographs of himself with some soldiers and send them to his friends on WhatsApp, to tell them hes standing ready to help the Indian Army.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express File Photo) MS Swaminathan. (Express File Photo)With Delhi choking with smog created by burning of paddy straw in neigbhouring states, noted agri-scientist M S Swaminathan today suggested to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ways to commercialise the straw to help tide over the problem. Swaminathan said paddy straw can be used for making animal feed, cardboard, paper and other products. He will soon send a detailed note to the PM in this regard.I have told the Prime Minister how we can make use of paddy straw instead of burning it. You cannot ask farmers to stop burning paddy straw as he has to prepare his field for the next crop. You must find a mechanism to commercialise it, Swaminathan told PTI on the sidelines of an event here.Watch What Else Is Making NewsA technology has been developed in Maharashtra for using paddy straw as animal feed, he said.You add urea and molasses in paddy straw, you can use it as animal feed. There are many different ways, paddy straw can be utilised. The PM was very interested and I will soon send a note to him on this topic, he said.India produces 140 million tonnes of paddy and 280 million tonnes of rice straw in a year, he added.Swaminathan, known as Father of Indias Green Revolution, was sharing dias with the Prime Minister at first ever international conference of agro-biodiversity being held here.While addressing the event, he spoke on the issue saying that when we talk about agro-biodiversity, it is not about grains alone but about the whole plant.Paddy straw enriched with urea and molasses is a wonderful animal feed, he said while citing example of research work done in Mynamar in this regard.Meanwhile, the Centre has called a meeting of Environment Ministers of all neighbouring states on Monday to curb stubble burning by farmers which has made Delhi a gas chamber.There is an emergency situation in Delhi. The situation is bad, particularly for children, patients, women and elderly. We need to take immediate steps to deal with the situation, Union Environment Minister Anil Dave had said.Cases of severe breathlessness, asthma and allergy have sharply risen in Delhi as the city remains blanketed in thick layer of toxic air due to the worst smog in 17 years, aggravated by use of Diwali crackers last week.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)On the lane outside, paramilitary men stand armed with automatic rifles and pellet guns. Inside, Ahsan Niyaz prepares for his forthcoming Class X Board exams.With schools and colleges across Kashmir shut for close to three months after the July 8 killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education has rescheduled the annual Class 10 and 12 exams in Kashmir from October to the second week of November. That leaves Ahsan, 16, with less than 45 days to prepare for his first Board exam: science on November 15.WATCH VIDEO |A week before the exams were announced, Ahsans father Niyaz Ahmad Dar, a veterinarian in Samboora village of Kashmirs Pulwama district, decided to temporarily move him to his maternal uncles home in Srinagar. Their village is in south Kashmir, the epicentre of the current protests, which continues to simmer, and Ahsans father wanted him out of there. My father wanted me to study in a relatively calmer place, he says. Ahsan, a student of Delhi Modern Public School in Pampore, will return to Pulwama just before the exams.For the last 15 days, Ahsan has been spending his days in a room on the first floor of his uncles home at Kawa Mohalla in Khanyar, a locality in old Srinagar. In a room up a flight of stairs leading from the living room, Ahsan sits on the carpeted floor surrounded by his books, the suitcase that he brought from home serving as his study table. Since he came to Srinagar, he has been in this room all day and night, often bringing his food up to eat.Ahsan Niyaz reads book in his house in down town Srinagar.

After a hot cup of salty tea, he has settled down with his social science  history, geography and civics  books. He sits crosslegged on the floor, gently rocking back and forth as he reads from the textbook perched on the suitcase.WATCH VIDEO: Surgical Strikes: No Need To Show Evidence Of PoK Strikes, Says Government SourcesHistory is a tough subject and needs a fresh mind. So I usually study the subject in the morning, he says. The 16-year-olds knowledge of history and civics is informed by the ground realities of Kashmir. The book says India is a federal country, but is it? he asks. Where is the democracy they write about? I havent seen it anywhere in Kashmir.Ahsan says his school in Pulwama had only completed 50 per cent of the syllabus when the protests started. His father then arranged for a private tutor to teach him science and mathematics and he is now banking on what he learnt in those classes.I studied Urdu and English by myself, but I am worried about the practical exams. We havent done any practicals in the science subjects; I dont know what we are going to do in the exams. I dont want to do badly in science as thats my favourite subject, he says, adding that he hopes to be an aeronautical engineer some day.Ahsan arrived at his uncles home on September 17. To compensate for the time lost during the last three months, his uncle, a shopkeeper, enrolled him in a private tuition centre nearby. The classes are held for three hours every day, a subject a day. Its physics today, he says, stealing a quick look at his watch.Its 8.55 am and Ahsan has to reach the tuition centre at 9 am. He picks up his backpack and sprints down the stairs. On the street outside, the tension is palpable. Ahsan, though, appears calm: hands in his pockets, he walks past the paramilitary personnel, past the graffiti on compound walls and shop shutters that read, We Want Freedom and Go India Go Back.Freedom is a fraught subject in Kashmir, more so for a 16-year-old whose movements have been severely restricted  first by the forces on the road and now the exams. Both his uncle and father have strictly forbidden him from leaving the house. No TV or sports either. His Nokia phone is the only distraction he is allowed, but with the government suspending outgoing calls on pre-paid connections, there is little he can do with it, except hope for his mother or younger brother to call. The walk to the tuition centre is the only time he gets to step outside his uncles home.Our earlier visits to Srinagar have never been this tense. This time, when we decided to come, my father said we would have to leave home before sunrise, before the protesters and the security personnel came out, he says.Ahsan Niyaz at a private tuition centre in Khanyars Kawa Mohalla locality.

Mohammad Junaid, 16, says, Even if we assume things are going to be normal once again, what about those who have been hit by pellets and have lost their vision? Will they ever get justice? By now, Ahsan looks visibly agitated.He has his reasons. On July 9, Tabish Rafiq, his classmate in the Pulwama school, was hit by pellets in both theeyes. Tabish will never be able to see with his right eye and there has been some loss of vision in his left eye, says Ahsan. I couldnt go to meet him; the CRPF men didnt allow me. I only read about him in the newspaper, he says.Back at his uncles home after the three-hour tuition session, Ahsan eats his lunch from a bowl  rice and vegetables.Ahsan Niyaz eats food in his house in down town Srinagar.

His aunt Gulshana, who has done her Masters in maths and teaches at a private school, has set him a test paper that he will have to begin solving at 6 pm.Maths doesnt need cramming so afternoons are the best time to practise the subject. If it had been social science, Urdu or English, I would have dozed off, he says.By the time he is done with his maths paper, its 8 pm and Ahsan starts with his science subjects  physics, chemistry and biology.On most days, he says, his mind drifts, especially when he hears chants of azadi. When that happens, he simplyshuts the window and comes back to his books.Our teacher has told us not to think about what is happening on the streets and focus on studies. But thatsdifficult, he says.Back home, he would read Greater Kashmir, the English newspaper his father subscribes to, and feel sad about all thats happening.Now, he doesnt read papers that regularly  all he worries about are his exams. I was stunned when I heard about the date sheet. How can they hold exams in these circumstances, when we havent even completed our syllabus? he says.He looks at his watch  its 9 pm, time for dinner. He will now study for about an hour and a half before hitting the bed. I am confident I will complete my syllabus, but I am a bit nervous because it is the first time that I am writing my Boards, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Addressing the first ever International Agro-biodiversity Congress in the national capital, Modi cautioned against growing threat to plant and animal species and said there is a need to adopt a shared vision for conserving them through focused research and proper management of genetic resources.World over, crores of poor people are fighting hunger, malnutrition and poverty. To address these issues, science and technology is very important. While finding solution to these problems, we should not ignore sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity, Modi said at the conference attended by about 900 delegates from 60 countries.There is a need to assess the negative impact of use of the technology in agriculture, he said, citing the example of pesticide usage affecting honeybee in pollination process. In lighter vein, he also mentioned that technologys negative impact on people was such that they do not remember their own telephone numbers after the introduction of mobiles.So, we need to be alert on how application of technology in agriculture is bringing changes, he said. Terming pesticides as a major concern in agri ecosystem, Modi said, The use of pesticide not only kills pests but also those insects necessary for entire eco-system. Therefore, there is a need to audit development of Science. In the absence of audit, the world is facing various challenges.Expressing concern over extinction of genetic resources, the Prime Minister called for national, international, private bodies and experts to work together and prepare a shared vision for conservation of agro-biodiversity. We will also have to see how various rules related to agro-biodiversity can be harmonised so that these laws do not come in the way of development of agriculture and farmers. He said about 50-150 species are getting extinct every day despite adoption of the recommendations of the 1992 biological diversity convention. In the coming years, there is threat of extinction of one out of eight birds and one fourth of animals. We will have to change our thinking.Watch What Else is Making NewsPeople have exploited natural resources blindly in the name of development. As a result, challenges are going to grow in the coming days. In the current scenario, discussion and research on agro-biodiversity are very important for achieving global food, nutrition, health and environment security.Stating that the problem of climate change has been due to imbalance in nature, Modi said, In view of global warming threat, we have ratified Paris agreement on October 2. India is playing a leading role.Stating that each nation is adopting a different way to protect agro-biodiversity, Modi said, It would be appropriate if we prepare a register to keep a record of all such practices and then do research to find out which practices need to be promoted. He added that biodiversity conservation should be more a matter of individual consciousness than rules and regulation.Elaborating on the richness of Indias biodiversity, Modi said there are more than 47,000 plant species and over 89,000 animal species besides over 8,100 km of coastal areas. India has been able to protect genetic resources as ancestors linked agri-produce with culture. The country has been able to conserve many varieties including Konamani rice variety in South India, Agnibora in Assam, Bhalia wheat in Gujarat, he added.India has also helped other nations in conserving agro-biodiversity, Modi said, noting that Haryanas buffalo breed Murah and Gujarats Zafrabadi are known as international trans-boundary breeds. However, he pointed out that the country has been able to register only 160 animal species and urged to focus on research in this area to identify more species.Emphasising on widening the scope of research for value-addition on the strength of biodiversity, Modi mentioned how a high nutritional grass variety Banni in Gujarat was helping in increasing milk production. Through value addition in the characteristic of this grass, we can promote this grass in the country. We need to expand the scope of research for this, he said, adding that value-addition can be done in castor, millets and mushroom.He made it clear however that there should not be any damage to species while doing value addition. Human beings have created a problem of climate change by interfering in the nature. Rise in temperature is affecting life cycle of plants and animals. As per one estimate, 16 per cent of wild species will be on the verge of extinction by 2050. This situation is a cause of concern, he said.Stating that agro-biodiversity management is a priority for all nations, Modi stressed on conserving genetic resources in gene banks and making it available for farmers. We need to create such a mechanism so that our farmers are able to analyse desirable genes in their farm fields and for which they should get good price. Such farmers should be involved in research work, he said.Modi also called for blue revolution and asked scientists to focus not only on fisheries but also on sea weeds farming.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(PTI Photo) West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee. (PTI Photo)A FIVE-DAY food festival, the brainchild of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, meant to celebrate Bengali cuisine globally and provide farmers a platform for their produce, has come in for criticism from the Opposition, which has termed it hypocritical and an insult for a state where poverty and financial crisis have often resulted in many not having enough to eat.The Ahare Bangla food festival, held at the Milan Mela grounds in Kolkata from October 21 to October 25, saw hundreds turning up.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOrganised by the state animal resource development department, the event saw four state organisations, 23 sweet shops and 20 restaurateurs participating. The festival is now in its second year and has an international outreach with stalls from Bangladesh, China and Russia participating. The queues stretched on endlessly. A total 103 food counters served more than 550 items. It was an incredible opportunity for the people to get a taste of classic Bengali dishes alongside new items that they had never tried before, said Animal Husbandry Minister Swapan Debnath.The festival saw a variety of items  from traditional bhapa ilish to emu steaks. While traditional vegetarian dishes were highlighted on October 22, eggs were the delicacy on October 24 and fish on October 25.While the government has been ecstatic at the reception of the event, the Opposition less so. It has alleged that the festival was an unnecessary squandering of tax payers money and an insult to the poor, who cannot even get enough to eat.Ahead of the Assembly elections earlier this year, the ruling Trinamool Congress was confident of its rice politics  extending the scope of the National Food Security Act to reach out to 6.5 crore people instead of 3.5 crore (over 70 per cent of the states population). The Bengal famine of 1943, consequent cases of what the government euphemistically refers to as hunger deaths or death due to chronic ailments neglected in the past have entrenched hunger as a vital issue during elections.A myriad representation of hunger by artists ranging from Chittaprosad to Somnath Hore have formed the iconography for hunger in the post-colonial Bengal, which continues today. Mamata herself is not unaware of this. At rallies, she is often introduced as the anna data  goddess of food  by her party members. It was no accident that the new state secretariat was named Nabanna, after Bijon Bhattacharyas play on famine.For the Left and Congress, the Ahare Bangla festival has proven an ideal platform to hit out at Mamata. Left cadres had hit the street, protesting the wastage of government funds through its Anahare Bangla (Bengal starving) programme. A day before the inauguration of the food fest, Left leaders had organised a protest that defaced the venues gate with posters highlighting starvation in Bengal and deaths due to malnutrition in the tea gardens.The government should give priority to issues like unemployment, factory lockouts, dengue outbreaks and not organise a food festival. It is an insult to those who dont get enough to eat, said Left leader Sujan Chakraborty.The Congress, on the other hand, has alleged that the fest was a gimmick. Party president Adhir Ranjan Chowudhury said: It seems Banerjee is mocking the common people. In a state where farmers do not get paid for their crops and a lot of people cannot buy two square meals a day, what significance does a food festival hold?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: File) Air India contended that the enhancement of compensation by the State Commission was not justified as it was highly disproportionate to the negligence/deficiency in service alleged by the complainant. (Source: File)Air India has been directed to pay Rs one lakh by the apex consumer commission as compensation for serving stale food to a passenger aboard a Mumbai-New York flight. The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, while dismissing the revision petition filed by the airline in 2015, said the nature of deficiency in service could have affected the health of several passengers. Taking into account the nature of deficiency in service and the fact that it would have affected the health of several passengers, we do not find any fault with the order of State Commission enhancing compensation to Rs one lakh, the bench, presided by Justice Ajit Bharihoke, said while also upholding the award of Rs 10,000 as litigation cost by district forum.The Maharashtra State Consumer Commission had earlier enhanced to Rs one lakh from Rs 15,000, the compensation awarded by the district forum, saying the passenger might have been required to go food-less during the remaining journey and such conditions create a bad situation during air travel. According to the complaint filed by Malti Madhukar Pahade, she was served with stale food while travelling in the Air India flight from Mumbai to New York. She claimed she also found a strand of hair in the rice bowl.Pahade described the bad state of curd served and referred it as green as cherry. While challenging the State Commissions order, Air India contended that the enhancement of compensation by the State Commission was not justified as it was highly disproportionate to the negligence/deficiency in service alleged by the complainant. The bench, also comprising member S M Kantikar, dismissed the contention and upheld the state commissions order which said a passenger travelling with a reputed airline expected minimum courtesy and proper food for human consumption.It also noted that the airline had fined the caterer Rs 20,000 for serving stale food on board. We do not wish to comment upon the motive or reason of the concerned authority to impose such a meagre amount of fine on the defaulting caterer particularly when the food supplied by the caterer is served to all the passengers travelling in the flight, the bench said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Brown Plant Hopper nymphs feeding on a paddy plant.Hot and dry weather raises the chances of whitefly attacks, as Punjabs farmers discovered for cotton last year. This year, it is humid and warm conditions, particularly in September, that has put paid to their hopes of a bumper paddy harvest. The villain: an innocuous-looking insect called the brown plant hopper (BPH).Read | After whitefly, brown plant hopper turns nemesis for Punjabs farmersUnlike most other pests, this one typically strikes very late, when the paddy crop is already 80-90 days old and in the final grain-filling stage. The female moths lay eggs from early-September that hatch within 10 days. The larvae emerging from them are the real baddies. These immature nymphs settle at the lower stem or culm of the paddy plant, from where they start sucking the sap. Since this sap rich in carbohydrates is transported through the phloem tissues to the grains that are still forming, it being sucked also impacts filling.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe resultant grains tend to be ill-filled, light-weight and chaffy. While it may appear that the farmer has harvested 20-21 quintals of basmati paddy per acre, actual yields would be only 15-16 quintals. The farmer will also get a lower price because there would be a higher percentage of broken rice produced during milling, explains A K Singh, head of the Indian Agricultural Research Institutes (IARI) division of genetics.The entire lifecycle of the BPH insect  from the laying of eggs to the larvae becoming adult moths  is just 25-30 days, of which the most dangerous nymphal stage lasts 15-20 days. This time, the maximum nymphal population was noticed from September 25 at the grain-filling stage (when the milky starch material turns first into soft and then hard dough) about a week or 10 days before harvest. The sultry and cloudy weather was clearly favourable to the buildup, notes Singh.According to Sarjiwan Singh Manhas, research & development head of Syngenta South Asia, BPH infestation is often difficult to detect since the pest attacks the lower portions of the paddy stems. We tell farmers to go for prophylactic insecticide spraying. It should be done when they notice even a few hoppers in neighbouring fields in the early stages of the crop. The usual practice, instead, is to spray when the build-up has already happened and the plant would have grown to some three feet height, at which the required quantum of the chemical may not reach the bottom parts where the insect is present, he points out.The Switzerland-based (now Chinese-owned) Syngentas product Chess  the active ingredient molecule is pymetrozine  is seen as the most effective against BPH today. In our 200 demonstration plots and two learning centres attended by 10,000 farmers in Punjab and Haryana, we have shown that you can control the pest through timely and the right kind of spraying. The paddy grown in these sites did not suffer yield loss even this year when infestation levels were so high, claims Manhas.Pritam Singh Hanjra, a progressive farmer from Urlana Khurd village in Haryanas Panipat district, does not dispute the effectiveness of Chess, but is concerned about the price. It costs Rs 6,000 per kg and you need to spray 120 grams per acre. That works out to Rs 720, excluding the cost of spraying itself which is another Rs 200 per litre. Also, I dont know how long it will be effective. Earlier, we were using Applaud (buprofezin molecule of Dow Chemical), Actara (Syngentas thiamethoxam) and Confidor (Bayers imidacloprid), but the pest has developed resistance against all of these, he says.Moreover, it isnt just BPH. Paddy farmers are also spraying against other pests such as stem borer and neck blast. The most effective chemicals to control them now are Coragen (chlorantraniliprole) and Galileo (picoxystrobin) respectively, both belonging to DuPont. These again cost between Rs 700 to Rs 800 per acre each. As farmers, we have no choice but do everything to protect our crop, complains Hanjra.An alternative approach to spraying, which the IARI is presently working at, is to breed for resistance through introduction of genes sourced from both traditional landrace cultivars as well as wild relatives of paddy.The countrys premier publicly-funded farm research institute has transferred the Pi9 gene obtained from Oryza minuta (a wild relative of normal cultivated rice, which is Oryza sativa) to its popular Pusa Basmati-1 variety, in order to make the latter moderately resistant to neck blast and highly resistant to leaf blast fungus. Likewise, two genes  Xa21 from Oryza longistaminata (another wild relative) and xa13 from BJ1 (a traditional landrace)  have been incorporated into Pusa Basmati-1 to confer resistance to the deadly bacterial blight pathogen.For BPH control, too, IARI is looking at transferring the Bph 17 gene sourced from Rathu Heenati (a traditional Sri Lankan red rice cultivar) and the Bph 18 gene from Oryza australiensis (a wild relative) into its improved Pusa-1121 and Pusa Basmati-6 varieties.In all these cases, the transfer of the target genes from the resistant donor lines has been achieved through molecular breeding based on marker-assisted selection. We did this first in basmati varieties, because there is a huge export market for this rice and farmers cannot risk too much application of pesticides. Through molecular breeding, we are ensuring that only the particular genes of interest get introduced without compromising on the unique basmati grain traits, informs A K Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Sahil Walia A farmer tilling his fields after burning paddy straw at Charuni village in Kurukshetra. Source: Sahil WaliaPlumes of smoke are rising from the fields on National Highway 1. By the end of October or sooner, the smoke will be a thick blanket in the air over Haryana, extending all the way to the national capital. Its the season for paddy stubble burning.In this district of Kurukshetra, harvested paddy fields are now black with ash. In between the wheat-paddy cycle, some farmers grow potatoes or mustard. The sowing of these crops has already started at some places.Karambir, a farmer at Charuni Jattan village, follows the wheat-paddy cycle every year. Having harvested paddy from half of his six acres of land, Karambir did what a majority of other farmers in his village are doing. He set the paddy stubble on fire.The farmers have no option but to burn the stubble. Earlier when we were harvesting with our hands, the crop was cut in such a way that we could make bundles of stubble to be utilised as fodder or send to cardboard-making factories. Now, when we use combines for harvesting, the stubble that remains is of no use. Rather, it creates problems as it does not mix in the soil. The only option is to burn the fields and then turn the soil before sowing the next crop, said Karambir.Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to here share Karambirs opinion. They say while they know burning fields robs the soil of its nutrients, they have no alternative.At a little distance from Karambirs fields are four acres owned by another farmer, Shakti. Standing on his burnt field, Shakti says labour for cutting the crops manually is not easily available. Further, the labourers charge Rs 4,000 per acre for harvesting and take around three to four hours. On the other hand, those giving combines on rent charge Rs 1,200 per acre. With the use of combines, an acre can be harvested in half an hour, says Shakti, adding for the farmers this is more economical.During the 2015 harvest, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board did a survey in 10 paddy growing districts in the state with the help of Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC), an agency of Department of Science and Technology. The districts surveyed were Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.The survey showed a decline of around 21 per cent in crop burning practice in the past three years. In the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier, in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 percent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 per cent of the rice cropped area in 2013.The survey said the total paddy stubble burning area in the 10 districts had come down by 3.5 percentage points as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percentage points as compared to 2013.In eight districts, there was a marked reduction in stubble burning. In Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar alone, there was an increase. The decline appears to have not made a significant impact on the air quality in those two years. The report also indicated that early rice stubble burning in major area takes place during second to fourth week of October in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Panipat. While late burning in major areas takes place during first week to third week of November in rest of the districts.A farmer at Chanarthal village in Kurukshetra, who also burnt the stubble in his fields, said he wanted to plant mustard in a day or two, but it would be impossible if it were not for the burning. The officials take decisions without knowing ground realities. If the government wants us to stop burning the stubble, they should provide some alternatives. What do we do with the stubble, he said, not willing to be named.President of Bharatiya Kisan Union in the state, Sewa Singh Arya, says, The stubble that is left after harvesting using combines is not usable as fodder. Using a tractor shreds it to pieces. If the stubble is not set on fire, then the next crop cannot be sown. There is a need for the government to provide some incentives to the farmers.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has prepared a strategy to tackle the problem. All Deputy Commissioners have been advised to issue necessary directions to all the revenue field officials like BDPOs, tehsildars and patwaris to instruct the sarpanchs and panchs in the villages for persuading and educating the farmers on the ban and on the harmful effects of such acts.All DCs have also been advised to direct the gram sachivs and patwaris to bring all the incidents of burning of wheat stubble or paddy straw and other agricultural waste in the open fields to his notice within 30 minutes of the occurrence of such incidents. In case they fail to do so, it shall be treated as dereliction of duty and disciplinary action would be initiated against them.Apart from HARSAC being asked to monitor stubble burning in the 10 districts, Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imagery reports / data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis.The government has decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project. An official said government or panchayat land would be explored for setting up of the project and storage of biomass.Further, power utilities will buy power from the biomass power projects on the HERC tariff or better tariff. The agriculture department will support the setting up of bio-fertilizer plants using biomass and would devise a scheme to provide subsidy and to buy the fertilizer from such plants.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said awareness is being created among the farmers. He added once a biomass power project is set up, the farmers will have an incentive not to burn the stubble.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
593ef9fa7be9e024e459534a,"Crop devastation: After whitefly, brown plant hopper turns nemesis for Punjab’s farmers",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/punjab-farmers-whitefly-brown-plant-hopper-crop-loss-paddy-3104727/,2016-10-27,"Another farmer sitting in front of his unloaded paddy at Jalandhars grain mandi. (Express photo) Another farmer sitting in front of his unloaded paddy at Jalandhars grain mandi. (Express photo)For Punjabs farmers, fortune always seems to smile on the other side. Last year, it was the whitefly sucking pest that ravaged their cotton crop. This time round, its the brown plant hopper (BPH) that has caused significant yield and price realisation losses for paddy grown in large swathes of the state. And there couldnt have been a worse time for the BPH (kala tela, in local parlance) to strike  barely a week or ten days before a bumper crop was ready for harvesting.Read: A surgical strike that farmers in Indias granary were least prepared forIn 2015, an estimated 1.36 lakh hectares (lh) out of the total 4.36 lh area sown to cotton in Punjab had suffered whitefly infestation. It led to farmers planting a mere 2.56 lh under the fibre crop this year. And ironically, the ones who did plant are celebrating today, as not only have there been no whitefly pest attacks, but even realisations are pretty good. Farmers have sold kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) of various Bt hybrids at Rs 4,800-5,300 per quintal this season, compared to last years Rs 3,900-4,700 rate range.Watch What Else Is Making NewsBaldev Singh, a farmer from Panniwala Mahla village of Abohar tehsil in Fazilka district, regrets having drastically slashed his cotton area from 32 acres to 3 acres this year. I did it after my crop in 8 acres was totally destroyed by whitefly. How on earth would I have known that there will be no pest attacks or prices are going to be better this time? he points out. Harpreet Singh from Lakhmirwala in Mansa districts Budhlada tehsil, on the other hand, is elated. He did not reduce his 15 acres area planted to cotton. His yields have also been 8 quintals/acre, as against last years average of 5 quintals.State officials have been quick to take credit for no whitefly devastation this year. We maintained close and constant vigil through 500 scouts and 50 field supervisors, who were appointed for the first time. Thanks to their regular alerts, we could save the crop in all the eight cotton-growing districts (Ferozepur, Fazilka, Faridkot, Muktsar, Moga, Barnala, Bathinda and Mansa) through timely pesticide sprays. This was even after whitefly incidence was detected initially in about 12,000 acres in Khuian Sarwar and Abohar blocks of Fazilka, informs Jasbir Singh Bains, director of agriculture, Punjab government.No such close and constant vigil from the entire official machinery was, however, observed for in paddy. Farmers in Punjab expanded the area under paddy this year to 30.10 lh, from 29.75 lh in 2015. The increase came entirely from parmal (non-basmati) varieties; basmati paddy acreage actually witnessed shrinkage from 7.63 lh to 4.96 lh.But despite this switch to a crop supposedly less prone to pest attacks or price risks, large paddy-growing areas in the state have reported BPH infestation. The farmers have these cases have either suffered lower yields or resorted to premature harvesting in order to limit crop damage. Devinder Singh of Khabe Dogran village in Tarn Taran district was able to harvest only 23-24 quintals of paddy per acre, as against his normal average of 30-32 quintals. Moreover, the kala tela attack forced him to go for early harvesting and sell his grain at Rs 1,350 per quintal, below the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,510 per quintal. The arhtiyas (commission agents) in the mandi told me that the MSP is only for paddy with maximum moisture content of 17 per cent, whereas my grain had more than that limit, he complains.Amarjit Singh, who has been the sarpanch of Chandke village in Gurdaspurs Batala teshil for the last 30 years, alleges that state procurement agencies have colluded with arhtiyas and rice millers/shellers to use high moisture content as a pretext to loot farmers this time. I was paid between Rs 1,430 and Rs 1,450 per quintal. They imposed a cut of Rs 60-80 against the MSP in the name of moisture content, adds this farmer whose extended family owns 100 acres, of which he alone cultivates 40 acres.In many parts of Punjab, farmers are said to be delivering paddy with moisture content going up to 22 per cent. Every one percentage point increase beyond the permitted 17 per cent moisture limit attracts a value cut of Rs 20/quintal. Not more than 15 per cent farmers have received the full MSP of Rs 1,510 per quintal this year. 85 per cent would have had to face a minimum cut of Rs 20/quintal. The government should have granted a one-time moisture limit relaxation of 21 per cent, keeping in view the totally unanticipated BPH attack at the fag end of the season, states Ajmer Singh Lakhowal, chairman, Punjab Mandi Board Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to agreed that procurement operations this time have been smooth overall. The government is aware that Assembly elections are due early next year and has ensured prompt lifting of our paddy in mandis. But they should have also kept strict vigil on the arhtiyas, sheller owners and government inspectors, who have taken advantage of kala tela to imposed arbitrary value cuts and deny farmers the MSP, asserts Himmat Singh of Kishangarh village in Jalandhar, who sold his 250 quintals of paddy at Rs 1,300/quintal when I should have got at least Rs 1,400.Jagmohan Singh Dakaunda, general secretary of a Bhartiya Kisan Union faction he himself heads, believes that the Punjab government should have taken up the issue of moisture relaxation with the Centre. Farmers are not at fault here. The high moisture content is only a result of their being forced to harvest a bit early. Haryana farmers, too, have experienced the same problem from kala tela this time, but the government there has made sure that their entire crop is purchased with a value cut not exceeding Rs 10-20/quintal, he claims.According to Gurdev Singh Deol, former head of the Punjab Agricultural Universitys department of entomology and now a consultant with the Tata Trust, high humidity levels during grain-filling stage are the most conducive to BPH pest infestation. They attack the stem of the paddy plants and suck the juice from it, which affects grain formation as well. A good spell of rains during September about 2-3 weeks before harvesting is helpful in clearing the pest. This time, we have unfortunately had high humidity, but very little rains in September, he notes.While kala tela has been a frequent visitor in the past decade, Bains admits that its incidence this year has been the highest since 2011-12. When farmers began to notice the sudden build-up, they panicked and prematurely harvested their crop even with high moisture content. In fact, both mandi arrivals of paddy as well as procurement by government agencies have so far been higher relative to last years corresponding levels. It is a different matter, though, that bulk of this grain would have fetched farmers less than the official MSP. To what extent they would attach the blame for that on the ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party alliance remains to be seen.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Thirty years ago this week, the space shuttle Challenger exploded on take-off, killing the seven-member crew. The front page of the New York Times of January 29, 1986 is back in circulation, telling how thousands watched the falling debris of the dream that the shuttle embodied, of making spaceflight as commonplace as jetliners.The crew of the International Space Station (and Flight Operations on the ground) observed a moment of silence for the martyrs of Americas push into space  the crews of Challenger, Columbia and Apollo 1. The little video from the ISS on Nasa.gov is more moving than all the political tributes recorded on earth.Nearer home, after a brief struggle with lung cancer, Delhis much-loved editor Arindam Sen Gupta went to the big newsroom in the sky. Bong, as he was known to his numerous friends, was from the time when Indian medias second language was Bengali (the third was Malayalam, to the chagrin of the Hindi press). But he remained youthfully enthusiastic about the newspaperly life well into middle age and will be fondly remembered by many.Netflix, which has just gone global with launches in numerous countries including India, began an equally global crackdown on violators of geo-licensing last weekend. Netflix content varies across territories according to the rights acquired by the company, and many connoisseurs use proxy servers, DNS switchers and virtual private networks to circumvent the electronic barbed wire. For instance, if you are in Britain and want to see an American documentary, you would want to ride a VPN which gives you a US IP address. The US service has the biggest stash, so it is the usual target. VPN piracy is an open secret, an issue which streaming television has inherited from internet radios like Pandora. Now, apparently, such TV tourists are being blocked by Netflix, but there is still a way: the one-man website uNoGS.com (unofficial Netflixonline Global Search), which provides listings of shows with language options and VPNs which can provide access to them. This may seem like piracy but really, does geo-restriction by licensing make any sense when the biggest distribution pipe, the internet, respects no physical borders? Geo-restriction is a totally legacy idea, and the industry will have to dream up a borderless licensing system for television, cinema and radio.The Indian media went sort of ape when Donald Trump said, in a CNN interview, that India is doing great. Unexpected praise is always heart-warming but shouldnt we be worried, too? Its Trump doing the praising, and earlier, he had accused India and China of disrespecting and cheating the US just because its down. Later in the week, the US media went wild over Trumps controversial exit from a Fox show, apparently on account of a feud with the host, though his foes believe hes just chicken and his voters protested that his opponents would be able to say something cogent and he wouldnt be able to carpet-bomb them into silence. Why not? Its Fox, isnt it? But the mainstream press missed the finest Trump story, which has been flourishing in geekdom: some people from Rice University are putting together a new programming language called TrumpScript on the collaboration site Github. Built on Python, it exhibits Trump-like behaviour. Its motto is, Make Python great again, and it replaces the binary logical opposition of true and false (or one and zero) with the totally unfuzzy fact and lie.Other rules: No floating point numbers, only integers. America never does anything halfway. And: No import statements allowed (they pull code from elsewhere). All code has to be home-grown and American made. If you want to play around with TrumpScript, download it from github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript.Amply rewarded and re-energised by a Padma award, Anupam Kher has returned to the trenches, reiterating that the idea that India is intolerant is a joke. It is  Khers very own private joke gone public. The award wapsi campaign never accused India of being intolerant. It opposed a government with whose blessings the fringe was turning into the mainstream, creating new possibilities for targeted violence. But it doesnt matter any more. Now that people are willing to re-accept awards that they returned last year (will they re-return them later?), our heads hurt too much to care.pratik.kanjilal@expressindia.comFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo)The US and ASEAN nations can advance a shared vision of a regional order where disputes are resolved through peaceful means, President Barack Obama has said as he welcomed leaders from the region for talks expected to discuss Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea.Hosting 19 leaders of the ASEAN countries for the summit, Obama said, Few regions present more opportunity to the 21st century than the Asia Pacific.Together, we can also continue to increase our security cooperation to meet shared challenges, he said as he welcomed leaders of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia at Rancho Mirage in California.In recent years, the US has increased its maritime security assistance to its allies and partners in the region, improving mutual capabilities to protect lawful commerce and to respond to humanitarian crisis, he said.Here at this summit, we can advance our shared vision of a regional order where international rules and norms, including freedom of navigation, are upheld and where disputes are resolved through peaceful, legal means, Obama said.This is for the first time that the US President has hosted ASEAN leaders for a summit meeting.Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea, where China and several Southeast Asian states have conflicting and overlapping claims, is expected to figure in the joint declaration of two-day summit.Im very confident that, among other topics that we will discuss during the next day and a half, this (the South China Sea) will be an important one  by no means the only one, National Security Advisor Susan Rice told reportersIm confident that our shared commitment to upholding these norms will be reinforced, she said in response to a question.We will be continuing to work with our ASEAN partners on a potential statement that we might issue together. This statement will cover a wide range of topics. It wont be focused primarily on the South China Sea, she said in response to a question.We obviously have issued such statements in the past with ASEAN, and in it we consistently underscore our shared commitment to a peaceful resolution of disputes, freedom of commerce and navigation, the rule of law, and the necessity of disputes being resolved through peaceful, legal means, Rice said.We also have expressed concerns about efforts to resolve disputes through other means, and well continue to do so, she said.Observing that Americas ties with Asia has expanded dramatically in the seven year of the Obama Administration, Rice said ASEAN is an increasingly important partner in addressing regional and global challenges  from maritime disputes to climate change, pandemic disease to violent extremism, sustainable development to trafficking in persons.During the summit, she said, the leaders would discuss their shared interest in promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, encouraging peaceful resolution of disputes and combatting terrorism, pandemic disease, climate change, and trafficking in persons.All countries were represented by their leader, except Myanmar, who sent Vice President Nyan Tun. Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung also turned up, reversing an earlier decision not to come.Rice said North Korea is a topic of interest to the entire region, certainly to the US and its allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea.So we will continue our work to contain and reduce the threat posed by North Korea. Well do it both in the context of our discussions here on the margins  this is not a topic formally on the agenda  but more urgently, as we have done bilaterally and trilaterally in our cooperation with the Korean government in Seoul and Japanese government as well, she said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

This contradicts our ideology, she said in Geneva. Syrias ambassador to Russia said U.S. war planes were responsible.White House national security adviser Susan Rice on Monday condemned in the strongest terms the intensified bombing of northern Syria, adding that it ran counter to commitments to reduce hostilities made by major powers last week in Munich.The Syrian civil war, reshaped by Russias intervention last September, has gone into an even higher gear since the United Nations sought to revive peace talks. The talks in Geneva were suspended earlier this month before they got off the ground.World powers agreed in Munich on Friday to a cessation of hostilities in Syria to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered, but the deal does not take effect until the end of this week and was not signed by any warring parties.Turkey shelled YPG positions for a third straight day on Monday to try to stop its fighters seizing Azaz, just 8 km from the border.

Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura made a surprise visit to Damascus on Monday and will hold talks with Syrias foreign minister on Tuesday, a Syrian government official told Reuters. A senior UN official later confirmed that de Mistura had arrived in Syria for an unscheduled visit to follow up on commitments made in Munich.But in a further clouding of the Munich deal, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Monday that any ceasefire did not mean each side had to stop using weapons, and that nobody was capable of securing the conditions for one within a week.At a news conference in Kiev, Turkeys prime minister doubted Russias commitment to any deal to cease hostilities, pointing to comments from Moscow that it would continue its air strikes regardless.They want to have just two options in front of the international community: Daesh or Assad, Davutoglu said, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.Turkey is enraged by the expansion of Kurdish influence in northern Syria, fearing it will encourage separatist ambitions among its own restive Kurds. Ankara considers the YPG a terrorist group.Davutoglu said Turkey would make the Menagh air base north of the city of Aleppo unusable if the YPG, which seized it over the weekend from Syrian insurgents, did not withdraw.Turkish Defence Minister Ismet Yilmaz said Ankara was not considering sending troops to Syria, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency.Syrias rebels, some backed by the United States, Turkey and their allies, say the YPG is fighting with the Syrian military and its backers  including Russia  against them in the five-year-old civil war. The YPG denies this.South of Azaz, the Kurdish-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, of which the YPG is a member, took around 70 percent of the town of Tal Rifaat, according to the Syrian Observatory, which monitors the war.HOSPITALS HITTens of thousands have fled to Azaz from towns and villages where there is heavy fighting between the Syrian army and militias.We have been moving scores of screaming children from the hospital, said medic Juma Rahal, following the missile strikes.

(Express Photo by Amit Mehra) Farmers in Punjab and Haryana say the bulk of burning happens in the first week of November. Here, a field in Panipat is set on fire to make way for the crop to be planted in November. (Express Photo by Amit Mehra)On one side of National Highway 1, a heap of dry leaves is up in flames. A few kilometres ahead, farmers in fields are burning the refuse left behind after threshing the paddy crop. The air is thick with smoke along parts of the highway in Haryana.Delhis annual pollution crisis has started  and it will only get worse. The large-scale burning of agricultural remains  the stalks left in the ground after the crop is harvested  is expected to begin in earnest in the first week of November. Farmers say the bulk of burning happens in the first two weeks of November, as the entire paddy crop has not been harvested yet. This is bad news for the air quality in Delhi.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne only needs to visit some villages in Sonepat and Panipat near National Highway 1 to realise the extent of the problem posed by burning of agricultural stubble. And to understand why farmers do it.When we used manual labour for harvesting, the stubble was easier to deal with. We would just till the farm again and the stubble would be mixed into soil. Now that we have started using machines to harvest, 8 -10 inches of stalks are left behind and these are difficult to deal with. Getting manual labourers  mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh  is expensive, time consuming and difficult, so everyone does it by machine, said Kherati Lal, 65, a farmer in Haryanas Panchi Gujra village near Murthal.The easiest thing in such a situation, he says, is to set fire to his farms to clear the stubble. Except, this is banned by the government.We would put 2 litres of kerosene and set fire to the whole thing. End of story. Now we have to bring in machines to turn the soil and cut and bury the stubble. We have to water this and run a tractor over it thrice to make sure it decays properly. The government has started keeping a strict check on fires now, so we burn only the stalks that come out along with the rice crop. Its a small quantity, he said.But even small quantities being burnt on each farm make for an air pollution disaster.As per officials at the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), 60,000 acres of land in Punjab is under cultivation of paddy. In Haryana, paddy is cultivated on around 30,000 acres. This produces 32 million tonnes of paddy straw.According to the first source apportionment study of Delhis air pollution by IIT Kanpur, about 30 per cent of pollution in Delhi is because of biomass burning, which includes agricultural, leaf and garbage burning.Several studies since have confirmed this. A recent study by scientists at the National Environment Engineering Research Institute said that 60 per cent of Delhis particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is contributed by neighbouring states. Of this 60 per cent, half is contributed by Punjab and Haryana.Despite efforts to curb such fires, farms in Haryana and Punjab have been going up in flames for the last two weeks, according to NASAs fire mapper. The map also shows that Punjab is seeing more fires, especially near Amritsar, as compared to Haryana.The effect on air quality is already visible. According to an analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, the air quality has dipped since September 25  something that can partly be attributed to a dip in wind speed and partly to the beginning of the harvest season.An analysis of the air quality on the National Air Quality Index shows that this October is, on average, more polluted than the last. Between October 6 and October 20, at R K Puram station, the average air quality was poor during both years. But this year, the value was 261 as opposed to 257 last year, the data shows.Meanwhile, with the Supreme Court, the Delhi High Court and the National Green Tribunal banning all such agricultural fires, state governments have started feeling the heat.The Haryana government has already issued almost 700 challans and collected lakhs in fines for farm fires this year. The progress in Punjab has been slower, with some officials suggesting this could have something to do with the upcoming assembly elections.But leader of Opposition in Haryana assembly and INLD leader Abhay Singh Chautala has criticised the decision of the BJP government in Haryana to impose a fine on farmers, and demanded that they be reimbursed.Removal of stubble from fields is expensive. A farmer cannot afford to pay Rs 10,000 per acre from his pocket for this. In several countries, machines are available using which stubble can be cut, tied up and sent to factories for use. The Haryana government has three such machines lying defunct, he claimed.Ram Niwas Gautam, 60, a resident of Manana Village near Panipat, said, I have a 4-acre farm. A farmer cant afford to buy a machine to get rid of the waste and hiring manual labour is out of question as they are rarely available and charge a lot of money. Labour contractors charge aroundRs 20,000; where do we get that kind of money? Only the big farmers can afford it.According to experts, the governments need a mix of prosecution and incentives to deal with the problem. In Punjab, for example, farmers are selling the straw to waste-to-energy plants for power generation, and a small amount is being sold to mushroom farms to use as substrate.Farmers should be paid Rs 1,000 per acre under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana so they can shun the practice of burning paddy straw. They should be given subsidies for buying Rotavator machines that help cut and mix agricultural stubble with soil. We need to understand why the farmers burn stubble and then deal with the basic problem, said Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain.*Many orders, little changeNov 2012Supreme Court mandated panel, Environment Pollution Control Authority, directs Punjab, Haryana to ensure complete ban on burning of agricultural stubble by 2014. States asked to promote alternate uses of paddy straw, such as power generation.Feb 2014NGT tells Ministry of Agriculture to hold meeting with Punjab, Haryana, Central Pollution Control Board, National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and prepare guidelines to control pollution from burning of agricultural remnants in fields.Dec 2015NGT orders fine for burning stubble. Its order states:*Land holders with less than 2 acres to payRs 2,500/- per incident*Rs 5,000 for land holders with 2 and 5 acres*Rs 15,000 for land holders with area more than 5 acres of land*Oct 2016Delhi HC issues orders to governments of Punjab, Haryana, UP and Rajasthan to prevent burning of agricultural stubble in their states. On October 4, Delhi government writes to environment ministers of some neighbouring states in this regard.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo used for representational purpose) The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. (Photo used for representational purpose)In a step to prevent distress sale of paddy in the state, Odisha government today set a tentative target of procuring 30 lakh tonnes of rice during the 2016-17 kharif marketing season (KMS) beginning November 1. The Food and Procurement Policy for Kharif Marketing Season, 2016-17 was approved at the cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here today, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister Sanjay Dasburma said.The cabinet approved a proposal to extend by another three months the period for reducing the rate of Value Added Tax (VAT) on pulses and dals of all kinds under the Odisha VAT Act, 2004, Chief Secretary A P Padhi said. As the state government procures paddy from farmers during Kharif and Rabi seasons separately under the KMS, the target was set to collect 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice, equivalent to 44 lakh tonnes of paddy.The minister said as per the minimum support price fixed by the Centre, farmers would get Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety of paddy. The rate of Grade-A variety of paddy was fixed at Rs 1,510 per quintal, he said, adding that procuring agencies and district administrations would make wide publicity regarding the FAQ (fair average quality) of paddy.While the state-run Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation procures 95 per cent of paddy, other agencies, if necessary, would be deployed in surplus districts, the minister said. He said the Kharif paddy would be procured during the period from November 2016 to March 2017 and Rabi paddy during May and June, 2017.The paddy would be procured from farmers who are registered in the online portals of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. So far 8.29 lakh farmers have got themselves registered with the department, the minister said, adding 95 per cent of the paddy producers have been provided Aadhaar numbers.Aadhaar seeding would be used for paddy procurement and the farmers would be paid online under the P-PAS system. The facility has been extended to 294 of 314 blocks in the state, he said. Replying to a question, the minister said while the state required only 19 lakh metric tonnes of rice for public distribution system, remaining rice is to be given to the FCI.The cabinet also extended another three months for imposition of one per cent VAT, instead of five per cent on pulses of all kinds in view of the demand of traders. Though the government has sustained a loss of about Rs 5 crore twoards VAT in three months due to reduction of the rate of VAT on pulses, it would like another three months extension as sale of pulses has increased, the Chief Secretary said.In another decision, the cabinet approved a proposal of the finance department to reduce the rate of VAT from 14.5 per cent to 5 per cent on LPG cylinder manufacturing. As neighbouring states like West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand maintain 5 per cent VAT on LPG cylinder manufacturing, the Odisha government would also bring it down to increase transaction, Padhi said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Marathwada has been in the grip of severe drought in the last four years  two during the Congress-NCP regime and two during the BJP-Sena-RPI government.Around 900 farmer suicides were reported in the eight districts of Marathwada region between January and October this year. During the same period last year, 700 farmer suicides were reported, according to officials at the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate.Compare this with 2013 and 2014, when a total of 600 suicides were reported in Marathwada. And between 2006 and 2012, less than 400 farmer suicides were reported on a yearly basis. The year 2015 recorded the highest number of farmer suicides  1,133 from January to December  in 10 years.Marathwada has been in the grip of severe drought in the last four years  two during the Congress-NCP regime and two during the BJP-Sena-RPI government. A year ago, the state government picked Osmanabad  which has seen several suicides  to implement a zero-suicide district plan.Since the plan was set in motion, the number of suicides in Osmanabad has in fact gone up  from 136 between August 2014 and August 2015 to 172 between August 2015 and August 2016. They spoke about zero suicides and look what shocking figures have emerged in Osmanabad. It is a telling commentary on the Devendra Fadnavis governments failure to save the lives of farmers, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said, The Fadnavis government only makes tall claims. If more than 1,000 farmer suicides have taken place in two years in Marathwada, it shows the complete failure of the government in taking care of the farmers, he said.The Fadnavis government maintained that it had put in place several plans to check farmer suicides, but a turnaround would take time.According to Beed district collector Naval Kishore Ram, the plans being implemented include offering rice and wheat at Rs 2/kg and Rs 3/kg to farmer families, critical health care benefits, crop insurance, counselling and guidance. Surgeries for critical ailments like heart and kidney problem are being performed free of cost in government hospitals and empanelled private hospitals, he added.Osmanabad district collector Prashant Narnavare said they had undertaken mass counselling and guidance programmes for farmers. This is being done through expert doctors. First we identify farmers who are mentally disturbed due to various reasons. We call them for counselling with experts, he said.Farmer suicides are not just due to crop failure or mounting debts, Ram added. There are several factors behind their suicide. It could be family pressure or illness, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo) In this Friday, November 4, 2016 photo, a farmer walks through smoke caused by setting his field on fire to prepare it for its next yield at Chandhat, in the state of Haryana, south of New Delhi, India. (AP Photo)As politicians engage in the blame game over hazardous air pollution in Delhi, millions struggle with hacking coughs and burning eyes. With Delhi continues to be covered in a grey haze, latest predictions show that the situation in the next few days is going to be better, but only slightly.According to System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), government data shows that the smog that enveloped the city midweek was the worst in the last 17 years. The concentration of PM 2.5, tiny particulate pollution that can clog lungs, averaged close to 500 micrograms per cubic meter.In comparison to Delhi, Mumbai fares much better. With moderate air quality and particulate matter averaged close to 140 micrograms per cubic meter. The best air quality, according to statistics put out by SAFAR, was discovered in Pune. Particulate matter in the city was found out be below 100 micrograms per cubic meter.Even as doctors have asked people in Delhi to stay indoors during the worst days, many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated. People still set off massive amounts of festival fireworks, piles of garbage burn all night and dust from the construction projects that dot the city is unchecked. And at the start of every winter, farmers in the states bordering the city begin burning straw from their rice paddy crop to clear the fields for planting wheat.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday asked Centre to intervene to mitigate the alarming levels of smog. He said that vehicle restriction measures like odd-even will not be able to bring down smog as initial studies suggest that the large scale influx of pollutant-laden smoke from Punjab and Haryana has aggravated the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Imphal Valley is dominated by Meities (Manipuri Hindus) and this particular area is dominated by the Kuki tribe. I talked to people as well as a few members of the Kuki underground insurgent group. I then realised that the whole controversy regarding the Smart City was basically a turf war between two insurgent groups  Kuki Insurgent Group and Valley Insurgent Group. The Kukis were not allowing any government official to come or any development to happen in that area. It was all about area domination. They (Kukis) felt that if they allowed a project backed by the Manipur government in Imphal to come there, then the people from Imphal would take over the area.

Besides, our sources in banks had been complaining that companies were not being able to service their debts because of interest payouts etc. We put two and two together and figured that there was a crisis on the corporate as well as on the banking side. We realised that there was almost Rs 12 lakh crore in bad debt, almost one-fifth of the Rs 60 lakh crore in loan amount that banks had given to companies. A lot of things happened after our story  the 5:25 rule that was put out, the RBI getting after companies to sort out their balance sheets and so on.(BROADCAST)Archana Shukla (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Archana Shukla (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Archana Shukla, CNBC TV18: For her series, Whats Ailing Rural India, which reflected on the gap between government projects and their delivery. I think we often forget to discuss the rural economy, which contributes to the GDP of the country in a big way. Through the series, we wanted to study the consumption patterns and understand the reasons for rural spending not picking up, which again is linked to the entire agrarian crisis. For the report, we covered the agrarian crisis in Marathwada and the drought in Bundelkhand. In two villages of Banda district of Bundelkhand, which we had reported about, the district administration distributed 50 kg of rice to every family, put up two hand pumps in the village and even started MGNREGA work.Reporting on Politics and Government(PRINT)Ashutosh Bhardwaj, The Indian Express: For his report on the leaked Chhattisgarh tapes that suggested financial foulplay before a bypoll. There was talk about unfair dealings in the Antagarh bypolls. I chased the clues for over a year until I stumbled upon these audio tapes. Antagarh is a reserved constituency for tribals in Maoist-hit Bastar. The involvement of both the national political parties, the BJP and Congress, in these dealings underline their failure to address tribal unrest. The story was scattered across several players and dates, so it was difficult to thread them together.(BROADCAST)Halimabi Abdul Kureshi, IBN Lokmat: For capturing the impact of the beef ban on society and industry in Maharashtra. I belong to the Qureshi community. I have seen people who work as butchers as it is their traditional occupation. They had little education but were happy as long as they had money coming their way. When the Maharashtra government passed the Maharashtra Animal Preservation (Amendment) Act, even bullocks were brought under it. Most of the people in the meat industry, 80 per cent of them people who follow their traditional occupation, were the worst sufferers. People removed children from school. When vehicles carrying animals would be caught, there was sadness and grief. The community believed it could not raise its voice as there were no politicians etc from the community who would take their side. Then, a Qureshi boy committed suicide. After all this, people contacted me as nobody was ready to be their voice. No media house was covering this side of the story. When I was visiting the cattle market, I met a Christian who said there are people who have been eating beef for generations and the ban was a human rights violation. Due to the ban, the leather industry went down, there were families who couldnt get their girls married. My father, who was the inspiration for this report, passed away, but I started working on the report on the twelfth day after his death. So this report was something emotional also. I felt the other side of the story had to come out. After all, it is about traditional occupations.Sports Journalism(PRINT)Devendra Pandey (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Devendra Pandey (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Devendra Pandey, The Indian Express: For his report on irregularities in the IPL. It was during a casual chat with someone that I first heard about a breach of the code of conduct by franchises of the Indian Premier League. IPL is so glamorous that most people dont know whats happening behind the scenes in this shortest and most attractive form of cricket. It was difficult to verify and get confirmation of small details, but I somehow managed to get copies of confidential documents that showed certain irregularities.(BROADCAST)Sanjeeb Mukherjea (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sanjeeb Mukherjea (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sanjeeb Mukherjea, CNN-IBN: For uncovering IPL spot-fixing tapes involving Rajasthan Royals players. When I joined sports journalism, I never thought I would be covering what is happening outside the stadium rather than the match inside. From 2009-2010, there were a lot of things happening around IPL. In 2013, when the scandal happened, there were a few administrators who were in a hurry to get away from where they were and I got information from my sources in the Mumbai Police and Delhi Police. This is what has changed about sports journalism, that you now have to also deal with the police and the judicial and legal aspects. When I came upon the tapes, I was startled because what had come out in reports until then was not even bits or pieces. It took eight to 10 months to listen to all the tapes, work with the transcripts, and match them with the voice samples and edit. This story was basically about investigating what was wrong with cricket, the most famous sport in India.On-the-spot Reporting(PRINT)Nayantara Narayanan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Nayantara Narayanan (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Nayantara Narayanan, Scroll.in: For her reports on the Chennai floods and the aftermath. The floods took Chennai out but we also found that places outside the city had been very badly affected. So I spoke to my editor and we all got the sense that we should really be looking beyond Chennai, which took me to places such as Kanchipuram and Cuddalore that had been flooded for a month, but from where very little news was coming out.One of the stories was on a village in Cuddalore, a Dalit settlement, ignored in whatever relief work was going on. An NGO had alerted us about this village. Within days of the story being published, I got a call from the NGO saying that individuals had come in with relief material and when she asked them how they had heard about the village, they showed the story we had published.(BROADCAST)Aamir Rafiq Peerzada (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Aamir Rafiq Peerzada (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Aamir Rafiq Peerzada & Rakesh Solanky, NDTV: For extensive reports on the damage caused at the Everest base camp, due to avalanches triggered by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. I remember being trapped for close to two days due to a heavy avalanche. At the time, at least 16 people were dead and many were injured. All our equipment was destroyed and we had been wearing the same clothes for days. We put together the reports through phone calls to the office, says Peerzada. Solanky, the videojournalist on the assignment, says, I had gone to the Everest base camp to film the expedition to the worlds highest peak. However, the earthquake triggered an avalanche, which nearly wiped out the camp, killing 22 people. I kept my camera running throughout the incident, despite getting buried under the snow on several occasions. It is what we do.Investigative Reporting(PRINT)Sandeep Pai & Manisha Pande (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sandeep Pai & Manisha Pande (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sandeep Pai & Manisha Pande, Newslaundry.com: For their RTI investigation on how politicians exploit PSUs. The story was about an RTI investigation into how politicians had been writing to PSUs, seeking favours such as funds for their organisations, for NGOs etc. They usually had their own interests behind such requests. So it was essentially a misuse of public money, says Pai. From the replies for the RTIs Sandeep filed, we started picking out names in which there was a direct conflict of interest. After the story, some PSUs issued internal circulars, saying we dont need to unnecessarily release funds and that we can take a call on this, says Pande.(BROADCAST)Ganesh Suratchand Thakur, ABP News: For investigating the alleged abduction and detention of girls by the Sanatan Sanstha. The investigation, Operation Sammohan, was based on the allegations of five families. We conducted detailed interviews with them and also visited several Sanatan Sanstha offices to get to the bottom of the truth.Feature WritingShamik Bag (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Shamik Bag (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Shamik Bag, Mint: For his story on the life and death of Malli Mastan Babu. Malli wasnt a difficult choice: a man from a humble, nomadic, tribal background, a first generation literate who went on to study at IIT-Kharagpur and IIM-Calcutta, and one who gave up a corporate career for the mountains. I first got to know about Malli from a small report in The Telegraph some years ago. In 2015, his name returned tragically to the papers. After going missing for days at a 22,000-feet Andes peak, Malli returned to his Nellore village in Andhra Pradesh in a coffin. Strapping young, gone at 40. I picked up his trail, travelling back to his childhood village in Nellore, standing at the foot of the small hill that first dented the boy Mallis imagination. I then travelled to Tirupati, Visakhapatnam and finally to Sikkims Yuksom, the base camp of his dream. From that small hill in Andhra Pradesh, Malli went on to climb the seven highest summits in each continent, a pioneering Indian feat.Sreedevi T V (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Sreedevi T V (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Sreedevi T V, Malayala Manorama: For her profile of a 94-year-old nature conservationist. During one of our evening meetings, our co-ordinating editor asked me to meet a woman who had dug a pond all by herself at Haripad in Alappuzha district. Thats how I met Bhavani Amma at her house where she lived with her son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Before I started, I asked her how old she was and she said 94. I was dumbstruck. As she spoke about the well she had dug, the trees she had planted and the saplings waiting to be planted, I realised Bhavani Amma was a true Gandhian. Now that I have won this coveted award, I believe its she who is being honoured.Foreign Correspondent Covering IndiaVictor Mallet, Financial Times: For his ground report on pollution in the Ganga. Im delighted the win this award for two reasons. First, it was for a story about the Ganga and the importance of saving the river from pollution and over-extraction of water. When I was doing my research, I was disappointed to find how little has been achieved in the past three years, even though Narendra Modi had made it a priority when he stood in Varanasi and won the general election in 2014. Second, I found The Indian Express to be by far the best of Indias English-language newspapers during my four years based in Delhi covering South Asia.Commentary and Interpretative WritingAnna M M Vetticad, BLink: For her piece on the stereotypical portrayal of women professionals in TV and films. The July 2015 instalment of Film Fatale, my column in The Business Lines BLink, under the headline, The Rape of Avanthika, was about the misogyny and romanticised sexual violence in the Telugu blockbuster Bahubali. Despite furious fan responses, it was gratifying to see the piece play a part in at least marginally steering discussions away from the movie marketing hype and towards its illiberal content. This is the goal of Film Fatale, which was conceived as a commentary on the intersection of cinema, politics and society. In 2015, the column also covered the ageism actresses face worldwide, the representation of marginalised communities in Indian cinema and other concerns. This award for the collection of Film Fatales I wrote last year is a validation of my conviction that all cinema is political and even seemingly mindless.Pramit Bhattacharya (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Pramit Bhattacharya (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Pramit Bhattacharya, Mint: For story that exposed how micro-finance may not always be as inclusive as is perceived. I started the Economics Express column a little over two years ago in an attempt to look at issues of everyday life, as well as public policy. The idea was to use the lens of economics and borrow insights from the world of academic research to help shed light on some of these issues. From cows to riots to marriage to micro-finance to climate change, the column has attempted to examine each issue fairly and rigorously by considering the relevant published research on each topic. The Economics Express column written in June 2015  after the micro-finance industry saw a sharp recovery in fiscal 2015  tried to bust the myth that micro-finance was a powerful antidote to poverty.Another column, written earlier that year, explained how economic considerations, rather than religious ones, influenced peoples decision to purchase cows in India, and featured both contemporary and historical debates on the role of religion and economics in influencing such investments.Prakash Kardaley Memorial Award for Civic Journalism(PRINT)Christin Mathew Philip (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Christin Mathew Philip (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Christin Mathew Philip, The Times of India: For his reports on the use of substandard construction material in building roads in Chennai. I have been reporting on the conditions of roads for the past five years. Following this story, however, the Madras High Court took suo motu cognizance, and quality checks were conducted on the roads which I reported about. Some of the roads were reconstructed. It is nice to see regional stories being rewarded.Photo JournalismBurhaan Kinu (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal) Burhaan Kinu (Source: Express Photo by Abhinav Saha and Tashi Tobgyal)Burhaan Kinu, The Hindustan Times: It was September 29, 2015. At around 10.30 that Tuesday morning, my phone was filled with messages about the lynching of a man in Bisada village in Dadri, UP, on suspicion that he had stored beef in his refrigerator. When I reached Akhlaqs house, I could see the zblood-stained wall and a broken sewing machine. The refrigerator had also been broken. His relatives were preparing his body for burial, I could hear the family wailing. It was difficult to stand there with my camera, but as a journalist, I knew I had to present an unbiased report so I continued to document the grief, loss and pain."

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Gurwinder Singhs home in Roranwala. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)Lush green paddy fields as far as the eye can see, the sound of water gushing from a tubewell, fields lined with tall poplars and eucalyptus. Notwithstanding the razor wire strung on a fence in the near distance, the view from the top of Gurwinder Singhs double-storey house in this village  700 metres from Zero Line, the International Boundary between India and Pakistan  could have been one of unmatched rural idyll, had it been another day or another place.But a day after the Punjab government, acting on the Union Home Ministrys advice, ordered evacuation of all villages in a 10 km radius of the border, even the prettiest sight takes ominous hues.Most of the 450 people in the village left in panic. But as the sun dawned on Friday, many returned, worried about their crop, homes, animals, and confused about whether there was a real threat from across the border.Most people left last evening after the warning. I came back this morning to feed my animals and water the fields. In ten days, my paddy will be ripen and it will be time to harvest it, but everything is up in the air now, said Gurwinder.The BSF did not open the black gate on the razor wire fence this morning to allow farmers to access their fields between the fence and Zero Line. Of the nine acres owned by Gurwinders family, six lie beyond the fence. There is no fence separating his land from that of Pakistani farmers on the other side.If we cant harvest it, it will all go waste, said Gurwinder. On his mind is a Rs 6 lakh loan from the arthiya or commission agent at the mandi, that he took three years ago to add a floor and more rooms to his house, and for his marriage. He repays by pledging the crop to the arthiya.Maybe the government will pay some compensation, he said, recalling that during the Kargil war, there was a similar evacuation, but the Army laid mines in the area and villagers could not return to the fields for over a year.On Thursday, in the midst of the evacuation, Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal asked farmers not to panic, and not to harvest before the crop had ripened.But with uncertainty looming, many men in Roranwala returned in the morning, after leaving their wives and children in Amritsar with relatives.Gurwinder, his wife, one-year-old-daughter, parents and brother had left after packing a few clothes on Thursday night. They travelled by car to Chheharta in Amritsar to stay with his fathers aunt.Gurwinder was one of the few men who returned to the village with his entire family, but like other men in the village, he said he was taking no chances and returning to Chheharta in the evening.If something really happens, the enemy wont spare women and children. But maybe in five or six days, our government and Pakistan will sort things out, he said.This village is famous for Basmati 1121 and Parmal (two rice varieties). The Parmal has ripened, but we can cut it only if there is peace and calm, said Sukhdev Singh, another villager. Some people have to cut in five days, some in ten.Sukhdev said the announcement for evacuation was made from the village gurdwara at around 2 pm. The Block Development Officer called the sarpanch at noon and told him the details. The sarpanch made the announcement, Sukhdev said, recalling that though the village has seen India-Pakistan wars in the past, this was the first time there was an announcement asking people to leave.With the gates to the fields closed and no work to do, men who had returned sat in the village square next to the gurdwara. Veley baithein hain (We are sitting jobless), said one of them.Raghubir Singh, 87, said he was among the few who had not left the village. Its our village, all our possessions are here  our crops, our animals. Cant leave it all and go away. I can tell you there will be no trouble, he said.He pointed to the trade that was continuing at the Attari Integrated Check Post, 2 km from the village. Pakistani buses are coming and going. And our soldiers are also not moving to the border. These are signs to watch out for if trouble is coming, he said.On instructions from the top leadership of the ruling Akali Dal, ministers and MLAs visited border villages all morning, reassuring people that everything would be taken care of.Government is ready to address every problem, said Animal Husbandry Minister Gulzar Singh Ranike, whose constituency, Attari, is particularly affected. Compensation will be paid if the crop cannot be harvested. Centre will pay.His son Lali Ranike, who was accompanying him on the rounds, said earlier governments used to wait for the first bomb or shell to fall, and then ask to people to leave. We have taken advance measures.Assembly elections are due in Punjab early next year. A government official on evacuation duty said this was the opportunity for the Akali Dal to reconnect with people and mobilise supporters.This kind of work is not possible by officials alone. The political worker on the ground is of crucial importance, and the Akalis are going all out, he said.Ranike said that for villagers reluctant to leave, the government was organising all help. We have asked them to form committees of six or seven people. If anyone has a complaint, they should go to the committee, and the committee will inform me, the minister said.In Roranwala, the evacuation had an unexpected fallout, and it is unlikely that any minister can do anything about itGurwinders cousin had received a marriage proposal, and just the day before the evacuation, his prospective in-laws had come to see him. The two families had exchanged photographs of the prospective bride and groom.Yesterday, they called to say they were not interested, said Gurwinder. They probably decided after watching the news.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

People of the area have faith in me, says the Congress candidate from the area .The only way I will lose some votes is if people presume that I still belong to the earlier Trinamool-Congress coalition, Mahato, who had won the 2011 elections as a candidate of the TMC-Congress alliance, added.This year, Mahato is a candidate of the Congress-CPM alliance. Our earlier alliance with CPM was not an intimate one. It was a very weak alliance. This alliance with CPM is a much stronger one, says Mahato.Asked whether voters will feel betrayed by his change in position, he said, It is not as if they are unaware of the misdeeds of Trinamool leaders. There is television everywhere now, and they all have read about the corruption in the party, says Mahato.Even the rehabilitated Maoists will vote for us. They dont side with TMC. The government has done nothing for them, only given jobs to some leaders, but virtually nothing for the foot soldiers, he added.Mahatos election campaign focussed on debunking myths about Mamata Banerjees Rs 2-a-kilo rice scheme. People need to know that this is a central government scheme. She keeps shouting about it, but people are not stupid. The tribals here have connections with neighbouring villages in Jharkhand, where the government gives rice at Rs 1 a kilo, he said.If elected, Mahato said he would work on providing proper drinking water and a scientific way of irrigation for farmers in the area."

(Express Photo) Former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during a CPM rally in Barrackpore on Thursday. (Express Photo)Pitching once again for an alliance with Congress in the coming Assembly elections in West Bengal, senior CPM leader and former chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on Thursday said people want such a tie-up to oust the ruling Trinamool Congress.Everyone is talking about a tie-up. You need to understand why people are talking about the alliance. The priority at the moment is to get rid of the TMC from here and thus, individuals and political parties should come together for that, said Bhattacharjee while addressing a party rally in Barrackpore in North-24 Parganas district.There can be differences in political ideologies but that should take a backseat at the moment. There is a single-point agenda, which is to defeat TMC, he added.This is the second time that the former chief minister has openly spoken in favour of an alliance. The first time was in January in a rally in Singur.Senior CPM leader Gautam Deb, too, asserted that an alliance with the Congress was imminent. We will go to Delhi and a decision would be taken there. The Trinamool has to be taught a lesson, Deb said.Lashing out at the Mamata Banerjee-led government, Bhattacharjee said the TMC had driven out existing industries from the state and prevented new ones to come. Two software giants  Infosys and Wipro  had tried to set up their units here, providing employment to at least 10,000 persons. It didnt happen because of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. When she was the rail minister, she had announced big ambitious projects at Sankrail, Dankuni and Kanchrapara. Foundation stones for all those projects were laid but none of those took off, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging that the state has gone backwards in terms of industrialisation in the last four-and-a-half years, the former CM said, We wanted to bring in heavy industries such as steel, automobiles and petrochemicals, but Mamata says industries of puffed rice and fritters should be set up here. The state is going backwards.He said the TMC government has destroyed the health care, education system in Bengal. Where are the super-speciality hospitals that she claims that the present government has put up? No new colleges and universities have come up. All she is doing is painting the flyovers and structures put up by us, into blue and white, Bhattacharjee said.Alleging indifference of the state government towards the plight of closed tea garden workers in North Bengal, the Politburo member said, Currently, we are witnessing that tea gardens are being shut one after the other leading to starvation deaths almost every day.

(Express photo/ Partha Paul).BJP leader Roopa Ganguly on Monday lauded Trinamool Congress governments initiatives such as Kanyasree and Sabuj Saathi.Families have definitely benefitted from Kanyasree projects and through distribution of cycles. If a girl is given a cycle, wont it help her? The money that they get from Kanyashree scheme help them a lot It is definitely a good scheme but it has been propagated with a political agenda. There is nothing wrong with the scheme but there is something wrong in its implementation, she said.Ganguly was speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of a symposium on the Role of Womens Empowerment in Facilitating Inclusive Economic Growth, organised by MCC Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Kolkata.Under Kanyashree scheme, an annual scholarship is provided to poor girls between 13 and 18 years of age to continue their studies. Besides, if an unmarried girl continues her studies up to the age of 18 years, a one-time grant of Rs 25,000 is deposited in her bank account.If we take out politics and political influence from every little thing in the society, we can actually empower people. Today, every aspect of the society has been politicised. We need to first stop this and then only we can empower the people, especially women, she added.However, referring to the state governments decision to probe the Narada sting operation, Ganguly came down heavily on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. It is such a farce that it is of no use commenting on such issues. She (Mamata) is realising that she is trying to fool the people. She has watched the video footages and found another way to fool the people. She is a brilliant politician, she said.On Mamata governments Khadya Sathi initiative, she said: If I am giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to people, I should have the courtesy to tell them that I am getting it at Re 1 per kg and then giving it to you at Rs 2 per kg.Earlier, while speaking at the symposium, Ganguly claimed said she was twice beaten up at Gopalnagar in Kolkata and in Kakdwip in South-24 Parganas by women who she claimed were wrongly empowered. I was twice beaten up by women before the Assembly polls. Those who had beaten us were empowered women but they were wrongly empowered, she said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Archive photo A reliever polling agent at a booth in Salt Lake, Bidhannagar, where elections took place on Monday. Archive photoOfficials engaged with the ongoing assembly election have been carrying out their duties under sweltering heat and with bare minimum facilities amid looming threat from workers of nearly all political parties.Speaking to The Indian Express, several poll officials recounted the circumstances under which they have been working since the polling began last month, with many claiming that the work often puts their lives at risk.The security provided by the central or state police forces exists only during the day. As soon as we deposit the EVMs (electronic voting machines), we are on our own. The government, at most, arranges for a vehicle that drops us to the railway station where we often end up spending the night since no trains are available at such late hours, said Swapan Kumar Biswas, an employee of the customs department who oversaw polling at one of the booths in Entally constituency on April 2.Biswas, like many others, was alluding to threats from workers since our work involves taking several steps against the interest of political parties.I feel the government could provide us with adequate security until we have reached our home safe, he said.Aside from the threats, officials complain about the lack of basic facilities such as fans and tube lights and clean washrooms.The washrooms at most of the places where we are posted are in such bad condition that we avoid eating food altogether. I didnt eat for two days and lived only on puffed rice and some biscuits, said Partha Sarathi Das, an employee of National Sample Survey Office who was the micro observer at Sandeshkhali in North-24 Parganas where polling took place on April 25.Govinda Purkait, the presiding officer at a booth inside Gypsy Mission School in South Kolkata for the polling on April 21, said the booth did not even have a fan when he took charge there. The temperature outside was crossing 40 degrees. When I reported it, a huge pedestal fan was brought in but it had no regulator. It kept lying in one corner of the room for the entire time I was there, he said.Manir Hossain, a teacher with a government school, said he had arrived at the booth in Rajarhat on April 24 and had to spend the night there but couldnt sleep because of the mosquitoes.Another micro observer, posted at Khandaghosh in Burdwan district, said on the condition of anonymity that there was only a 60 Watt bulb inside the polling station with no basic facilities. We were afraid even to ask people for food and water as that could be considered as taking favours from political parties, he said. The observer also said workers of some political parties had alluded to rigging the polls. If we intervene, we put our lives at risk; if we dont, we are showcaused by the Election Commission, he added.The Election Commission, which has come under the attack from several quarters over the violence during the polling, offers little help to the officials in charge of overseeing the polling. It is not possible for us to provide round the clock security to all of them, said Dibyendu Sarkar, additional Chief Electoral Officer.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"

Now, he says, that period has been extended by another three weeks.Where will we go for the next three weeks? Not everyone has a relative here and some are staying at hotels. How long can they pay for the hotel? asks Sharma as he narrates the visit by Deputy Commissioner (central Kolkata) Akhilesh Chaturvedi who has instructed the residents not to come back for the extended period. But Sharma has come back, although without his wife and son.I havent called them back yet because we are not sure how safe it is. We were hoping we would move back in this week as we could barely take any of our belongings with us, said Sharma, who is also worried about his son missing his classes.Gayatri Devi (66) and Shiv Kumar Nagmayal (72) didnt have to worry about coming back. They never left. The only family of the 12 living in the building for over half a century.Where will we go? I am old and this place is all I have. If this building goes down, I will go down with it, says Gayatri. From their flat on the second floor, the point where the flyover snapped like a twig that Thursday afternoon, stares back. Some say that a portion will fall on our building. But I feel that nothing of the sort will happen again, said the husband.Lives of their neighbours, residents of building number 2, hasnt improved either. Women and children have gone back to their parents. We have been guarding the building ourselves as the gatekeepers have run away. And we only have puffed rice and tea for dinner, says Nauratan Sharma, 40, one of the residents.Families here havent left their place, and its not difficult to figure out why. The deputy commissioner said we will get alternative arrangements but it sounds vague. How can we expect him to know anyway, he is the police commissioner, not a minister. And from the government, no one has told us anything about any alternative arrangement, he said.When contacted by The Indian Express, DC Chaturvedi said he is not in a position to say when the families could return. My responsibility is to protect the residents of the area, warn them. The engineers will determine how long the whole process will take, he said.Officials of Kolkata Municipal Development Authority and the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (the latter has been assigned the task of removing the collapsed spans) had inspected the site Wednesday. But among their jobs now is also to deal with the determined residents who are not ready to leave. We need to vacate the houses on both sides of the road in order to avoid any eventuality, said an RVNL engineer on condition of anonymity.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

I am thankful to the farmers of Bengal for contributing to the stock of grains required for Khadya Sathi, Mamata said after launching the scheme from Red Road.As much as 15 lakh metric tonnes of rice have already been procured, which is more than our target of 10 lakh metric tonnes. The Krishak Mandis have been instrumental in the procurement process. Out of 176 Krishak Mandis, 120-130 are already up and running. We have been providing help to the people of Singur who lost their land, the CM asserted.The much publicised Khadya Sathi scheme, which aims to ensure that 70 lakh people in the state get subsidised food and cereals at half the market price while over 7 crore people would receive 5 kg of food grain every month at Rs 2 per kg, will prove vital in the upcoming elections, TMC leaders believe.The scheme, according to government officials, targets the poor and very poor, many of whom who arent covered under the National Food Security Act.The CM took took the opportunity to attack the CPM, which, she said, has been claiming about no development in the state. They cannot see. I will ask them to open their eyes. I think either they do not want to see the progress or they are sleeping, Mamata said.I talk less and work more. I keep myself busy with work.. Do not make me open my mouth..I will give a fitting reply at the right time, she added.She also accused the central government of reducing allotments for important social programmes like integrated child development services. The Centre can stop them but we cannot stop the benefits being extended to the people of our state. It is our responsibility towards the people, we cannot step back on that promise and commitment.Mamata was quick to point out that the seven crore people who would benefit from the scheme included those communities that the opposition claims have been found wanting  those living in the Jangalmahal region, malnourished tea garden workers and their families, people of Singur who lost their land to acquisition and other homeless in the state.They have been suffering for a long time We have announced a Rs 100 crore package for them. Family of a worker of a closed garden will get Rs 1,500 and rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg, she said. The farmers of Singur would continue to get a monthly allowance from the state government till the court takes a call on the return of their land, the CM said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

People  holding aluminum buckets and pots or anything that can store water  anxiously wait for their turn at the tubewell that would soon begin to draw water in the form of mud.If you are late, all you get is muddy water, said Sukumar Mahto, speaking about the only tubewell in this part of Purulia, which, the 29-year-old pointed out, is a dry area. This lone tubewell supports not just Kororia but neighbouring villages, too.We are used to harsh summers, but this year has been particularly bad. Children have acquired allergies and illnesses because there is no water. There are no vegetables either, only potatoes, and thats what we have been sustaining on, Mahto said.The ponds around the village began drying up two months ago. Most of them now sit mudcaked, a reminder that they used to be a water body a while ago. A few still have some water left but their levels have fallen drastically. It is these that men, women, children and cattle use for all things necessary  bathing, washing, cooking, and drinking.Similar to Birbhum, but unlike other districts in West Bengal, Purulia is largely a monocrop region, planting and harvesting paddy.Before this long stretch of rainless dry heat set in, Purulia had received a good spell of rainfall in August last year, prompting farmers to try their luck at a second crop  many planted vegetables. But these failed.Purulia, officially, is a semi-drought-hit region. But the situation right now is similar to drought. There is no source of water in the district. The surface water has dried up and the groundwater has reduced at an alarming rate. This started in November last year, so we began giving out crop insurance and extended the Rs 2-per kg rice scheme  meant for the lower income groups  to cover the entire district, District Magistrate Tanmoy Chakraborty said.He added that 1,000 tubewells have been installed where groundwater is still available. Dry wells have been added to low lying areas so they fill up when the groundwater rises.For extra measures, the administration has asked owners of factories and small industries to install taps outside their industrial structures to make drinking water available to the common people.But these industrial owners have their own story to tell.Prashant Jalan (27), who runs a brick kiln with his father, said no work has taken place for the last three months. There is no water to manufacture brick, he said. Work on developmental projects, government sources said, have similarly slowed down because of the scarcity of water.There is literally no water here any more. Factory owners have been asked to install taps outside their buildings so that people could come and drink water from these. We will be installing ours in a couple of days, Jalan said.These taps, however, will receive water only for two hours each in the morning and evening every day.Purulia is a region where the plateau meets the plains so it is a dry area in any case. The people here are accustomed to harsh climate. What we need is a good spell of rain and the monsoons to come, the DM said.The monsoon, unluckily for Purulia and several other parched regions in the country, will be delayed by a week, according to the Met Departments forecast. It will arrive in Kerala some time at the end of the first week in June. Until then, residents of Kororia village and those nearby will have to keep pace with the rising sun.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The TMC candidate, meanwhile, sought to refute allegations that he had to do anything with the attacks on workers of the opposition party.CPM HEAVYWEIGHT Amiya Patra Thursday accused the Mamata Banerjee government of claiming credits for the welfare projects, which he claimed were either undertaken by the previous government or are being funded by the current dispensation at the Centre.The improved roads and other infrastructural development works had mostly been funded by the previous (UPA) government. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claims she has been giving rice at Rs 2 per kg to the populace but never tells people that the Centre provides a subsidy of Rs 27 for each kg of that rice. She claims that Jangalmahal is peaceful with jobs available for everyone but nearly 30 per cent of the population has moved out to places like Burdwan and Hooghly in search for work, said Patra, the CPMs candidate from Taldangra (Bankura) in the upcoming Assembly elections.A university in Bankura may have come up but it remains non-functional as do the four super specialty hospitals, the leader pointed out. The buildings, painted blue and white, are ready but the university doesnt have a faculty and the hospitals dont have doctors.About the Left Fronts alliance partner, Congress, Patra said the party enjoys little presence in Bankura. Their vote share is only about two per cent here, Patra said. He attributed the lack of his partys presence in the campaign season to TMC-sponsored terror. We could not do wall-writings as our workers were prevented from doing so but the people here have seen what we have done for them all these years and I am confident of winning once again, he said, and claimed that Bankura may be largely water-starved, people in Taldangra at least have several tube wells that provides them with drinking water.The constituency has drawn a lot of attention of the CM too who has campaigned for TMC candidate Samir Chakraborty, the husband of Bidhannagar Municipality chairperson Krishna Chakraborty. During her rally Wednesday, Mamata had blamed the Left Fronts 34-year rule for the scarcity of drinking water in the district and claimed her government will ensure development in the area.The TMC candidate, meanwhile, sought to refute allegations that he had to do anything with the attacks on workers of the opposition party.They have even gone to the Election Commission to complain that I had prevented their workers from campaigning. The fact is they dont have anyone to campaign for them. I had offered to volunteer if they wanted me to, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Subham Dutta Abdul Mannan (left) with Sujan Chakraborty outside the Assembly on Friday. Subham DuttaA DAY after BJP national general secretary and Bengal party in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya said his party could offer issue-based support to other Opposition parties, the Congress-Left alliance rejected the proposal on Friday, alleging that the saffron party had a tacit understanding with the ruling Trinamool Congress.Addressing a joint press conference outside the state Assembly with CPM MLA Sujan Chakraborty, Congress legislator Abdul Mannan said: While their national leaders are coming to Bengal and praising the Trinamool government, state BJP leaders are trying to save their skin by saying such things. They should condemn the central BJP leaders actions and ask the Centre to step up investigations into the Saradha multi-crore scam.When we had urged all parties to unite against the Saradha scam, all parties had responded, except Trinamool and BJP. How can we rely on them? Mannan asked.Vijayvargiyas statement had come days after a similar view was expressed by state unit chief Dilip Ghosh. Tacit understanding and opposition cannot go hand in hand. We all know about the tacit understanding between BJP and Trinamool. So these talks of opposing Trinamool in the Assembly is nothing but a farce to fool the masses, Chakraborty said.Speaking about Chief Minister Mamata Banerjees first first administrative meeting on Friday, Mannan said: We were expecting that the chief minister would spare some words for the victims of post poll violence. At least, she would send out a stern message against the prevailing violence but she did not. She had said a lot in the Assembly yesterday but not today.While she spoke about people getting rice at Rs 2 per kg, thanks to the central government subsidy, she kept quiet about the escalating price of potatoes, which has reached Rs 26 per kg, he added.Claiming that the chief minister did not say anything against the Centre as she did not want to offend her friends in Delhi, Chakraborty said: What is of utmost priority at the moment is maintaining peace and arresting the escalating price of essential commodities. She did not say anything about any of these.Mannan said the two parties were ready to reach out to victims of poll violence. By June 16, they intend to visit at least six places that have seen such violence. Didibhai (Mamata Banerjee) and Modi bhais (Narendra Modi) understanding is clear, given the fact that Mamata did not say anything about the central government not passing on the benefit of lowered crude oil price to the people. We demand a tax rebate on prices of petrol and diesel, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Under the scheme, 7 crore out of the total population of 9 core in the state would get rice at Rs 2 a kg and other subsidised food rations. The old ration cards are now being replaced with digital ones and this has caused some problems, said government officials. The CM described the hitches as teething trouble.

Rs 152 crore has been set aside for the food processing and horticulture department, Rs 495 crore for the animal resources development department. Rs 250 crore for the fisheries department, Rs 2,277 crore for the irrigation and waterways, and a whopping Rs 10,653 crore for the panchayat and rural development department. This takes the total budgetary allocation for the rural Bengal to Rs 15,841 crore  the maximum for the Trinamool Congress government since its first came to power in 2011.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn his Budget speech, Mitra had said that in the agriculture and agri-allied sector, a seven-fold increase has been recorded from 2010-11 to 2015-16, with the earnings recording Rs 21,224.61 crore last year.According to the state figures, in agriculture and allied activities, the state claims to have achieved record agricultural production of 174 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of produce in 2015-16. Procurement of food grains has increased and warehousing facilities enhanced from 62,000 MT in 2010-2011 to 5.62 lakh MT in 2015-16  a nine-fold increase. In 2015, 30 lakh flood-affected farmers were provided assistance of Rs 1,025 crore in three months, the minister had said Friday.More than 10,000 kms of rural roads and 10,663 kms of highways were upgraded and constructed.

Of these, 116 suicides took place in Bardhaman alone.Activists allege that like the Left Front government before it, the TMC government too has refused to accept the states agrarian crisis. The worst affected, they say, have been the rice and potato farmers.Neither government made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give subsidy to farmers for crop cutting, which was cancelled by the Mamata Banerjee government. The production cost of crops has increased with the increase in prices of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, electricity. There is no water available for the crops either. We hope the outlay announced by the state government (in the Budget) should alleviate the situation to some extent.

CM Mamata Banerjee with Taldangra assembly constituency TMC candidate Samir Chakraborty Actor turned politician MP Moon Moon Sen during election campaign at Taldangra, Bankura district, West Bengal on March 30, 2016. Express photo by Partha Paul.Launching another scathing attack on the Opposition, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday claimed that the Trinamool Congress would return to power again, and unlike 2011, she would no longer be polite after the Assembly election results are declared.Reiterating her claim that the CPM had unleashed a reign of terror against opposition during its 34-year rule in the state, Mamata alleged that even now they are continuing with such practice. Nine TMC workers have been killed in the state since elections were declared. Election will be over after a month. We will remain here after that. We will not spare any of them (Opposition parties). We had shown enough manners after we won the last Assembly elections. Not anymore, Mamata said while addressing a public meeting at Taldangra area in Bankura district.Referring to the recent sting operation carried out by the news portal Narada News, which purportedly showed several senior TMC leader accepting bribe from a fictitious company, the Trinamool chief said, The CPM leaders have built property worth thousands of crores and now they are calling the TMC thieves, a party which is comparatively younger. Once we are back (in power), we will ask for the accounts of their properties and they will have to answer us.Mamata also claimed that the TMC was no longer a young sapling which would need protection but a mighty tree which stood on its own strength.Taking a dig at the electoral understanding between the Congress and CPM, the CM said those parties which needed support to survive are creepers. CPM has proved that it has no principle after it joined hands with Congress. Both the shameless parties have come together, she said.Canvassing support for her party candidate Sameer Chakraborty in Taldangra, a seat which has been won by CPM for the last 39 years, the Trinamool chief said the Opposition party had not done anything for the people there.Talking about the lack of infrastructure and civic amenities here, Mamata said,The CPM had only converted this place into a breeding place for terror. In the last four years of the TMC government, I have worked for Bankura by setting up the Bankura University, provided four super-speciality hospitals, and started an ambitious water supply project worth Rs 1,100 crore that would benefit around 34 lakh people when completed in two phases.A Rs 1,200-crore water supply project has also been taken up in neighbouring Purulia district, she added.She also alleged that some of the officials of the coordination committees who supported the CPM had tried to sabotage the project under which the state government provided rice and wheat for Rs 2 a kg.Attacking the Centre, Mamata said the BJP government was a dalal (agent) for CPM and Congress. The BJP should rather watch out in Delhi where its government might not stay for another term, rather than trying to form a government in Bengal.Meanwhile, in another rally in Kharagpur, Mamata rooted for Trinamool Congress candidate Ramprasad Tiwari and said the pending development works in the constituency will be a priority work for the government if her party comes to power.I have known Gyan Singh Sohan Pal for long and have great respect for him. Still, I think much needs to be done for Kharagpurs development and Trinamool Congress will do that if it gets the opportunity, the CM said. Gyan Singh, fondly called chacha by his admirers, is the Congress-Left Front alliance candidate from IIT and Railway town Kharagpur, from where he has won consecutive times. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh is also contesting from the seat.CPM has been the arch rivals of Congress for over three decades and many Congress workers were murdered during the Left Front regime. Yet, their lust for power is such that they have now formed a poll alliance. People will defeat them and give them a befitting reply, she said."

A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about.IT WAS 2 pm and Subhasis Roy, 42, had not taken a break since the morning. The Trinamool Congress worker from Alimuddin Street, where the CPM headquarters is housed, doubles as the graffiti painter for the local party office. We have to finish this work before evening, said Roy, a former student of Government College of Art and Craft.The work was a piece of graffiti depicting what he called the unholy marriage of CPM and the Congress in West Bengal. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and CPM leader Surjya Kanta Mishra seem to be stuck in a tussle. The Congress leader asks the CPM leader to not run away, the CPM leader seems to be muttering a halfhearted word of assurance. The hand and the sickle too seem precariously poised against each other.The graffiti is one of many in a battle being waged on the walls of Bengal.In a state where ugly vinyl hoardings of candidates in filmstar-like poses had taken over most walls and public buildings, graffiti reflecting creativity and wit are making a comeback. Even in the 2011 assembly elections, the few graffiti on display ranged between the prosaic and the very prosaic. Hammer and sickle peered out cautiously between twin flowers, and somewhere on the side a name would be squeezed. There was little of wit or aesthetics.There has been a systematic decline of humour in public life in West Bengal. So, when I see graffiti that are acerbic and funny, I feel hopeful, said veteran cartoonist Chandi Lahiri. During the era of Bidhan Chandra Roy and Siddhartha Shankar Ray, we had the creative freedom to lampoon leaders of the ruling party. Most of my cartoons were used by opposition leaders for graffiti. But during Left rule, we were forced to exercise caution. This year, the satire seems better, more complex.A wall on East Behala constituency depicts the complexity Lahiri is talking about. A bus with route no 420 on it is depicted on a city road. Signage beside it says the bus goes to Narada and Saradha via Kalighat, where Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee lives. At a corner of the graffiti, bold letters say the Trinamool is so corrupt that no one will buy it even on OLX.This used to be the kind of graffiti that would adorn the walls of Bengal in the 1960s and 1970s. Lahiri gives the example of his favourite creation, a 1960 graffiti in Kolkata that showed a donkey refusing to eat rice offered by then state minister of food Prafulla Chandra Sen. The rice that we got in the market was of pitiful quality. It used to be full of kankar, or grit. We used to call that variety of rice kankarbati, he said.But during CPM rule, Lahiri had to think twice before designing any graffiti that then chief minister Jyoti Basu could deem offensive. Since I was a cartoonist with a leading Bengali newspaper, I was issued a press card. I used to visit the Assembly during sessions to observe the visage of leaders. However, after an anti-CPM graffiti of mine became particularly popular, the state refused to renew my press card, he said..Political graffiti are supposed to depict hard reality in a lighthearted manner, feels graphic novelist Sarnath Banerjee. Political graffiti is an example of true satire, he said. In Kolkata, we saw some really acerbic examples of them Historically, graffiti has always been a guerrilla art form. People from the fringes of society would express their dissent and mock mainstream society on walls.The themes of the graffiti of Trinamool and the opposition CPM and Congress also depict their campaigning tactics. While most CPM and Congress graffiti attack Mamata Banerjee on the Narada sting operation, the Sarada controversy and womens safety in the state, the Trinamools graffiti mock the alliance of CPM and Congress, once such bitter rivals in the state.In East Behala, a wall shows a harassed woman surrounded by names of places where rape cases were reported in the past few years  Park Street, Kamduni, Madhyamgram. One in Howrah depicts the Vivekananda flyover collapse.The slogan in Bengali reads, Trinamool has taken bribes, the flyover has come crashing down."

Subham DuttaIt was a mammoth show both of vindication and strength  of Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee.By mid day, the main highway leading to the venue in Singur, where Mamata was to hand over parchas (revenue documents) and cheques, was chock-a-block with farmers, who had to lost their land, and their families. They had walked kilometres under the glaring sun to meet their hero.Some canny entrepreneurs had set up food stalls by roadside. The road had been in places cordoned off with makeshift bamboo barricades. A large stage had been set up for the dignitaries and their entourage and tribal dancers performed to keep the large crowd from getting restless. Trinamool supporters and villagers beat drums and smeared each with other with green abir.Mamatas full cabinet was in attendance. As were her MPs  all lending support to the partys massive show of strength. Senior bureaucrats and top police officials were also present. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar too showed up alongwith some other poet-activists. But the front row of the stage was booked for some special guests of honour, Seated on either side of the CM were the men and women, farmers and villagers, who had spearheaded the Singur uprising in 2006 at great personal cost.Notable among them, was the mother of 19-year-old Tapasi Malik. The teen, who was at the forefront of the Singur resistance, was gangraped and burnt alive allegedly by CPM workers. Her father was initially accused of the crime. Her mother, tears rolling down her cheeks, was seated next to Mamata on stage. On the other side of Mamata was 12-year-old Payal and her parents. Payal and her mother were arrested and sent to jail  the girl was two years old at the time. Saraswati Das (82) was also on stage. The elderly lady used to bring puffed rice for protesters during the agitation.I would usually take 1-1.5 kgs of puffed rice. Whatever I could afford. I never really thought I would see this day when we would stand vindicated. I am very happy, said Das.Immediately after the Supreme Court gave its verdict on August 31, Mamata had set the ball rolling to return the land to the farmers in a victory rally. She appointed six of us ministers to take charge and plan the event. We started working on September 2. We have already started cutting down the wild growth that has taken over the fields and clearing the land, said Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim.Mamata kicked of the function with the distribution, not of the deeds, but of little sack pouches filled with Singur dirt. This is your land. This land is more valuable to us than gold, she announced from the stage.Soon the much awaited parchas were handed out. Akul Chandra Das (73) used to own a five-bigha plot in Beraberi village. The retired headmaster of the hamlets only school, Das had spent his earlier years teaching students all the subjects  ranging from mathematics to English. On Wednesday, he was handed over documents, which guarantee the return of his five bighas, and a signed cheque of Rs 2,28,236.I have been waiting for 10 years for this. I never really thought I would get to see this day or that I would remain alive by the time the SC verdict came. I cant express how jubilant I feel, Das told The Indian Express.Ubiquitously called mastermoshai by his students, Das said that even as a teacher he used to cultivate his own land. All five bighas of it. My land was very fertile. It would give crop three times, sometimes four times, a year, he said, adding that he would normally grow seasonal vegetables.With three children, two daughters who have since been married off, and a son who works as an assistant at a jewellery store, the family had fallen on bad times since their land was taken. But I will start farming again. I will do it myself if need be. She (Mamata) has promised that she is going to make the land cultivable again. So there should be no problem, he adds.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

When the countrys per capita income growth rate is 6.1 per cent, our states rate is 12.48 per cent From agriculture to industry to infrastructure, Bengal has made rapid progress. We have set up 70 new police stations, eight coastal police stations, 19 human rights courts, 45 women police stations and 88 fast-track courts, Mamata said, while addressing the Jangalmahal Utsav in West Midnapore district.Accusing the Left Front of plunging Bengal in a state of penury, she said, For 34 years, these people did nothing yet incurred so much debt and ruined three generations of the state, and now they are talking big. What we have done in mere four and half years, many cant match that even in 400 years.The Chief Minister also attacked the Centre for deducting over Rs 1 lakh crore towards servicing debts incurred by the previous Left Front regime. With an eye on upcoming Assembly polls this year, Mamata enumerated the various social security schemes and harped on the all-round development carried out by her government.From new super specialities hospitals to sick newborn care units (SNCUs), from critical care units to mother and child hubs, from fair price medical shops to diagnostics centres, we have made a lot of infrastructural development in the field of health, Mamata said.The CM further claimed that over seven crore people in the state have been brought under food security scheme. Already 7.7 crore people have been brought under the food security scheme. Rice and wheat are being given at Rs 2 per kg, she said.Mamata countered the oppositions campaigns against her by asking them to shut up. If you can fight, then fight. If you can develop, then do it. If you can accept the challenge then do it. But if you cant, then shut up and let us carry ahead with development, the CM said.The five-day Jangalmahal Utsav would focus on tribal music, folk songs from Bengal and also showcase the handicrafts from the south Bengal tribal region. Mamata also distributed prizes for the Jangalmahal Cup in sports like football, kabaddi and archery held in West Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum districts.I love coming to Jangalmahal to see your smiling faces. Talents are in plenty in this region, she said, adding there were over 42,000 participants this year for the Jangalmahal Cup and similar sports events were held in the Sundarbans as well.Mamata, who inaugurated and laid the foundation stones for a bouquet of projects in West Midnapore district, asked all participants to register their names in the employment bank. She allocated funds for the construction of a stadium here and another at Kharagpur.Referring to the steps taken in the tribal areas, she said development of the Kendu leaf collectors and insurance schemes for them have been taken up. The region has immense tourist potentials like Mukutmanipur, Ayodhya Hills and Jhargram Rajbari, the CM said and stressed the need for further development of the entire area to attract tourists.She also expressed hope that the two-day Bengal Global Business Summit, beginning from January 8 in Kolkata, would help develop the region.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

As Africans recede into anger and silence, Ankita Dwivedi Johri walks the faultlines for 24 hours. Photographs: Tashi TobgyalBaljit Singh has contemplated leaving Rajpur Khurd at least on two occasions. Zu Zan Hmos Osycal has considered the idea multiple times in the past one month. But this wasnt the plan the two men started out with. Rajpur Khurd is a crammed urban village in South Delhis Chhatarpur district, an address better known for its opulent farmhouses and grand weddings. In the past five years, close to a thousand men and women from African nations have made it their home. In the events of the past fortnight, the faultlines between them and the Rathi Jats in the village lie in the open.Black African men stand in the alleys of the Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur area of South Delhi during a power outage.

Following the attacks, over 15 African nations raised concerns over safety of their citizens in India. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and MEA officials had to step in to promise better security.Flanked by high walls, Rajpur Khurd faces power-cuts, water shortage and bumpy roads. The chasm between its old residents and new neighbours is the biggest hurdle of them all. There are few meeting points, and open racism and distrust.7 amLouzi, the cook from Chemas kitchen prepares a Nigerian lunch for the day at their residence in Rajpur Khurd village near Chattarpur in South Delhi.

After 10 minutes, a slightly groggy African woman steps out and hands her a big black bag full of trash. Relieved, the garbage collector dumps the bag onto her cart and moves to the next apartment.The term the girl uses is Arabic for Abyssinian, a nationality known as Ethiopian today. The term was used to describe the Africans who came to live in India in the pre-British era, arriving as merchants, fishermen and slaves. After Independence, it simply became a derogatory word, to describe anyone with a dark complexion and a thick mane of braided hair. In Rajpur Khurd, which houses a growing number of Africans, mostly Nigerian men looking for business opportunities, it is a term thrown about often.As the sun grows strong, the narrow lanes of the village, lined with general stores, repair shops and food stalls, leisurely come to life. At this early hour, there are few signs of the new residents among Rajpur Khurds 5,000-odd Jats. Its too early, wait for a few more hours, says a shopkeeper near a branch of Syndicate Bank in the village.Some time passes before Mike Enumah, a 36-year-old Nigerian garment businessman, appears. I buy clothes from markets in India and sell them in my country, says Enumah, who came to India in 2010, to do his Bachelors in Business Administration at the University of Mumbai. He moved to Rajpur Khurd in 2013 to live with his cousin.Today, as he visits the local store to get supplies for the day, Mike seems angry. Why do we suddenly have all these cameras in our faces? These images will be broadcast in my country, what will my family think? he says. I heard the news of the attacks on Africans, but I did not see them. It doesnt affect me, man, he shrugs.Michael Chema from Nigeria lives in the Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur and runs the Chema Kitchen while also claiming to be a businessman and a fashion store owner back home in Nigeria.

Indians own all the big companies in my country, they are treated with respect. But here , he stops mid-sentence. His landlord Ashok Rathi jumps in to finish the line. The ruckus is created by Africans who visit from Malviya Nagar and Dwarka areas. My tenants dont even drink and smoke. Here no panga, no tension, he quips.Ashok Rathi, who owns four buildings in the area, has reasons to be happy with tenants such as Mike. Rajpur Khurd is believed to have been set up by Raj Singh Rathi, a Jat farmer who came to Chhatarpur over 900 years ago. All residents of the village are considered his descendants, hence the surname Rathi on a majority of the nameplates outside houses. We were all farmers, but around 2008, the government started acquiring our land. So many of us built multi-storey houses on our plots to save our land. But no one was willing to rent and the flats remained unoccupied for over two years. That is when we opened our doors to the Africans. They paid more rent, Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 a month, says Ashok Rathi.Mike again insists things are fine. I came to India, leaving behind my wife and children, to make a living. I was told 60-70 per cent people speak in English in India. I havent picked up any Hindi, but havent had a problem. Go find those who have had a problem. Then, he objects, No pictures.

(Source: Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal)Africans are not evil, man, they are simple, just like the Americans, Michael Chema proclaims to the room, which right now has his business partner Louzi and a few hungry men, flipping through English entertainment channels on television.Chema, a Nigerian, arrived in India in September 2014, after brief visits to Vietnam and Thailand. I am an international businessman Louzi cooks the best food in Rajpur. We began this kitchen service, says Chema, sitting in the living room of his three-room apartment. The house has the basics: an old couch, a few cushions, a mattress on the floor in the bedroom and an air-conditioner. All my friends come to my home because of the air-conditioner, he smiles.Its 10 minutes past noon, and the two have just woken up. Louzi heads straight to the small, cluttered kitchen, with a microwave and several large bowls. She hurriedly empties a packet of rice flour into a huge aluminium bowl, adds a little water, and then begins stirring the batter over high flame till it gets the consistency of dough. She then pulls out two large plastic boxes from the freezer. This is chicken curry and the kidney bean soup she made in the night, says Chema. But just as Louzi tries to explain the recipe, Chema interjects, You ask me the questions.The food prepared and re-heated, Chema settles down on the couch with the rice dough and chicken curry. Louzi heads back to the kitchen, to prepare food for the 20 customers who will come in the next hour. Life is very simple for me here. Language is a problem but I try to begin my sentence with bhaiyyaji (brother) That works most of the time, he laughs, dunking the dough into the curry and taking large bites. If Africans are involved in a fight, we try to go for peace always. But the ones who fight The hardships in India make African men very sad, angry  rents are high, food is expensive Maybe that is why they get into fights. But I want to live long, get married he says, talking about the recent attacks.Chika Mariamo (backin the pic) is been in Delhi for eight months and lives in the Rajpur Khurd village near Chattarpur in South Delhi.

People stare at me all the time, but I guess that is because I have a great fashion sense. Indian men they are heartless, jealous, and the girls are shy That leads to some tension, he says, spitting out bones into a bowl.But here in Rajpur Khurd, it is all good. The Rathis protect us. They have lawyers and policemen in the family Once some men followed me from Malviya Nagar, but this old Rathi woman threatened to attack them with sticks. They fled immediately, he says, handing over the dishes to Louzi.As his friends begin trickling in for lunch, sold at Rs 200 a plate, the mood in the house gets lighter. A group of men head straight to the room with the air-conditioner, beer cans in hand. The others join their friends in the TV room. Louzi is hard at work in the kitchen. A few men light up, and a waft of sticky rubber-like smell fills the house. I am very popular, continues Chema. These are my friends, this is my iPhone, I have made a lot of money worked hard. We dont create any trouble the ones who do are the Africans from Malviya Nagar.There is a knock on the door, its his landlord. Louzi peers through the wooden door, not opening the iron gate just yet. Where is the money? You need to give Rs 6,000 for the AC, he demands.2 pmPastor Samuel Joseph is been in Delhi for a year and a half and lives in the south of Delhi towards the Chattarpur area preaching at a church there.

In 2000, on the advice of the relative, he left Sonepat with his wife and came to Rajpur Khurd. He runs a tuition centre on the ground floor of his house and has two children  a daughter, 7, and a 10-year-old son. In the past one-and-a-half years, he has made two changes to his house: put up CCTV cameras outside his balcony and a thick wooden stick at the entrance.In Africans ko chot lagne se bohot darr lagta hai (These Africans are scared of injuries). They feel if they bleed, their wounds wont heal in the Indian weather. So everytime they create a ruckus, I just threaten them with my stick and they flee, he says.The CCTV, now outside many homes in the village, is for proof, Baljit adds. They get drunk at night and relieve themselves outside my house. They have these gang wars and hurl abuses. But everytime I went to police with complaints, they asked for proof. That is why I have installed the CCTVs.Baljit also worries about the influence on his children. I am scared to even let them out in the balcony. The African women move around with alcohol. Sometimes at night we see men thrashing their wives or, I dont know, live-in partners, on the street. Even police are intimidated. They say embassy ka issue ho jayega. I have lost 20 per cent of my students because of this ruckus, he complains.Dariya Singh, a retired BSF officer, links the growing numbers of Africans in Rajpur Khurd to the other flashpoint involving the community in Delhi, the Khirki Extension episode of January 2014. It is our fault we let them invade this area. There is no unity in us. When we tell landlords to not keep them as tenants, they say You give Rs 10,000 a month, he says, adding that the Africans get drunk and drive around without helmets. All their cars have dark glasses, but police say nothing.A womens African salon in Rajpur Khurd village in Chattarpur area in South Delhi.

One day they beg shopkeepers to give them some food, the next day they turn up with bundles of cash. We all know the work they do Why else does this place become a taxi stand at night? They all head to farmhouses and we know what happens there.For Zu Zan Hmos Osycal, it is such stereotyping that is responsible for the recent attacks. Pursuing his MA in Clinical Research from Punjab Technical University, Osycal claims his house was raided four days back for drugs. I understand this is not Vasant Kunj, this is a village, people are conservative but they can at least respect us. I want to have intellectual conversations with them, but no one wants that in Rajpur, he says, sitting in the small shoe and clothes shop which he runs with his wife.The 32-year-old from Liberia came to India five years back to study. He stayed in many parts of the capital before moving to Rajpur Khurd two years ago. But he is a minority in the village: an African student who lives with his wife.We hardly step out, just to Sarojini Nagar and Uttam Nagar to get clothes and shoes, and sometimes to INA market to buy some food. We dont interfere in anyones life. But then why does police come unannounced to my house? Why do villagers break into my shop and steal? I just want to finish my studies and go back, he says.His wife Mahrovia refuses to talk. I am not comfortable speaking about these issues, she says, arranging a few dresses. And dont take my picture! Samuel Joseph, a 64-year-old Nigerian and a pastor at a local African church, explains the communitys reluctance to getting noticed.Rajpur Khurd is the heart of African settlements in India, but the villagers here are very hostile to them After the recent attacks, cameras scare them, they feel any kind of pictures can be used against them, says Joseph, who sells dried fish to the local African kitchens in the village.A Nigerian man shows a bottle of a indigenous conction of lime leaves, garlic, ginger and whiskey which he claims cures all kinds of fever, pain and hypertension.

It is true that a majority of the Africans in Rajpur Khurd have no jobs, they get into risky, illegal jobs for money, but that is true for Indians in this village too, he argues. It is the 21st century, Indians need to have good relations with foreigners.Though there is little fraternising between the Jats and Africans, there are a few exceptions. Like the 30-year-old Jamia Hamdard University student, who is helping a dhobi iron clothes. Like many in the village, she does not wish to be identified or photographed, but the dhobis assistants vouch for her. Thoda darawane dikhte hain, par baat karne par theek hain. Masti zyaada karte hain (They look intimidating, but once you talk to them, they are fine. They just fool around a lot), says one of the helpers.I often come here to help them out. We have good relations with Indians on a one-to-one basis But please dont ask me about the attacks, no one understands what we go through here, says the girl.5 pmKabeya (right) share details about the protest against locals after four African nationals were attacked.

Chika Mariamo, 32, has stepped out to visit the salon. Only an African can style our hair, Indians dont know what to do with it, smiles Mariamo. There are few salons in the area run by African women. A Cameroon national, Mariamo has been in India for eight months. I came here to earn a living, I had heard about Delhi from my friends. I am still looking for a job, she says.Talking about the lack of English-speaking people in the village, Mariamo points to her pink tights and a fitted tank top, and adds, People here are extremely racist. Look how I am dressed now, is there a problem? I dont understand what the men say about me, but I am not a fool, their expression says it all.Mariamo is among the few African women who speaks about issues faced by the community, the others are happy to let the men do the talking. How will they talk? People here think the worst of them. We go out in the evening to meet friends, but we all know the rumours. Look at how they treat their own women. I have rarely heard any of the Indian women in the village complain about us, it is always the men, she says.Four African nationals were attacked in Rajpkhurd village of Chhatarpur, South Delhi on Thursday night.

They (Africans) have a few places where they gather in the evening. The landlords say they are students, but I have never seen a book in anyones hand. They are just middle-aged men with nothing to do, says Baljit. Ashok Rathi again tries to put up a defence. Their day begins in the evening. What is wrong with that?Mentioning the good things, he says, Once I had viral fever. One of my tenants gave me this tonic made out of whiskey and neem leaves. I was cured overnight. Most of my tenants make their own medicine. It is just like our Ayurveda.Around 6 pm, Mike Enumah and his brother, a few other African residents and some landlords, including Ashok Rathi, head to the sensitisation conference organised by the Delhi Police at a nearby resort since the attacks of May 28. The two groups get into different vehicles and sit in separate rows at the conference.While Mike claims to be assured after the meeting, his brother feels more needs to be done. Why take steps only after a tragedy? They need to do more in the village, he says, adding he does not wish to be named. He adds a request: Ignore the man from the afternoon who said he will break your camera. People here are just scared they are angry.9 pmThe attacks triggered a major diplomatic face-off between India and Africa.

His wife and two children are back home. I want to grow my business. I have pitched several ideas to the Indians in the village but you guys dont like foreigners. Indians need exposure; there is no cultural exchange in the village, he complains.Okezies decision to come to India went beyond work though. I grew up watching Bollywood films in Nigeria; I was fascinated about the country.On his way to Rajpur Khurd from the airport, he says, he was amused to see so many cows on the streets. Now applying some gel on his clients hair, he points out, But we accept all that. We are big, we look different, speak a little aggressively, but we mean no harm. Maybe a few pictures before he downs the shutters? No, he says firmly.MidnightJason (centre), one of the victims, share details about the protest against locals after four African nationals were attacked in Rajpkhurd village of Chhatarpur, South Delhi.

Baljit and a few of the neighbours gather on one terrace, a vantage point that helps them keep an eye on them. PCR vans and policemen on bikes begin nightly rounds. Its quite hot but the men dont allow the women and children onto the terrace.Hamare gaon ko auto, taxi stand bana diya hai (They have made our village an auto, cab station), says one of Baljits friends. A group of African men, including Mike and his brother, meet up near the bank branch. There are some visitors from outside too, including just one non-African. As the group talks, their voices sometimes rising, Baljits friend says, After the attacks, they are careful, you should have seen earlier. He shows a video of what seems like a fight between two African women.On the street, the group seems aware of being watched. Some of them begin speaking in hushed tones, the others disperse everytime they see a police vehicle. There are three other spots, the villagers say, where the Africans gather every night. But the spots are vacant tonight. If only the policemen were this vigilant on other days, says Baljit.Blessy runs a store in Rajkhurd village of Chhatarpur where four African nationals were attacked.

Some African men continue to roam the streets till 3 am, some play music on their phones. The ones visiting from outside begin dispersing.It seems like a regular night, but the villagers are not convinced. Agle hafte aana, zyaada din shaant nahin rahenge (Come next week.

Nor is Dhivaharan to be found at the Sengamalarthayyar Educational Trust College for Women that he owns, says the guard there.Very disciplined, good college. Better than Government Arts College. All the people are preferring STET only, says a shop owner in Mannargudi.Dhivaharan has kept a low profile since December 2011. That was when Jayalalithaa carried out an unexpected and swift purge against Sasikala and a dozen of her family members, who were alleged to have amassed wealth and properties alongside political influence within the AIADMK.As surprising as Sasikalas sudden expulsion was her return to Poes Garden some three months later, after a public apology in which she distanced herself from her family members who, she claimed, had misused her proximity to Jayalalithaa, and swore she could never think of betraying her akka. Since then most of her family members have remained persona non grata in the Jayalalithaa household.Sasikala is said to have fully resumed her role as her friends gatekeeper and counsel in a party whose centralised functioning is so opaque that even the seniormost ministers are clueless about important matters. Sasikala is the person who handles all matters related to Jayalalithaas case in Supreme Court. No one in the party knows anything about it, says a long-time AIADMK watcher in Chennai.The Supreme Court has set June 1, two weeks after the declaration of the Assembly election results, as the deadline for the Karnataka government to finish arguments in its appeal against the Karnataka High Court order setting aside a Bangalore special courts conviction of Jayalalithaa in a disproportionate assets case.Just as Jayalalithaa is inaccessible, so is Sasikala. She gives no interviews, and her last public statement was her 2012 apology. In contrast to Jayalalithaas first term as chief minister between 1991 and 96, she has rarely appeared by her side in public in the last few years.Although the family remains out of view, its business interests have, however, grown. Last October, a company in which two members of Sasikalas extended family are directors bought 11 cinemas in Chennai. Another Sasikala relative runs Jaya TV.In this town, the AIADMK candidate in the May 16 election is S Kamaraj, a wealthy contractor and a former party district secretary. He was not in the first list of candidates, triggering speculation that he was chosen later because of his closeness to the family. But here is the paradox. In a place synonymous with the Sasikala family, AIADMK did not win in Mannargudi in 2011.Local boy T R B Raja of DMK, the sitting MLA and son of former Union minister T R Baalu, is standing for re-election. When you talk about AIADMK, you have to talk about Mannargudi. But for all that, what has the Sasikala family done for this place, he asks, as he reels off the DMKs contributions  a fertiliser factory, a modern rice mill, Government Arts College, and reopening of the railway station after 40 years, and several train connections, which he credits to his father during his time as the Union minister.Sasikala may be strong in Poes Garden, says Raja, 41, but she is not strong here.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"

Express photoFour days after two children died of suspected food poisoning at Kapurthalas Sukhjit Ashram, a Punjab government-run home for special children, the Deputy Commissioner (DC) has asked the district police to step in to ascertain the identity of those who donated langar at the Ashram on the fateful day. The move came after the district administration failed to get information about the donors from the Ashram staff. No entry about the donors was made in the Ashrams official register.DC Jaskiran Singh has now directed police officials to question slum dwellers who live next to the Ashram and were also served the same food in the afternoon that day.To get information about the vehicle used to bring the cooked food to the area, the DC has also ordered scanning of the footage from all CCTV cameras installed along the roads in the vicinity.Sources claim that food was brought to the Ashram in a Tata Ace mini truck Sunday. Poori Chana and sweet rice was first served to slum dwellers in the area and then donated at the Ashram. The first death was recorded Monday, and the second Ashram inmate died Tuesday.The distric administration has also decided to get CCTVs intalled inside the Ashram to keep an eye on the activities of the staff and the inmates.Meanwhile, Kapurthala SDM Dr Mandeep Kaur, who was to submit the magisterial inquiry report Thursday, missed the deadline and will submit now submit it Friday.Also, after the suspension of the District Social Security Officer (DSSO), Kapurthala, Gulbarg Lal, the Ashrmas charge has been given to DSSO, Jalandhar, Dalvinder Singh. The new superintendent, Kiranpreet Kaur, who was recently transferred from Amritsar to Kapurthala, will join Monday.Kapurthala DC said that the children who were admitted to hospital after the incident will stay there till whitewash of the new rooms at the Ashram building was complete.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Reuters/File) The frog marriage is a traditional ritual observed by the rural folk to appease the gods to bring in rain and ensure a good harvest.

Hundreds of village folk, young and old, boys and girls gathered at Rongdoi village community hall till late at night to witness the unconventional marriage.There is a mythological belief among Hindus that if wild frogs caught by people are married off with Vedic rites and traditional marriage rituals like human beings, it can help bring rainfall in the coming days. Thousands of farmers are facing a drought like situation throughout the state as the monsoon rain is eluding to hit the plains of Assam for almost a week.The people (farmers) of Jorhat is also passing through a bad phase of dust storm and dry wave these days followed by severe water crisis in paddy fields too, which motivated the citizens to arrange for frog marriage as to please the rain god.There is a belief that when a frog marriage is performed, the Barun Devata [the rain-god] is pleased and brings rain. Since, there has been no rain for the past couple of weeks, villagers of Rongdoi have performed the frog marriage to invoke the Barun Devata and expecting the rain to come very soon.The paddy crop in most parts of the state has been affected. In fact most of the region did not receive any significant rainfall for the past weeks casting a long shadow of ecological destruction which could have an adverse and cascading effect in rice cultivation as well as other industry like tea etc.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/Saurabh Das) In this Friday, Nov. 4, 2016 photo, Bijender Singh walks through smoke caused by setting his field on fire to prepare it for its next yield at Chandhat, in the state of Haryana, south of New Delhi, India. Even as the Indian capital hit a new low on air pollution, many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated, like farmers in bordering regions continuing to burn crop waste. (AP Photo/Saurabh Das)Even for a city considered one of the worlds most polluted, the Indian capital hit a new low this past week.Air so dirty you can taste and smell it; a gray haze that makes a gentle stroll a serious health hazard.According to one advocacy group, government data shows that the smog that enveloped New Delhi was the worst in the last 17 years. The concentration of PM2.5, tiny particulate pollution that can clog lungs, averaged close to 700 micrograms per cubic meter. Thats 12 times the government norm and a whopping 70 times the WHO standards.The Delhi winter, once a glorious time of clear _ crisp days that meant holidays and weekends spent picnicking in its many public parks _ is now a time of annual health woes.As millions struggle with hacking coughs and burning eyes, many schools across the city have either shut down or ended all outdoor activities. Doctors have asked people to stay indoors during the worst days.Yet many of the problems that turn Delhis air so toxic continue unabated. People still set off massive amounts of festival fireworks, piles of garbage burn all night and dust from the construction projects that dot the city is unchecked.And at the start of every winter, farmers in the states bordering the city begin burning straw from their rice paddy crop to clear the fields for planting wheat.Sources of pollution in Delhi and outside of Delhi have exponentially increased in the last couple of days, said Polash Mukerjee, a research associate with the Centre for Science and Environment, a Delhi-based research and lobbying organization.He said that wind direction is blowing toward Delhi from all directions, especially from Punjab and Haryana, where there are large incidences of crop fires that we are detecting even today.Over the last two years, the government has tried a slew of measures to control air pollution, including stricter emission norms for cars and a tax on diesel-fueled trucks that enter the city.New Delhi also has attempted to limit the number of cars during the winter months, when air quality is at its worst. Twice the city imposed a two-week period in which cars were allowed on the roads only on even or odd days, depending on the vehicles license plate number.Last month, the city launched a smartphone application called Change the Air, inviting residents to send photos and complaints about sources of pollution, from the burning of leaves and garbage in public parks to construction crews working without dust control measures.But despite announcing new measures, the city has struggled with enforcing them on a regular basis.One of the biggest struggles is crop burning in neighboring areas, where despite attempting to impose cash fines on farmers enforcement has been hard. For the farmers, its cheaper to burn rice paddy straw than hire people to carry it away.Pollution is also caused by diesel cars, factories and many other sources. Farmers only do this for one month of the year, Bijendar Singh, a farmer in neighboring Haryana state, said as he watched his paddy straw burn.It is a compulsion for farmers to do this. Because of this compulsion, we spread air pollution. As much as it harms the people sitting in Delhi, it harms us and our children even more, he said.Mukerjee, the research associate, said that the government hasnt worked out a strategy to help farmers dispose of their crop waste.Paddy straw that lies in your field today, as a farmer, it is absolutely worthless to me. I dont earn anything out of it. Why should I spend money collecting it? Mukherjee said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The 498-km Cauvery river has more than 44,000 sq km basin area in Tamil Nadu, and about 32,000 sq km area in Karnataka.The Karnataka government on Monday asked Supreme Court to suspend its September 5 order of releasing water to Tamil Nadu saying the agony claimed by Tamil Nadu on water crisis not there.The Supreme Court, however, expressed its displeasure over the Karnataka governments failure to implement its order. Justice Dipak Mishra observed: Citizens and executive of this country have to accept and obey orders of the Supreme Court unless it is modified. If the court passes an order, either comply or come for modification. People cannot take law into their hand, news agency ANI reported.The Karnataka government had late Saturday night filed a plea in the apex court seeking an urgent hearing.

The 12-year-old was allegedly hit, and when her father Mohammed Shagir protested, he too was allegedly kicked. Hours later, Shagir died.According to Shagirs wife Rukhsana Khatoon, her son escaped a similar fate six months ago. Chand Babu, a Class II student, wanted a little more khichdi too, and in return was allegedly thrown off the schools roof, fracturing his right leg. He dreads going to school since.Three teachers and a cook of the school now face a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and are absconding. The post-mortem report is awaited. The school is shut since the incident.Share This Article Related Article Mid-day meal: Students in Punjab 'disliking khichri', schools demand variety in menuMid-day meal: Students in Punjab 'disliking khichri', schools demand variety in menu A taste of whats cooking for mid-day meals in city schoolsPrincipals protesting,so no midday meals in 35,000 schools in stateUnpalatable truthSoon,parents to check quality of khichdi served in civic schoolsIn mid-day meals,quantity,nutrition first casualtyShagir, a daily wage earner, leaves behind five children between the ages of four and 12. The family, that doesnt own any land, lives in a thatched hut on government land. Neighbours have been giving the family food since Shagirs death.Recounting what happened on February 12, Kasheeda says, When I asked for khichdi a second time, school cook Sanjit hit me with a serving spoon with a long handle. I came back home crying and complained to abbu. My father immediately rushed to the school and told Sanjit, Sab bachchon ko sarkari khana khane ka haq hai (All children are entitled to the government mid-day meal).According to her, a school teacher named Z N Ansari, also known as Mastan, rushed out shouting and threatening him, Cheer denge (will tear you apart). Hardev Ram (the school headmaster) also joined in, saying maaro. Mastan hit my father between his legs.Shagir, who was reportedly hit on the testicles, doubled over in pain, defecated in his clothes and fainted.He was rushed to a local doctor, but didnt recover.Rukhsana says a neighbour immediately called police but no one turned up the whole day. The Narpatganj police only reached the spot at 1 am on the intervening night of February 10 and 11, and an FIR was registered on February 11 against four persons  the schoolteachers Mastan and Hardev Ram, cook Sanjit Paswan, and the husband of a schoolteacher, Sambhu Yadav, who was present at the spot at the time.Police claim they came to know of the incident only on February 10 night. Says Narpatganj police station in-charge P K Praveen, The incident is surely a fallout of the mid-day meal at school. We have recorded the victims familys statement, and statements of 40-odd villagers. Mohammed Shagir had gone to the school and had a scuffle with teachers. Post-mortem alone will establish if he died because of being hit on his testicles.Narpatganj Block Education Officer Iftekhar Ahmed says, We have been talking to villagers to reopen the school while police investigate the matter.Another school cook, Mehdooda, says she had seen Shagir at school that day, but did not see any fight. I am not aware what happened to him later, says Mehdooda.School committee chairperson Mohammed Ali Sher, who says he was out of the village on the day of the incident, claims, The school is often under pressure to offer mid-day meal to extra children.While Classes I to V at Rajkiya Prathmik Vidyalaya have around 300 students, villagers say poor parents often send siblings along too to have the mid-day meal.Bihar government primary schools get Rs 3.86 per child for buying pulses and vegetables besides 100 gm rice each. From Classes VI onwards, the rice quantity goes up to 150 gm and the subdiary amount to Rs 5.78 each. Bihar has about 70,000 government primary and secondary schools serving mid-day meal to 2.5 crore children.The scheme has been under scanner in Bihar since the 2013 Chhapra tragedy in which 23 children died after eating poisonous food.Several villagers claim the whole controversy is linked to the coming panchayat polls, and that the teachers are being framed.Rukhsana and Shagir moved to Muslim-dominated Gokhlapur and Araria, one of the poorest districts of Bihar, around 30 years ago from a distant village.Pointing to a bamboo-and-grass fence around their hut that Shagir himself built just before the incident, Rukhsana says, An influential group in the village is out to prove us wrong on the cause of my husbands death My husband was hale and hearty and died after being hit.She says the group is trying to use the fact that the case was registered a day later. We were forced not to file a case last time but this time, we want justice. We are the ones who need mid-day meal the most, Rukhsana says.Vowing to support the family, her neighbour, Mohammed Izhar Alam, however, asks, Can Kasheeda get justice at all?

Rudra ignores her father and flips through her ABCD picture book  front to back, back to front, upside down.Rudra, the youngest of Kartiks three children, is a nursery student of the English-medium Mother Teresa Public School in Nabarangpur town, 4 km from their home in Pujariguda gram panchayat. Last year, Kartik, who earns Rs 7,000 as a machine operator at the nearby Mangalam timber factory, enrolled Rudra in the private school as part of the Odisha governments Anvesha scheme, under which children of BPL SC/ST households are admitted in private, English-medium schools. The government spends Rs 36,000 per student per year, plus a stipend of Rs 750 a month. In Nabarangpur, 137 children were enrolled in three such schools in 2015-16, 22 of them in the Mother Teresa school. This academic session, the scheme will be scaled up and 250 students will be enrolled in seven schools across the district.It has just been four months since Rudra joined school, but Kartik and his wife Nila cant stop talking about how she has changed  She says 1, 2, 3, 4 with such speed.

Their eldest daughter is away at a residential school, on the far right is a neighbour (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia)Nabarangpur, the focus of a year-long Indian Express investigation tracking poverty and change in what is arguably Indias poorest district, has some of the most dismal indicators for education. According to the 2011 Census, literacy in the district is 46.43 per cent, way below the national figure of 74.04. Besides, over half the population  57.35 per cent  has never attended school. But for a district that has such a low base, what stands out is hope, as Kartik says, of a better life.*****District Education Officer Kulamani Nathsharma is convinced that under his watch, Nabarangpur is advancing spectacularly. This time, our Class X pass percentage is 91.87 per cent, up from 82.60 last year. We stand fifth in the state. Enrollment in our schools has been steadily increasing  from 2.41 lakh students in 2014-15 to 2.56 lakh in 2015-16. The number of children who are taking the Class X Board exams is going up, so is the pass percentage. All our children have been enrolled. We have upgraded 14 upper primary schools to high schools and we will have one model school in each block, says Nathsharma, who attributes this success to persistent monitoring, inspection and tracking of teachers attendance.But there are some Nabarangpur numbers that dont quite add up. According to the District Information System for Education (DISE) data for 2014-15, the drop-out rate in Class VIII, the grade after which the Right to Education (RTE) umbrella folds up, is a high 24.23 per cent  its 4.88 per cent for Odisha and 6.88 nationally.The district also faces a crippling shortage of teachers. According to 2015-16 data provided by the District Education Office, Nabarangpurs elementary schools are short by 985 teachers and secondary schools by 290 teachers.Children at the Korchamal Government Girls High School, one of the 85 such ST/SC schools in the district, with attached hostels. The government spends Rs 800 per child in these hostels (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia) Children at the Korchamal Government Girls High School, one of the 85 such ST/SC schools in the district, with attached hostels. The government spends Rs 800 per child in these hostels (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia)Another problem is of access to higher education. Until now, the district didnt have a government degree college  a new Government Model Degree College is now being built at a cost of Rs 8.87 crore. The districts unaided and semi-aided private colleges are too few and far apart.While there are enough schools in the district, the crisis is at the level of 10+2 and degree colleges. Previously, there were very few students who cleared their Class X. But the numbers have been increasing every year and these students will need to get into colleges. Only 700 students in the district cleared Class X in 2000, that number went up to over 8,400 in 2015. But that year, more than 3,000 students couldnt get admission in Plus 2 colleges because there werent enough seats. All this is changing. The plan is to have 10 model CBSE schools with classes from VI to XII, one in each block. Of these, four are ready and will take in children this year. Last year, we also upgraded four high schools to Plus 2 level, says Nabarangpur MP Balabhadra Majhi of the BJD.Radhanath Behera, a retired principal of Nabarangpur College, one of the only two degree colleges, both private, in the district headquarters, says that while these are welcome steps, something drastic needs to be done. Without access to Plus 2 and degree colleges, girl education becomes the biggest casualty. Very few parents would want their daughters to travel long distances or stay in hostels to study, says Behera.Besides, Nabarangpur faces a problem thats typical of the states tribal districts  while children speak dialects such as Desia and Bhatri, teachers, usually posted from distant districts such as Cuttack and Bhadrak, speak a different tongue. Its very difficult for teachers and children to understand each other. Of course, teachers gradually learn if they stay in one place for long and children too learn to speak Odia as they get into the senior classes, but by then, the formative years are lost, says Behera.Yes, there are these problems. But Nabarangpur is a relatively young district (it was carved out of Koraput in 1992) with a predominantly tribal population (55.79 per cent). So youll find 35-year-olds who have never seen the inside of a school but who send their children to school. Many of these children are first-generation learners. I think its unfair to call them backward without giving them a chance. Give them at least a generation, says Nabarangpur District Magistrate Rashmita Panda.****Santemera, a village in Jharigam block, is what many call backward. Its in places like these  remote and distant  that the Nabarangpur education story stutters somewhat. The road stops 5 km before the village and the mud path into Santemera churns up during the rains. The village has no health centre; only a homeopathy centre with no doctor. The nearest health centre is in Jharigam, 25 km away. During the monsoons, we all get malaria. Some of us go to Jharigam, the others wait for ASHA didi (the Accredited Social Health Activist) to come and give injections and medicines, says Tuna Das, a villager.Santemera is a village of 134 households, majority of them Gond and Jani tribals who work as subsistence farmers, growing maize, pulses and rice on forest land.In Santemera village, Debo Majhi, 90, says, When we were young, we had land and did some farming. But now, these boys have no option but to go out and study (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia) In Santemera village, Debo Majhi, 90, says, When we were young, we had land and did some farming. But now, these boys have no option but to go out and study (Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia)They barely make enough for themselves. Since Santemera and the other 13 villages in the panchayat are on top of the Chandan Dhara hill, there is no water and no irrigation either, says Panchayat Executive Officer Naresh Chandra Jal. Outside his office in the nearby Badatemera village, villagers sit on their haunches in the summer heat, waiting to collect the Re 1 rice thats being distributed under the Antodaya scheme.The only money villagers earn is from collecting jungle produce and selling it in the nearby markets of Chacha and Jharigam  tendu patta, wood and, during February-March, mahua, that sweet smelling yellow-green flower that villagers use to make a heady local brew.What Santemera does have is a school, the Government High School that has classes from I to X. Its the only high school in the panchayat. Banvas Majhis sons Durjan, 11, and Devsing, 5, go to this school. The 35-year-old has never been to school himself, but made sure he enrolled his daughter and four sons. The daughter, now married, and his eldest son later dropped out.There has been a wedding in the family  Banvass eldest son got married the previous day  and their mud house is teeming with relatives. After a quick discussion about whether the boys should skip school, Banvas decides they will go. Whats left for them to do anyway? At least they can go to school and eat their lunch, he says.Around 7.45 am, after an unhurried bath in the village pond with their cousins, Durjan and Devsing cycle home, drink black tea and change into their school uniforms.

(Source: Express photo by Ravi Kanojia)But before that, theres another routine they cant skip: pick mahua flowers. Every morning, the boys carry their wicker baskets and join their parents, siblings and cousins and head to the nearby forests to pick these flowers. Early mornings are the best time for mahua and they have to get there before the cattle graze on the carpet of flowers.Around 7.45 am, after an unhurried bath in the village pond with their cousins, Durjan and Devsing cycle home, drink black tea and change into their school uniforms. Its well past school time, but no ones rushing them. School can wait. After all, says Banvas, the teachers are never on time themselves.They then walk past the school and head to a small patch of land near the village pond to a mahua tree. Its already the end of mahua season. And the boys are late today. In February and early March, there is a carpet of flowers. Each person collects 4 to 5 kg of flowers and leaves them to dry, after which villagers sell them in Chacha or Jharigaon markets for Rs 20-25 a kg. Of course, only after keeping some for ourselves, says Banvas.The boys then go home, pick their jute bags and head to school. Principal Devsing Gond and the two high school teachers break into nervous excitement as they arrange for chairs, hurry the children into classrooms and get the attendance registers out. Classes have finally begun, at least two hours behind schedule. Besides principal Gond, Kalindi Malick, teacher of Classical Sanskrit, and a science teacher are the only two teachers for classes VII to X, both on contract. The primary and middle classes have only one regular teacher, two gana shikshaks and one teacher on deputation.Teachers get posted here, they report for duty and then dont come back. The school management recently passed a resolution asking for more teachers and sent it to the Block Education Officer. We had 196 students last year and need at least five teachers for high school and four for primary school, says principal Gond, before going on to list the other problems. We have no electricity  the wiring is done, but we havent got the connection yet, he says.Back at the Majhi household, Banvass father, 90-year-old Debo Majhi, sits on his haunches, chewing a mango twig. These children have no option but to study. When we were young, we had land and at least did some farming. But now, these boys dont want to do that. So they spend all their time looking at their cellphones. They must go out and study. Only then will they get jobs and be able to look after their parents, says Debo.****Pabitra Mohan Pradhan, the District Welfare Officer, says there are many parents who want their children to go out and study. They realise that education can change lives. These people would have never studied themselves, but want their children to go to school. For instance, for our tribal residential schools, we dont have to put out advertisements, parents just bring their children here every year, he says, talking about the schools run by the ST/SC Development, Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Department of the Odisha government.There are 36,584 students studying in 85 such ST/SC schools in Nabarangpur, all with attached hostels. The government spends Rs 800 per girl in these hostels and Rs 750 on each boy. Everything is taken care of here  besides their education, they get free food, clothes, writing material, etc. I went to one such school myself, says Pradhan, sitting in the staff room of the Korchamal Government Girls High School.With an annual pass percentage of 100, its one of the schools the district administration holds up as a success model. The school has 789 students  645 in hostels and 144 as day scholars  and its students usually come back winners from the annual state-level Sargiphula festival. In the last academic year, our school stood first in the science competition at Sargiphula. Two of our students designed a Swachh Bharat vending machine  if you throw a plastic bottle into the machine, it dispenses a Re 1 coin, says headmistress Indumati Rath.But these successes are tinged with niggling problems. This year, three girls of Class X dropped out to get married, she says.Rashmita Harijan, 14, is determined she wont drop out  that she will complete school and become a teacher, or even a writer. Standing in one of the dormitories of the Korchamal school, Rashmita narrates the latest story she has written. Its a story of two sisters, Sankha and Koila. Their mother dies early and their father marries again. The stepmother doesnt like them so she throws the two girls out of the house. Their mother appears as a bhoot and rescues them. She then turns the girls into two rivers, who finally meet as Baitarni nadi.Rashmita has written this story in a notebook that she has left behind at her grandmothers home in Phampuri village in Kosagunda block of Nabarangpur. There isnt much space to keep things here, she says stopping at the bunk bed she shares with her younger sister Sargarita, a territory the latter has marked out with an I plus U thats scribbled on the hostels wall. My youngest sister Sarita is with my grandmother. She will join us this year, in Class I, but she wont have space on this bed, laughs Rashmita.The girls lost their mother six years ago and father a couple of years ago. I miss them, my mother more. But when Im here, in school, I dont think of her that much. This place is home now. I have been here since I was eight, she says.Ravi in NabarangpurKaam ho jaye bas. Khane ka koi tension nahin, Ravi would say every time I asked him if he was hungry, if we could push back our lunch to late evening because we had one more village to cover, one more student to meet, one more family.Nabarangpur was Ravis last big assignment. We spent five days there, trying to understand what it takes to study in Indias poorest district. On our second day, a school teacher told us, If you have to understand the problems that children and teachers here face, you must go to some of the most interior villages of Jharigam block. Thoda Naxal area hai. Ja sakte ho?Of course. Naxal bhi toh gaon wale hain, he said before I could respond. Thats how we chose Santemera village.In these parts, before children go to school, they go to pick mahua, a flower that locals use to brew a desi drink. Achcha picture banega, Ravi said. But we had to reach very early, at 5.30 am, because that week, with Odisha going through a heat wave, the government had declared new timings for schools  6.30 am to 10.30 am.We decided to do a recce of Santemera, tie up with a family and tell them we would be there next morning. But the road stopped a good 5 km before Santemera. From there, it was just earth churned inside out. The driver refused to go any further. Ravi, who sat in the front seat, tried his best to coax the driver to keep driving  eyes on the road, tyre to the left. Finally, he asked the driver to let him drive. Aise chalate hain. We have driven on worse roads, he said, turning to the driver, smiling all along.Thats when I realised this was a man with a resolve few others had. Two nights later, around 10 pm, when we walked down the main Nabarangpur road looking for an ATM, I was a little unsure. Was it safe? Theres Ravi, I thought.

The seven tea gardens are Birpara, Garganda, Lankapara, Tulsipara, Huntapara, Dhumchipara and Demdima.After the Centre announced that it was taking over seven of the 14 shut tea gardens belonging at Dooars in Alipurduar, the condition of the workers of these tea gardens has worsened. They are in a state of na ghar ka na ghat ka. The decision was taken ahead of the Assembly elections in Bengal.

It was too late by the time the infants parents brought her to the hospital, said Dr Satpathy.The babys parents  Boda Kolar and Bindu  from Goram village in Jharigaon block took the infant on January 16 to the local quack after she stopped breast-feeding and started crying continuously.Like many villagers in Nabarangpur, the family chose to take the infant to the local quack who applied pieces of a hot bangle on her body with the assurance that it would cure her illness. But it led to an infection. Her parents took her home and later to the community health centre in Umerkote three days ago. After her condition failed to improve, they brought her to the Nabarangpur headquarters on Sunday afternoon, said Dr Satpathy.Officials said the quack, Kusumati, has been arrested while a five-member team has been formed by the District Collector to probe the incident.Indias poorest district on various development indicators, Nabarangpur is the focus of a year-long assignment by The Indian Express until August 15, 2016. The primary healthcare system in the district in southern Odisha is in shambles with only 55 of the sanctioned 134 posts of doctors filled.The Indian Express had reported last month that hundreds of parents in the district, most of them tribals like Boda and Bindu, choose to brand their infants with hot nails or bangles in the name of tradition to cure various ailments.In December, a 27-day-old boy was branded on his stomach with a hot iron nail by a quack in the district. The infants mother, an anganwadi worker, had taken her boy to the quack after he stopped breast-feeding. The infant survived the branding.Satyabrata Kanungo, the medical officer of Jharigaon Community Health Centre (CHC), told The Indian Express that creating awareness against such practices was a daunting task.After delivery, a woman is supposed to spend at least 48 hours in the hospital. But here, almost all the mothers rush home to take a bath along with their newborns. Tribal customs prohibit the mother from eating after delivery unless she has bathed properly. The child too is given a bath which often leads to infections, he said.And if there are any health issues, the elders in the community, whose views hold sway in the family, always order a visit to the quack, said Kanungo.Purusottam Ghasi, the witchdoctor who was arrested for last months branding, had said that he never conducted his treatment on his own accord but only when people requested him to do do. I get Rs 50 and a few kilogrammes of rice for my work, Ghasi had told The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In a Facebook post, Vijayan said the people of Kerala should feel ashamed if a girl ends her life due to hunger, and indirectly criticised the state government for the apparent failure of its projects and funds meant for welfare of people from tribal communities, among others.Sruthimole, 15, daughter of one Perunnan Ravi and Moli, was found hanging from the ceiling of her home in Kelakam, near the town of Peravoor in Kannur district. The family belongs to Kurichia, a tribal community known to be progressive and relatively well off among tribals in the state.According to police, a suicide note allegedly written by Sruthimole purportedly states: I am going. Dont bother about me. I have suffered enough and cant suffer any more. When I come back home after tuition, grandmother would not prepare (food)would scold meOn Saturday, Kannur District Collector P Bala Kiran said he conducted an inquiry through the tehsildar after the issue triggered an outrage. It was not a starvation death. The girl committed suicide due to domestic issues and problems, he said.According to Bala Kiran, the family is well off  it owns about 3 acres of land, and had taken another 3 acres of cashew plantation on lease.The victims father, Ravi, also said they are under no financial constraint, and that the day Sruthimole committed suicide, there was some 30 kg rice and other necessary provisions at home. The family is at a loss why she killed herself, he said, adding that lack of food will not be a reason.On Friday, Deshabhimani said the teen had not eaten for days, and was a likely victim of the governments neglect towards the tribal populace, who are struggling without food and water.Earlier, during the civic body polls in November last year, another report in the local media had shown a few children from tribal families looking for food in waste dumps of Peravoor panchayat. The report depicted it as a struggle to ward off hunger. The district collector, however, claimed that their probe revealed that the report was in all likelihood incorrect.When asked to comment on the issue, CPM leader and MP P K Sreemathi said, Let police first find out whether it was a hunger suicide or not.WATCH THE INDIAN EXPRESS NEWS PLAY LISTFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express photo A restaurant in Kerala offering Arabic cuisine. Express photoWhile the missing of a dozen Muslim youths with their family members have triggered a debate on the influence of Islamic State in Kerala, some sections of the Muslim community in the state are on the fast course to Arabification.Until recently, sporting long beard and wearing skullcap had marked the demonstration of Islamic identify for men and burka for women. But, the recent adoption of various Arabian cultural, culinary, financial and other practices have taken Muslims in North Kerala closer to the Islamic life in the Middle East.Certain Muslim business houses even have names written in Arabic, while some others have got to the extent of adding destination board in the language to their buses. Arabic style fonts are also in currency for writing English alphabets. Another trend has been the proliferation of such messages on WhatsApp.Watch Video: Whats making newsIn the last two years, Arabian food items mandi rice and kabsa have conquered the states taste buds with outlets selling these dotting most of Malabar. Even in small towns these restaurants are popular, and not just among Muslims. The Yemeni mandi, is now finding its way into even marriages in Kozhikode and Malappuram districts, replacing the traditional Malabar Biriyani.Though rare till a few years ago, some middle class Muslim men find it fashionable to wear the white jubba thoab, instead of the traditional mundu and shirt. Even burkha is relatively new in the state, but is now very popular.In recent years, Muslim organisations have also begun promoting a state-specific Islamic calendar, once circulated in Arab countries only.Prof Hameed Chendamangalloor, an observer of Muslim matters, says the Muslim community in Kerala is undergoing the process of Arabification. He adds: The main reason is the strong influence the Middle East countries exert on the community. It is happening like the westernisation. Those Indians who had lived in England once used to emulate the English way of life back home. Similarly, Muslims in Kerala are trying to bring home the Arabian culture and way of life.He said in the past Muslim life style was the similar to one followed by Hindus and Christians and adopting the Arabian way would lead to the segregation of Kerala Muslims. Since girls have to wear the burkha from their childhood, the community is getting trained for this compartmentalisation, he said.Congress leader and maker of award winning films Aryadan Shoukath said every micro-change in the Arabian world is getting reflected and replicated in Kerala. Such adoption of Arabian life may be peculiar to Kerala. The Gulf money, a major stay of Kerala economy, plays a key factor in bringing the Arabian culture to the state. Expatriates try to copy in their home state what they had experienced in the Middle East, he added.The concept of Islamic banking too has caught the fancy of some with the Jamaat Islami propagating the concept of Sharia-based, interest-free banking. A few years back, the Jamaat had floated Alternative Investment and Credit Limited, a venture capital fund as per Islamic law. Taking a cue from the venture, the state government too ventured into Islamic finance in 2010. The state-run Cheraman Financial Services Limited is now planning to infuse fund into public sector ventures in distress.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

For the first time, water sports and river cruises are also being introduced on the river Krishna.The State Government which is promoting the event as a cultural and tourism event will set up food courts at several places in Vijayawada along the `pushkar ghats which will serve Andhra specials from across the districts. Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu who visited the pushkar ghats to review the arrangements today said that noted food items of all the districts should be available at the food court and the pilgrims should feel proud about Andhra food varieties. He said that the food items of other states also should be made available at the food courts. Many of the food courts would be set up at the apron downstream of Prakasam barrage at Vijayawada. Although, it is river Krishna pushkaralu, the water that will be released for pilgrims to take a holy dip downstream of the Prakasam Barrage at Vijayawada is technically from river Godavari. As there was negligible inflow from upstream of Krishna, the Government released more water from the Pattiseema lift irrigation project on river Godavari last week and the waters reached the Prakasam Barrage two days ago.Water sports are likely to be added attraction during the 12-day Krishna pushkaralu which occurs once every 12 years. The CM directed the officials to organize water sports and arrange air-conditioned boats and organize cruises during the 12-day river festival by setting up 10 parking places along the river for the boats to dock.

(Source: PTI) President Pranab Mukherjee during his visit to the Parliament of Namibia in Windhoek, Namibia on Thursday. (Source: PTI)Indias public and private businesses are ready to invest in resource-rich Namibias mining sector using environment-friendly processes to back the countrys developmental goals, President Pranab Mukherjee said on Friday.Addressing students of Namibia University of Science and Technology, Mukherjee said Namibia is blessed with rich natural resources and an abundance of mineral wealth.Their efficient extraction and value addition using environment-friendly methods will contribute to the sustainable development of Namibias mining sector. Our public and private enterprises stand ready to join your endeavours in this direction, Mukherjee said.Watch Video: Whats making newsHe recalled the old friendship between the two countries and cited Indias example which was earlier a food importer and later emerged as the worlds largest producer of wheat and rice for two years.At the time of Indias independence, India, due to her weak agriculture sector, had to import food grains. However, soon enough, due to proper planning and synergy between science and public policy, the excellence of our scientists and the selfless toil of our farmers, our country saw a revolution in agricultural productivity, he said.He said in the sphere of bilateral trade and investment, fruitful economic exchanges between India and Namibia underscore the much larger potential waiting to be realised.The President said an MoU has been signed on setting up a centre of excellence in IT in Namibia which will contribute to enhancing the capacity and skill levels of Namibian IT students and professionals.We intend to commence the setting up of this centre as soon as possible, in consultation with the Government of Namibia, he said drawing huge applause.Mukherjee said during bilateral discourse, the areas that have been prioritised for collaboration between the two countries include human resource development, capacity building and educational and cultural exchanges.In this context, I would like to mention Indias flagship programmes like Skill India, Make in India, Digital India and 100 Smart Cities as they could be successful models in Namibia as well, he said.The President said India remains committed to partnering with Namibia as your people pursue their developmental goals and national aspirations embodied in Government of Namibias Vision 2030 and Harambee Prosperity Plan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Its hardly a secret that barring in wheat or paddy, no major yield breakthrough has been achieved by Indian scientists for over two decades.The recent confrontation between Monsanto and the Centre over pricing of Bt cotton seed technology has yet again brought into focus the need to constantly update technology to sustain gains in agriculture. Its hardly a secret that barring in wheat or paddy, no major yield breakthrough has been achieved by Indian scientists for over two decades. This is more so in pulses, oilseeds and high-value agriculture sectors like horticulture, dairy and poultry.Dramatic productivity gains in major cereals during the seventies and eighties were made possible mainly through technology sharing by non-profit international research bodies, such as CIMMYT (the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, Mexico) and the International Rice Research Institute in Manila. While our scientists improved many of the genetic lines sourced from these centres and adapted them to the countrys huge diversity of agro-climatic conditions, the original strains and the science behind them were, however, developed in foreign labs before they could support technology in Indian fields.It was this international cooperation between government, non-government and research bodies that enabled Indian farmers, at least in the better resource-endowed regions, to achieve significant productivity breakthroughs in wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, India was self-sufficient in foodgrain production.Share This Article Related Article Dont narrow the fieldDont narrow the field India-born scientist Sanjaya Rajaram named winner of 2014 World Food PrizeIndia-born scientist Sanjaya Rajaram named winner of 2014 World Food Prize As farmers give new technologies a miss,water levels keep fallingScientists race to avoid climate change harvestAs good as MSP getsRecord wheat harvest ahead this rabi season,says agri expertRecapitulating this history is important in the context of the on-going dispute with Monsanto because it reveals how the then government clearly differentiated between strategy and tactics. The reflexive anti-US and anti-MNC sentiment, prevalent among influential sections of academia, civil society and the media, apart from bureaucratic and political circles here, wasnt any weaker then than now. Yet, the political leadership stared down a shrill campaign to block the import of a small quantity of breeder seeds of dwarf wheat varieties for multiplication in India; from its standpoint, the larger strategic objective of food security was more important than any short-term tactical loss of support among key support bases.Ending dependence on food aid was given higher priority than pandering to fears regarding destruction of indigenous bio-diversity or loss of seed sovereignty.In the instant case, more than one senior agricultural scientist has confirmed to this writer that Monsanto had originally made an offer for an outright transfer of its Bt gene technology to the Centre for a one-time payment in single-digit million US dollars. The Centre could, then, allow any public or private entity to produce cotton seeds incorporating this technology at a fixed royalty. In retrospect, this may have been a major missed opportunity.The Monsanto offer was made sometime in the mid-1990s, but a combination of scientific pride and bureaucratic caution seemingly ensured that it never got beyond a few conversations. Monsanto subsequently licensed the technology to a joint venture with a private Indian seed company.The commercial royalty levied on this technology lies at the heart of the current dispute with some of the sub-licensee firms that have incorporated it into their own cotton hybrids. With various courts and the Competition Commission of India, too, getting involved, well have to wait and see how the issue gets resolved.However, the larger question  of accessing cutting-edge technology, spanning crop husbandry and even high-value agriculture  remains unanswered. Frequent technology upgrades are critical to attain the ambitious vision of doubling farm incomes by 2022. Can it be done without seeking technology from outside? The answer is an unequivocal no.The approach to acquiring critical agricultural technology could follow the pattern emerging in another area of strategic importance: Defence. To provide the armed forces with cutting-edge capabilities, the Centre is today taking the lead for identifying proprietary technologies and negotiating their transfer to Indian entities (often from one foreign private company to an Indian one), so that the necessary platforms (guns, tanks, fighter jets, warships etc.) are manufactured in India.Technology for agriculture needs to be approached in a similar manner. Let the Niti Aayog list critical gaps in our agri technology portfolio and fill a priority list with outright import and adaptation of on-the-shelf technologies from anywhere in the world. The Centre can negotiate the purchase of the identified technologies, using government-to-government purchase mechanisms similar to those in defence acquisitions. This will greatly reduce the commercial complexity of such buy-outs, with the Centre holding the rights to domestically license a range of technologies at reasonable rates of royalty (or even zero where warranted, such as in pulses).But why not simply liberalise flows of planting material or germplasm from abroad and allow private entities to enter into tie-ups of their choosing? Well, the chances are we will run into a hundred Monsanto-type problems.The political economy of agriculture now will not permit market forces to have free play; the temptation for state agents to influence economic decisions would remain a threat to businesses in the near term. Only when this situation has improved over a decade or so, and market-determined pricing for inputs becomes accepted practice, can one realistically expect agricultural technology liberalisation in the full sense.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo by Bhupendra Rana) A tribal sifts through the dirt on track for grain. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)As soon as the doors of the goods wagon slid shut at the railway yard in Vadodara, a group of women tiptoed in, armed with brooms, sieves and cloth bags. They gently slipped under the wheels of the train, each staking claim to a spot.Then, they carefully started scooping up and sieving the grain that had spilt over and got mixed with the cement, dust and stains of crude oil on the tracks. A couple of hours later, they silently signalled to each another and moved out, evading the security guards on duty.For these tribal women of Dahod, who do not figure on the official Below Poverty Line (BPL) map of Vadodara despite settling here 10 years ago, this is the only way to keep their families from starving. Even if that means scavenging for dirty grain on the railway tracks.These grains help us survive for a few weeks or even a month. We fear being caught for trespass and being harassed. We come here only to collect some grains that are of no use to anyone, says Surti Pagra Bhil, a widow with two sons and a daughter, who was able to gather more grain in a plastic bag she had picked up on the way.The menfolk are unable to earn much money as daily wage labourers, says Surti, dressed in a frayed cotton skirt and blouse, with a dupatta covering her head.From the yard, the women hire autos in threes to carry the grains to their encampments along the Narmada canal in the Chhani area, where UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon had inaugurated the countrys largest canal-top solar power plant last January.Outside each hut, they spread out the grains to pick out the bigger impurities  crushed train ballast, cement chunks and weeds. We wash the grains in water and dry them before crushing them with our stone-grinders at home. Each of us manages to collect about 4 kg wheat from the tracks. It is sufficient to last our families for a few weeks. For the rest of the days, we survive on what our men earn, says Dholki Damor, another tribal woman from Dahod.Most families here were part of the slum census carried out by the Vadodara Municipal Corporation in 2010. Surti even has a hut identity card, with a magnetic chip, issued by the civic body in her name.Woman collecting grain from dirt. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana) Woman collecting grain from dirt. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)But she says what she really wants is a BPL card. My son, who lives with his wife and three children in the adjoining slum, earns about Rs 2,000 per month. But no one has told us about the BPL card. We do not have any such card. The authorities gave us this (hut identity) card when they conducted a count a few years ago, says Surti.When contacted, District Collector Avantika Singh said that the families that migrated from Dahod, mostly in search of work, fall under the limits of the civic body.Kavita Desai, project director of the urban community development programme of the municipal corporation, said, We are following the BPL list from 2000.However, sources in the Vadodara collectorate said that the BPL list is due for a revision soon.Until then, the train wagons remain the only hope for these families. The women are given the task of keeping an eye on the grain wagons. As there is no fixed schedule, we often visit the yard to see what wagons have come in, says Dholki.If the women are lucky, two trains full of grains arrive in a month. We often return disappointed as cement and sand comes in more often. Then, we rummage through dust bins to look for food, says Dholki.Vadodaras railway yard sees wagons bringing in grains for the Food Corporation of India (FCI) as well as private dealers  mostly rice and wheat. Wagons carrying cement, crude oil and other chemical or construction material also arrive here.Women taking away the stock of grain collected by them. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana) Women taking away the stock of grain collected by them. (Express photo by Bhupendra Rana)This week, the wagon that the women gathered around belonged to the FCI. Says Anil Shrivastav, area manager (Baroda), FCI, It is very rare that grains spill out off bags while loading or unloading. Even those that can be retrieved are picked up by our workers as we have to tally the weight from the loading and unloading points. Only those grains that get mixed with impurities are discarded on the tracks.Shrivastav added that there is no fixed schedule for the trains. The grain wagons come in as per the requirement put forth by the state government. The grains are offloaded at Vadodara and stored at the FCIs Chhani godown. On an average, the FCI sees grain wagons coming in every two weeks, he said."
59409d857be9e024e45998a9,Grain Trade: Punjab’s agricultural crisis now consumes arhtiyas,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/grain-trade-punjabs-agricultural-crisis-now-consumes-arhtiyas/,2016-03-24,"Labourers cleaning grain at an arhtiya mandi in Khanna. Gurmeet Singh Labourers cleaning grain at an arhtiya mandi in Khanna. Gurmeet SinghJaspal Setia, 54, committed suicide about four months ago. He wasnt a farmer, but an arhtiya or commission agent at Amritsars Bhagtanwala grain market. The reason for the extreme step was the Rs 2.5 crore or so that he had advanced to farmers and small rice millers (shellers), and couldnt recover.His family was in the arhat business for over six decades. But the stress from the blocked money he just couldnt take. This was more so because these funds which he had lent had been largely borrowed from banks, relatives and businessmen, who were themselves seeking high returns, said Vijay Kalra, president of the Federation of Arhtiya Association, Punjab.Setias isnt an isolated case, even though it might appear unusual in the context of the considerable sway that arhtiyas supposedly wield in Punjabs grain trade. They are the middlemen through whom the Food Corporation of India and other government agencies undertake procurement of wheat and paddy that farmers bring to the states mandis. The arhtiyas are the ones who get the grain that is unloaded into their mandi platforms cleaned and, then, organise its auction. They also arrange for bagging of the grains prior to their being loaded into the trucks of the successful bidders  the buyers are predominantly state agencies. For all these services rendered, they get a commission fee, amounting to 2.5 per cent of the purchase price.The real power of the arhtiyas, however, derives from their direct contact with farmers, to whom they lend for cropping operations as well as meeting other personal needs. Such lending is often conditional upon the farmers delivering the harvesting grain to them. The arhtiyas, thus, earns both from the interest on the advances made and commission fee on the grain mainly supplied to government agencies. Efforts by the Punjab government to procure directly from farmers and credit payments straight into their bank accounts have failed. The reason for it has been farmers own preference to go through these middlemen.But of late, the arhtiya communitys fabled power has seemingly been on the wane, as growing distress among debt-ridden farmers, following successive crop failures and crashing prices, has started affecting its business as well. Not only have many arhtiyas stopped lending to farmers, there are reports of some even resorting to taking their lives due to large irrecoverable advances made from funds borrowed from the market.Ravinder Singh Cheema, vice-chairman of the Punjab Mandi Board, estimates that 250-300 big and medium arhtiyas across the state may have committed suicide in the last 5-6 years. That includes at least half a dozen in just the past six months in Bathindas Bhagta Bhai Ka mandi and grain markets in Amritsar, Khanna, Abohar and Budhlada.We attended their last rites and even met the family members. None wanted to come out in the open and admit to their blocked monies in the market. The reasons for the suicides were hushed up. For them, its a matter of family honour and reputation, he pointed out. The families have all since shut shop, even as court cases are on to recover the outstanding amounts.According to Kalra, arhtiyas flourish only when farmers do well. When there is crop failure, the arhtiya cannot force farmers to return the money. Nor can he go to court because the entire arhat business is based on good faith. And if farmers commit suicide, their monies are gone forever, he noted.Punjab has around 26,000 mandi-licenced arhtiyas controlling the crop of over 11 lakh farmers. Each arhtiya deals with anywhere between 20 to 200 farmers, who go through them mainly for the ease of obtaining advances. Which government bank will lend to me if some emergency crops up in the middle of the night? asked Mohan Singh, a six-acre farmer from Jamsher village in Jalandhar district. He admitted to even borrowing from an arhtiya to repay a bank loan that would otherwise have led to forfeiture of his land.The arhtiyas were traditionally from mercantile communities such as Bania/Marwari and Khatri/Aroras, but the last two decades and more have also seen those from farming backgrounds enter the trade. Anestimated 40 per cent of Punjabs arhtiyas today are Jat Sikhs, who aggregate the produce of their fellow farmers.But the ongoing agricultural crisis, across crops from wheat and basmati paddy to cotton, has considerably pushed back the trade. Only three years back, Khanna mandi, one of Indias biggest grain markets, had 300-plus licenced arhtiyas. That number, according to latest available records available, is down to 240. And even out of those, only around 150 are said to be active arhtiyas.Pawan Kumar, an arhtiya at Khanna with more than two decades of experience, is among those finding the going tough now. Over Rs 5 crore of my money is blocked. With basmati prices flat, I have shellers who have outstandings with me from 2014, he complained.His sentiment is shared by a fellow arhtiya, Varinder Kumar Guddu. My sons have diversified into solvent extraction and flour mill business. Im the only one still doing arhtiya work, but there isnt going to be after me. The blocked monies in the market are only increasing, even while land values of farmers are falling, he observed.Traders reckon that the Khanna market alone has Rs 150 crore of commission agent monies being blocked, with farmers and rice shellers unable to clear their due. A similar situation prevails across other mandis from Jalandhar, Moga and Ferozepur to Amritsar and Gurdaspur.One sign of the changing times is the disengagement of the youth from the arhat trade. Cheema claimed that most arhtiyas one would find today are in the 40 to 70 years age group. The younger generation is simply not willing to adopt this traditional family business.My son has gone to Canada to study and is unlikely to return. My commission agency shop will have to shut down in the event, stated Kamaljit Singh, yet another arhtiya of Khanna, who is owed large sums by farmer and sheller clients. The same story was repeated by Prem Kumar, a Jalandhar-based arhtiya: My son has done engineering and is working with an MNC. He will never join me.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Facebook/file photo)In a case similar to that of Greenpeace activist Priya Pilla, tribal rights activist Gladson Dungdung on Monday claimed he was offloaded from a London-bound Air India flight, citing his passport as an issue.Dungdung was supposed to be on a flight from New Delhi to London where he was going to attend a workshop on Environmental History and Politics of South Asia, to be held at the University of Sussex on May 10.When I went to the immigration officer about one-and-a-half hours before my flight, he first greeted me nicely, asking me about myself. Then he asked me if I was a student. When I said no, I was a researcher, he asked me what was my area of research. As soon as I said human rights, he became alert and excused himself, Dungdung told Indianexpress.com over phone.The officer then started contacting the Air India staff. Dungdung overheard the officer mentioning the word offloading.I asked him why I was being offloaded. He said my passport has been impounded. I reasoned with him that I had surrendered my passport in 2013 and all the formalities were over in that year. I also told him that I had traveled overseas in 2014 and 2015. To this he replied that this was 2016 and that he couldnt do anything, he said.Dungdung was subsequently not allowed to board the flight and had to return to his home in Ranchi. The authorities also seized his passport.Gladson is a tribal rights activist and believes in retaining and increasing the forest cover for the adivasi population as well as for the betterment of the world.There can be no economy without ecology. Are people going to eat iron and money instead of rice and grain, he said.Dungdung has recently authored the book Mission Saranda: A War for Natural Resources in India, which focuses on human rights violations and mining issues in Saranda Forest which houses Indias rich Adivasi cultural heritage.In January 2015, Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai was also offloaded from a flight going to the UK where she was supposed to testify against the UK-based firm Mahaan Coal Limited.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Dipankar Ghose) The Pahari Korbas are one of Indias 75, and Chhattisgarhs seven, particularly vulnerable tribal groups. (Dipankar Ghose)NAYA SAAL? He shakes his head. The words mean nothing to Bhubaneswar. To him, the new year comes at the beginning of the sowing season, when they pray to a tree called the Mahadani Sarna.The 50-year-old has heard of the words though. He has heard of them from the rare doctor or the occasional NGO workers who climb their way up to his small settlement of 22 homes in Baijnathpura village in Surguja district. Often they ask him, and the others of his Pahari Korba tribe, what they want the new year to bring. The Pahari Korbas are one of Indias 75, and Chhattisgarhs seven, particularly vulnerable tribal groups.When visitors come next, Baijnathpura may have an answer. In 2015, construction began for a road till the foot of the hill on which their settlement lies, under the MGNREGA.Over the past two years, teachers have been making their way up, asking parents to send their children to residential schools. Most families now have ration cards. Even if nutrition is still a problem, every family gets rice under a state government scheme, and children are fed by a reasonably regular anganwadi worker.Because of the rice especially, the nature of deaths has changed. Earlier, there were many more because of hunger. Now it is disease and illness, Gangaram Pekra, who heads Choupal, an NGO working for the Pahari Korbas, says.A road will hasten the change, the villagers assert.It could also finally bring what Bhubaneswar has long been hoping for. He points to the pole that stands in front of his hut. Close to a decade ago, Bhubaneswar says, they put the pole up.They put two others in the village. We have 22 homes, and for one year, two of them got electricity. Then one day, the lights went out in those homes as well. Days later, villagers from the plains came and stole all the wires. Somehow we saved the pole, hoping someone would come back. A decade has passed, and there has only been darkness.Bhubaneswar does not seek electricity for any amenities, he says. Here in the jungle, animals keep coming near our settlements. Since five-six years, there have been more and more wild elephants, who crush our huts and fields. Nobody has died but we have come close. Light will help. We can see them coming, and it will keep them away. The first thing we need is electricity, he says.Bisheshwar Singh, also from Choupal, says the needs of the Pahari Korbas are daraavne (frightening) in how basic they are, pointing to the small cement tank that is the source of water for the 22 families. The water has a thin white film of algae on it. Inside are six tadpoles.We clean the tank with our hands, just removing the leaves in it. We refill the water from the stream nearby, but it gets dirty in days, says Aminsai, one of the tribals. The district administration gives them bleaching water, but it was last provided two years ago.The long trek down in the absence of a road means most tribals fall back on quacks in case they fall ill. Gyan, a villager in Baijnathpura, talks of Mandu, who died a fortnight ago. He suffered for a month, and it was only on the last day, when the jadi-booti (herbs) didnt work, that he was taken to a dispensary. He died within hours. Doctor sahib said he had something called TB, Gyan says.Cradling his two-month-old daughter, Gyan talks of the day she was born, at home. The men had all gone out, and there was no way to contact them. There is one phone for a hundred people in Baijnathpura, and it was with Gyan. After she was born, we went to the Mahadevi Sarna and sacrificed five chickens and a goat. She has lived, Gyan says.Chhattisgarh has only 37,472 Pahari Korbas left, scattered across four districts. Gyan, the highest earner in Baijnathpura and the only one with a fixed salary, is a cook in an ashram for tribal students in Birimkela village, down in the plains, and earns Rs 1,200 a month.The others, like Bhubaneswar, are subsistence farmers for half the year. The rest of the time, they sell wood or look for menial labour in fields nearby.Officials have over the years tried to convince Baijnathpura residents to come down to the plains, given the inaccessibility of where they live. But Pekra says the tribe has a deep mistrust of people in the plains.In their culture, land is owned by the community and not individuals. So they never had land in their names and were taken advantage of. Other tribes, which had access to greater education, took the land from the Korbas and got pattas transferred in their name. The Korbas found themselves pushed to the periphery of villages where the infertile soil was. They got increasingly cut off, and receded back into the hills. It is the governments responsibility to reduce that trust deficit, Pekra says.There is also fear of losing their culture and identity to shahari log (people of the town) if they moved. Already, those who can speak Korba bhasha in Baijnathpura are down to three, all of them elders. Everybody else talks Surgujia, a dialect spoken across tribes in the district.Towards the end of the year  his 13th year in office  Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh had announced an 11-point programme for the particularly vulnerable tribal groups such as Pahari Korbas, to be delivered within two years. It included water, housing, electricity, ration cards, health check-ups for each settlement, apart from a transistor, a blanket and an umbrella for each tribal home.The blanket and umbrella, Bhubaneswar says, he already owns. He tells you why the transistor is important. If they gave us a transistor, maybe we would have known that the state government said this But they should give us our electricity first.As lights come on in the plains below, up in the hills in the darkness, Aminsai insists they will never leave their home. Arent there other places in India which have bada bada pahad (big-big hills), and there is still a road, clean water and electricity?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It also put Mizoram in Indias railway map, and became the first step towards taking the railway line farther south so that the capital of Mizoram, Aizawl, finally finds a place in Indias railway map three years later.Mondays train  a commercial freight train comprising 42 wagons laden with food-grain (rice)  left Katakhal station in Assams Hailakandi district in the morning and arrived in Bairabi, where it was ceremonially received by John Rotluangliana, Mizoram minister for transport, food & civil supply and tourism along with other top officials of the state government and railways.Sanctioned way back in 2000 for gauge conversion, the 84.25-km project was completed well within target, Pranav Jyoti Sharma, CPRO at the Northeast Frontier Railway headquarters said. The present success was attributable to the hard work and dedication of Railway engineers whose effort saw completion of the work well within target, he said.For Mizoram, it was a day to rejoice because the railway train has made transportation of essential foodgrains easier, cheaper and safer. Mizoram requires about 40,000 tons of rice per month, which is transported from other states of India by railway as well as road.The Katakhal-Bairabi gauge conversion is part of the Lumding-Silchar project that became operational a few months ago, however travels only two kms inside Mizoram territory. With Mondays BG train to Bairabi, Mizoram becomes the third Northeastern state after Tripura and Manipur to have got BG connectivity during this financial year, CPRO Sharma added. Passenge trains will start plying immediately after the safety inspection got over, he informed.The proposed 51-km track to Sairang, which will be the railhead for capital city Aizawl, would be completed by March 2019, the railway CPRO informed. Imphal, Kohima and Shillong are the other three state capitals in the region which have yet to find place in Indias railway map.The 84.25-km Katakhal-Bairabi line, built at a cost of Rs 326.51 crore, has nine stations in between, these being Algapur, Hailakandi, Monacherra, Lalabazar, Mahamadpur, Katlicherra, Manipur Bagan, Jamira and Ramnathpur, all of which are inside Assam.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

An article published in the Onam special edition of RSS mouthpiece Kesari claimed there was no reference in any mythological scriptures which supports the popular and widely circulated legend that Vamana had sent Mahabali to the netherworld through deceit and the king visits the land annually to meet his subjects.Countering the argument, senior CPI(M) leader and state Health Minister K K Shylaja said Onam was celebrated by all irrespective of caste, creed and religion and the attempt of the RSS was to bring back the bygone upper class hegemony. It was also a part of RSSs agenda to hijack the festival, the minister alleged.According to the popular belief in the state, Mahabalis homecoming in the Malayalam month of Chingam to see his subjects is celebrated as Thiru Onam annually, which falls on September 14 this year. However, the article written by K Unnikrishnan Namboothiri in the RSS magazine argued that Onam was originally celebrated as the birthday of Vamana and not a festivity to mark the homecoming of the demon king.There is no such reference or explanation anywhere in mythology or epics to support the story that Mahabali was pushed to the netherworld by Vamana and he visits the land every year to meet his subjects. Then, how did such a false story become prevalent in Kerala? the article stated. The write-up claimed that Lord Vishnu had actually blessed the demon king and not punished him by pushing into pathala (netherworld).There is no indication in spiritual texts like Bhagavatham or Narayaneeyam or such other authentic books that Bali was pushed to the netherworld. Instead, such texts say that the noble king had emerged victorious in the trial by Vamana and he was blessed by the God, it said. The writer also criticised the general picturisation of Mahabali as a man with moustache, potbelly and wearing an olakkuda (traditional palm leaf umbrella).It is an attempt by some vested interest to distort the mythical stories and paint in poor light the characters of Hindu Puranas, the writer said, adding that such attempts to destroy Hinduism should be checked. According to mythology, Onam is connected with Asura (demon) king Mahabali, under whose reign everyone lived in happiness and equality.Envious by his popularity, Devas (Gods) sought the help of Lord Vishnu to get him banished into the netherworld. But before going down, Mahabali secured a boon from Lord Vishnu to visit his subjects every year on the Thiru Onam day. The demon kings annual visit is celebrated by Keralites, who lay by their front yards with floral carpets, wear new clothes and prepare a sumptuous feast.The RSSs views on Onam have kicked up a debate on the centuries-old beliefs, which have been taught since school days as poems and stories. Kerala minister Shylaja charged that the RSSs argument should be seen as an attempt to trace out the demon king Bali, under whose rule people enjoyed equality and no exploitation.Perhaps, lower caste or Dalit people were portrayed as demons in our mythical stories. Mahabali is considered to be a demon king. So, he represented the downtrodden. The present RSS move is to eliminate the achievements of a Dalit ruler and picturise that the upper class is the supreme, she told PTI.Eminent historian and former chairman of Historical Research Council M G S Narayanan, however, said there were records that Onam was celebrated as Vamana Jayanthi (birthday of Vamana) centuries ago in the state. Mahabali is a mythical character and his story has nothing to do with the history. But, there are historical references that Onam was celebrated as Vamana Jayanthi in the state during early periods, especially during 9-11 century AD, he said.To mark the occasion, mass feast for Brahmin community members were organised in many temples during the time, he said. Unfazed by the controversy, people in the state are all set to celebrate Onam with shopping malls and markets witnessing heavy rush in cities, towns and villages. In a bid to check price of essential commodities, the CPI-M led LDF government has opened 176 special markets across the state.According to official figures, the sale of essential products through the special festival markets has touched Rs 10 crore so far. Serpentine queues before state-run civil supplies and horticorp shops to get provision and vegetables on subsidised rates, have become usual scenes in every nook and cranny of the state.Majority of shops, ranging from malls to small retailers, have announced reduction sales and special offers for various products. The government has also so far distributed around 15 lakh special Onam kits, comprising essential commodities to Below Poverty Line families.The distribution of special kits to tribal families and free rice among school children, announced by the government as Onam gifts is progressing, official sources said. Around five lakh government employees in the state have hit a special bonanza during this festival season as they would get a weeks holiday as Onam, Bakrid and Sree Narayana Guru Jayanthi fall in the same week.The government-sponsored week long Onam festivities would kick start in the state tomorrow. A colourful pageantry will be held here on September 18, marking the culmination of the Onam festivities. Around 70 floats, displaying the cultural legacy of the state, would be paraded through the heart of the capital city during the occasion, the sources added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo)A short pre-monsoon shower might have muddied the ground here this morning, but it has not dampened the BJPs hopes that Prime Minister Narendra Modis rally on Thursday would lead to a revival of the party in coastal Odisha.The AIIMS ground, where Modi will address an estimated 50,000-strong crowd and speak about his governments achievements over the last two years, was cordoned off by police. BJP workers were busy putting up party flags and banners while Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Union Tribal Affairs Minister Jual Oram checked the preparations.Two years ago the PM had promised many things. Tomorrow he will give an account of his achievements, said Pradhan. This will be Modis fourth visit to Odisha in two years.With about 20 per cent vote share and 10 MLAs in the 147-member Odisha Assembly, the BJP is behind the BJD and the Congress. BJP leaders said the party is now aiming at a revival in its pockets of strength, such as Balasore.Balasore elected a BJP MP for three terms between 1998 and 2004. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, BJP candidate for Balasore Pratap Sarangi came second while the partys MLA candidate won in Remuna. In at least two other Assembly seats of Balasore, the BJP finished second.We hope to give the BJD a good contest in next years panchayat polls. That is why tomorrows meeting is important for us. If we do well in panchayat polls, it would lead to the partys revival, said Sarangi.BJD leader Damodar Rout said he did not expect any BJP revival. The party is too weak on the ground to get enthused by a single rally, he said.On the eve of the rally, Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Centre had accepted the Naveen Patnaik governments demand for sending rice and wheat under National Food Security Act in the ratio 85:15.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI photoKarnataka has moved the Supreme Court for urgent hearing on its plea seeking a direction to restrict the quantum of water to be released from River Cauvery to Tamil Nadu, from 15,000 cusecs to 1,000 cusecs.The application filed late Saturday evening has also sought modification of the apex courts September 5 order in which it directed release of 15,000 cusecs of water for 10 days as an immediate relief to Tamil Nadu farmers.Karnatakas decision to move the Supreme Court comes even as the Cauvery Supervisory Committee is meeting in New Delhi on Monday to decide on the quantum of the rivers water to be released to Tamil Nadu and other states.The application has sought that instead of 10 days, the apex court should restrict the flow of water only for 6 days as the state itself was facing distress situation in view of massive agitation and loss of Rs 500 crore per day.When contacted, advocate V N Raghupathy said, We are trying to get the matter listed for an urgent hearing.The early listing of the matter is important as the courts are closed for the next 2 days on account of holiday.In the application, Karnataka has stated that there has been huge public pressure and the state police, with great difficulty, have been able to prevent attempts to damage public property.Even the minimum arrangement mentioned by your lordships has caused distress and havoc in the entire southern part of Karnataka, paralysing civil life. The agitation of farmers has been that their dry crop is equalled with that of the farmers in Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadus need for the rice crop consumes more than twice the water which is needed for light crops in Karnataka the application said.The application has stated that people, particularly farmers in the districts of Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya and Bengaluru, have been squatting on the roads and streets, affecting the IT industry in Bengaluru which earns revenue as income tax, service tax, and foreign exchange of USD 60 billion to the country.The application has also referred to inputs from security agencies that said if the flow of water is allowed to continue further, the situation may go out of hand.The application is likely to be placed before Chief Justice T S Thakur, who is likely to take a call on it and if it all an urgent hearing is required, it will be assigned before a bench, which on September 5 had passed some interim directions.In an interim order on September 5, the court directed Karnataka to release 15,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day to Tamil Nadu for the next 10 days to ameliorate plight of the farmers there.The apex court also directed Tamil Nadu to approach the Supervisory Committee, set up to implement award of Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (CWDT), within three days for the release of Cauvery water as per the final order of the Tribunal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

As a result, the farmers often have to bear with poor returns as both vegetables and fruits are perishable commodities.Expressing serious concerns to tap greater investment in agro-processing sector, the report reveals, Less than 1.2 per cent of fruits and vegetables are processed. Out of the total yield, 60 percent vegetables and 70 per cent fruits are consumed fresh. The huge wastage of vegetables and fruits has a great potential if it is channelised in the processing industry.The states present processing capacity of fruits and vegetable is one lakh metric tonnes (MT). Despite being the leading state in agro-industry, by international standards, Maharashtra appears way below in investment in the processing sector. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who was handed over the NABARD report has urged the agriculture, horticulture, industrial and finance departments to prepare a comprehensive plan to effectively tackle the shortcoming in the processing sector.At the Make in India Week starting in Mumbai from February 13, state government will also try to rope in private investors in the food and horticulture processing industry. Highly placed sources in the government revealed, There are MNCs keen on partnership to open up new gates in the food processing sector. However, state government with the help of the Centre, will have to make huge investments to upgrade its basic infrastructure by creating mammoth cold storages which are easily linked to the farms in remote villages across the state. Some districts which have made mark for processing units include Pune, Kolhapur, Nashik, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Latur, Sindhudurg. .A senior secretary argued, The concept of processing raw agro produce was never on the governments agenda for the last several decades. Gradually, we have realised not only to check the huge wastage but also to turn into a profit making sector.The main crops / fruits available for primary and secondary processing are soyabean, cashew, mango, wheat, rice, jowar, pomegranate. Maharashtra agro-industries are in the sectors of sugar, cotton, rice mills, poultry, flour mills, edible oil, milk processing units.The chief minister reckons that promotion of processing sector would help in giving boost to small and medium scale units. However, public -private partnership to tap higher investments can work to create sustainable value chains by creating more food parks complete with all infrastructure under one umbrella.NABARD report emphasises, The world agriculture trade is shifting towards processed foods and agro processing holds the key for sustainable growth. It emphasised,  Maharashtra which is leading state in agro-industry, has tremendous potential for a much higher value addition through processing. The state produces average 145 lakh MT of food grains, 50 lakh MT of oil seeds, 769 lakh MT sugarcane and 88 lakh bales of cotton. The report suggests ,Fruit pulp, juice and concentrated units, winery, pickles, rice mill, flour mills, Dal mills, soyabean oil extraction and refining units, can be set up in MIDC industrial areas. The report urges the government to involve private sector in agriculture marketing. Moreover, it talks of sustained supply of quality power and water. There is a concern as 75 per cent of farmers rely on informal credit at very high interest rate which leads of increase in cost of production and affects competitiveness.Therefore, it has recommended banks to focus on value chain financing for overall development. The banks should provide working capital to the units, suggested the report.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The state Cabinet had last month approved the move to distribute rice from April one.Though the decision was taken before the model code came into force, it is being implemented during the election period.Office of the Kerala CEO said the state government has not been asked to defer the implementation till elections are over but the issue has only been referred to the committee headed by the Chief Secretary for further consideration.Kerala will go for a single-phase poll on May 16.State Food Minister Anoop Jacob told PTI that if the implementation is delayed, the state will approach the Election Commission as the policy decision was taken much before the model code came into force.Citing a past precedent, he said in 2011, the Kerala High Court had set aside the Chief Electoral Officers order restraining the state government from implementing its decision to extend the scheme to distribute rice at Rs 2 a kg to families of the Above Poverty Line (APL) category subject to certain conditions.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Shubhangi Khapre)Meenakshi Gorantra Penda, 14, will appear for her class-X board exams from the Government Primary and Secondary Tribal School in Permili village of Gadchiroli, where she is a resident student. She is worried that the school has not begun even the first chapter in science with barely three months to go.Vijay Namdeo, preparing for his XII board exams, is struggling with mathematics, as is every other student who has chosen that subject. The school has no teacher for mathematics in class-XII.The ashram shala, or tribal school, in this Naxal-hit district houses some 175 students from classes I to XII. The Maharashtra tribal welfare department has set aside a budget of Rs 1,200 crore for ashram shalas, which are a prominent feature of an integrated tribal policy that the government is working on. Officials said they are providing every possible facility from a central kitchen to uniform and books.There will be no shortage of funds when it comes to providing the best facilities to tribal students, said Minister for Tribal Welfare Vishnu Sawara.However, a senior secretary conceded, mismanagement in tribal residential schools is a fact despite huge funds having been set aside for their functioning. And the reason they are so short of teachers is apparently that qualified teachers are rarely willing to stay in these schools for very long.School authorities at Permili were not willing to come on record. We have good basic infrastructure, said a senior official involved in the management of the school. But the biggest problem is to get teachers who would come regularly and take lessons. The standard of teachers and continuity in covering all subjects has always been a problem here.The Permili school is one of 529 ashram shalas across Maharashtra, aimed at bringing tribal children to mainstream education.Permili is a little village dotted with bamboo and grass huts. The school stands out as a sprawling concrete cement structure. Students come from the interiors of the Naxal belt  Sironcha, Allapalli, Gadchiroli.At the centre of the residential school is a playground. Kanchan Pilvatre of class-VI said food is not a problem. Lunch comprises rice, roti and curry; evening tea includes puffed rice cooked with onions and potatoes along with cooked gram, and dinner is again roti, curry and rice. But what we want is regular lessons, said one girl.Subhash Nana Atram of class-XII said, We have only two teachers, who come and teach Marathi and biology. We have lodged complaints as science students find it difficult to handle physics, chemistry and mathematics.

(Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty) At a cattle camp just outside Ashti town. (Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty)EVERY DAY until he was suspended last week, Babasaheb Tandles working day revolved around counting, one by one, approximately 12,000 animals. Twice over.A graduate employed as talathi of 11 villages in Marathwadas Beed district, Tandle, who uses a crutch to walk, would visit cattle fodder camps being run by contractors on his modified three-wheel scooter, riding approximately 60 km a day. With consecutive seasons crop failure and farmers fodder reserves running low, a key government intervention as Marathwadas drought drags on is the provision of free fodder and water to cattle. The camps, 297 of them, are in operation in Beed, Osmanabad and Latur districts, with 208 in Beed alone.At each of the seven camps assigned to him, Tandle would walk through rows of animals, counting. Talathis say they take approximately half an hour to complete the count at a camp of about 1,500 animals, Tandle likely a little longer. And according to rules, he was to conduct the count twice a day.READ | Drought country faces worst year: Waiting for a drop before dawnOn March 8, Tandle was suspended pending enquiry after a surprise check revealed the number of animals to be inflated at one of his camps. The talathis response was that he had formally intimated the government two months ago that the travelling alongside the additional work of monitoring the governments multiple drought relief measures was proving to be too gruelling for him.Share This Article Related Article Waterless in Marathwada: Wells dry, villages shift to cattle campsWaterless in Marathwada: Wells dry, villages shift to cattle camps Cattle economics: When milk turns sour for parched and singed MarathwadaCattle economics: When milk turns sour for parched and singed Marathwada Unauthorised fodder business thrives in drought-hit areas in MaharashtraUnauthorised fodder business thrives in drought-hit areas in Maharashtra Maharashtra government reverts to village wells to combat drought in MarathwadaMaharashtra government reverts to village wells to combat drought in Marathwada Maharashtra to raise loans to tackle droughtMaharashtra to raise loans to tackle drought Failed crops, parched fields, now Marathwada faces the great thirstTandles miscount is only the tip of the iceberg  with the state government spending several thousand crores on drought relief works, mostly through contract jobs, monitoring these efforts has turned into a seemingly unresolvable tangle.There are now 2,75,961 cattle at the camps. They have to be physically counted, minus any technology, twice a day, while also accounting for farmers who may take their animals in and out during the day. Each large animal is to be fed 15 kg of fodder, again something that the army of talathis is expected to monitor. The talathis, the Revenue Departments lowest-rung staffers, almost all graduates, are expected to hear complaints from farmers at the camps regarding short-feeding or lack of water or poor quality of fodder.The talathis themselves say its unrealistic, and monitoring is abysmal. On an average, one talathi is responsible for four to 10 villages, and has four or five such camps in his area, each with 500 to 2,000 animals. So each talathi counts about 6,000 to 10,000 animals, twice a day, travelling to camps located several km away from one another, mostly using two-wheelers, in 40 degree Celsius temperatures, says P K Rakh, a circle officer in Beed.We cover approximately 50 to 100 km a day travelling from office to various camps and back, says Laxman Dhakne, another talathi. Fuel costs have to be borne ourselves.That there are leakages because perfect monitoring of relief measures seems impossible is now apparent to the district collectors, who are conducting surprise checks and visits.There are other relief works that are even more complex to monitor. Every arrival of the water tanker in every village requires a signed note from the gram sevak, but checks on the 2,189 tanker operators records for 1,632 villages and 598 hamlets in Marathwada can hardly be done every day. MGNREGA works are supposed to be underway everywhere but in village after village, farmers with job cards say works havent begun yet. Foodgrain is being supplied in drought-hit talukas (wheat at Rs 2 a kg and rice at Rs 3 a kg) but only for land-owners. Landless labourers complain bitterly about this.Its a situation where the government is omnipresent, the states presence is everywhere from water supply to food to animal care to labour availability, but there is nobody keeping a real count of whether the really needy are the real beneficiaries, says Amol Jadhav, a resident of Nandurghat village in Beeds Kaij taluka. Nandurghat saw six suicides in the last quarter of 2015 and one suicide this year already. While the Devendra Fadnavis government recently announced Rs 3 lakh for a farm well for the families of suicide victims, the implementation is spotty. I heard about it, but no official has approached me, says Chandrabha Khomne, wife of Kalyan Khomne who committed suicide in a hamlet outside Nandurghat last June. Am I supposed to approach somebody? Who?Meanwhile, the bill for the relief measures keeps rising. According to the states memorandum seeking assistance for drought relief works from the Centre, the government expects to spend Rs 83 crore this year on cattle camps alone, a November 2015 estimate that now appears too low.Rs 50.67 crore was disbursed for Marathwadas cattle camps earlier this month, including Rs 30.44 crore for Beed alone. Yet, cattle camp operators throughout Beed and Osmanabad said their bills were still to be cleared.The relief works are also a political minefield. For example, the large majority of those running cattle camps have political aspirations or, at the very least, affiliations. We certainly get some political mileage out of running camps, says one contractor, a mid-level BJP leader in Ashti. But the more selfish cause for me is that my field gets all this organic fertiliser from cattle dung. At one camp in Kaij, a contractor was providing free meals for the animals owners in addition to the fodder. At a camp in the Dhamangaon area of Ashti, a BJP-affiliated sarpanch was organising weekly kirtan sessions. Its political campaigning at the governments expense, says a local NCP leader in Beed with two camps of his own. Posters and hoardings directing farmers to these chaara chaavnis or fodder camps across Marathwada bear the names and photographs of political leaders of all hues.By the time the summer hits its peak in May, an estimated 3.5 lakh animals will be in the fodder camps. The cattle camps numbers and bills would have risen, the number of tankers would have risen, there will be much more chaos. And our talathis will still be counting animals, said one IAS officer posted in Marathwada.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo by Partha Paul Milan Baidya (centre) is among a hundred officials and 700-odd daily wage labourers who are working to survey the land. Express Photo by Partha PaulIts around noon. The rain has finally stopped, and Milan Baidya gets ready to set out to work again. The 43-year-old technical staff member has been with the West Bengal Land and Land Revenue Department since he was very young. So the work isnt new. But this time, things are different. Its the time-frame, its frantic, Baidya sighs. Looking down at his feet, he adds, At least we now have gumboots.Standing at the edge of what was land earmarked for the Tata Singur project, it is easy to see why the boots matter. Spread across 997 acres, the land once epitomised the dream of a state. Now it is part-swamp, part impenetrable grassland, housing a crumbling factory that never saw any operations  a portrait of a dream deferred.On August 31, the Supreme Court quashed the acquisition of this land in 2006 by the Left Front regime in West Bengal for a Tata Motors plant. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, whose rise to power was partly propelled by the protests she led of farmers here who lost their land, wants the land surveyed by September 14, so that the process of returning plots to respective owners can begin soon. Mamata is planning a rally at Singur that day, to mark the apex court upholding her stand.Its easier said than done.Baidya lists the challenges he and at least a few hundred other officials, ranging from Additional District Magistrate Land Revenue P Maji to non-technical staff, face. In the past 10 years, the fields here have been untended. In most areas, there would be a lot of vegetation by now. This is very fertile land and it means this is now a forest. The place is also full of snakes. The gumboots are for them. We can brave the rain, but not the snakes.Carbolic acid had been poured into the grass to scare the snakes, he adds, but all it had done was chase them away from one end of the land to the other.The nearly thousand acres in contention at Singur had more than 2,000 owners at the time of acquisition. Baidya and others are tasked with returning this carrying a Revenue Department map, wooden stakes to mark out ownership, and the faithful gumboots. This, while taking into account that the ownership of land itself in southern Bengal is typically fractured, with individuals owning islands of land within larger tracts owned by others.Baidyas day starts at 6 am. The abandoned factory has been transformed into temporary barracks for the officials, with some mattresses, covers and thin pillows. Baidya doesnt mind the accommodation, only wishes it had been given a little airing.Lunch is generally rice and fish or egg, while breakfast and evening tiffin have bread and egg, supplemented with pale, sugary tea. Apart from the transformer that the government had set up before 2011 for the Tata factory, a temporary generator has been provided to ensure continuous supply of electricity. Water tankers have been brought in from the district headquarters at Hooghly.Elaborating on the task at hand, Baidya says, If the land was level, the work could have been done in a week. But now, first, the land must be cleared of vegetation. Then, it must be surveyed, and finally ownership recorded and marked. Right now even the first stage is an issue.Almost 3 ft of fly ash had been dumped on the site by Tata Motors to raise the land level. While this has damaged the top soil, making the future of cultivation bleak, it has also made it impossible to work with the heavy harvester machines that the state government dispatched to speed up work.Haradhan Majhi, a farmer and one of the daily-wage labourers employed to operate the harvesters, walks tentatively through the tall grass, towards Baidya. Majhi doesnt have gumboots. The harvester is stuck, he tells Baidya. Someone needs to come and dig around the wheels to get it moving again.One of the 700-odd daily wage labourers working here, Majhi is getting around Rs 200 per day apart from food for the job.Before Majhi starts walking back, Baidya takes off his own gumboots and offers them. While the government has announced that gumboots, gloves and caps would be provided to all workers, there still arent enough to go around. We need to share. This entire work is a long process of sharing, Baidya rationalises.Work goes on from 6 am to 6 pm. Vegetation is chopped, maps are pored over, land marks, buried deep under, are identified and finally, a stake with a piece of paper and number is stuck into the ground. The stake, itself, is unimpressive. But with their task akin to fitting together pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, the sight is thrilling, says an official.After work, Baidya and the others exchange stories sitting at the factory. Talk turns to children, growing expenses, and politics. But, most conversations, Baidya says, are about two things  home and land.The 43-year-old understands both. His village Beraberi is not far, and he lives there with his wife and two children. He is the first in his farming family to have a government job.Nothing is more important for the people here than land, Baidya adds. I was a staunch supporter of the Left before Singur happened. But I couldnt rationalise the way land was snatched away. If I supported them for their land reforms, then today I support Mamata Banerjee for her Singur protest, which is why the work here is so important.At the same time, Baidya underlines the dilemma of parents like him. Giving the example of Majhi, he says, Majhi had land here. I also know he wants industry here. He wants his children to not work in the mud and to have proper jobs. Can you blame him?Baidya himself doesnt see a life in either government offices or fields for his two children  a 12-year-old boy who hates studying, and a 16-year-old girl who is at the top of her class. He hopes they will find work in Kolkata, in private offices, where there are increments and less politics.The other topic that looms in every conversation is Mamatas deadline. A podium being erected in the eastern corner of the land for the CMs rally is a constant reminder.If you dont finish the work, Mamata Banerjee will berate you publicly. Which is why everyone is working so hard, Baidya chuckles, before adding, As am I.But, unlike the others who say it is impossible to finish by September 14 or by even the Supreme Court stipulated time of 12 weeks, Baidya remains hopeful. Everyone knows land is the dream of all those whove lived here and are working here.Somewhere in the background, the harvester is still spluttering desperately in the mud. And the rain has started again.So what happens to a dream deferred? In the case of Singur, nature reclaims it violently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo) The woman at her home in Durg, Chhattisgarh. (Express photo)At 10.30 every morning, she begins her journey on the dusty, rocky, treacherous path that leads from the lake she bathes in to the thatched hut she lives in  a bucket in one hand, wet clothes in the other. At the wooden door, she bends, opening the small lock with a key that hangs around her neck. She cannot see, but 35 years of practice has taught her ways to negotiate the darkness of her world. It is a world into which the Supreme Court on Thursday sent in a ray of light  and the promise of a few material comforts.Its been 20 years now  she was a girl of 17 then  that a man, a friend of her brothers and a constant visitor to their home, began to make advances on her, telling her he loved her, and wanted to marry her. She was reluctant  her sight had abandoned her when she was barely two years old  but he persisted. She gave in finally, but he broke his promise to her  and even though he admitted to their relationship before the village panchayat, he still refused to marry her.A case of rape was filed, and four years ago, the man was sentenced to seven years in prison, her neighbours at the village said. The case went up to the Supreme Court, which on Thursday ordered the Chhattisgarh government to pay her Rs 8,000 a month for life, noting that she now lives entirely alone, and without any support except a PDS scheme that gives citizens 35 kg of rice at Re 1/kg every month, and a Rs-300 physical disability pension.Inside her two-room hut, silence is the womans constant companion. Her mother left the family when she was still small, and her father passed away seven years ago. Her brothers have gone their separate ways.She was a happy child once, recall neighbours, but say that child does not exist any longer. She was blind, but she was happy, constantly playing with her father and two brothers. Her father took care of the family, working on other peoples fields, or doing menial labour. There was never any money, but they had enough to survive, an old neighbour said.But she is now angry and bitter, they say, the fruits of years of neglect and loneliness. They avoid talking to her  She nevers says anything good, and is always angry. Who wants to talk to someone who always abuses you? her nextdoor neighbour said.She reacted to the Supreme Court order not with happiness or relief, but with disbelief  Iss duniya mein kaun aise madad karta hai, she said. Slowly, as she was told by neighbours, who enter her house only when she has visitors, she came around to the possibility. Chalo achha hai, she said, thodi toh sahooliyat hogi. For years I have lived like this.Inside her hut, the walls are bare save for three posters of Durga. A green cup holds a toothbrush and toothpaste. There is no bed or mattress, but a kerosene stove, a wood-fired chulha, and some steel vessels. Food is the rice that the government gives. Sometimes there are vegetables, but mostly not.When my father lived, he used to bring home money and take care of me. My brothers left the house several years ago. Now one brother comes once a week. Normally he brings wood for the chulha. Sometimes he brings a little money, but he too does a menial job, or he brings a little dal and vegetables, she said.I cook on my own. Sometimes my fingers get burnt, but what else is there to do?She is mistrustful of people  she smiles a bit at the thought of being taken to a Nari Niketan, a possibility offered by the state, but is unenthusiastic about the idea of having others around.Yes, things will be better there (at the Nari Niketan). They will give me food, clothes and more pension you say? I will be better. At least I wont have to do everything myself But I dont like being around people. Can they not send me whatever they have to here, in my hut?The fact that the Supreme Court struck down the accuseds appeal means nothing to her. I dont care. Usse marna hai marre, usse jeena hai jiye. God will not forgive him. I only want to live in peace, and a little comfort. Is that too much to ask?Her case has led the Supreme Court to ask all states and Union Territories to formulate a uniform scheme for providing victim compensation in respect of rape/sexual exploitation with the physically handicapped women as required under law, with a rehabilitation model framed by Goa being the benchmark.Yet, as this 37-year-old somehow fires up the chulha at her home, the sparks inches away from her fingers, her neighbours express a fear that betrays just how deep her wounds are. We just hope that when the government people come to tell her what to do, she doesnt turn them away. You have to be patient with her. Bahut varshon ka gussa hai.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Subham Dutta)DEFENDING THE Left Fronts poor performance in the recently held Assembly elections where it won only 32 seats, CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra on Wednesday said had they forged the alliance with Congress earlier, the results would have been different.Had the decision to fight the TMC-sponsored terror unitedly with Congress been taken about eight months or a year ago, the results would surely have been different that what it has been now, Mishra said during the Anil Biswas Memorial lecture here, referring to his claims before elections that the Left-Congress alliance would secure over 200 seats in the Assembly.Pointing out that the Left and Congress had had secured 2.15 crore votes, Mishra said it was it was not a small achievement considering the adversities they faced. People tell me that the Left is losing its relevance here in Bengal. I refer to the 2.15 crore votes in the Assembly elections and say that if the Left is not relevant here, it is not relevant in any part of the world, the CPM state secretary said.Watch Video: Whats making newsHe was quick to point out that no one would be able to distinguish the number of votes secured by Congress and the CPM separately.Mishra reiterated that there was an under-the-table settlement between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress. Whatever the Election Commission claimed, we know what kind of settlement was there between the two, he said.The CPM leader slammed Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for giving out bicycles to schoolchildren and rice at the rate of Rs 2 a kg to people to earn favour. Just before the election, schools went on a vacation and the rice meant for mid-day meals were channelised in this Rs-2 scheme to lure people. Now, after the election results are out, supply of foodgrain at public distribution system outlets have dried up, Mishra said.Alleging that Mamatas gimmicks had swayed voters towards TMC, he said, People who had been momentarily benefitted out of these schemes did not want to bother about where the state was going, as long as they stood to gain something out of it. That is a kind of narcissistic attitude which the ruling party had been exploiting to their benefit. But the mandate doesnt legitimise the instances of corruption that the TMC is into.Mishra also took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and said that he was making tall claims in his speeches during his visit to the United States, via teleprompters. Mamata must be very happy listening to those. While he is saying to the Hindi-speaking population that I can save you if you vote for me, Mamata is saying the same to the Urdu-speaking crowd, Mishra said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

With Kashmir under its longest ever continuous spell of curfew, for many in Old Srinagar City their lives depend on what they can make of that time.Srinagar sees the first light of day at 5.15 am; by 6.30 police and paramilitary personnel are manning every street, lane and bylane of Old City, the separatist stronghold.Sheikh Majid is among those in Fateh Kadal out today at the crack of dawn, leaving with the call for early-morning prayers from mosques. He is counting on finding shops open to stock up on milk, groceries, vegetables and other essentials, but the 28-year-old is almost sure he wont be able to get what is on top of his shopping list today: diapers for his two-year-old boy.Also read | Panel works on alternative to pellets in Kashmir: Balls of pepper, capsicum gasThese are difficult times. We know we have to bear with it. But it is very painful when your baby needs milk or a change of diaper and you feel helpless, says Majid.They (the forces) dont even let patients go to hospitals, claims Nazir Ahmad Bhat, a resident of Nowhatta, whose 15-year-old son isnt feeling well. Before I could tell them we have to go to hospital, they ordered us to go back. When we persisted, they pointed a gun towards us. We returned silently.WATCH: Why Has India Written A Second Letter To Pakistan Stressing Talk On TerrorA curfew pass isnt easy to procure. These are issued by the Srinagar deputy commissioner and generally given only to journalists and those who can get clearance from higher-ups. Even then, the passes are often ignored by the wary men in uniform.Also read | Rajnath by her side, Mehbooba says 5% creating havoc, focus must be on 95%Kashmir in general and Old City or downtown Srinagar in particular have seen long spells of curfew in the past. The Valley was shut for a month after the Hazratbal siege of 1993. In 2008 and 2010, Kashmir witnessed short spells of curfew quite often. But this time, the curfew has already stretched for a month and half without a break in most parts of Kashmir. In Old City, security forces only withdraw in the night for a couple of hours, till dawn.Whether Majid gets what he wants today depends on whether or not police have allowed milk and vegetables into Old City, from villages around. Supplies are allowed during the night, but there are days when police and paramilitary forces close all the entry points and stop milkmen and vegetable sellers.With houses densely packed in Old Srinagar City, including at Fateh Kadal, residents have no space for kitchen gardens, leaving them totally dependent on villages for supplies. That makes this area one of the worst affected in Kashmir in terms of shortage of essential commodities.While Kashmiris are used to stocking essentials, as earlier the Valley would get cut off from the rest of the country for months during winter, that is mostly in the case of rice. Traditionally, we dont like eating pulses during summer, so very few people have pulses in store. And vegetables cannot be stored, says Naseem Ahmad, a resident of Safa Kadal.Besides, he adds, All this happened so quickly that we did not get a chance to store things. We ourselves have enough rice for two months, but there are people who live hand to mouth. For them, life is very difficult.Ashiq Ahmad, a resident of Nawpora Srinagar, says they have changed their diet to mostly rice with vegetables, and sometimes pulses. Among vegetables, we are able to get only kale and a few others produced locally.Meat is a luxury, with mutton, the most widely eaten, almost completely unavailable, and chicken scarce.Usually, I supply around 400 litres milk to people downtown every day, says Abdul Gaffar, who belongs to Maloora village on the outskirts of Srinagar. But this time, police have stopped me near Parimpora (on the outskirts of Srinagar) on many days. They didnt allow me to move forward or to go back, often causing the milk to spoil.WATCH: Why Has India Written A Second Letter To Pakistan Stressing Talk On TerrorMajid says things have turned even more difficult over the past couple of days after curfew was extended to night-time and following the police crackdown on volunteers. We had volunteers who brought in vegetables, pulses and other essentials every evening. They stored the goods in the local mosque, and sold them on a no-profit, no-loss basis. People would go to the mosque early in the morning and buy the things. But then police asked them to stop it, he sayss.Superintendent of Police (SP), North Srinagar, Sajad Khalid refuses to comment on the charges.With the national highway largely closed  shut at night for security reasons and blocked in daytime by protesters  the number of trucks bringing essential supplies to the Valley from outside has also dipped.J&K Minister for Consumer Affairs Choudhary Zulfikar Ali denies there is any shortage. We have adequate supplies, and we have ensured that these continue unhindered, he says.According to the minister, some problems have been created by sporadic incidents of people throwing stones at trucks carrying supplies.However, the ministers figure of 24,000 trucks bringing essential supplies to the Valley since July 9 makes it around 35 per cent compared to normal days. Hizbul commander Burhan Wani was killed on July 8 night, triggering the protests.Excise Department officials say that on an average, around 1,500 trucks entered the Valley every day, or 45,000 trucks a month, before the protests.Having found no diaper today, Majid decides he will wait for the next day morning. While curfew has ensured that the shops remain shut, some shopkeepers have started trading through the backdoor in Old City. Majid hopes to find one such backdoor entry to get a diaper.Its close to 6.30 now. In the distance, police and paramilitary vehicles can be seen driving in. Majid and the others rush back to their homes. Some who are still out are herded inside.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Chandan Bose, the accused in Jawahar Bagh clash, being taken to jail in Mathura on Thursday. PTIRam Vriksh Yadav, the head of the cult outfit Swadhin Bharat Vidhik Satyagrah, had such sway over his followers that continued to live in camps in Jawahar Bagh in Mathura despite being served namak and roti (salt and chapati) and khichdi, alternately as lunch and dinner.The alleged mastermind of the violence on June 2 during police action to evict the squatters, Ram Vriksh had told his followers, who had illegally encroached the public park that police can never attack the camp as they cannot use arms against women and children. The followers who expressed desire to leave the camp for their native homes fearing action from the local administration, were motivated to stay back and told how they can attack the police if they ever raided Jawahar Bagh.These are some of the details that Ram Vrikshs close associate Chandan Bose, who was arrested along with his wife from Basti district Wednesday, revealed during the police interrogation.Bose and his wife were produced in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Thursday, which sent them to 14 days judicial custody. The couple had been on the run after the violence on June 2 saw 29 people, including two police officers and, reportedly, Ram Vriksh, dead.SSP Mathura, Babloo Kumar told The Indian Express that during preliminary interrogation Bose divulged crucial information about the functioning of the camp in the Jawahar Bagh. Bose, who is said to be the second-in-command in the cult outfit, told the police how the followers were assigned different duties in the camp based on the their educational and personal skills.Watch Video: Whats making newsA quack from Buxar, who was also a follower of Jai Gurudev, acted as the doctor in the camp while Bose was handling finances and ration. Those who were skilled in handling arms, used to give shooting training inside the camp while those who had studied management and law were dealing with their respective sections of fund management and legal issues, the SSP said quoting Bose.According to police, Bose told them that there were some 2,500 people living in the camp till June 2, the day when police moved in to evict the area. There used to be a head count of the members every night before they went to bed, Bose told the police.Ram Vriksh used to collect funds to run the camp from the inmates even as many of the rich followers of Jai Gurudev used to donate lakhs of rupees.Bose recalled that recently some from Deoria district donated Rs 10 lakh. But, such big donations came only once in a while. Ram Vriksh used to issue receipts against the donations too, the SSP said.Bose also told the police that those living in the camp were urged to go to their native villages during harvest season and bring back maximum donation of foodgrains. The villagers used to come back with trucks loaded with wheat, rice and sugarcane, the SSP said.The modus operadi of collecting funds was reportedly copied from the Jai Gurudev Trust in Mathura and Pithora.Bose accepted that people in the camp had laptops, mobiles and guns. He, however, could not reveal from where the arms were procured saying that he wasnt in charge of that section.The SSP said that based on Boses interrogation, they now have several leads, which will help them in carrying out the probe.Accused of inciting the violence on June 2, Bose told police that he was a native of West Bengal and had shifted to Ludhiana about 20 years ago. He ran a small garment business and claimed to have came in contact with Ram Vriksh during the latters visit to Ludhiana a few years ago, police said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5940b8467be9e024e459a294,"Cooch Behar: Polls over, former enclave dwellers wait for ration cards, rice",http://indianexpress.com/article/elections-2016/india/india-news-india/west-bengal-elections-cooch-behar-polls-over-ex-enclave-dwellers-wait-for-ration-cards-rice-2794201/,2016-05-11,"Abul Kasem says he doesnt get enough rice to feed his family. Abul Kasem says he doesnt get enough rice to feed his family.WITH polling having concluded in West Bengal, erstwhile enclave dwellers in Cooch Behar have a far more pressing concern  ration cards. Though the administration has promised to issue the ration cards after the election results are declared on May 19, there is uncertainty among the 13,000 former enclave residents here, who were among those granted Indian citizenship after the country ratified the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh last year.The 13,000 people are residents of villages which were Bangladeshi enclaves before they became Indian territory following the agreement.The lack of ration cards makes the new Indians ineligible for the states welfare measures, particularly the du takae chal (rice at Rs 2 per kg) scheme. We have been issued election cards but no ration cards. This means no rice, no kerosene and no milk powder. Those in the camps get them, but we have to still toil on whatever little land we have, said Saddam Hussein (21), a resident of Madhya Moshaldanga, an erstwhile Bangladeshi enclave now in Indian territory. There are large tracts of highly fertile land here and hence rice (the staple in the region) is aplenty; the problem, however, is that most of it is owned by a small group of farmers. And those below the poverty line havent been issued ration cards.Those with ration cards  around 1,000 people lodged at the three camps in Dinhata, Mekliganj and Haldibari (all once residents of Indian enclaves in Bangladesh)  have another grouse: lack of sufficient food. At present, each family is provided with 30 kg of rice.Families with more than five members are given an additional five kg for every extra member. But this policy isnt working out. My family has 14 members. Its the largest in the enclave camps. But according to the present rationing system, I get 75 kg of rice. In Bangladesh, our family consumed almost double the amount, said Abul Kasem (62).While those at the camps have adapted by creating small kitchen gardens  cultivating pumpkins, gourds and beans  the district administration blamed the rice shortage on insufficient planning by the Centre and its inability to understand cultural differences. The average five-member family in urban areas of Bengal consumes about 20 to 30 kg of rice. But in rural areas, particularly Cooch Behar and the adjoining area of Rangpur in Bangladesh, rice is eaten four times a day. Almost everyone is employed in hard labour and rice is the fuel. Eating habits cant change in a day and the Centre has failed to take this into account, said a state official.Then theres unemployment. While some camp residents have been able to find jobs under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the model code of conduct has delayed payments. In addition, resentment from local residents at the new Indians allegedly getting preference has led to increased tension in the area. They dont want us here. That is to be expected. But we have no money. Whatever money we brought with us is close to finishing and its making us desperate. We were promised that our land in Bangladesh would be sold and we would get the money but we have not received a single penny of it. We havent been able to go back and oversee the sale either.Whenever we ask, we are told after the elections, said Jayprakash Roy at the Haldibari camp.After the migration, the new Indians had submitted a detailed list of their land  about 5 sq km in total  to the district administration. The Bangladesh government had in turn promised to buy the land at market prices and ensure that the money is transferred to those who had opted for Indian citizenship. But this is yet to materialise, the residents said.For enclave dwellers on the Indian side, the land issue has become even more pressing as they dont have pattas (land right documents). Many fear that their properties will be gobbled up by land sharks looking to profit from the government-planned development in the area. The Bangladesh government wants to build police stations, roads and hospitals. We havent been given proof that we own the land that has fed us for generations. Already surveyors are trying to take over, said Sunil Ray, a former resident of Mrigpur enclave, now in Bangladesh.The district administration here hopes that all issues will be resolved soon. District magistrate P Ulaganathan said that with polls over, the problems of the enclaves would be accorded top priority. But Trinamool Congress district president, Rabindranath Ghosh, maintained that much of the problems stemmed from bad planning and delays from the Centre. Take funds for instance. They released some of the money almost a year after they were scheduled to. This was all political because the BJP wanted to put us under pressure, he said.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HERE"

Now, similar discrepancies have emerged in the latest list, with one key difference  the word Hindu was missing from its title.The title of the list of 346 names that Singh released last week was Kairana se palayan karne wale Hindu pariwaron ki soochi (List of Hindu families who migrated from Kairana).The list from Kandhla, with just 63 names, was titled Kandhla se palayan karne wale pariwaron ki soochi (List of families who migrated from Kandhla).Watch Video: Whats making newsThe Indian Express checked on names from both lists:Narendra Jain and son Arun Jain are listed as residents of Saravagyan in Kairana.

(Source: Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Empty biryani stalls on the highway at Doha in Mewat, Haryana, on Friday. (Source: Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Remove the biryani vessel, take it inside.The panic is clear on the face of a middle-aged man standing near a makeshift biryani stall on the Delhi-Alwar road at Ferozepur Jhirka in Haryanas Mewat district on Friday. Shaukat Ahmed Qureshi, 17, the stall owner, responds in a flash. He calls out to a friend for help and both hurriedly carry away the large, blackened aluminium vessel to a dhaba across the street.Hiding, moving, and at times even throwing away the biryani, has become a daily ritual for the six remaining food-stall owners on this stretch. Until a month ago, there were 20 of them but things have changed since 25 samples of biryani from these stalls were taken away by local police, based on complaints that cow meat was being used in the preparation.Who complained isnt quite clear.Kuldeep Singh, SP, Mewat, says some called the police station, some walked in. No FIR has been filed in the case, he admits. Still, seven samples of biryani were collected and sent for tests.The reports are yet to come.But fear has clearly gripped the biryani stalls here.In one of the poorest districts in Haryana  with also one of the lowest share of cows in the state  the new law making cow slaughter punishable with jail-terms of up to 10 years and fines of up to Rs 1 lakh this year has hardened the fault-lines and sharpened local rivalries.Over the last month, says Shaukat, at least three vehicles full of policemen from the Ferozepur Jhirka and Nuh thanas have been coming here every day.They throw away our biryani and confiscate our vessels. We have told them several times that we use only buffalo meat, but they are not ready to listen. The last time the team came, they picked out meat pieces from my biryani, packed them in plastic bags and took them away. They havent come back since I am scared, says Shaukat, who has been selling biryani on this road, mostly frequented by truck drivers, since 2002.If we see any vehicle other than a truck, we shut shop and hide, he says.Shaukat and 15 other members of his family depend on the biryani stall for their livelihoods. Like the other vendors, he charges Rs 30 for a plate, and says daily profit is not more than Rs 200-250. Last month, we couldnt sell out our stock for several days. We dont have refrigerators, so we ended up throwing the biryani away. We borrow rice from general stores every week and only have money to pay them after selling for six-seven days. Because of these raids, we have debts to take care of, too, says Shaukat.Like the other biryani vendors, Shaukat belongs to the Qureshi community and hails from Doha village nearby, where at least 50 families have engaged in this trade since 2000. Earlier, there was a factory in the area and all members of our community worked there. But it shut down in 1999 and we switched to the biryani business. Now the government wants to snatch this away, too, says Irfan Qureshi, 22, whose biryani has also been taken in for testing.Most of the vendors have already left, they fear getting arrested. Look around, there is no one, says Irfan, pointing to the empty stalls on the road.This March, the Haryana government enforced the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gau Samvardhan Act 2015. In July, there was a panchayat meeting held in Doha, where all members of the Qureshi community were asked to give up the biryani business.The sarpanch, local police, Meo-Muslims and Hindus from the village attended the meeting. We pleaded told them we have no land, but they insisted we drop the job. This was during Ramzan. Now just before Eid, the chaos has begun again, says Nawab Qureshi, 50, whose family is in the biryani business.We are the poorest community in the village, so it is easy to trample us. Now, our boys are running and hiding from police, the business has taken a huge hit, says Nawab.As per the 2011 Census, Doha has a population of 7,642, of which the majority belong to the Meo-Muslim community. The remaining are Qureshi-Muslims and Hindus.Why cant they do some other job? It is an open secret that they use cow meat in their biryanis. They cant afford chicken or lamb. I am tired of telling them to end this nonsense, says Haji Shah, a Meo-Muslim and one of the complainants, speaking on behalf of his daughter-in-law and sarpanch Rubiya.The Qureshis believe that Shah and members of the Meo-Muslim and Hindu communities in the village have been complaining to police. There are two groups in the village. It is the Qureshis versus the rest, and the sarpanch (referring to Shah) and his men are the masterminds behind this drama. We have been selling biryani for 16 years In the last three months, we have been harassed every day, alleges Nawab.Read | Complaint of beef in biryani, Haryana police to send samples for testingSays Lakshmi Narayan, a resident of Doha, The meat could be either cows or buffalos, we are not sure, but why kill any of them? The Qureshis have been warned time and again, they should have changed their profession by now. Ab jhelo (Suffer now).We only respond to complaints, and the samples from Ferozepur Jhirka were collected based on that. We are yet to receive the report of the tests on the meat, and only after that can we decide on any action. As far as collecting samples from other villages in the area is concerned, we will do so only if someone raises an objection, says Bharti Arora, DIG, who is also the nodal officer of Haryana Polices Cow Protection Task Force.ALSO READ | Beef crackdown in district with low share of Haryanas cattleThe samples of meat picked up from stalls on the Delhi-Alwar road have been sent to the Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences in Hisar. We have received the samples from Ferozepur Jhirka, but the results have not come out yet, says Dr Ashok Malik, PRO at the university.Back on Delhi-Alwar road, while playing hide-and-seek with approaching vehicles, four out of the six stalls have managed to sell their biryani stock by lunch. Though relieved that there were no raids today, the vendors have another complaint: Police seized 22 of our aluminium vessels this month. They should at least return those to us, says Irfan, packing up for the day.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

And Advaniji, who is a mitahari (someone who eats less) would obey her without arguing.When the BJP was in the making, she took care not just of Advaniji, the house and the family, but also handled party leaders, workers and visitors with warmth and love.Those were different days. In the 1960s, 70s and 80s, wives of political leaders contributed silently in the making of the party and its ideology. Kamla bhabhi had a sharp political mind. She was on the same page as her husband and supported him in his ideology. In all six Lok Sabha election campaigns, she joined Dada on the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar campaign trail.

During the Emergency, she handled hundreds of workers and gave moral support to thousands of BJP men and women. When Advaniji was in jail during the Emergency, she would handle party members as well as take the children to the jail to meet their father. Her contribution to the BJP was immense.In their drawing room, there are many photos of the two of them together. In one of them, Kamla bhabhi can be seen chiding Dada. Advaniji would often point to the photo and say, You very well know who rules my home.I first met her in 1984, but became a member of their close-knit family in 1989. She was like a mother to me. In 1992, I had given my 89, South Avenue quarters to Kirti Azad to fight the elections in Delhi. When Kamla bhabhi came to know about it, she called me to say I should stay at their home. I was travelling abroad at the time. When I arrived with my baggage, she treated me like her own son Jayant. Some bottles of perfume that I had bought from abroad were broken; she cleaned up my bag and gave my clothes for washing. She also ensured I got food that would suit my Gujarati taste, complete with papad, rice and onion salad. I stayed for a month but she never got tired of guests.Advaniji is fakir-like in real life.

59419c9a7be9e0192d33ab40,I finally saw why running makes my daughter so happy: Parents of sprinter Dutee Chand,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/south-asian-games-guwahati-parents-of-sprinter-dutee-chand/,2016-02-13,"Dutee with her parents and sister. (Express photo) Dutee with her parents and sister. (Express photo)Standing next to each other at one end of the Indira Gandhi Athletics Stadium in Sarusajai were two cotton weavers, a mother and a father, modestly dressed, wearing chappals and looking lost. They had travelled all the way to the outskirts of Guwahati from Chaka Gopalpur, a village in Odishas Jajpur, to witness  for the first time  what their daughter Dutee Chand did for a living.The train journey from Bhubaneswar to Kolkata and onward to Guwahati marked the first time Chakradar and Akkaji, who earn less than Rs 500 a week, had travelled beyond the state capital. They carried with them, in a jhola, home-made rice cakes, Dutees favourite food, and prasad from a temple in their village.The stadium with floodlights, the announcers booming voice blaring through the speakers, stands teeming with spectators and a large number of security personnel made them uneasy until they saw in the distance the familiar figure of Dutee, at the starting blocks for the 200 metres final.Dutee would have been tense, too. The presence of her parents at the venue must have been reassuring. The ongoing South Asian Games was her first international event after the ban that kept her away from track for close to a year.It was a traumatic period for the confused sprinter. More so, because the athletics world, committed to providing a level-playing field, wasnt sensitive to such cases. But Dutee didnt give up until the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) declared void the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) guidelines that debar athletes with hyperandrogenism  deemed excessive but naturally occurring testosterone  from competing in the female category. For the weaver couple from Jajpur, the issue was too complex to understand. Now, watching their daughter on the starting block, they knew the nightmare was over.When the fans cheered as Dutee and her statemate Srabani Nanda, the winner of the race, crossed the finish line ahead of Sri Lankas Rumeshika Ratnayake, Akkaji held her husbands hand as tears of joy rolled down her face.Saraswati Chand, Dutees older sister who accompanied her old parents to Guwahati, says she had to hold back her tears as the family embraced Dutee after the race.Dutee experienced similar emotions. It was a heart-warming moment for the family. My parents had never seen me participate in a competition, even at the state level. I won a silver and bronze (100 metres) but knowing that they were at the stadium makes me feel like I won gold, said Dutee.Saraswati, a former athlete, took the decision to bring her parents to Guwahati. After Dutee made a comeback after her ban was overturned, my parents wanted to watch her in at least one race. I decided to bring them for the South Asian Games because it is a rare opportunity for them to see Dutee run against international athletes, she said.Akkaji and Chakradar had seen pictures in newspapers of Dutee with medals hanging around her neck and had been invited to felicitation functions in Bhubaneswar. The closest they got to seeing their daughter run was when she would dart across the banks for the Brahmani river as a young girl.A day after watching Dutee live, Akkaji recalls the hurtful questions the family had to face. I could not understand why Dutee was disallowed from running with other females. It was a huge relief when she was allowed to run again. For the first time during this visit to Guwahati, I saw why running makes my daughter so happy, said Akkaji.Before heading to the stadium, the family which stayed at a city hotel, went to the Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati and prayed for Dutee to win a medal.Now, I can tell everyone in our village that I have seen Dutee run. The whole world was talking about Dutee and as her parents it was our dream to watch her run. I never imagined she could run so fast, said Akkaji.On Friday morning, Dutees parents and sister took a train back to Kolkata from where they will board another one to Bhubaneswar. Dutee was on a plane to New Delhi with the Indian athletics contingent. As the family headed in different directions from the South Asian Games, they knew they would never forget the floodlit evening in Guwahati.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express photo) At least 32 children were admitted to the Kapurthala civil hospital on Tuesday. (Express photo)A DAY after the death of two children at Sukhjit Ashram, a government-run home for mentally retarded children in Kapurthala, there was a flurry of activity. The District Social Welfare Officer (DSSO), who held additional charge of the Ashrams superintendent, was placed under suspension while attendant Veena Rani was chargesheeted for accepting and distributing the donated food to the children.Also, Kiranpreet Kaur, the superintendent from Amritsar home for mentally challenged, was transferred to Kapurthala Ashram, which did not have any permanent superintendent for the past over two years.Two teams from Chandigarh  one comprising the director, Punjab Social Welfare Department, Gurloveleen Singh Sidhu, and the other one having the chairman of Punjab State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, Sukesh Kalia, and the commission secretary, Sumer Singh Gujjar  visited the Ashram on Wednesday.While Sidhu and Kapurthala Deputy Commissioner Jaskiran Singh interacted with the media, the other team met the DC to discuss the matter.All the 30 children were stillunder treatment at the local civil hospital. The DC said they would be taken to the newly built rooms of the ashram building where whitewash was started on Wednesday.Sources said that donated food was accepted at the Ashram for two days  Saturday and Sunday  in violation of written orders of the Kapurthala DC. However, no entry was made in the register about the persons who had donated the cooked food.Hospital sources said that the children died due to suspected food poisoning and their windpipes being choked because of vomiting.The cremation of both the children was held on Wednesday. However, the body of Jyoti, 15, was not accepted by her relatives when the ashram staff contacted them.Sidhu said that as per law, the cooked food from outside cannot be accepted but the norms were flouted by DSSO Gurbarag Lal. That is why he had been placed under suspension and attendant Veena Rani was chargesheeted because she accepted the food and then distributed it to the children.He said that a magisterial inquiry was going on and if anyone else was found guilty, they would be brought to book.Asserting that further action would be taken after the inquiry report, the DC said that only fruits and raw food items like pulses, rice and milk are accepted but not cooked one at the Ashram. Only a registered organisation with prior permission can distribute the food inside, that too after being first checked by the superintendent and the attendants.Kalia said the home was in a bad shape and he would make recommendations for better administration of the home. The commission has directed the district administration to get the home cleaned, the entire building painted and also directed the authorities to put up a noticeboard mentioning in bold letters that outside food is not allowed inside the Ashram.Staff shortageCurrently, there are six staff members at the Ashram  a teacher, two attendants, a cook, one sweeper and one chowkidar. DC Jaskiran Singh said they needed at least 11 staff members  a permanent superintendent, two cooks, two full-time attendants, three chowkidars and three sweepers. He said he had written to the social welfare department over six months ago in this regard but no action was taken.Sweeper Asha Rani said the Ashram has just one cook, Kulbir Kaur, and if she goes on leave, then attendant Veena Rani used to cook food for children.Unhygienic conditionsA visit to the Ashram revealed a sorry state of affairs. There is wild vegetation inside the boundary wall of the home. Even the parks meant for these children are surrounded by high grass all around, and the rooms where they put up are in pathetic condition and stinking badly. In one room, meant for two, around six-seven children are adjusted under a fan in this scorching heat.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
59419dbd7be9e0192d33abb1,"GI certification: Madhya Pradesh demand to grow basmati opens a Pandora’s Box, both economically and politically",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/geographical-indication-battle-over-basmati/,2016-08-25,"Basmati farmer Krishnakumar Tomar at his field in Badi, Raisen district. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) Basmati farmer Krishnakumar Tomar at his field in Badi, Raisen district. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)When Krishnakumar Tomar, one of the first to grow basmati in this fertile belt, harvested his crop 14 years back, he had no idea where to sell it. With no local takers for the aromatic paddy, the 40-year-old from Badi, which falls in Raisen district, was told he could get a good price for it at Delhis Narela mandi or Kota in Rajasthan, both many hundred kilometers away.I wondered whether it was worth the trouble going all the way there, recalls Tomar. The long road journey to Narela may only have further sowed seeds of doubt over his decision to switch from growing regular high-yielding paddy.But today, basmati is my main crop, declares this science graduate, who grows Pusa Basmati-1 (PB-1), a variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi, on his entire 35-acres farmland. He devotes more resources and attention to it than even wheat, which is cultivated during the rabi winter season and sold to government agencies at the official minimum support price (MSP).Tomar used to previously cultivate paddy varieties such as Mahamaya and Kranti, which gave yields of up to 30 quintals per acre. PB-1 yields are lower at 18-22 per acre. The difference, however, is in prices.Ten years ago, ordinary paddy sold at Rs 600 per quintal. Even today, the governments MSP is only Rs 1,470. In basmati, prices rose as high as Rs 3,900 per quintal in 2013. They have fallen since to Rs 2,000, but are still more than that of non-basmati, he points out.Tomar is among the many farmers in this area  having assured irrigation, thanks to the Barna Dam completed in the late 1970s  who have stopped planting regular paddy or soyabean in the kharif season. They have prospered by switching to a crop that is now a bone of contention between Madhya Pradesh (MP) and the northern states led by Punjab and Haryana.All the three are, incidentally, ruled by the BJP either by itself or in alliance.At the heart of the dispute is MP staking claim for inclusion of 13 of its districts  from Morena, Bhind, Sheopur, Gwalior, Datia, Shivpuri and Guna in the north to Vidisha, Raisen, Sehore, Hoshangabad, Narsinghpur and Jabalpur in the central-south  in the Geographical Indication (GI) area officially demarcated for basmati cultivation.As of now, only seven states in the Indo-Gangetic plains on the foothills of the Himalayas  Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, West Uttar Pradesh and two districts of Jammu & Kashmir  have been granted GI certification rights for growing basmati.The states that have been issued the GI tag  mainly millers and farmers in Punjab and Haryana  are vociferously opposed to extending the same to MP. Their contention is that the state neither has a history nor the specific agro-climatic conditions suitable for basmati cultivation.But for farmers here, basmati is what has brought them prosperity that was non-existent till a decade ago. Tomar may have, then, struggled to dispose of his crop. But that changed with the entry of millers, who sensed an opportunity to procure basmati from MP at rates lower than what it cost in the traditional northern belt.LT Foods Limited was the first mover. The company, which sells basmati rice under the well-known Daawat brand, went on to establish a state-of-the-art plant in 2006 at Mandideep, about 20 km from Bhopal. In no time, many others also moved in. They included S.S.A International and Narmada Cereals Pvt. Ltd, which have also set up milling facilities at Mandideep, technically in Raisen district.There is no dearth of buyers for basmati, unlike wheat, where we are entirely dependent on the government. Nor do we have to go to any procurement centre to sell, as the company agents come to us directly to purchase from our doorstep. And the basmati crop does not fail from less or more rains, which is not so with soyabean, notes Sunil Sharma.This 40-acre farmer, also from Badi, took to basmati after seeing Punjabi Jat Sikh farmers settled in the region growing it.The Class XI-pass Sharma owns a Mahindra Bolero SUV, while his friend and fellow-farmer Mukesh Chouhan drives a Scorpio.Many people in these parts have purchased four-wheelers and even property 100 km away in Bhopal. It is all only due to basmati. Yes, prices had shot up to Rs 4,000/quintal three years ago and are now half of that. But things are still better than 10 years ago, when we did not even have our own tractors, he points out.These farmers are equally clear that they cannot be denied the right to cultivate basmati, in the name of GI protection. We did not oppose their getting the GI, why should they oppose ours, then? Punjab is, no doubt, the leader in agriculture, but we are trying to catch up. Whats wrong in that? retorts Sharma.The primary argument of the northern millers and farmers  supported by the scientific community and bodies like APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority)  is that MP never had any tradition of basmati cultivation, a prerequisite for grant of GI. They started growing basmati only from the start of this century. All this pressure to include MP is for just helping one company, said a Delhi-based miller, while alluding to LT Foods.The company, however, denies the charge of the MP government fighting a proxy war on its behalf. We buy less than 15 per cent of the states total basmati paddy production. The rest is bought by many others, including millers and traders in North India, says Rajinder Wadhawan, Director (Operations) at LT Foods.MPs farmers are the ones who would be affected the most, in the event of the state government losing the GI battle, he adds.According to Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary (Agriculture) in the MP government, the state has submitted evidence, including documents and publications dating back to the British era, to prove that basmati was being cultivated in the relevant districts long enough to warrant a GI tag.That evidence was, however, not accepted by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board, which, in an order on February 5, directed the MP government to file additional evidence. The latter has since challenged the order and the matter is currently before the Madras High Court.All this wrangling comes even as basmati exports from India have shown a decline in the last couple of years, after posting a more than ten-fold jump to over Rs 29,000 crore between 2006-07 and 2013-14.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Now, similar discrepancies have emerged in the latest list, with one key difference  the word Hindu was missing from its title.The title of the list of 346 names that Singh released last week was Kairana se palayan karne wale Hindu pariwaron ki soochi (List of Hindu families who migrated from Kairana).Watch Video: Whats making newsThe list from Kandhla, with just 63 names, was titled Kandhla se palayan karne wale pariwaron ki soochi (List of families who migrated from Kandhla).The Indian Express checked on names from both lists:* Narendra Jain and son Arun Jain are listed as residents of Saravagyan in Kairana. Srimander Jain, Narendras brother, said, Narendra moved to Muzaffarnagar around ten years ago. His son is a contractor who moved to Delhi over five years ago for better business opportunities. They have houses here. Srimander said Narendras family ran a few shops in Kairanas Chowk Bazar area but moved out due to alleged harassment from street vendors and hawkers.* Amod Jain, listed as the son of Roopchand Jain and a resident of Saravagyan, died around five years ago. Amit Choudhary, who bought Jains house in 2000, said he had moved out 16 years ago. His son has been running a business in Delhi since 1995 and they own a house in Pitampura, he said.* Jagdish Jain, listed as a resident of Saravagyan, was living on rent in Amod Jains house.

(Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh) Farmer Pavitar Pal Singh at his basmati field near Ludhiana. (Express Photo: Gurmeet Singh)Kulwinder Singhs family in Kohali, a village in Amritsar districts Chogawan block barely 20 km from the India-Pakistan border, has been growing basmati paddy right from the time of Partition. Kohali, like all other villages in Punjab, falls under the Geographical Indication (GI) area, where paddy bearing the appellation basmati can be exclusively cultivated as of now.It is our heritage. How can we allow any adulteration or dilution in that? is Singhs instant reply, when asked about adding Madhya Pradesh (MP) to the list of states eligible to be issued the GI tag for basmati cultivation.Singh grows basmati on his entire 60-acre holding. That includes 55 acres under Pusa-1121 and the balance 5 acres under Basmati-386, a traditional tall cultivar yielding only 8-10 quintals per acre, as against 18-20 quintals for the former improved variety bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi.Kohali village itself has over 10,000 acres of farmland, much of it planted to basmati during the kharif season. We do the transplanting between mid-June and mid-July and the crop is harvested from mid-October to mid-November, just before the onset of winter. The cool weather at this time, specific to the agro-climatic conditions of our area, is what contributes to basmatis unique aroma. It is a Gods Gift that nobody can take away from us, avers Singh.For farmers like him, the primary concern is basmati losing its premium tag that could lead to a beating down of prices. Last year, Singh was able to realise only Rs 2,000-2,200 per quintal for Pusa-1121 and Rs 2,500-2,600 for the Basmati-386 paddy that he sold, compared to their respective rates of Rs 3,600-4,000 and up to Rs 5,000/quintal fetched during 2013-14.Lower prices have also been a reason for the basmati area in Punjab registering a decline to 4.94 lakh hectares (lh) this time, from 7.63 lh in 2015. This has happened despite overall sowing of paddy  which includes non-basmati parmal varieties, mostly procured by state agencies  rising from 29.75 lh to 30.10 lh.Punjabs basmati-growing belt is concentrated in about two-dozen agricultural blocks  each covering 40-80 villages  of Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Pathankot. These four districts along the Indo-Pak border produce over half of the states basmati, with Hoshiarpur, which lies in the foothills of the Shivalik range, being the other major grower. Punjab is estimated to account for roughly 50 per cent of Indias annual basmati rice exports of four million tonnes.Farmers in the main basmati belt of Punjab have not significantly reduced basmati acreage, in spite of falling realisations. Amritsar district, for instance, has a total agricultural area of 1.80 lh, of which 1.35 lh was planted to basmati in 2015. That figure has only marginally come down to 1.15 lh this year.We dont know about any crop other than basmati, states Manwinder Singh, an MSc in horticulture, who grows only Pusa-1121 on his 15 acres land in Lopoke. This village, in the same Chogawan block of Amritsar and just 8 km from the border, has over 80 per cent area dedicated to basmati. It used to be 100 per cent two years ago. But this time, some farmers have planted parmal in some portions because of lower price risk and assured government procurement for such paddy, he adds.Pavitar Pal Singh Pangli, president of the Borlaug Farmers Association for South Asia, claims that undivided Punjab  which, apart from the province in todays Pakistan, also covered Haryana and Himachal Pradesh  was from where basmati originated.It is unfortunate that Punjabs monopoly over basmati  having to do with grain aroma and size traits linked to the soil and climatic characteristics specific to the foothills of the Himalayas in the Indo-Gangetic plains  is being challenged within our own country. If MP is going to get the GI tag, the time will not be far off for Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu to also be issued the same, says this farmer, who grows basmati in 10 out of his 45-acre holding in Panglian village of Ludhiana district/block.Pangli warns that the ultimate beneficiary from all this would be Pakistan: The fact that the quality of grain from MP or the southern states is not of the best quality may cause reputational damage to our product in the international market. Pakistan will, then, lay claim to being the sole producer of authentic basmati.His views are also shared by scientists and basmati miller-exporters in Punjab. It is in the national interest to protect our monopoly over basmati, by ensuring that rice grown outside a clearly delineated GI area is not sold as basmati. Once the GI tag is given to more regions, you are basically opening the flood-gates, which will effectively end that monopoly, notes GS Mangat, senior rice breeder at the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana.The loser here will, of course, be the Punjab farmer. A repeat of last years low prices, even with shrinkage in planted area this time, will be a real disaster, points out MS Sidhu, a senior agro-economist at PAU.According to Sumit Mahant of Mahant Overseas, an Amritsar-based exporter, Punjab and Haryana have huge stakes in both cultivation as well as processing of basmati. To extend GI tag to areas that traditionally never grew basmati would spell doom for Indias basmati exports, as we will simply lose consumers in discerning markets such as Europe, England, US or Canada. And what will happen to all the investments the industry has made here? he asks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
