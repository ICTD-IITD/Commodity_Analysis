The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive.The spread of basmati cultivation, beyond its traditional confines of undivided pre-Partition Punjab, Jammu, West Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, can be put down to a single phenomenon: Advances in crop breeding.The traditional tall basmati varieties like Taraori, Type-3 (Dehradooni), Basmati-386 and Basmati-370 were photoperiod-sensitive. They needed a short day length for flowering; the plants would simply not produce flowers until the sunshine hours fell to 12 or less.That condition was available from end-September  when the kharif paddy crop should normally commence flowering  only in the north/northwest parts of the subcontinent on either side of the Indus River. In central and southern India, the day length was 14 hours or more through October. These areas couldnt, therefore, grow or at least had no recorded history of farming basmati in contiguous stretches.This changed, though, with the release of improved basmati varieties from the late 1980s. These strains  especially Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509, bred by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI)  were not just high-yielding, but also relatively less sensitive to photoperiod or day length variations, giving more planting time flexibility. Since they could flower even when sunshine hours were long, farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh could now grow them.But as AK Singh, head of the Division of Genetics at IARI, points out, the grains from the basmati paddy cultivated in the non-traditional belts have quality issues. Basmati rices most distinctive trait  apart from long kernel length, linear elongation on cooking, and fluffiness  lies in its aroma, which, in turn, derives from a compound called 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline. The accumulation of this highly volatile compound in the grain, contributing to basmatis characteristic fragrance, is largely a function of environmental conditions.The retention of aroma, courtesy 2-Acetyl-1-Pyrroline, is best when the flowering and grain-filling phase coincides with a cool climate, with temperatures below 30 degree Celsius during daytime and just over 20 degrees at night. These conditions are, again, obtained during October only in the traditional basmati belt.Moreover, it isnt aroma alone. Higher temperatures during the roughly one-month period from flowering to maturity can also affect the texture and milling quality of the grain. When temperatures are high at the time of grain-filling, the packing of the starch granules in the rice tends to be loose. So, you get grains with more chalkiness (opaque areas caused by incomplete filling) and resulting in higher percentage of broken rice during milling, explains Singh.What all this means is that Pusa-1121 basmati can well be grown in MP or Maharashtra. But the aroma, appearance and milling quality of the grain produced from there cannot really match what one would get from the basmati grown in Amritsar, Karnal, Kathua, Kangra or Dehradun. The cooler climate during the critical crop maturity and grain-filling period in those parts cannot possibly be replicated elsewhere. And theres little even plant breeding science can do about it.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational image) Across Marathwada, 683 farmers have committed suicide from January 1 to August 15 this year. (Representational image)A YEAR ago, the Maharashtra government selected Osmanabad for a zero-suicide district plan that aimed to check suicides by farmers.Since then, the number of such suicides has in fact gone up by over a fourth  from 136 between August 2014 and August 2015, to 172 between August 2015 and August 2016, according to officials at the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate that keeps tracks of suicides in the eight districts of Marathwada region.Across Marathwada, 683 farmers have committed suicide from January 1 to August 15 this year. This is higher by a fifth than the number of suicides in the corresponding period last year, when 574 farmers had committed suicide.Osmanabad district collector Prashant Narnaware conceded that the district administration has not been able to check suicides as planned.But I will not say that the efforts have failed completely. The figure of suicides would have been higher but our concerted efforts have helped in saving several lives, said Narnaware, who was recently honoured by the government as an outstanding collector. And officials in the Chief Ministers Office said plans are in place and will take time to show results.These plans include loans, aids and counselling against suicide.The district administration set up committees in all 730 villages, each headed by the sarpanch who was given Rs 1 lakh and who was supposed to identify distressed farmers for immediate small loans. We will have to find out whether these committees did the job properly, Narnaware said.Under the scheme, Rs 1.5 crore each was given to the agriculture and animal husbandry departments. The agriculture department was supposed to identify farmer groups that were doing well, connect them to the distressed farmers, and set up a revolving fund for farmers in the group. The animal husbandry department was tasked with encouraging poultry farming, Narnaware said.Officials said they distributed crop insurance of nearly Rs 500 crore. From this year, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has been launched. From August 2015, the government started providing wheat at Rs 2 a kg and rice at Rs 3 a kg to farmer families.Suicides have become a chronic problem, Narnaware admitted. For instance, the harassment of farmers by moneylenders continues to be the biggest challenge. Though only 90 moneylenders are registered, the figure is much higher. We get to know about unauthorised moneylenders only when a dispute comes up.Ram Jeevan Bondhar, president of the Marathwada unit of the farmers organisation Shetkari Sanghatna, said suicides continue because of the failure of the government to take its schemes to the doorstep of farmers. It has come to light that 300 farmers in Kalamb taluka of Osmanabad have not received crop insurance. It reflects government apathy, Bondhar said.The Maharashtra Congress said the failure of the government shows it has no clue how to handle the crisis. They make big announcements sitting in Mumbai or going to Delhi. But at the ground level, they are zero which is proved by what has happened in Osmanabad, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant. We can understand 20 o30 30 suicides taking place in a zero suicide district. But the staggering figure of over 100 speaks of a complete failure.When The Indian Express approached the CMO, officials said they would update the CM on the figures. The efforts taken will take time to show results, one official said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Dipankar Ghose) Digging a well in Pipantola in Chhattisgarhs Kabirdham district, home to the Baiga tribe. (Source: Express photo by Dipankar Ghose)The Sun singes their bodies, squabbles break out, so does laughter. Some are old, their foreheads wrinkled, some are just school children. Theres no contractor, no official, no one to supervise. But all that doesnt matter. Facing a crippling drought, the villagers of Pipantola are digging their own well.Go to the small river. You will know what a drought means for us, said one of them. Pipantola, on one of the many hills that dot Chhattisgarhs Kabirdham district, is a village of Baigas, one of the seven primitive tribes in Chhattisgarh, classified by the government as protected vulnerable tribes, with a combined population of less than 72,000.And a decade ago, a drought like this would have meant starvation deaths in villages like Pipantola and Sindurkhar nearby. Yet so far, there has been none, thanks to the will of the people and a state government scheme that ensures every tribal family gets 35 kg of rice a month.In Pipantola, for instance, the chhoti nadi that sustains life is a stagnant pool of water, coated white with a pungent odour. It is here that clothes and utensils are cleaned, baths taken, water consumed.We are digging the well because we will not survive another summer like this, said Jugti Bai, washing her clothes in the pool, her famished cattle wandering nearby.This is a small Baiga hamlet, and the Agar river was enough for everyone in the village. This year, for the first time, the stream from the river has completely dried up, and the pool has become stagnant and dirty. So I convinced them not to wait for the government and build their own well, said Naresh Bunkar, a social activist working for tribal rights in the region.In two months, we have dug halfway, but theres more to go. Everyday, every family of the village works. An NGO I work with, Goonj, has promised them clothes in return for the work, he said.Ten kilometres uphill from Pipantola is the larger Sindurkhar, with at least 50 Baiga families making up around 30 per cent of the population. Much like Pipantola, every Baiga family here is engaged in farming, but only to sustain themselves.Every year, the families plant small crops such as sikia, maria, kodokutki (all millets) and, sometimes, jowar and bajram, so our families can eat through the year. The soil is infertile and rocky, and our crop is not of high quality, so we cant sell. But this year, there was no rain, and all of it has failed, said Samaru Baiga, from Sindurkhar.In Samarus hut, there are two bowls of food for the day. One is a bowl of rice in a pool of water, the other contains leaves of charrota, a plant, stirred in oil. Every day for the past few months, there has been nothing else.Samarus neighbour Sukrat Das Manikpuri, an OBC whom the Baigas often turn to for advice, says even the 35 kg of rice from the government often falls short. Everything has to be rationed because most Baiga families have four to five children, some even eight or nine. There are always too many to feed without any crop at all, and given the dependence on rice, there is a problem. Besides, there is absolutely no nutrition in our bodies. We need the government to give us pulses, he said.Nayan Singh Baiga, for instance, has a wife, mother, and four children to support  the rice ran out in the middle of April. Now they eat khanda, or discarded rice husk, that sells in the closest town at Rs 20 per kg. In his hut, his mother sifts through the white khanda. We have to remove the stones, she said. But try as she might, the small stones remain.We are now beginning to have stomach problems, and the doctor has said our systems cannot digest these small stones. But what else can we do? The forests once had so much produce harra, bahera, amla. But their acquisition has seen all of those disappear. Only the sal remains now, said Manikpuri. Harra and bahera are fruits and leaves of trees found in the region and considered to have medicinal properties.Villagers in Sindurkhar say there have been attempts by the state government to provide drinking water. In fact, the Agar river, which flows about a kilometre away, leads to an embankment where a pump house, a well and underground pipes are connected to six tanks set up under the Nal Jal Yojana.But the problem, especially during summers, is that the taps only work for ten days a month. Every month, the administration sends up trucks of diesel for the motor but that only lasts for so much time. For the rest, we have to go to the river. This summer, the water is dirty, shallow and stagnant, said Mangal Baiga.The other government initiative in the village is the setting up of handpumps. But the hills are mineral rich and the water polluted. As proof, Mangal Baiga fills a plastic bottle at the pump. For the first few minutes, the water is clear. In half an hour, it turns yellow, with red sediments at the bottom.We dont know what is in the water. They gave us a purifier once for a handpump but that couldnt take the load. We only know that we cannot drink, wash or bathe with this water, he said.The residents of Sindurkhar are not entirely angry with the administration, though. Last week, government officials visited and promised drought relief compensation to those who held land under the Forest Rights Act. Of the 60 registered, around ten were given compensation amounting to Rs 1,000 per acre, villagers say.But at least there is rice, a primary health centre, and a school. Most importantly, they have been connected to the plains when they brought a road. In other places, there is not even this much, said Naresh Bunkar, the activist.But then, he added, a drought means they will need more than bare basics.Meanwhile, the villagers of Pipantola, Sindurkhar and other villages with a Baiga population hope that the rains will arrive soon, the Agar will rise, crops sown and the water clean.They say that the government officials who visited last week told them that the rainfall expected this time was close to normal. And yet, Nachkar Baiga of Pipantola cant help but ask: What if the rains dont come?WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) An opium farmer whose crop has been ploughed back into his field using rotavator. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current crisis in agriculture seems to have spared none  not even those engaged in legal cultivation of opium poppy.Extreme moisture stress from a failed monsoon and lack of winter rains have led to an unprecedented 95 per cent of the 19,651 licenced opium growers in Madhya Pradeshs (MP) three northeast districts of Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam to seek destruction of their crop this year. The reason: expected yields falling below the minimum 58 kg per hectare level stipulated by the Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) under the Union finance ministry.The CBN, under whose regulation and monitoring the licenced cultivators operate, requires growers to request for destruction of their standing crop if they anticipate yields to be lower than the minimum qualifying level. Not tendering such request and harvesting less than the minimum qualifying yield (MQY) of opium latex would make them liable to lose their cultivation licence.Share This Article Related Article Afghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United NationsAfghan opium cultivation jumps 10 per cent in 2016: United Nations Tech lag: Indias opium finds few takersTech lag: Indias opium finds few takers Conditions eased for farmers seeking opium licenceConditions eased for farmers seeking opium licence Rising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirationsRising drug trade threatens Myanmar's aspirations Myanmar declares war on opiumPoppy in a rice bowlEvery year, there are some growers who approach the CBN with crop destruction requests. But the extended dry spell this time has resulted in only about 1,000 of the 19,651 licenced cultivators agreeing to harvest the crop, which is sown during late-October/November and is ready for lancing in February. Under the rules, such requests are to be made before lancing or scratching of the poppy seed pods (fruits) from which the opium latex leaks out. The latex that coagulates on the pods and dries to a sticky yellow residue is what gets tediously collected by the cultivators; they are supposed to account for every gram that is thus obtained. While growers are still coming to terms with the poor yields on account of natural causes, their main grouse  for which they have taken to the streets  is the Centres decision to plough back the entire crop that is not harvested.Previously, the crop affected by natural calamities or disease could be uprooted under official supervision, with the cultivators allowed to take out the poppy seeds (khas khas) from the pod after latex extraction and sell these in the open market. Although the pod husk (doda chura) remaining after extraction of the opium latex and poppy seeds is classified as a narcotic under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act  in view of containing some morphine that can give a high when used in sufficient quantities  it could also be sold to contractors with licenses from the state government.These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai) These bulbs are yet to be harvested. (Express Photo: Milind Ghatwai)The current changed opium cultivation policy mandates the entire sub-MQY crop to be ploughed back to the soil, which growers complain deprives them of revenues that can at least recover their cost of seeds, fertilisers and chemicals. I realised my crop had failed, so I informed the authorities. But what about the costs I have incurred and the time spent in cultivation? asks Rajmal Kabra, a resident of Bahi Parasnath village, about 16 km from Mandsaur. The 55-year-old, who cultivates poppy on a plot of 10 are (0.1 hectare) claims he has never in my life witnessed so much damage to an otherwise most hardy crop.The CBN has defended the new total-ploughing-back policy on grounds of preventing smuggling and black-marketing of opium. Growers dont want to risk their licenses. But they also want to make money from selling seeds and diverting poppy husk illegally, says a CBN official. He adds that the policy was actually issued first in 2009, but its implementation was deferred twice.This time, the CBN has even used rotavators to destroy the un-harvested sub-MQY crop, although the Neemuch-based Assistant Commissioner of Narcotics Mahesh Kumar denies it was done on any significant scale. We dont have any rotavators. It is only a few farmers who have these, and which may have got used, he clarified. Either way, that operation has been kept on hold, following farmer protests.Ek ne bhi chira nahi lagaya (not a single one in my group has lanced his poppy), informs Chandraprakash Patidar, a grower in Bahi Parasnath, who also has 67 cultivators under his jurisdiction. As the mukhiya of the group, he has to maintain a register tracking the daily opium extraction by each of them.Satyanarayan Patidar is among the few who has gone ahead with lancing his pods. He grows opium on a 20 are (0.2 hectares) patta that has yielded just 9 kg. At 45 kg per hectare, this is below the MQY of 58 kg. I am scared to lose the licence next year, observes Patidar, whose patta is in his grandfather Shrirams name. This patta yielded 15 kg or an average of 75 kg/hectare in 2014-15.Producers are paid a minimum price of Rs 870 per kg for opium yields up to 44 kg/hectare. The price rises to Rs 1,000 for yields between 44 and 52 kg per hectare and going as high as Rs 3,500/kg for 90 kg and above. Last year, Patidars family earned Rs 24,000 from their 15 kg opium at Rs 1,600 per kg. But they made even more from sale of 215 kg of khas khas (Rs 96,750 at Rs 450/kg) and 205 kg of doda chura (Rs 25,625 at Rs 125/kg).We are awaiting further orders and clear guidelines from the finance ministry, Mahesh Kumar told The Indian Express when asked about the authorities response to the demand for allowing farmers to recover poppy seeds and also not to cancel licences due to lower yields from unfavourable weather this year. For the moment, the CBN has permitted farmers to pluck and crush the opium pods for obtaining the khas khas, before ploughing back the poppy husk along with the plants into the soil. We dont object to the seeds, as they are not narcotic, explains an official, while confirming the relaxation.MP accounts for nearly 45 per cent of the countrys 44,438 licenced opium cultivators, who are also from Rajasthan (Kota, Chittorgarh, Bhilwara, Pratapgarh and Jhalawar) and Uttar Pradesh (mainly Barabanki, Faizabad, Mau and Ghazipur). In 2013-14, 318 tonnes of opium was produced from 5,893 hectares where legal cultivation took place.Opium collected from farmers is sent to government-owned factories at Neemuch and Ghazipur for final analysis, drying and processing. The factories convert a part of opium (150-200 tonnes) into alkaloids (morphine, codeine and thebaine) for supply to medicine manufacturers. The balance is exported as raw opium to the US, Japan, Hungary, UK, France and Thailand for medicinal purposes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
