Kolappan, near Nagercoil on Thursday night.Mr. Kolappan told The Hindu that a team of officials headed by him conducted a surprise check near St. Susai Primary School in Pallam near Nagercoil and found that the lorry driver and loadmen gave contradictory statements about the stock in the vehicle after finishing their delivery to the designated schools for the purpose of Noon Meal scheme.Their contradictory statements on excess stock of rice and pulses in the lorry increased the suspicion of foul play, Mr. Kolappan also said.The lorry along with the food items were seized and brought to the Taluk Office. The rice and dal were handed over to the officials at the TNCSC godown. Further investigations are on, Mr. Kolappan said."

Srinivas alleged that many people who lost the cards were eligible for the ration.While distribution of new cards was yet to begin, people were put to untold hardship due to the culling of ration cards, he said, at a press conference here on Friday.There were a total of 3,78,542 applications pending for issue of new ration cards, as per the information obtained under the RTI. The Civil Supplies vigilance committees were yet to begin functioning, Mr.Srinivas said.He demanded that the cards of the poorest of the poor be renewed, and the ration issued be expanded."

However, their margins expanded on benign input costs.This July-September quarter, sales growth for companies was lowest in almost a decade. Hindustan Unilevers revenue in the second quarter rose just 2%.While, the companies were hoping for a recovery in the second half of this year, the demonetisation has reduced demand further, particularly in wholesale channels, which drive almost 40% of FMCG business. The cost of raw materials has also inched up following a rise in global crude prices.According to Nielsen, consumer sales declined 1.8% in November versus October, while retailer purchase from trade fell 6.4%. The overall FMCG industry is estimated to be worth 2.56 lakh crore, so in absolute terms, the drop was huge, it said.Despite Diwali-related spends, there is an indication of lost velocity in FMCG. More importantly, we see retailer purchases declining faster than consumer sales, Nielsen said.Impulse foods and personal care products are among the most affected in terms of consumer offtake.The consumer is clearly moving into more daily necessities. ...The fact is that the consumer has got limited cash outlays ... said P Balaji, CFO, Hindustan Unilever, the largest FMCG player in the country.He also said the wholesale sector was among the most affected and so the company would focus on increasing its direct coverage of retail outlets.Religare Securities has cut its sales estimates on companies across the FMCG sector by 1.1%-7.5% for the current financial year, while profit estimates have been slashed by 3.2%-18.6%.Over the last few months, the price of key raw materials is on the rise.For instance, palm oil (key input in soaps) is up 48% year-on-year, wheat 24%, rice bran 16% and sugar 31%."

5b2e25189855b7245313eadb,Lal Bahadur Shastri: The Prime Minister We Must Now Remember,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/lal-bahadur-shastri-the-prime-minister-we-must-now-remember/story-gW4CjcMJSBsdFbTCFctEeP.html,2016-10-09,"This year has seen the publication of several books and numerous articles devoted to a prime minister previously forgotten or ignored: PV Narasimha Rao. Despite enjoying a full five-year term in office, despite overseeing a major and defining shift in economic policy, despite effecting innovations in foreign policy such as the Look East strategy, Narasimha Rao had thus far not got his due from scholars and commentators on Indian politics. There were two reasons for this. One was his conspicuous failure to prevent the destruction of the Babri Masjid and the communal riots that followed, a failure that in the eyes of many nullified his other achievements.Read: PM Modi pays tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, Lal Bahadur ShastriA second and perhaps more important reason for the neglect of Rao was that he had fallen foul of Sonia Gandhi. After she became Congress president in 1998, Mrs Gandhi systematically erased Rao from the memory of the party and its members. To be sure, this was part of a wider effort to define the Congress as the property of a single family. While the achievements (real and imagined) of Nehru, Indira and Rajiv were magnified and broadcast, those of other Congress leaders were underplayed. In this rebranding the reputations of many remarkable Congressmen (and Congresswomen) suffered, but Raos perhaps most of all.The attention now belatedly paid to Rao is welcome. But the time has also come to revisit the legacy of a prime minister even more considerable than Rao, likewise a lifelong Congressman, who too has been largely erased from his partys history by the family that has come to dominate it.This is Lal Bahadur Shastri. Not long after Shastri became prime minister, he stopped in Karachi, then the capital of Pakistan, while on his way home from Cairo. He was met at the airport by President Ayub Khan, who, noticing his tiny frame and 26-inch chest, wondered how such a little man could rule such a large nation. It is said that this sight of Shastri in the flesh convinced Ayub (himself an Army General) that the time was ripe for a fresh incursion into Kashmir. He was convinced that the new leader of India would not be able to effectively defend his country when war came.Read: 1965 war: We got air superiority over Pak in three daysAyub was mistaken. For, with his outstanding defence minister, YB Chavan, Shastri had already overseen the long overdue modernisation of our armed forces. In August 1965 Pakistan sent infiltrators into Kashmir, following this in early September with a major armed offensive. The Indian Army fought bravely, but the pressure on them was intense. In an inspired move, the prime minister ordered a fresh front to be opened in the Punjab, which immediately put the Pakistanis back on the defensive. Under Shastris leadership, the armed forces acquitted themselves extremely well in the war of 1965, thus erasing memories of their ignominious defeat at the hands of China three years previously.The slogan most associated with Shastri was jai jawan, jai kisan. For Nehrus successor keenly understood the link between self-sufficiency in food and self-reliance in politics. It was Shastri who, along with another remarkable cabinet minister, C Subramaniam, laid the foundations of the Green Revolution, although it was Indira Gandhi who came to claim the credit, since the gains from the new strains of wheat and rice took a decade to fructify, by which time Shastri, sadly, was dead.There are many reasons to remember Shastri now, when the agrarian sector is urgently in need of renewal, and when tensions with our always difficult neighbour are once more on the rise. Shastri was a self-effacing man, who wished to be remembered by his actions rather than his words. But when he did speak, he chose his words very wisely, never more so than in a speech he delivered at Delhis Ram Lila Maidan in late September 1965, shortly after a cease-fire had been brokered by the United Nations.The BBC had described the conflict that had just ended as a war between Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. In his speech in the Ram Lila Maidan, Shastri refuted this pernicious allegation. The meeting was chaired by a veteran nationalist who happened to be a Muslim by birth. The speaker before Shastri was a Anglo-Indian lawyer who had been a prominent member of the Constituent Assembly. When it came to his turn to speak, the prime minister drew the crowds attention to the company he was then proudly keeping. So Shastri said: Mir Mushtaq who is presiding over this meeting is a Muslim. Mr Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics . This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims itself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose [and] worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other.Read: City Cong pays tributes to Mahatma Gandhi, ShastriThe attention recently paid to PV Narasimha Rao was because this year marks the 25th anniversary of the liberalisation of the Indian economy. However, the speech of Shastri I have just quoted is not just timely, but also timeless. It inevitably comes to mind when there are troubles with Pakistan. Yet it remains compellingly relevant in times of peace too. If India is to survive and thrive, religion must never be a factor in the political life of the Republic.Ramachandra Guhas most recent book is Gandhi Before IndiaTwitter: @Ram_GuhaThe views expressed are personal"

As they carry out conservation work, the volunteers also replant degraded forests around the fort with saplings and shrubs.We focus on planting saplings that can grow into large trees and can cover a large area, said Raut. The volunteers select species of trees such as scarlet flame, laburnum, bread-fruit, mango, ashoka, copper pod and flame of the forest. To boost biodiversity, they add shrubs like West Indian jasmine (ixora), lemon, curry leaves and lantana.From a young age, I was interested in the rich history of forts, especially in Thane and Palghar. While there is a lot of archaeological information available, the forts are only frequented by couples and are hardly maintained, said Raut. In 2006, we began our research and identified over 50 forts across Mumbai, Thane and Palghar but most of them were run down.Since they began their clean-up activities, Raut and other volunteers noticed that visitors defaced walls with crayons or chalk, destroying centuries-old engravings on the walls.Raut also discovered a solution to the question, What to do with the tonnes of floral waste generated after festivals? Paint made from organic materials is used to beautify the forts.Every month, the group collects about 150kg of waste from flowers such as rose, saughandika (Javandhi), hibiscus, marigold, durva grass and even the karvi flower that blooms once in eight years. During the festive season, the quantity increases to 300kg. The petals are collected and mixed with gum from banana stems or ladyfinger and made into a paste. We also add waste collected from rice factory to make the thick paint, said Raut.The 2016 Nirmalya projectIn an attempt to reduce nirmalaya (flower waste) reaching dumping grounds in the city or ending up in the sea, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will compost 1,083 metric tonnes of nirmalya collected over 11 days of Ganeshotsav.To collect the waste separately, the BMC had installed 246 nirmalaya kalsh (collection points) at immersion sites. Similar to last year, we will carry out the composting process at our plant in Ghatkopar (West) and the manure produced will be used in municipal gardens, said a senior official from BMCs solid waste management department. Last year, BMC had collected 685 tonnes of nirmalaya with 899 civic workers appointed for the collection of waste.Nirmalaya waste converted to compost will be used at municipal gardens, which the civic body otherwise purchases for Rs 8 a kg.How are nirmalya flowers converted to natural paint?Petals from discarded flowers are collected in buckets with a capacity of 10litresThe petals are allowed to dry out in the sun for a few daysThe natural gum of banana stems or ladyfingers is collectedA paste is made with the dried leavesThe concoction is mixed with waste collected from rice factoriesThe mixture is then boiled till a thick colour emergesThe collected paint is one-fourth the 10litre bucketThe colour depends on which flower petals were selected  red for rose, yellow/gold for marigold. Petals that have turned completely black are not used, as they will give only black colour(Source: Shridutta Raut, Fort conservationist, resident of Bhayander)Experts sayThe haphazard condition of forts across Mumbai and its surrounding areas can be seen with garbage strewn almost everywhere. While Rauts efforts are noble when it comes to keeping these heritage sites clean, he needs to be careful and take support from government or private bodies so that scriptures of important historic value are not destroyed.- Dr Kurush Dalal, assistant professor, archaeology department, University of Mumbai, who surveyed a number of forts as a part of statewide clean-up drive by the state government between Friday and Saturday."
5b2e27319855b7245313ed08,Seeking a Permanent Address in Majuli,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seeking-a-permanent-address-in-majuli-world-s-largest-river-island/story-CzCtxHueKe68RCYQxHbRuM.html,2016-09-14,"A permanent address is a luxury not everyone enjoys in Majuli, the worlds largest river island. Annual floods and erosion force many to shift their houses every few years, some even earlier.Bhakatram Das, 72, moved from his home in Samaguri village to Baghgaon a fortnight ago after the Brahmaputra submerged his house and land. This was the familys third relocation since 2008.My bamboo and banana plants, which sustain my family of four, are all gone. I dont have any land now. We cant continue living like this, he said.A few hundred metres away, Gereli Das is also building her new residence with wood and bamboo. She, her husband and daughter are among dozens who lost their lands to erosion and were forced to shift this monsoon.We survive by planting rice and paddy. But this year we cannot cultivate paddy as all our land is gone, said the 60-year-old, who has shifted her house twice in the past six years.Floods and erosion are not new to Majuli. From 1246 sq km in 1971, it has shrunk to 650 sq km at present. The island and the cluster of islets near it, is still significant  80 km long and 15 km wide.The island itself shapes and reshapes with each floods, land mass eroded at one end is deposited elsewhere.Of the 248 villages on the island, 166 have been earmarked as threatened. Since 2001, more than 3,000 families have lost their land to erosion and were forced to relocate. Embankments are still home to more than 2,000 families.Majuli, the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture and spirituality, spread by 15th century social-reformer Sankardev, also face problems of connectivity and infrastructure.It can be reached only by ferries and boats during the day, the condition of roads is poor and the 100-bed sub-divisional hospital lacks specialists. There is no major educational institution or avenues for employment.But the floods also make the island a farmers delight.The nutrient-rich sediments deposited on the banks of Brahmaputra make Majuli a very fertile place, favourable for agriculture for the 170,000-odd residents.Transformation plansBut the islands fate could change soon. The BJP-led governments in New Delhi and Dispur have launched a spate of plans and projects to transform Majuli through flood and erosion control measures.On Thursday, a week after the island was declared the largest river island by the Guinness Book of World Records, the Assam government upgraded Majulis status from a sub-division to the states 35th district.New chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who represents the island constituency in the state assembly, held a cabinet meeting in Majuli and announced the governments determination to protect and develop it.The cabinet decided to set up a centre for water resources to tackle floods and erosion. Construction of concrete roads all over the island was another decision taken at the meeting.A cultural university and a post-graduate college are part of the state governments Rs 1200-crore package for Majuli.Talks are also on with World Bank and Asian Development Bank to fund an ambitious project to dredge the Brahmaputra and its tributaries and remove silt deposit which in turn would control flood and erosion.Construction of embankments, geo bags and tubes at erosion-prone areas and planting of grass with long roots, would control loss of land, said Narsing Pawar, the islands sub-divisional officer.The Union government has already announced the construction of two bridges connecting two separate banks of the island. Also, a 121-km long national highway will be constructed to connect Majuli with two major towns  Jorhat and Lakhimpur.The plans, when implemented, are expected to make access to Majuli much easier and bring tourists from within India and abroad to witness the islands pristine beauty and also experience its art, culture and spirituality.Preserving unique identityResidents of Majuli, comprising mostly scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, are excited at the attention their island is getting at present. But there is also fear that connectivity and development may lead to the island losing its unique identity.The satras  Vasihnavite monasteries  whose numbers have reduced from 65 to 32 due to erosion, still practice and preach the plays, dances and spiritual ways professed by Sankardev over 500 years ago.There is apprehension that unbridled rush of people from other areas could affect these practices which have remained unchanged for centuries.Connectivity has both positive and negative aspects. Majulis natural beauty and culture could get affected and we might end up like any other place, said Hem Chandra Goswami, religious and administrative head of Samaguri satra, one of the biggest monasteries in the island.Some feel lifestyles of the Mishing and Sonowal-Kachari tribals, who are dependent on the islands soil and water resources, could get affected once Majuli is transformed.Sonowal and his team has the task of ensuring that the likes of Bhakatram and Gereli get permanent addresses and there is controlled development while keeping Majulis culture and spirituality unadulterated."
5b2e27469855b7245313ed20,Pak Won't Reverse Seven Decades of Anti-India Policy without Diplomatic Process,https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/pak-won-t-reverse-seven-decades-of-anti-indian-policy-without-diplomatic-process/story-dAJaibFYSVjIVEm0BzXIEI.html,2016-09-30,"In the hours of the Uri strike that killed 18 Indian soldiers, BJP leader Ram Madhav demanded for one tooth, the complete jaw. Indias surgical strikes on Wednesday night were surely only a tooth  barely a few kilometres across the Line of Control (LoC)  but they represent one of the most important changes in Indias military posture to Pakistan in over a decade.Contrary to those who believe that history began in May 2014, this is not the first time that India has attacked targets on the Pakistani side of the LoC. Such assaults were relatively commonplace in the AB Vajpayee years, during the latter, turbulent stage of the insurgency in Kashmir. Journalist Praveen Swami has reported a string of retaliatory Indian raids across the LoC from the 1990s through the 2000s. He gives one example of a massacre of 22 civilians at Bandala in March 1998 by irregulars backed by Indian special forces, in retaliation for an earlier massacre of Hindus. These details are contested, but it is beyond doubt that the LoC was not sacrosanct. Those who served as brigade commanders during Operation Parakram (2001-02) have also remarked, coyly, that they were not sitting idly in their posts during that standoff.Read: Armys surgical strikes inflict terrorist casualties across LoCThe novelty here is not that India struck. It is that it chose to announce its operation with great fanfare. The hastily convened Cabinet Committee on Security set the tone, and the unusual pairing of the Director General Military Operations and ministry of external affairs spokesman underlined the strategic importance of the announcement that followed. Indias previous raids were instances of tacit signaling between the frontline military forces, with little oversight from the top brass and the foreign ministry out of the loop. They sent messages to Pakistans military, without causing Pakistan to lose face in a way that would set in motion a spiral of escalation. The downside of clandestine retaliation was that the Indian public was rarely privy to these goings-on at the LoC, beyond the odd leaked snippet.Indias decision to go public has advantages and drawbacks. It allows the government to claim vindication for its tough rhetoric. The Army has, as it promised, responded at a time and place of its own choosing. Those criticising the Modi government for talking loudly but carrying a small stick have been temporarily quieted (though has their appetite been whet?). Even the Congress, reliably a force for mindless opposition to nearly everything the government does, has read the tea-leaves, with Sonia Gandhi expressing rare public solidarity with actions to protect countrys security. More broadly, a public strike creates a precedent in a way a private one does not, making it somewhat easier for this or a future government to repeat the action. India may also be probing Pakistans thresholds for action. If the consequences of this strike are limited, the next one may be deeper or wider, perhaps even across the International Border. And if it is true that an Indian drone recorded footage, the longer-term implications for armed drones are self-evident.Read: We stand with govt on actions to ensure countrys security: SoniaPublicity also carries costs. While Pakistan is, at the time of writing, denying that any raid took place, it will eventually have to contend with reality  not least if the Modi government chooses to release what it claims is video evidence. The Pakistan army will have no choice but to respond forcefully. The evacuation of Punjab border villages on Thursday suggests that India expects to face an intensification of shelling along the LoC. But we may also see encouragement of further Uri-like attacks, or even attacks in Indian cities beyond Jammu and Kashmir and on Indian interests in Afghanistan. We do not yet know whether Pakistani troops were killed  the DGMOs reference to those trying to shield terrorists suggests so  but this will also influence Rawalpindis calculus.Diplomatically, India appears to have prepared its ground well. Having successfully corralled three of its neighbours to boycott the SAARC summit in November, Pakistan was already reeling. Then early on Thursday morning, perhaps while Indian force were returning across LoC, details of a conversation between Indian National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and his American counterpart Susan Rice were released, with Rice demanding Pakistani action against terrorist groups. Whether or not the US was informed, the impeccable timing sent its own signal. China, too, has remained muted over the plight of its all-weather ally. Without this diplomatic space, Indian leaders might not have taken this risk.Read: Indias claim of surgical strikes fabrication of truth, says Pakistan armyThe mood today will be celebratory. Much of the Indian public believes that decades of strategic restraint are drawing to a close. There will be an impact on the full gamut of bilateral relations, from trade to regional cooperation. But, as Lieutenant General HS Panag reminded us on Thursday, war is a game of chess. And the fundamental dilemma remains: While India can impose a modest cost on terrorist groups and their supporters, any game-changing punishment carries with it the risk of a larger war that would damage Indias broader economic and diplomatic interests. The brutal fact is that Pakistan will not reverse seven decades of policy without a diplomatic process. If we may draw some hope, it is that the carnage of 1999-2002 was followed by the backchannel of diplomacy of 2004-07. As the stick grows, so too should the carrot.Shashank Joshi is senior research fellow, Royal United Services Institute, LondonThe views expressed are personal"
5b2e27e69855b7245313edc3,Food for Though: Tamil Nadu Villages Sow Seeds of a 'Pulses Revolution',https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/food-for-though-tamil-nadu-villages-sow-seeds-of-a-pulses-revolution/story-oYRtK9asOT0HTwMXZEVjTN.html,2016-08-30,"At a time when prices of pulses have hit the stratosphere, depriving the common man of his favourite source of protein, farmers in five villages of Pudukottai district in southern Tamil Nadu have sown the seeds of what could be the solutionproduce more.The experiment, launched by agricultural scientist and Father of 60s Green Revolution, MS Swaminathan, has shown encouraging results.In the first attempt, the five villages produced 745 kg per hectare, close to the national average of 781 kg.For Swaminathan, this could be beginning of a revolution.I hope 2016 marks the beginning of a pulses revolution, the scientist told HT.RS Shanthakumar, director, eco-technology centre, M S Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), is also on the same page, saying it is a project that can be replicated elsewhere and scaled up.All these began on April 22, 2013, when farmers gathered at a pulses panchayat held by Swaminathan and his team at Edaiyampatti village in Illuppur taluk, and pledged to grow pulses.They were grouped in 71 teams and trained in seed selection, use of technology and implements and application of bio-fertilizers and enriched manure.For 43-year-old Lakshmi of Kathavampatti village, who took up black gram cultivation in three-fourths of an acre, the 300 kg-yield and net income of Rs 21,400 was simply unbelievable.Swaminathan sir is like a God to us. My income has doubled and we have more money to spend, thanks to him, she beamed.Fifty years ago, Swaminathan and other scientists had introduced India to the Green Revolution, bringing in high-yielding seeds, technological implements and machinery and scientific methods for pest control and soil management. With governments support in land reforms, easy credit and procurement, the country became a surplus producer of rice and wheat.But the neglect of pulses has proved costly, forcing the government to import, and making the once-economic source of protein out of reach for the common man.A kilogramme of moong dal costs Rs 160-180, while urad dal is around Rs 200 and tur dal Rs 180-200, all of which have doubled since 2014.Each time we go to the market, the shopkeeper raises the prices by Rs 10 per kg, laments Premalata Srinivasan, a resident of Mylapore in Chennai.It is hard to understand, whether it is an actual or artificial shortage that the shopkeepers are taking advantage of, she said, an apprehension shared by many across the country.Historically, India has been the largest producer, consumer and importer of pulses, accounting for 33% of the worlds cultivated area, 22% of the production and 27% of consumption of pulses.In 2012, 18.34 million tonnes of pulses were produced from a total area of 23.47 million hectares with the average productivity per hectare at 781 kg, falling short of the estimated demands by about 3-4 million tonnes.The pod-bearing plants are cultivated in rain-fed areas and are severely affected by the vagaries of monsoon. Higher input cost, in terms of seeds, fertilisers and labour, affects the return on investment. Lack of incentives from the government also has forced farmers across the country to stick to rice and wheat.For Swaminathan, the crisis was an opportunity to overcome the problem which led to the crisis.When he and his team came to Pudukottai three years ago, it was the driest district in Tamil Nadu.The setting up of Illuppur Agriculture Producer Company Limited (IAPCL) ensured that agriculture became profitable again and ensured that the farmers got the benefits.IAPCL, registered in 2015, markets and sells all the produce from the villages directly to retailers in various cities of Tamil Nadu under the brand: Edaimpatti and Patikaadu.Though the CEO is senior scientist K Thachinamurthy of MSSRF, he only executes the plans. Decisions are taken at the meeting of board of directorsall of who are farmersheld on the 7th of every month.Major decisions taken at the meeting and financial statement of the previous month are circulated to all the producer groups, promoting transparency and accountability and boosting confidence of farmers.With 70 % shareholders being women, the company and the programme also have accorded greater importance and representation to women.The company has now expanded beyond pulses and has a product mix of organic vegetables, integrated dairy and poultry.For R Subbaiah, another prosperous pulses farmer in Illuppur, the 482-kg black gram yield per acre in his farm almost doubled his average returns to Rs 27,306 per acre.I am glad I listened to Swaminathan sir. Today many people from other villages want to imitate us, he said."

Here are some Ganesh devotees who have gone the extra mile to celebrate the festival in an extraordinary manner.Idols made of cow dungKeeping environmental concerns in mind and to raise awareness about water pollution, students of KPB Hinduja College of Commerce, Charni Road, along with volunteers of NGO Surbhi Kutir Udyog Foundation have made water-soluble idols from cow manure this year. The money earned from the sale of these idols will be distributed among artisans and villagers to encourage them to adopt and take care of non-milking cows. To take this social initiative further, the students have undertaken a social media campaign on platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, said Dr Minu Madlani, the colleges principal.These idols are not as environmentally damaging as the plaster of Paris ones. Besides, when they dissolve, they will provide nutrients to aquatic plants and animals. The idols have been kept for sale on the college premises. Its prices will start from Rs150, said Madlani.Eco-friendly spicy idolA Ganpati idol made using discarded newspapers and rice starch in Malad and decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds. (HT Photo)Keeping with the legacy of making creative eco-friendly idols for the past five years, members of Shree Sai Darshan Mitra Nandal, Malad (West), have made an idol using pulp from discarded newspapers and rice starch. Whats more, the idol has been decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds.Weighing approximately 190 kgs, the idol consists of nine kg clove, 20 kg cinnamon, six kg cardamom, two kg chilly and a kg of mustard seeds.It took us over a month to put together the idol, said Montu Ruia, organiser of the mandal. The Spice Ganesha idol will also educate children about different spices used in Indian foods. Over the years, we have made idols of wax, chocolate, toy cars, erasers and pencils, among others.Also read: Ganesh mandals want jetty, boats at Girgaum Chowpatty for idol immersionDonate pens and books, not jewelleryMoving away from the traditional donations such as gold and silver this year, a Ghatkopar-based mandal has asked all its devotees to donate a book and pen during their visit.Members of Parshiwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, Ghatkopar (West), will be distributing all books and pens they collect through donations among less fortunate students across schools in the city and hand over some of the books to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to distribute them among civic schools.We are expecting a minimum of 60 books and pens per day from devotees, said Onkar Sawant, secretary of the mandal. We have a small 5-ft idol this year and we want the theme for this years celebrations to be the importance of education for all.A 6 ft papier mch idolResidents of Vikhroli (East), part of the Phirozshah Nagar Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, are the first ones to go eco-friendly and have been celebrating the festival by taking environmentally conscious measures for the past three years. This year, the mandal ordered a 6-ft Ganesh idol from sculptors at Kurla that put together a frame of bamboo sticks stuck together using natural gum. The idol was created using a mash of tissue paper and newsprint as environment comes first for Ganpati organisers.The entire pandal has too been decorated using only recyclable material such as cardboard and natural colours. We avoided using any material that could pollute the environment, said Swapnali Chavan, a member of the mandal, adding, The idol will be immersed in an artificial pond at Bhandup on the 10th day of the festival.Bringing a chocolatey GaneshaRintu Rathod with the 5-feet-tall chocolate Ganesha idol she made. (HT Photo)A resident of Santacruz, Rintu Rathod, a baker by profession, has made a 50-kg chocolate Ganesha that stands five-feet tall. While the idol has been made with chocolate, the jewellery and other adornments ave been painted with food colours. This is third consecutive year when she has made the chocolate Ganesha, which is a major attraction for children from her neighbouring areas.The idol will be immersed in around 100 litres of milk on the fifth day of the festival. The idea is to share the chocolate milk with underprivileged children from across Mumbai, said Rathod, who took nearly six days to make the idol.Idols stuffed with fish foodThe nine-inch idols that are although made of clay but have vegetarian fish food in them have been made as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. (HT Photo)A city-based group has created an alternative to plaster of Paris, clay and paper mch idols by sculpting idols from corn and vegetable powder  ingredients that can easily decompose in water and can be food for aquatic organisms  and coloured with organic substances such as turmeric, chandan and geru (coloured soil).Sprouts Environmental Trust along with college students from Mumbai have made the nine-inch idols as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. After the amazing response we received last year when we made 120 idols, we decided to increase the number by 40% this year, said Anand Pendharkar, the groups founder . The exterior of the idol is made of clay, but the cavity contains vegetarian fish food. The colour used to paint the idol is natural as opposed to paints on PoP idols that could contain toxic metals.The group also trained 200 students from various city colleges to make their own idols this year.Green immersionThe idol made with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay and filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. (HT Photo)Lower Parel resident Dattadri Kothur has sculpted unique eco-friendly Ganpati idols that are filled with seeds. With 400 idols this year, Kothurs concept is by far the most unique as he makes them with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. Made atop earthen pots with a base of red soil with size ranging between 12 and 20 inches, each idol is filled with 15 seeds.In place of broken idols littered across beaches in Mumbai, I wanted to create an idol that gives something back to worshippers, said Kothur, who calls these idols Tree Ganesha. It takes about seven to eight days for the idol to completely dissolve in the 18X5-inch pots. However, the seeds begin sprouting by day five. Holy basil and ladyfinger seeds were chosen because they grow the fastest, he said."

As the time for the Friday Mass draws near, more visitors start scribbling hurriedly on the slips of blank paper kept near the box and dropping them inside. Those coming to Mother House write their intentions (or wishes) on paper and put them inside this box for Mothers blessings. During the special mass on Fridays, the day Mother passed away, we ask the priest to bless all the intentions and pray for them, explains one of the nuns.The founder of the Missionaries of Charity will be canonised at the Vatican on September 4. But the nun who stepped out of Loreto in 1948, and made it her lifes mission to work for the poorest of the poor around the world has for years been revered as a saint by the people whose lives she touched. Sister Bernadette, 78, of Loreto Calcutta remembers a chance meeting with Mother Teresa at the Kolkata airport years ago. People at the airport kept coming to her and asking for her blessing. She had a paper and she would write God bless you and sign her name on it. She said, you see this, I am putting them in Gods hands, remembers the nun.The Simple Joys of LifeThose who knew her well, lived and worked with her, remember the person behind the public face. She had a great sense of humour. She would always be joking and when she found something funny, she would place both hands on her hips and bend double with laughter, remembers former chief election commissioner of India and Mother Teresas biographer Navin B Chawla.A nun of the Loreto order, 82-year-old Sister Eithne, recalls that same spirit in one of her meetings with Mother Teresa. I remember meeting her here in this house (Loreto House, Kolkata). She came to meet the community, her old friends. What I remember about that meeting is that there was great laughter and fun, she says.At Kolkatas Missionaries of Charity, nuns pray with Mother Teresas statue behind them. (Samir Jana/Hindustan Times)While her avowed mission remained to care for the destitute, everyone around her felt enriched by her love. She always had time for everybody, says Father Dominic Gomes, vicar-general of the archdiocese of Calcutta. After I was ordained, I was asked by the Church to go for my higher studies to Rome. I needed a passport. I made so many rounds of different offices and nothing was working out, he remembers. One day I was at Mother House and Mother noticed that I looked very sad, and she asked me what was the matter. I told her I had been trying to get my passport made for the past three months without any success. She immediately said give all your documents to me. To my surprise, the next day I had my passport.Sisters of the Missionaries of Charity remember how their superior cared for them the same way that a mother would. Sister Tarcisia, who joined St Teresas primary school in Kolkata as a six-year-old when Mother Teresa was the in-charge, talks of her motherly affection. She knew that my health was not strong, so whenever there was some heavy work to be done, moving a table for instance, she would push me out of the way. This from a woman who her biographer recalls as being habitually unmindful of her own health.  She often chose to ignore the advice of Dr Bardhan, her long-standing cardiologist in Calcutta, remembers Chawla. Mother Teresa needed a pacemaker at some point of her life and she was forbidden by the doctor to even go down the stairs. One day I was with her and there was a telephone call. And she said I am going to Bangladesh. Theres a cyclone there, I have got to go. I reminded her of her doctors orders and she said I will tell him later, says Chawla.On Mother Teresas 98th birth anniversary at Kolkatas Missionaries of Charity. (Subhankar Chakraborty/Hindustan Times)There are as many anecdotes about Mother Teresa, as the number of people who came into contact with her. Father Felix Raj, principal of the St Xaviers College in Kolkata remembers her great love for students. Photographer Raghu Rai talks about how she could be tough when needed, but would change if she found reason in what was being said. Recalling his first meeting with her, sometime in the 1970s, he says, Even at that time, the Missionaries of Charity were quite strict about giving access to photographers and journalists. When Rai happened to see three nuns in prayer through the movement of a half curtain behind Mother Teresa, he started taking their photos. On being questioned by Mother Teresa as to what he was doing, Rai answered, Mother, there are these sisters praying and they look like angels. How you melted, Mother, and accepted that moment, he recalls.Chawla talks of her immense will and how she would go to any length for her work. In one of his initial meetings with Mother, when he was secretary to the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Delhi, he remembers that she had come to ask for land to build a facility for the leprosy-affected in the city. I asked her how much land she needed and she looked at me and said five acres. Then we went to see the LG and she told him in detail about the plight of these people and the LG was so moved he was nearly in tears. He also asked her how much land she required and she looked at me with an impish smile and said ten acres! Because she had won him over she got 11 acres. And I saw this in country after country, situation after situation. If Mother Teresa could cajole anything out of anyone for her poor, she had no hesitation in doing so, he says.Read more: Tracing Mothers Journey in Kolkata from Loreto to Missionaries of CharityThe Nay SayersThis very attitude of her, however, in indiscriminately accepting help for her mission has been used by her critics against her, the most vocal of whom had been British journalist Christopher Hitchens. In a documentary titled Hells Angel - Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Hitchens questioned Mother Teresas meetings and closeness with certain political heads of states and business tycoons of questionable repute and in some cases her acceptance of funds or trophies from them. Notable among these were Haitian president Jean-Claude Duvalier and American activist and businessman Charles Keating. Hitchens allegations are echoed by Indian rationalist Sanal Edamaruku, who wrote in an article, Mother Teresa did not serve the poor in Calcutta, she served the rich in the West. She helped them to overcome their bad conscience by taking billions of dollars from them, and felt that Mother had given a bad name to Calcutta by portraying it as a city of hopelessness and death. Chawla admits that in all likelihood, she did meet Michelle Duvalier, Jean-Claude Duvaliers wife. It was true of Mother Teresa that whoever could do her work, she would go there and try and get work done for her poor. I did ask her once how is it that you take money from these dubious people. And she said how is it different from the thousands who come to feed the poor in all my homes. I dont look into their antecedents. Whoever they may be they have a right to give in charity and I have no right to judge them. God will judge them, he says.Queen Elizabeth II standing in left side profile as she presents Mother Teresa of Calcutta with the insignia of the Order of Merit November 24, 1983 at the Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. (Virendra Prabhakar/Hindustan Times)That Cult FollowingHitchens traced the root of Mothers global popularity and adulation to journalist Malcolm Muggeridges devotional representation of her in the book Something Beautiful for God. But he and those he interviewed in Hells Angel accused Mother Teresa of admiring the strength of the powerful almost as highly as she recommends resignation of the poor. He gave the example of the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, an industrial disaster in India, when Mother Teresas advice to the victims had been to forgive the multinational company responsible for it. Writer and journalist Mihir Bose whom Hitchens interviewed in the film felt Mother Teresa  accepted implicitly that theres nothing you can do for the poor except take them off the streets and look after them. You cannot change their attitude, you cannot make them feel that they have an ability or the means to improve and change their lives. Father Felix Raj answers the accusation. People have criticised Mother and said instead of giving a fish why dont you teach these people how to fish. She answered, okay fine I am capable of giving a fish but why dont you start teaching others how to fish. Then both of us participate in the mission, he says.Watch | Kolkatas saint: Mother of the PoorForeign physicians who visited the Missionaries of Charity homes in Calcutta have written of poor medical care given to the people there, including a lack of distinction between curable and incurable diseases, no use of pain relief medication and lack of proper sterilisation of medical tools, including needles. It is an allegation also voiced by writer and former volunteer at Missionaries of Charity, Mary Loudon, in Hells Angel. But Mother Teresas supporters explain it as their lack of understanding of her mission. I think they are giving the best possible treatment wherever it is. It is true that when the sisters feel no medical care will help... what is the need of shifting him to the hospital when he may die on the way. At that moment you try to help the person, not shift him to a medical facility, says Father Felix Raj.Less easy to justify is her religious non-acceptance of abortion and birth control measures and here even Chawla admits that he disagreed with her views. So deeply religious herself, did she ever try to convert anyone to her faith, another criticism levelled against her? She has not converted even one in terms of religion. But she has converted all, including me, her conversion is the conversion of the heart, says Father Felix Raj. Chawla explains that Mother never felt the need to convert the destitute because for her every suffering person she picked up from the street was her God.Sishu Bhavan, a place for children near the Mother House at the Missionaries of Charitys office in Kolkata. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)For herself and her sisters though, prayer and devotion to Jesus was sacrosanct. Stepping out of the comfort of Loreto House into the Calcutta of 1948, a city torn by post-partition strife and recovering from the famine of 1943, needed some courage. In the beginning there was no money, even for food. And she had to feed the 12 women who joined her order. She would beg for rice and sprinkle some salt on it. And then she would pray and someone would send vegetables. In the early days she strengthened her capacity to pray, says Chawla.Mother Teresa photographed by Raghu RaiRai remembers her words to the authorities during the refugee crisis when people started arriving to Calcutta across the borders from Bangladesh. My sisters will put up with everything; they will spend all their time, and do their duty, but they will have to come back every evening for their prayers to rejuvenate their spiritual energies, Mother had said to the officer in charge of relief operations.Talking of the first time that he met Mother way back in 1975, Chawla, talks of her trademark white sari with the blue border, which she chose over a nuns habit in 1948. She was bent over, even then, and when she turned, I noticed that her sari, which was clean and shining, was darned in several places, he says. For Mother Teresa, that sari was more than a garment. It was a promise from Jesus that your sari will become holy because it will be my symbol.For the world though, that sari came to symbolise and contain in its folds a love and compassion that was almost beyond human. In later years artists such as MF Husain would use it to symbolise her. His paintings of her were without facial features. Perhaps the artist in him saw in her the embodiment of that universal motherhood, that those close to her felt in her embrace.August 26, 1910: Born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, in Skopje, Macedonia in a devout Catholic family.

5b2e29689855b7245313ef5f,Biotech Regulators Show Conflict of Interest,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gm-crop-biotech-regulators-career-paths-show-conflicts-of-interest/story-cHR6TSfbpnojEHWrkOuDgN.html,2016-09-09,"Several officials who sit on Indias biotech regulator, which is preparing to take a decision on genetically modified mustard, are also associated with global organisations that lobby for GM crops, HT has learnt.Such an arrangement represents potential conflicts of interest, according to critics, who argue that there must be an arms length distance.On Wednesday, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the regulator empowered to clear transgenic crops for commercialisation, released an assessment report of genetically modified (GM) mustard on its website for public comments.Scientists who serve as regulators are mostly GM crop developers themselves, another area of conflicting roles.The co-developer of GM mustard, Akshay Pradhan, is also a regulator. Pradhan told HT he voluntarily sat out of all meetings concerning GM mustard. So there is no question of conflict of the interest, he said.A GM crop is one in which a gene has been altered for new traits, such as pest resistance or nutritional value. GM mustard, a public-sector developed variety, is the second transgenic food to come up for regulatory approval after BT brinjal, which was indefinitely suspended by the previous UPA government despite being cleared by the GEAC.Regulators linked to industry-backed non-profits or who have been privately funded GM developers said they were open about their affiliations. They denied any ethical problem because they acted in accordance with the regulators rules. Critics however say this is a serious case of a compromised regulatory framework.Such officials include the GEAC co-chair K Veluthambi, B Sesikeran, a nutrition scientist, and crop scientist SR Rao.Rao is on the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board funded by an agri-business MNC, among others. Sesikeran is a member of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), a global non-profit partly funded by firms to promote science in agriculture, including GM technologies. According to its website, ILSIs funding comes primarily from its corporate membership and supporting companies. These include GM crop companies.Being a regulator doesnt mean you are here to destroy GM science. If you are an airline regulator, does it mean you have to destroy the airline sector? We are here to promote GM science and there is nothing secret about it, only thing it has to be scientifically sound and safe, Sesikeran said.GEAC co-chair Veluthambi is a scientist behind a GM rice project. Both Veluthambi and Rao could not be reached for comments. However, their colleague Pradhan said: How can you go on suspecting public scientists? GEAC has to depend on the same scientists because they are the only ones available.Mere stepping out of meetings does not address the problem of conflict of interest, said Kavitha Kuruganti, who represents an anti-GM advocacy group. According to her, the regulatory body needs risk-assessment experts as regulators, not GM crop developers.There is only one reason why modern biotechnology needs regulation  that of protecting us from risks. That function is not being fulfilled with industry-affiliated and other crop developers working as regulators, Kuruganti said."

He and his family also developed close links with Manipurs royal family.Like many British personnel in India, Higgins kept diaries and recorded his experiences that, in many ways, were a world away from the Edwardian surroundings in Alford. His records include his views on the potent local brew, Zu.For more than 150 years, Higgins and his family lived in the most famous house in the town, Alford Manor House, built in 1611. The home was turned into a museum in 1967, and the trust running it is putting together the two-phase project that includes an exhibition and recreating the Manipur royal familys attire.Alford Manor House (Courtesy alfordmanorhouse.co.uk)Sarah Teesdale, trustee of Alford Manor House Museum, told Hindustan Times that both sides of Higgins role in Manipur will be set out in the exhibition that will run through most of 2017, and will include archives and his personal diaries.It has been an important element for me from the beginning to depict both sides of the conflict. JC Higgins involvement in the suppression of the Kuki Uprising and recruitment for the Labour Corps provides a completely different focus for our exhibition, she said.The Kuki Uprising and Higgins roleThe Kuki Uprising had its roots in British efforts to gather men, materials and munitions from colonies at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Manipurs Maharaja Churachand Singh was prepared to extend such support.Manipurs contribution included a double company of infantry, a company of 120 sappers and miners, 500 Naga labourers, four ambulances to the St Johns Red Cross Fund, and a sum of Rs 281,860.The Maharaja sought to raise two additional labour corps for France. As the war progressed and men were desperately needed, Higgins was directly involved in recruiting tribal men from the hills in the Manipur Labour Corps.The pressure for more men led to the Kuki Uprising and Higgins became involved in suppressing what the British described as a rebellion from 1917 to 1919.Our View From the Other Side will include the perspective of the Kuki tribesmen, who refused to be recruited and stood up to British rule, along with the story of those villages (which were) caught between the two sides and suffered great losses, Teesdale said.We will also look at the experiences of the men who did answer the call of the British and served in France as members of the Labour Corps.Maharaja Churachand Singh and Maharani Dhanamanjuri Devi of Manipur in 1905. The photograph was taken on the occasion of their wedding. The royal couples attire seen in the photo is being recreated for the project launched by the Alford Manor House Museum. (Courtesy Imasi: The Maharaj Kumari Binodini Devi Foundation)Higgins relationship with the Maharaja of ManipurHiggins and Churachand Singh worked closely together for more than 20 years, travelling and attending official engagements. Higgins letters home in the late 1920s mention polo matches played together and visits to the Residency by Maharani Dhanamanjuri Devi. Their children played at the British residence in Imphal as friends.The second aspect of the project involves Indian textiles experts and local artisans recreating the clothes of Churachand Singh and Dhanamanjuri Devi. Teesdale said the organisers were delighted to receive cooperation and support from Manipur and elsewhere in India for the project.Members of the erstwhile royal family have been consulted to recreate the phanek dress as closely as possible to the one worn by Dhanamanjuri Devi.The museum is currently in the third year of our Alford Remembers WWI Exhibition. As the exhibition has evolved, we have worked hard to include alternative views and a wide variety of experiences related to the war, all of which have Alford connections, Teesdale said.Extract from JC Higgins diary on Zu (local rice beer), April 1914:There are many kinds of Zu, but they may be roughly subdivided into two kinds. The first is a kind of beer or fermented liquor, prepared with some fermenting medium from rice, millet, maize, Jobs tears etc. I have even tasted it in times of scarcity made out of bamboo seeds. It varies of course in sweetness, flavour and consistency, but the best Kuki Zu, made from rice, is an excellent drink, tasting slightly like sour cider.The other kind is a spirit, distilled from the former kind, and is the most disgusting stuff it is possible to imagine. It is greatly appreciated by the hillmen, owing to it having more power to its elbow and one often experiences the bitter disappointment, having climbed a seemingly interminable hill with a hospitable bottle waved at the top and having a good pull at the contents, of finding the bottle is full of this poisonous stuff."

Die without a single protest? a furious Hemant Fitter, a former spokesperson of Keshubhai Patels Gujarat Parivartan Party, says. We will get no compensation for these lands  in national (or the states ) interest. Very soon there will be no green land in Gujarat at all.Sagar Rabari, the secretary of the Khedut Samaj, minces no words.If the government of Gujarat does not immediately withdraw the bill (slated to come into effect on Monday), farmers across castes and religions will unite to oppose it and the results will not be in the interest of the government or the society at large, Rabari says.Read | At Una rally attended by Kanhaiya, Dalits warn of fresh protestsThe anger has been simmering beneath the surface for months, if not years, and the latest bill is only the last straw that seems to have broken the camels back. For not only does this bill do away with the safeguards of consent and social impact assessment that are provided for in the United Progressive Alliances Land Acquisition Bill of 2013 that the Centre failed to amend, Gujarats farmers are also under the additional burdens of earlier state acts.Gujarats 2009 Special Investment Region Act, aimed at creating industrial hubs, authorised the government to acquire land from farmers without notice or compensation.Jayesh Patel says the Irrigation Act of 2013 is much more burdensome. It established a volumetric system of water distribution to farmers whereby, Patel alleges, farmers are firstly not supplied adequate water and if they draw water from their own rivers through lift irrigation or canalisation they are immediately arrested for depleting the water supply to industry.Excessive commitment to capitalism in Gujarat is systematically destroying farmers and making criminals out of them. I do not think any other state treats its farmers so despicably. Farmers are simply dying and at this rate soon Gujarat will be left with no agriculture at all, Patel says.The pity, Fitter says, is south Gujarat is still lush and green and produces some of the finest wheat, cotton, groundnuts, rice and other cash crops. Farmers are being crushed under the weight of industry and capitalism. Our green fields will soon be a concrete jungle at this rate, he says.Rabari says, At the root of all the social churning in the country today is the issue of agriculture, farmers, farming and ultimately land ownership. If farmers interests are neglected there will be huge consequences.There is a formal support to this planned agitation by Hardik Patels Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti, the OBC Ekta Manch and the Dalit Adhikar Sangathan, which just concluded a march from Ahmedabad to Una in Gir Somnath district where four Dalits were brutally assaulted for skinning a dead cow, apart from the Gujarat Khedut Samaj.All these organisations have issued a joint statement, warning of a major unrest in the state.Read | Dalits head for Una to attend mega rally against atrocitiesIn 2014, farmers from south Gujarat tasted some limited success in forcing a rollback by the state government when they jammed the Surat-Mumbai highway in April that year with a 15-km queue of tractors and refused to cede way to traffic on the busy highway.Under the Gujarat tenancy and land ceiling acts, 42 villages near the coastal region were to be completely taken over for a proposed port. The peaceful jamming of the highway unnerved the government enough to roll back its decision and return the lands to the farmers.We had decided then that we would die before we gave up or gave in. The situation is the same now. We will die but before that, we will fight, Maganbhai Patel, a farmer from Ambetha village in Surat district whose lands were among those forcibly acquired, says.The Gujarat model may come unstuck for the third time since last Augusts Patidar and last months Dalit uprisings.They only want to talk of a golden Gujarat. But beneath the golden surface, the green Gujarat is turning to dust, farmers are committing suicide in large numbers. They are selling their land in distress. They have nowhere to go, says Jayesh Patel.Kishor Desai studied accountancy but now tills his fathers land out of commitment to the family tradition. But now he is determined his sons will not settle on the land. In any case, at the rate government is going with regard to farmers. I do not think there will be any land left for them by the time they grow up. I am going to educate my sons to become working professionals.The Khedut Samaj is now undertaking an exercise to formally organise farmers district by district and educate them about their woes that are plenty  lack of adequate electricity, diversion of water to industry, no agricultural subsidies and low procurement prices.One presumes that the farmers would be aware of these perils but Patel says their lack of education is such that they treat these issues as fate and need to be informed that these are man  or rather the government-made perils  that are contributing to their distress. The agitation will begin next week after the Raksha Bandhan holidays are over.Patel has a crisp answer when he is asked if the divergent ideologies, as well the contradictions of various castes and religions, of the four organisations that have joined hands, will pose a problem. Beyond ideology, there is something called survival. That very survival is at stake in a regime that is crushing farmers under the weight of industry and capitalism. Survival is now our new ideology.The new chief minister, Vijay Rupani, then, has a tough road ahead of him."

Coming as it did on the back of PM Narendra Modis grandstanding attempts at diplomacy, it merits a deeper look at the governments foreign policy tactics. The government made grand overtures to one and all, and mounted a campaign with a lot of fanfare, only to have it come a cropper!Read | Will work with other members for Indias entry into NSG: USThe bid has exposed the fault lines in the governments attempts at backroom diplomacy. Consider this: in a press briefing post the plenary, the ministry of external affairs cited one country that scuttled Indias bid, an oblique reference to China. This, days after another presser in which external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj claimed China was not opposed to Indias bid, only to have it publicly shot down by a Chinese foreign ministry official who stated that Indias application did not feature on the agenda. As if that werent embarrassing enough, minister Swaraj dismissed any objection to Pakistans entry to the NSG, leading to the hyphenation of Pakistan and India as NSG aspirants on an equal footing, despite their contrasting proliferation records. This holier-than-thou attitude has once again left India looking embarrassed, because it has now emerged that Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif made a concerted effort to block Indias entry to the NSG by writing to no less than 17 of his counterparts. Is this the warmth and ease of relations between the two nations that minister Swaraj also boasted about? That in exchange for our PMs unscheduled stops at Lahore and Iftar party invites, India will receive attacks in the form of Pathankot, Gurdaspur and Pampore?Read | The perils of rushing inThe doublespeak and lack of clarity within the government are a worrying prospect because they threaten Indias position in the global order. It is clear that China was not alone in its opposition to India at Seoul, and prevailed upon fence sitters like Switzerland and Ireland, both of which PM Modi visited in the last year. His exhibitionism in each of these countries has drawn a grand total of nothing.So what are the lessons for PM Modi? First and foremost, that substance and finesse, and not fanfare, yield credible foreign policy returns. Diplomacy requires relationships to be built through thoughtful leadership, a mature meeting of minds and serious negotiations that yield tangible outcomes. The UPA government, under PM Manmohan Singhs measured and tactful leadership, dismantled the discriminatory nuclear architecture without any histrionics, pomp and ceremony. In 2008, India made a watertight case for itself with dignity and sobriety, and secured us a clean, one-time waiver from the NSG with no sunset clause. This waiver ended years of nuclear isolation after convincing member states of Indias exemplary record of non-proliferation, finally allowing it to engage in full civil nuclear commerce. Back home though, PM Singh had staked his government and personal integrity to ensure that the India-US nuclear deal and waiver came through, in the face of fierce opposition, not least by the BJP, which accused him of selling out national interests to America. The same BJP, which in 2008 unsuccessfully moved a no-confidence motion against the UPA, with typical hypocrisy, now hails the India-US nuclear deal as a centrepiece of the new strategic partnership between the two countries. But the NDA government has neither a sound understanding of diplomacy nor a proper plan of action, and being on first-name terms with President Barack Obama will only get you so far. PM Modi needs to ensure that there is synergy enough among Indias allies to win over its naysayers.Second, tackling China will require more than just a last-minute outreach to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a summit. In 2008, US President George Bush and secretary of state Condoleezza Rice had both taken a personal interest in securing India support for the waiver, making it hard for China to stand its ground in the face of US pressure. The US had intervened and lobbied on Indias behalf, commending its commitment towards non-proliferation as a responsible state. President Bush had himself lobbied extensively for India, even speaking to his Chinese counterpart to convince him to drop opposition to the India-specific waiver. In contrast, now there is a conspicuous lack of high-level American support for India, with neither President Obama nor secretary of state John Kerry personally lobbying for India. As a result, a far more aggressive China, with help from fence-sitter countries, has successfully thrown a spanner in the works. One cannot help but hark back to the visual of PM Modi and President Xi Jinping sitting on a swing at the Sabarmati riverfront. In a nasty turn of events, China has now left India hanging on the seesaw in midair, cheered on by its state media for taking a morally legitimate stand against smug, spoiled India.India has an impeccable record of non-proliferation, having worked hard to harmonise nuclear and dual-use export controls with NSG guidelines and implement all Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments despite being a non-signatory. But the governments ill-advised bid has left it looking insecure and vulnerable, undoing the UPAs efforts to ensure peace and stability in the region. The government must clarify its stand. What is its position on Pakistan? Will it continue its NSG bid as a public spectacle, or will it make a sincere effort to win confidence and rally support among member states? Ahead of the NSGs special plenary, India must concentrate on strengthening its relations with all countries. Will India stand up to China or allow itself to be bullied? Now that India has managed to secure membership to the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), it can use it as a bargaining chip to make China, whose application has been languishing since 2004, fall in line.PM Modi would do well to remember that statecraft needs to be calibrated, more often than not behind closed doors, built on groundwork, conviction and astuteness.Read | America is committed to Indias NSG entry, says top US officialJyotiraditya Scindia is an MP and the Congress partys chief whip in the Lok SabhaThe views expressed are personal"
5b2e2c9f9855b7245313f2aa,25 Years of Change: Why India's Farm Sector Needs a New Deal,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/25-years-of-change-why-farms-in-india-need-a-new-deal/story-9LXMbxV7BIDX54f9JvQabP.html,2016-07-26,"In chasing higher and higher GDP growth rates, India tends to gloss over two vital facts. One, farm growth cuts poverty twice as fast as industrial growth. Two, a 1% rise in agricultural output raises industrial production by 0.5% and national income by 0.7%, according to one calculation. In other words, the countrys fortunes are structurally tied to its farmers.Two-thirds of Indians rely on a farm-based income. A back-to-back drought last year led to a challenging farm duress. Rural incomes fell. Food prices soared. Farmers fretted. Yet, these effects are mild and nothing compared to a previous era.During 1965-66, a similar consecutive drought had put India on a knifes edge. Food output dropped 36% in those two years, data shows. All through the 40s, 50s and 60s, famines were common. Millions died.Many predicted another killer famine. Economists Paul and William Paddock prophesied a Malthusian horror of population rising faster than food output, declaring countries like India foredoomed.India signed off on an agreement with the US called the Public Law 480 to qualify for food aid. It was not just humiliating. With a Cold War on, food assistance was a political hazard because aid came tied with conditionalities. A taste of this came when the US stopped desperate wheat shipments for 48 hours right in the middle of the drought.Read: Policy alone cant determine Indias future, politics will play native roleTo end this dependence, India began putting together a policy framework, led by then farm minister C Subramanium. A breakthrough came when the country got hold of a fertiliser-responding high-yielding spring wheat variety from CIMMYT, an international farm research organisation. A similar variety of Indica rice came from the Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute.Nearly 18,000 tonnes of their seeds were dispatched to food-bowl states of Punjab, Haryana and western UP. Along with minimum support prices, fertilizer subsidies and irrigation cover in these pockets, an incredible green revolution took off. Within years, the results showed. India became self-sufficient in food grains.But thats about all Indias agriculture has been able to achieve. While subsidies were critical, overdependence on subsidies over investment was to be a costly mistake.The Green Revolution was actually only a wheat revolution. The technology was limited, the areas to which it was applied were limited, the crops were limited and the farmers who benefited were limited, said Uma Kapila, an economic historian who taught at Delhis Miranda House college. We all know growth requires investment. Over a period of time, we focused on subsidies at the cost of investment.Policymakers basked in the glory of the Green Revolution for too long, without realising the technology had run its course. The first signs of the Green Revolution diminishing emerged in the mid-1980s, when yields began falling. Today, India exhibits the lowest yields globally. Overall, the lowest returns from public subsidies were in agriculture, whereas investment was low.Read: Using telescope and microscope for meaningful growthThe rate of investment in agriculture in the 80s and 90s was between 8-12%. These years roughly coincide with the 6th and 10th five-year plans. With such low spending in agriculture, except for input subsidies, farm growth hobbled at 2.4% or so.In contrast, public investments, along with reforms, in other sectors were over 35%. This low-investment phase in agriculture was reversed only with the 10th and 11th five year plans (2002-07 and 2007-12).Even today, irrigated lands make up only 40% of the countrys arable land, making 60% of the net sown area vulnerable to monsoon failure.Higher farm output, the solution for more incomes with less farmhands, hinges on area and yields.The government has already tapped the easy areas, the ones most fertile and better irrigated. Area expansion has its limitations. We can no longer expand the area. The only way to go is to raise yields, says Kapila.Farm investment has now reached 20% or so of the GDP, but most of it comes from the private sector. While experts recommend more private participation, they say public investment must also go up.The consequences of a fading Green Revolution and a skewed farm policy are now showing up in politics. The violent agitations by Jats in Haryana and Gujjars for a sliver of Indias reservation pie are instances.Traditionally pastoral communities such as the Jats and Gujjars in northern states and even Patidars in western India benefited greatly from the Green Revolutions farm subsidies. The Jats participated heavily in the 1857 War of Independence, resulting in the British co-opting them with a lot of quasi-ownership of land. They thus acquired the bhumidhar (land-owning) status. Over time, this led to their dominance.Falling returns from agriculture at a time of higher economic growth could lead to more unrest. A 2014 survey by Lokniti found that nearly 40% farmers were so disillusioned that they wanted to abandon farming. Where do they go? On to the streets?Full coverage: 25 years of change"

Despite being biggest contributors in the central pool of foodgrain, Punjabs farmers are struggling for their livelihood now.India used to import petrol and diesel from Iraq while would import Basmati rice from India. But Modi stopped importing petroleum products from Iraq and replaced it with Syria. As a result, Iraq stopped purchasing Basmati from India, thereby pushing the farmer community of Punjab into deep mess, he added.He said Modi had vowed to implement report of Swaminathan commission, which is the only solution to farmers crisis, and waive debt on them, but he forgot that. So, we will offer him the blood to remind him of the promise he had made in the election manifesto and awaken him to redress the condition of farmers who are opting to end their precious lives. We will also gherao him, he added.Detailing about the programme, Zira said they have divided all districts into seven zones and blood will be collected from two farmers of each zone. He said he would visit to Barnala, Bathinda and Mansa districts on Friday to collect the blood.At the office of Amritsar district Congress committee (rural), he collected the blood of farmer Raghbir Singh, resident of village Sairon (Amritsar district), and Ranjit Singh, resident of village Gaddiwind (Tarn Taran district)."

The state administration will start operating formally from this complex with effect from Monday and arrangements are being made to shift employees from Hyderabad to Amaravati.For a change, the canteen scheme is named after former chief minister and Telugu Desam Party founder-president N T Rama Rao, apparently following criticism from various quarters over naming of every scheme after Chandranna (indicating Chandrababu Naidu).The Anna NTR Canteens provide breakfast, lunch and dinner to the poor people at heavily subsidised rates. The menu includes: Idli, Upma and Pongal, each for Rs 5 a plate during the breakfast. For lunch, they provide Sambar rice for Rs 7.50 per plate and pulihora (lemon rice) and curd rice for Rs 6.50 per plate. The dinner menu comprises two chapatis with vegetable curry for Rs 7.50 a plate.In the first phase, the government is planning to open 35 canteens in Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur and they will be extended to other cities in a phases. The government will incur a subsidy of Rs 40 on each person for breakfast, lunch and dinner, an official said.The chief minister said the government had started Anna NTR Canteen on Velagapudi as a pilot project and it would be expanded to different parts of the state. Well initially establish Anna canteens in 29 villages in the new capital city region of Amaravati, he said.Civil supplies minister Paritala Sunita said the government would also provide Oat Malt (ragi sankati) in Anna NTR Canteens in Rayalaseema.Earlier, Naidu personally served the food to the customers after the inauguration. He also had his breakfast at the Anna Canteen along with deputy chief minister Chinarajappa, ministers Narayana, Paritala Sunita and MP Galla Jaydev.The subsidised food outlets  Amma Unavagam  set up by chief minister J Jayalalithaa across Tamil Nadu were a huge success, which is said to be one of the factors for her return to power in the recent Assembly elections. In Telangana, too, the TRS government started Rs 5 a meal scheme under Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits and it brought victory to the TRS in the municipal elections held this year."

Not so much in its meteorological technicalities as in our reaction to it. There were times when we would be sturdy enough to play cricket in 40C without batting an eyelid (pun unintended). These days we rush to air-conditioned comfort zones when the sun is only half as punishing. In this era of baggy bermudas, colourful flip flops, mint mojitos, gelato ice-cream, frozen yoghurts, IPL, getaway vacations, and wellness resorts, the urban Indian has the wherewithal and the capacity to beat the heat in numerous ways.Folks from rural India still brave the ferocity of the season with limited means though. Thatched roofs, cool lassi, old-fashioned coolers and creaky fans make up their defence against the onslaught of the sun. Be that as it may, village residents stay healthier on the whole than their city-based brethren. We have all become, pardon me, rather namby-pamby.Thus the perceived need to sleep in the AC, cook in the AC, and even bathe in the AC! An affinity for air-conditioning appears to have inflicted the people of our country, to the point of overdoing it. Few can brave the adversity of a hot summer afternoon these days without the aid of modern-day technology. AC dehydrates our bodies and leaves us feeling weak and lethargic. The need to sweat a little during the afternoons and make do with just a fan at night is perhaps what the doctor should order.In some countries, there is a dictum that advises offices to keep the temperature at 24 degrees indoors. Men are permitted to not wear ties and remain comfortable. Here, we often try to get the cooling down to 18 degrees, especially in public spaces such as hotels and trains. And then we complain when we fall sick as a result of being exposed to 42 degrees on stepping outdoors.The need to roll down the car windows before switching on the AC in the mornings has been oft extolled but is still observed in the breach by some, to their potential peril. Some of us grew up at a time when car AC or any AC was unheard of. Straw hats, hand fans, kurta-pyjamas, rooftop charpoys, pedestal fans, and mosquito nets were still around. Road-rage was certainly less prevalent.Nowadays people have a really short fuse, especially in the summers it seems. Cool and calm minds are rarities. As are polite car users. But summers are also about invigorating morning walks, outdoor chats long into a balmy night, juicy gossip, and juicy fruits of all sorts, led of course by the emperor of emperors, the mango. Those men and women who have not partaken of mangoes in the confines of their homes, in a half-clad state, have hardly lived. And to those who avoid mangoes since they are fattening supposedly, I say humbly that they should avoid that spoon-full of sugar in their tea, avoid all toffees, chocolates, ice-creams, and even rice if they have to, but let us keep up the tradition of abiding love for the most succulent of Gods creations.Summer romances are short-lived. Mango deserts us by mid-August and melon even before that. So lets relish the taste of the season, and keep our cool, come what may. Summer time is fun time. Enjoy the season folks!vivek.atray@gmail.com(The writer is an administrator, author, and motivational speaker)"

She had confessed to having killed her daughter around 4pm on Monday and then dumping the body, Kumar added.The hunt for leadsWith no sexual assault visible on the childs body and no ransom call, the police suspected the hand of an insider. The mother emerged as a prime suspect after she was unable to explain the presence of sacks similar to the ones in which the body was found, in her house.On questioning from crime branch officials, the siblings of the deceased told the police that Manju had thrashed Piyu before her disappearance. Soon, Manju confessed to the murder.Accused misled husbandThe father of the deceased had, in fact, seen the sack when the body was still packed in it, but Manju misled him by claiming that it was for the family where she worked as a help.Even when the family launched a search for the child on Monday evening, she pretended to be part of the team.She even exhorted her husband to lodge a missing complaint.

His eyes are neatly lined in white and black. During a Trinamool Congress rally, he will be performing Mortine dance, which aims to spread awareness about malaria prevention.Welcome to the shrinking world of Bohurupi, the traditional folk artistes of Bengal. In the lead up to the upcoming state polls, Bohurupis have become an integral part of TMCs campaign, performing skits to attract crowds during the partys rallies.Through their performances, the artistes try to sell the benefits of the ruling partys schemes to the crowd. At some rallies they dress up as school teachers and inform the villagers about the Kanayashree scheme (welfare scheme for girls), while at others they stage a dance to depict how school students have received bicycles under the Sabuj Sathi scheme.While the Bohurupis might be able to change TMCs fortunes, their own condition remains desolate. On a good day, a Bohurupi manages to earn just about Rs 120. The custodians of the dying art are struggling to make ends meet.As part of a state government scheme, these artistes are entitled to identity cards, Rs 1,000 honorarium every month and four programs that would fetch them another Rs 4,000. However, only a few have been able to reap these benefits.Ironically, the scheme has in turn added to the communitys struggles. Earlier people used to give us money, as well as puffed rice and wheat if they enjoyed a skit. Now they think we are earning Rs 5,000 a month so they are not giving us anything, said 28-year-old Prasanta Choudhury Byadh."

The demand was made on three different occasions and Garg claims he refused to pay.Gargs application will be heard Wednesday. A special bench headed by Justice MB Lokur  hearing coal scam cases - will take up his plea in which he has sought SCs permission to give a statement before the special probe team investigating misconduct charges against Sinha.The panel  appointed by SC  is to submit a report on whether Sinhas alleged meetings with the accused in the 2G case and coal scam amounted to interference with the investigation. A visitors diary maintained at Sinhas official residence was given to the court by Common Cause  on whose petition the SC had ordered a CBI inquiry into the coal scam. Sinha has denied the charges.In his application Garg has detailed how Sinha allegedly forced him to pay-up immediately after CBI registered the case. The businessman denied the allegations and said he first met the former CBI boss after the FIR was registered in September 2013. His meeting took place at Sinhas official residence in Delhi where, the application read, the ex-CBI director asked for Rs 12.5 crore.When Garg refused to pay, CBI allegedly issued him a notice and arrested his company director. After letting him be in jail for two months, the agency filed a report in the court that no case was made out against the director. While the director was languishing in jail, Sinha allegedly asked for Rs 15 crore the second time to let off Garg.As per the application the CBI got an open-ended non-bailable warrant issued against Garg, which the Karnataka high court dismissed on January 28, 2014. By then a chargesheet was filed against him. Yet, Sinha allegedly called Gargs wife and demanded Rs 25 crore."

Baharul Sheikh who sells jhalmuri, hopes this tangy puffed rice mixture, which he gives away for free while campaigning, will make him popular enough to be in the assembly.Baharul, 32, is the Rashtriya Secular Congress candidate from western Assams Dhubri assembly seat. He is one of the poorest among the 525 candidates contesting in the 61 seats, where second-phase polling is underway.I am contesting because only the poor can understand the problems of the poor and try to do something about it, said Baharul. I know the big parties will buy votes, but I have only jhalmuri to give people I come across while campaigning.His rivals include Union HRD minister Smriti Iranis maternal uncle, Debamoy Sanyal, whom the BJP has fielded again. Iranis grandmother, Agomoni Sanyal, is based in Dhubri.Irani, unlike last time, has not campaigned for her uncle. I hope people vote for change this time, said Debamoy Sanyal.Baharul, a school dropout, fancies his chances because 70% of the voters are Muslim. But he is wary of perfume magnate Badruddin Ajmals All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), which wrested the seat from Congress in 2011.North of Dhubri, bordering West Bengal, is the Gossaigaon assembly constituency where the AIUDF is banking on the unlikeliest of candidates  a Telugu-speaking businessman from Andhra Pradeshs Vishakhapatnam district.Ravi Sankar Kasireddy, 40, came to Srirampur, on the Assam-Bengal border, with his fathers friend to join a transportation business. His success and sociable attitude earned him the AIUDF ticket from Gossaigaon, which falls in the Bodoland Territorial Council and has usually been represented by either a Bodo tribal or an adivasi, who are more in number.Mine is the only Telugu family in this constituency and my candidature speaks volumes of the assimilative nature of Assam, said Kasireddy, who has a Bachelor of Arts degree from Andhra University.Kasireddy too hopes to sail through on the strength of Muslim voters, who have gravitated towards the AIUDF after a series of communal riots since 2012. But he knows incumbent Majendra Narzary of Bodoland Peoples Front, a BJP ally, and Ashim Hasda of Congress are strong contenders."

Divisional commissioner Ravindra Pastore said all the collectors of the adjoining districts had asked the farmers to grow more vegetables. The farmers were even provided with seeds to this effect months ahead of the festival. He assured that the vegetable supplies would be arranged from the adjoining districts at the administration and the wholesalers end. Superintendent of police MS Verma said special care would be taken to ensure safe movement of vehicles carrying food stuff and milk to the city in the nights.However, peoples fear is not baseless as over five crore people are expected to visit the city with five lakh population during the festival time. This is going to put pressure on food availability, sources said.Pushkaran Dubey, an old city resident who usually buys one kg of potato and onion, bought 50 kgs of each on Friday as he fears short supply during the Simhastha.Even if other leafy vegetables are not available, I could at least have aalu ki sabzi for my family and guests who are expected to come for the fair, he told HT.Not only Dubey, many citizens could be seen buying veggies with long shelf value from the market.One Usha Chhajlani, a resident of Mahashewta Nagar, said that she had stocked a sack each of tuwar dal, rice and besan along with 15 kg tins of edible oil and other groceries. She said procuring the usual food stuff could be a problem during the Simhastha in the face of high demand. My house is going to be flooded with relatives from different cities so preparations to serve them have to be made early, she said.Arun Agrawal, owner of a leading cereal shop, said the police allowed unloading only during the night during the fair. Arranging workers would then be a problem, which might also timely supply of food items."

I was just two feet away from my father, looking the other way, when the beast emerged from the dense foliage and pounced on him, he says.But what was he doing in the tiger reserve? Mondol blames it on the 2009 Cyclone Aila, which changed the landscape of the region and laid waste to everything his family owned. We were simple farmers before it came. We had no option but to take to the forest for our livelihood, the 28-year-old says.Mondol is just one of the many residents of the Sunderbans who is staring at an uncertain future because of the cyclone.The Sunderbans  the worlds largest delta  is spread across India and Bangladesh. Of the 102 islands here, 52 are inhabited by 4.5 million people while the rest fall in tiger territory.Aila changed the face of the Sunderbans  from geography to socio-economic conditions to culture and politics. The storm damaged the embankments and saline water gushed into the villages, leaving the farmlands barren, says Subhash Acharya, former joint director of the Sunderban Development Board.Almost seven years have passed since the cyclone struck in May 2009, but all the problems plaguing the area  poverty, unemployment, falling agricultural yield, rising man-animal conflicts and the threat of climate change  seem to be here to stay.It is with indignation that villagers recount how chief minister Mamata Banerjee had promised to rebuild the embankments  which guard the inland ecology and human habitations at the islands  before coming to power.Thousands of villagers live in fear here. Sunderbans is a sitting duck  one cyclone and everything gets washed away, says Sasadhar Mridha, who manages the jetty at one of the islands.In the Sunderbans, both life and politics revolve around these embankments. Though the Union government had allocated around Rs 5,000 crore for building them, less than 20% of them have been strengthened till now. The government couldnt acquire land to rebuild the embankments, says a Gosaba villager. Others allege that corruption has marred even the little work that has been carried out on the embankments.It is an issue that Revolutionary Socialist Party, a Left Front constituent and Trinamools main rival on these islands, plans to grab in elections.The villagers, however, concede that the Mamata government has introduced a slew of development projects in the delta, including the provision of rice at Rs 2 per kg, financial help for schoolgirls and concretised roads. But will this be enough for the upcoming polls?"
5b2e33e99855b7245313fa42,India's Tale of Many Miseries,https://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/ipl-in-the-times-of-drought-india-s-tale-of-many-miseries/story-sbKinlcWWswYzO5fd3CHjM.html,2016-04-11,"All of good life is vulgar when there is misery around. Feasting in the sight of urchins, for instance, or kissing on the street in a nation starved of feasts, love, sex and foreplay. In the same category of vulgarity is the watering of cricket grounds in a state where there is a drought. It deserves lament, perhaps in a sweet mediocre collegiate poem. But to take the matter to court is out of proportion.The pubic interest litigations against the hosting of a cricket tournament in Maharashtra have fanned a moral outrage that is, like many urban moral outrages, a confluence of serious concerns, contempt for a wealthy organisation, pious exaggerations, irrational arguments and personal agendas.The issue before the Bombay High Court was that Maharashtra should not be allowed to host the Indian Premier League matches because cricket grounds consume thousands of litres of water every day in maintenance. The court saved Saturdays inaugural match but asked, probably with anger, Are cricket matches more important than people? Now, the Board of Control for Cricket in India is a despicable private club of industrialists and politicians, but the courts question was hyperbolic. Also, people matter to the board because that is how it makes money.And what exactly is the reasoning of the court? Is not an international-grade cricket ground maintained when there is no tournament underway? If an active cricket ground exists, it would be watered on most days, or it would die. So why this fuss before the tournament? Also, the calls for the cancellation of matches are comical for a simple reason  it is on the days of the matches that the grounds are not heavily watered.Read | Tackling drought is states responsibility, not cricket boardsThe water that is used on an Indian cricket field, according to an official, is about 15,000 to 20,000 litres of non-potable water a day, or less than five tankers. That is as much fresh water that is required to make one kilo of chocolate, according to the data of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, a global network.Sunil Gavaskar, whose relationship with the BCCI, it is reported, has collapsed and whose lucrative contract with the board may end, wrote in his column, The issue of drought is one such where many lives are at stake. (True). I am no expert on ground and pitch preparation (True) Nor do I know whether the water that will be saved if the matches are not played can be used to irrigate the lands that have become dry and parched. (It cant be used). He went on to suggest that the matches should be moved out of Maharashtra. It is a small price to pay, for the alternative could well be unnecessary loss of lives of those whose hard work gives us our daily roti and dal.This is a mystifying exaggeration  the suggestion that if matches are held in three cricket grounds in Maharahstra the lives of farmers would be at risk. But it is a popular view.Read | No way we can do this: BCCI official on moving Maharashtra IPL matchesThere is much veneration of farmers in India by those who are not farmers. These are the very people whose greatest fortune was that their grandfathers or fathers ejected their progeny from the agrarian economy. Most farmers in India have small land-holdings and they are doomed. The reason why most Indian farms are land waiting to become real estate.If people really cared about water, all they have to do is adopt a healthy diet  quit eating red meat (just one kilo of mutton requires over 10,000 litres of water to produce, or half the quantity of water required by a cricket ground in a day), quit rice (one kilo of rice needs about 2,500 litres of water, but half of this does re-enter the hydrological system), wheat and sugar (about 1,000 to 1,500 litres for every kilo).Read | Tea without sugar more effective than IPL banThe human body does not require rice and wheat. In fact it does very well without grain. Rice and wheat are the staples of the world because they have been subsidised to be so. The world has promoted an unhealthy diet that takes considerable fresh water to produce. Add to it the evil called sugar, we have a species that sucks out water to eat poorly. The hypocrisy of those who are outraged by the watering of cricket grounds lies in their very paunches.And, if people really care about poor farmers they would fight for a greater role of science. India is unable to experiment with biotech, which includes processes to create drought-resistant crops, because the Donald Trump of science, Vandana Shiv has maligned the technology.It was inevitable that the talk of farmers and drought would bring up the outlandish hypothesis of farmer suicides, first popularised by Shiva and later sustained by other noted activists, like P Sainath, because it aligned with their economic grouses. Let me repeat an assertion this column made earlier while arguing that farmer suicides are primarily a depression story where poverty only plays a role:In a country where most people can be termed farmers, it is not anomalous that most people who kill themselves would be farmers. In fact, what is anomalous is that a huge majority of farmers who commit suicide are male. If both official and activist statistics are considered, it would appear that women in impoverished farming communities are among the least likely Indians to commit suicide. Activists who ascribe social, economic and political reasons for suicides would never be able to explain why. In most nations of the world, including India, the number of men who commit suicide is several times more than the number of women. this pattern is reflected in the gender ratio of farmer suicides.But the idea that farmers commit suicide because of crop failure or loans or that India is not socialistic enough, is a beloved of activists. There is a book waiting to be written here if you are interested and may I suggest a title: P Sainath Loves A Good Farmer Suicide.Manu Joseph is a journalist and the author of the novel, The Illicit Happiness of Other PeopleTwitter: @manujosephsanThe views expressed are personal"

Since the time my five-year-old daughter went missing, I am extra cautious with my other children. I used to always ask my sister to be careful, the aunt said.I am shocked with the incident. We were looking for her through the night. In the morning, the police told us her body has been found near the highway. We hope the police find the culprit at the earliest, said the aunt.Meanwhile, the girls sister suspects her mothers regular client may have taken the girl away on the pretext of giving her chocolate. I suspect a man, who came to our stall daily and would take her out sometimes on the pretext of giving her chocolates, may have a role to play in it. I have told the police about it. They are now looking for him."
