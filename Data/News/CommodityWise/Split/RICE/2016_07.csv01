But our hopes were dashed. I dont call him by that name anymore. Poriborton has lost its meaning, Das tells HT, elaborating about the bigha of land her family gave up in 2006 for a Tata Nano factory that never materialised.Located barely 40 kilometres from Kolkata, Singur is where it all began: The epicentre of massive farmer protests against the state governments forcible acquisition of land for the Tata factory that gave Banerjee a potent issue to script a historic regime change in 2011.But almost a decade later, the villagers who refused compensation packages are dissatisfied with Banerjee as the emotive issue of returning their land remains tangled in court.Didi visited Singur 38 times between 2006 and 2011. And she did not visit us for once since becoming the chief minister, says Krishna Bag, a neighbour of Das.Her father-in-law committed suicide when he realised he couldnt protect his land and both Krishna and her husband  Arun Bag  went to prison.Land was required in Beraberi, Gopalnagar and KGD gram panchayat areas. (Subhankar Chakraborty)They were accompanied in jail by their two-year-old daughter Payel, who went on to become the face of Singurs protests.They arent the only ones. Hundreds of farmers in the area felt let down by Banerjee who rode to power in 2011 on the back of a promise to return 400 of the 997.11 acres of land used in the Nano factory plot.Her (Banerjees) recent comment saying she had nothing to do even if the court took 50 years to pass a judgment has come as a rude shock to us, Bajemelias Gopal Dhara says, adding, During the days of the movement she never told us there could be legal complexities in getting our land back.But in spite of the complaints, Singur is ready to vote for Trinamool Congress Rabindranath Bhattarcharya. Local residents point to development work done by the state government and say none of the other parties  the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Congress or BJP  stood by their movement.Its true that Trinamool failed on its promise to return land but the administration is helping the families of unwilling land-losers with financial and other aids. There is no other way for these people but to bank on Trinamool, says Jaladhar Das of Beraberi, who willingly parted with his one-bigha land for the Nano plant.Every shareholder of land belonging to a farmer who parted with their land unwillingly gets Rs 2,000 and 16 kg of rice at Rs 2 per kg every month.For people not affected by the land acquisition or Banerjees movement against it, the development work Singur witnessed in the past five years is good enough reason to re-elect the Trinamool nominee.Roads, water supply and irrigation system have improved. Singur has got a college. People are regularly getting benefits allotted through various central and state government schemes. There is no reason why Bhattacharya should not win again, unless local Trinamool leaders play spoilsport, Robin Ghosh of Gopalnagar tells HT.Analysts say the development and welfare schemes is motivated by the administrations urge to compensate farmers in view of its inability to return their land.Singurs roads are metalled and without potholes. The drains even inside the villages are lined with bricks and the street lights all function. Their number has also gone up, compared to a few years ago.The culverts on canals and drains have all been refurbished. Locals have no complaint about the number of tubewells and deep tubewells."

For 16 hours, he sat in a small room with other children doing fine needle work on clothes. He got an hours break for lunch and dinner comprising of dal, rice and a vegetable. Anwar was paid `2,000 for his labour.Anwar says he worked in the zari unit for 2-3 months before a team rescued him and sent him to a shelter home.His brother, Rehman, says he is 14, but looks younger. Asked about the gruelling schedule, he replies, If we dont work, how will my family eat? His family comprises his parents, four brothers and two sisters.The brothers are from Palsa village of Bihar. They worked in Delhi and Mumbai before being brought to Jaipur by their elder brother. The children are among the 12 rescued from Bhatta Basti area of Jaipur.Vijay Goyal, coordinator of One Stop Crisis Management Centre, says around 80% of the children rescued are from Bihar, Bengal, Jharkhand and UP.He says children are made to work long hours in dismal conditions and also face sexual and physical abuse. The supervisors in the units often give gutka to the children to keep them in a stupor. Under its influence, children dont feel hungry or sleepy and keep working for long hours.Rehabilitation of rescued children is a concern, he says. The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) needs to make verification process more rigorous before handing children over to people who claim to be parents or relatives.But CWC chairperson Ram Prakash Bairwa says the committee is doing its best within stretched resources.Besides crackdown on middlemen, Manan Chaturvedi, chairperson of Rajasthan State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, says poor families should be given livelihood options.As per the 2011 Census, there are 28.12 lakh child labourers in Rajasthan. Of this, 14.61 lakh are boys and 13.51 lakh are girls. There are a total of 163 childrens homes in the state. (Names of children have been changed)"
5b2e39899855b7245314004f,Toxic Dal Could Be Back and It May Not Be a Bad Idea to Try It,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india/toxic-dal-could-be-back-and-it-may-not-be-a-bad-idea-to-try-it/story-ewjmwNGVvKPyekX5h1IJAL.html,2016-01-19,"Three new lentil (dal) varieties belonging to a family of legumes known to be poisonous since Hippocratess time could be back on your plates. But should you eat them?Indias chronic shortage of pulses  the essential soupy item in everyday meals  has made a cheap source of protein for millions very expensive. So, the country is thinking of bringing back khesari dal (scientific name: lathyrus odoratus), which became notorious after it was linked to neurological disorders, leading to a formal ban in 1961.Yet, khesari had its own advantages. It is a tough guy in the field, highly resistant to drought and floods. If revived, it could sell very cheap because of its coarseness.The khesari family has been historically notorious. In 1942, an officer at Vapniarca, a concentration camp in the then German-occupied Ukraine, began feeding Jewish inmates bread made of grass pea (lathyrus sativus), a close cousin of khesari, to see its effects. Many began limping within weeks and died. In a Nazi regime trying to push the frontiers of science, Vapniarcas inmates were guinea pigs.So, why would India want farmers to grow a crop known to cause lathyrism, a neurological disease from eating legumes of the genus lathyrus to which khesari belongs? Thats because the Indian Council of Medical Research has cleared three new varieties developed by farm scientists, in which they have cut the offending toxin BOA to safe limits.These khesari varieties are mahateora, ratan and prateek. These arent the same varieties which caused diseases back in the 1960s that led to a ban. Those varieties are simply gone, NP Singh, the head at the Kanpur-based Indian Institute of Pulses Research, told HT.Khesari is very similar to peas. When the government imposed a ban nearly five decades ago, there wasnt such a scarcity (of pulses), Singh said. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute and Raipur University began working on separate ambitious projects to develop varieties that would be safer.So, in the light of the ICMRs findings, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has sought the ban to be removed by the Food Standards and Safety Authority (FSSAI).Singh said 11.6 m hectare rice fields remain unused after harvest in eastern India because there is too little moisture to grow anything else. Thats where these new khesari varieties can be grown. People can consume it in moderation and use it as fodder.Moreover, khesari is still widely grown in Bangladesh. Experts believe large quantities of the deadlier variety are anyway being smuggled in every year.On the three new safer varieties, the jury is still out. The FSSAI is planning to run its own set of rigorous tests before allowing them to enter the market."

They count themselves fortunate if they stumble upon the carcass of a wild or domestic animal. These are staple food for 52-odd families living at a settlement in the Jonha hills. They belong to a small community called particularly vulnerable tribal group or PVTG in bureaucratic jargon but simply known as Birhor, the prefix to the name of their village or tola.Sarkar humre kar ration pani bandh koir diya, toh yahi khaye hai (Government has stopped our ration supply. Hence, we eat roots and dead animals), says Paklu, digging with a rusted sickle. He looks 20 years older than he is, skinny and eyes drooping from the shots of mahua he had in the morning.Mahua, the local brew, is a curse as well as blessing for these illiterate and impoverished forest-dwellers who depend solely on knowledge and skills passed down by their ancestors to survive.Basic social security schemes, mainly food and special pension, have either not reached them or had been discontinued. Alcoholism is rampant. Paklu has his mahua (alcoholic beverage) fix to forage and scavenge for food. The sick and feeble gulps down copious quantities of the heady drink to forget hunger and tame their appetite, locals say.At Birhor Tola, HT came across a heart-rending and sickening sight of at least five families peeling the skin of a buffalo  long dead and stinking. The skin will fetch them a few hundred rupees, enough for a community feast, while the meat will sustain them for at least a week. The stale flesh is a spawning ground for diseases. Thats least of their concern.This wasnt the case till some months ago. Trouble began when the Jharkhand government with all good intention rolled out schemes under the national food security act in October 2015 for more than 20 million beneficiaries, including endangered groups such as Birhors, Birajias, Baigas and Souriya Pahariyas. The old ration cards were cancelled; fresh ones issued  or have been in the process being distributed.At Birhor Tola, barring Meghanth Birhor, none have received the new ration card, thereby depriving them of the 35kg of free rice each family earlier used to get every month. The new scheme also entitles them to 35kg of rice a month. But they cant get it without the new card. I got rice through this card till September last year. They say this is of no use now, says 55-year-old Dukhiya Birhor. Women in the village make ropes while the men search for food in the forest.I earn Rs 15 to Rs 20 a week, which helps me buy a kg of rice, says septuagenarian widow Rupani Birhorin. Ranchi deputy commissioner Manoj Kumar wonders how the Birhors failed to get their new ration cards. We have extended the date of enrolment to January 31. A team will soon travel to the colony to help them."
