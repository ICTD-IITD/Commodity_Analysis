This has helped me immensely in gaining an acute knowledge of Indian cuisine and my career over the past three and a half years.On one of my many travels across Asian countries, I found an interesting pairing of red bell peppers with shimeji mushrooms and rice bran oil sprinkled with sea salt. It was prepared by a chef at a small restaurant in Bangkok. The dish was unique in its taste and appearance.I was intrigued if my team back at the hotel could create a westernised rendition of the same. After some brain storming, we decided to experiment with the flavours from both parts of the world, Eastern and Western and see how it would turn out.We tried many combinations and at the end, paired roasted bell peppers, truffles and sea salt with a dash of Japanese ponzu mayo. It tasted amazing but the team felt that a little crunch in the dish would elevate it to a whole new level. Since we had already tried and failed with our Western options, we looked beyond known cuisines and chose tortilla sheets for the base.The final product tasted incredible with all the flavours complimenting each other beautifully and thats how our famous Chilled Red Pepper Pizza was born!Heres the recipe for the dish:IngredientsRed Pepper - 200gmsTortilla Sheet - 1Onion (thinly sliced) - 25gTruffles (thinly sliced) - 5gParmesan Cheese - 10gRed Radish (thinly sliced) - 10gTruffle Oil - 10mlJapanese Mayonnaise - 25gSea Salt to tasteMicro Greens - 5gMethod Preheat the oven to 200 degree Celsius Place the whole peppers on a sheet pan and place in the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, until the skins are completely wrinkled and the peppers are charred, turning them twice during roasting. Remove the stem from each pepper, de skin and deseed them. Cut the peppers into thin slices and arrange the in a plate and freeze them Grill the tortilla bread to crisp, spread over Japanese mayonnaise and thinly sliced onions over it. Arrange the chilled pepper over the bread and season with sea salt. Add slices of radish, thinly sliced truffles, parmesan shavings. Pipe out the Japanese mayonnaise out it and cut into slices.

For, the turf war had started with the non-approval of the L-G of some popular schemes announced by the Chief Minister in the assembly.Welfare measures are being lost due to the L-Gs move against the governments decision, said Congress MLA and Parliamentary Secretary to Chief Minister K Lakshminarayanan.Since old age pension (OAP) beneficiaries were finding it difficult to withdraw money from banks, the Chief Minister had announced a scheme in association with banks to disburse pension at their doorstep. It was to take off in December, but there was no approval from Bedi, said Lakshminarayanan, adding there were 4,000 OAP and 21,000 differently abled beneficiaries.Distribution of free rice (20 kg per month) to every ration card holder on a regular basis has also not met with approval, he said. As the State Trading Corporation could not supply the rice, the government had sought approval for procurement from the market.For the last two months we have not been able to keep the electoral promise on uninterrupted supply of quality rice every month. It was announced in the budget, said Lakshminarayanan.Even problems in infrastructure could not be addressed, rued the former minister. Desilting of harbour mouth could not be done, despite the passage of four months. While the government keen to engage a dredger, the L-G wanted it to be executed by the Dredging Corporation of India (DCI). The DCI dredger arrived on December 4, but still dredging has not materialised, said Lakshminarayanan. Informed sources said one of the engines of the dredger had developed a snag and was under repair.Further, he said the MLA Local Area Development Fund was raised to Rs 2 crore in the budget, but the L-G has approved only Rs 50 lakh as she wanted the remaining funds to settle pending arrears."

So suggests a string of incidents that have been reported in the city recently.In one of the recent instances, a 65-year-old senior citizen Venkata Ramana, suffering from a chronic health disorder, and his wife Syamala were rendered homeless by a realtor who was reportedly helped by some policemen from Miyapur police station.The realtor Raju had been eyeing the land owned by the senior citizen couple for some time. He soon found an opportunity when the couple had to visit the hospital for some treatment. The realtor entered their house and threw their furniture and other household stuff on the road.When Venkata Ramana approached the Miyapur inspector K Ramesh and the then sub-inspector Ramulu, they were reluctant not only to register a case but even to accept the complaint for preliminary inquiry.Syamala, speaking to Express, said: I requested the senior police officers to help me at least in getting back the rice cooker and gas cylinder to prepare food for my husband.When contacted, Cyberabad commissioner Sandeep Shandilya said that the police officers from SI rank to senior officers, have been instructed to register cases when they receive a complaint. People come to the police seeking justice. If cops are involved in troubling the public, they will be subjected to stern action, the commissioner said.As many as 9 policemen suspendedTo deal with such errant policing, senior officers of the department have suspended nine police officers in Cyberabad, Rachakonda and Hyderabad police commissionerates.In Rachakonda, one inspector and three SIs were suspended within a span of 15 days for their errant behaviour.

The Union labour ministry is planning to draw curtains on the age-old system of cash and kind wages for the plantation workers and make cash payments in their bank accounts mandatory.Under the Plantation Labour Act, 1951, the wages of plantation workers include cash besides ration, healthcare and education services (in kind). The daily wage of a plantation worker in Assam, with effect from January this year, is Rs.137. He or she is also entitled to 35 kgs of rice and wheat every month at subsidized 54 paise per kg.The Congress asked the Centre to clarify if the money, to be given to the workers in lieu of ration which is viewed a part of their wages, would be on a par with market prices. We oppose the Centres move to kill the system of ration. This is not just anti-poor but also illegal, Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president Ripun Bora said.As of now, its not clear how much money a worker will get in lieu of ration. If the money is at the subsidized rate of ration, it will be a great injustice to the workers. We must not forget that the family members of workers also enjoy the fruit of the system. If the government implements the decision without examining these aspects, the miseries of workers will only increase, Bora said. Assam has some 850 tea estates with the number of workers (permanent and casual) estimated at around nine lakh. Together with their family members, some 25 lakh-30 lakh people are the beneficiaries of subsidized ration.The influential Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) said it would oppose the Centres move tooth and nail. Our stand is that the workers should keep getting ration provided by the management. A reason is that there is never any delay in getting it. Secondly, most workers spend their weekly wages in a day or two. Now, if a certain amount is paid in lieu of ration, many workers will misuse it on liquor or elsewhere, ACMS leader Nabin Keot told Express. If the government goes ahead with the decision by amending the Plantation Labour Act, it could trigger dangerous consequences across tea estates, he warned."

This would mean an end to the 170-year-old system of paying the workers in cash and kind.Under the Plantation Labour Act of 1951, a plantation workers wage is divided into cash and kind comprising ration, healthcare and education services.A plantation workers daily wage, revised in January this year, is Rs 137.

About 30 lakh people, including workers dependents, are beneficiaries of subsidised ration.We are not against cash transfer of wages, but the Centre has no clarity on how it will calculate the value of ration  at 54 paise or the market value of Rs 25-28 per kg. If the money transferred is at the subsidised rate of ration, it will be injustice to the workers, Congress state unit president Ripun Bora said on Sunday.A workers family members also enjoy the fruits of the present system. The government needs to examine the pros and cons before implementing a decision that appears to be pro-planters, he said.Bora also said the move was illegal since the Gauhati High Court in 2014 had stayed a similar move to kill the ration system soon after the Narendra Modi government came to power.The Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) said it would oppose the Centres move tooth and nail.Workers must keep getting ration from the management.

The anticorruption activist had her first major fight last week when Narayanasamy instructed officials to quit the WhatsApp groups the L-G had formed and Bedi hit back by nullifying the order. She then twisted the knife through a tweet, saying: When a leader wants things done he will promote shared info. When he wants control & dependence he will ensure they r kept divided/deprived [sic].Tension between the two power centres was building much before the flare up as the government thought she was choking off funds for various populist schemes. For example, it was claimed that she was sitting on two schemes to deliver funds at the doorstep to 25,000 diffabled or old age pension beneficiaries. Reason: The delivery mechanism involved the government paying Rs 20 per beneficiary to the bank. The other points of friction were the sourcing of rice from the open market for free distribution of 20 kg to each ration card holder; the contract to desilt the harbour mouth; and hiking the MLA Local Area Development fund.The L-G justified her position in a tweet: Am in Puducherry to ensure financial prudence. Public moneys will be spent where most needed. Bedi does have a point since implementation of populist schemes lend themselves to the possibility of corruption. Also, the Union Territory lives on doles from the Centre, so it must learn to spend wisely. But the elected government too has a point, as it is trying to honour its pre-poll promises. Isnt it up to the elected government to decide how and where to spend?Now that she has specified her last day in office, she has opened herself to speculation that she is prepping for the 2019 Delhi Assembly poll plunge for a second shot against arch rival Arvind Kejriwal."

The rice brought by the devotees in irumudikkettu is of the purest quality. The appam is made in hygienic conditions. It is ironic that the Special Commissioner chose to implement the High Court order banning re-use of rice brought by devotees, just days before Makaravilakku season, the Minister said.The High Court had in 2015 ordered that the articles brought by pilgrims in the irumudikkettu should not be reused or recycled. The TDB has been reusing the rice brought by pilgrims in the irumudikkettu for making appam for the past many years.Kadakampally said he suspected that the Special Commissioners action was deliberate. The government, he said, has asked the Commissioner to reconsider his stand and would also inform the High Court about the matter. If this situation continues, we will have to stop production of appam as the stock would run out in a few days, he said."

For Vibhooshanan Nair ,a stamp vendor and document writer of Kedaram, West Nada , Fort, Thiruvananthapuram travelling the Himalayas is a perennial pilgrimage.Whenever the snowy mountains and blue valleys beckon him, he draws the money from his piggy account he maintains with the Corporation Bank for this purpose and sets out in search of new destinations, most often lonely.PicManu R MavelilIt was the visuals of Sanyasins and others cooking rice in the hot spring at Yamunotri he had got accustomed through the News reels shown ahead of the screening of films in his youth caught his imagination and stirred his mind to venture out to tread the snowy mountains and bath in river Ganga. As I had no money I had to wait for several years as the paltry income I earn as a document writer could not have been enough to set out for the journey. But when I started my first trip to Haridwar, the Gateway of the Himalayas and dipped myself along with the Sannyasins during the Kumbh Mela in 2010, I noticed that money had never been the problem but it was the mental approach that hed been impeding the journey he said.When he got an invite to stay at the Abheda Ganga Mayi Ashram at Haridwar he could understand that life was going to change for ever. He visited Haridwar, Rishikesh and the upper legs of Himalayan mountain thrice in 2010 itself. As he wanted to travel every holy place in the Himalayas and Haridwar being the vantage point to witness the Kumhamela he purchased a small house on the bank of Ganga near Kankal for Rs.four lakh in 2011.As it is on the bank of Ganga there is no pattaya for the house. But no one would encroach it even though it remained closed for major part of the year he says. He has also entrusted a native, one Vinod as caretaker.As it is near the Neeldhara, where Sannyasins take JAL samadhi, he used to visit there and stay with sanaysins who meditate there.The cloud of smoke emanating from the hundreds of funeral pyres from Kankal will enlighten you and make you a more wise man  he says.His passion for travelling the length and breadth of Himalayas has been triggering him to set out for at least three trips to the various holy places in Himalaya a year.He has already visited Amarnath and vanish no devi braving the hardships twice. Already covered the holy chardham of Yamunotri,, Gangotri, Kedar , Badari and places like Gupthakashi,and Thunganath nearly half dozen times. He has already visited Pasupathynath temple in Nepal before it was damaged in earthquake. His repeated visits to kasi( Varanasi) and Utharkashi in jharkhand has been making him more concerned about polluting Ganga and excavating rocks from Ganga.Asked what he gained from all these journeys he would say :  I am a more patient, tolerant man now. My sudden fits of anger I had been experiencing in the earlier days has paved way for enduring suffering without becoming annoyed. When you are in lap of Himalaya, you learn to be patient.He is taking his wife Prabha also with him in his recent journeys."

Dancers from different classical dance forms will come together at Natya Rasa 2017, organised by Soundarapandian Bone and Joint Hospital on Friday. City Express caught up with Odissi exponent Reela Hota, Kathak pioneer Astha Dixit, Kuchipudi dancer Prateeksha Kashi and Bharathanatyam danseuse Radhe Jaggi, for a quick chat about their respective dance forms ahead of their performance.Despite India being a country where classical dance forms have been predominant, it has seen an emergence of other forms of art through globalisation.Reela HotaMany youngsters are taking up Western dance forms. Radhe feels this adaptation is a positive development. We live in a world where information and ideas can be shared at the click of a button, so why not our art? Its going to be very interesting to see how modern dance can be influenced by Indian aesthetics, she says. Prateeksha feels there is no dearth in the number of youngsters who are taking up classical dance forms. But I think the number of people who are taking their interest to the next level is decreasing, because being a professional dancer is quite demanding and there is no stability in it either.That being said, several dancers adopt yoga to attune themselves for the stage. Yoga has allowed me to be physically strong and helped me approach dance with sensitivity, shares Radhe. It also helps me understand the philosophy behind the words and steps we perform on stage. For Reela, yoga helps her with both mental and physical strength. It makes me concentrate better and gives me a sense of calm and serenity  both of which are very important for a professional dancer.Astha DixitOver the years, there has been a blend of various classical dance forms. But is it easy to do so with such diverse dance forms as Odissi, Kathak, Kuchipudi, and Bharathanatyam? Reela, who is known to experiment with Odissi and fusing it with other dance forms, feels that is easier than one thinks. Its quite simple actually. Sometimes the other genres movements help in creating fresh new movements for our own style. The thala and raga in all Indian classical dance styles are complementary. Kathak dancer Astha agrees adding, They all are uniquely aesthetic dance forms. When art meets art, aesthetics meets aesthetics, its always beautiful. Says Reela, Classical dances in India are like a bowl of rice made with different spices, though its taste varies but ultimately its rice only.Among all the classical dance forms, Bharathanatyam is the most prominent in India and abroad. Prateeksha believes that this dates back to the time when Indian classical dances were being revived after the British rule, when many institutions began to bring back the dance forms, Kalakshetra is probably one of the main reasons why Bharathanatyam is prominent now, she says. Reela, however, begs to differ. I feel it is prominent in Tamil Nadu, and though it may have a following across the country, each state has its dance form that is predominant there, like Odissi in Odisha.So how do they feel about performing in Chennai? I have performed twice here, and the audience has been discerning and appreciative, says Reela. I had heard that people in Tamil Nadu prefer traditional dances but I have performed thematic presentations on Kundalini Tantra and received a good response, she says. Having performed across cities Astha is looking forward to performing in the city. Chennai people are rasikas. They appreciate art. They feel the beauty and flow of of Kathak.Catch their performance on Jan 6 at Chinmaya Heritage Centre, Harrington Road, from 6:45pm onwards."

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

Apparently, the possible link is considered to date back to as many as 2,000 years! In search of the same, a nine-member team of archaeologists - scholars, curators, and professors from South Korea were in the region for the last two days, studying Indian petroglyphs (paintings depicted on rocks through pecking) and ancient rock art. And they believe, the art work seen on the megalithic rocks excavated from Mahabubnagar is way similar to that found in South Korea.The team from the South East Asian country visited Mudumal in Mahbubnagar, Telangana, Mallaypalli near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh and Kupgal and Hire Benakal near Bel lary i n Karnataka. However, Lee Hoen Jai, curator of Gyonggi Provincial Museum, in Gyonggi Do, South Korea who was in the city on a historical trip wasnt a happy man.They have destroyed all these beautiful megalithic stone structures with rock art that is distinct to structures that date back to BC 725. There are a number of geometric symbols that depict stories of life after death, that the people of those times believed in, he said expressing sadness. Prof KP Rao, department of History, University of Hyderabad (UoH) who accompanied the team on the trip, added, There are lots of similarities in the kind of art that is seen here on the megalithic rocks in South India and South Korea. There are similarities in the way rice is cultivated in both the places, and also Dravidian and Korean languages.These archaeologists are here to do a comparative study of art material here and other parts of South Asia, with a special focus on South Korea. Now a curator, Lee completed his PhD from UoH in 2007. I have studied these sites then and now. The sight makes me sad and sick, he added, referring to the stone henge structures found in Mudumal in Mahbubnagar, the only one that exists in whole of South Asia.The other is in England. It dates back to the 18th century and now it is destroyed though it is something that needs to be protected, added Lee, who was the only one who could communicate in English from the group. Pointing to his collection of photographs from Mallayipalli, a small town seven kilometres from Chandragiri near Tirupati, Lee explained the intricacies of rock art on the dolmen that date back to 7th century BC.There are 1,182 human figures on the underside of the dolmen of 420 mts. They speak largely about death and it is clear that they believed in life after death. The paintings talk about people leaving the earth, their burial and their comeback, Lee said. These paintings show that they also bury a dagger along with the body. This has also been found in some of the megalithic sites in South Korea. The group found these aspects relevant, interesting and also important, Prof Rao said."

If you have chilly chicken with curd rice, you will understand what Im talking about. I see cooking synonymous to experimenting. Ever tried mixing two different cuisines or reconstructing dishes? You should, it combines different flavours. For example, try making Baked Alaska with halwa and rabdi, instead of cake and ice cream.Chef Anand, Turyaa HotelIve been in this industry for 19 years and Im still learning. I started my career in Chennai and have had the good fortune of working with some of the best hotels. Being a self-taught cook, I started cooking as a young boy after my mothers demise. The first time I entered the kitchen, I burnt eight litres of milk! I still remember the first dish I made  it was a caramel dessert.A combination of sweet and sour is the best, like in Chinese cuisine. It is one cuisine that is so balanced, flavour-wise. They add jaggery to all of their dishes. Even if you check the recipes for cookies, youll see that they ask you to add a pinch of salt, to balance the flavour. You should always be careful to get the right flavour of the dish.Three ingredients that I always use while cooking are peppercorn, cinnamon, and cumin. These spices give the dish the best flavour and smell, and they are healthy as well. Did you know that cumin aids digestion? And I bet you also didnt know that it is good for most lung diseases. I suggest that everyone add these three spices to their food daily. But the most nutritious South Indian ingredient one can use in cuisine is fenugreek.There is one thing you should know while having food, especially if youre a food critic. Do not eat using just your mouth. Experience the food through its presentation. If a dish looks good, you will get the urge to touch it, to eat it. Thats when you know that youre in for a treat. The presentation of a dish is very important, that is why shows like Master Chef have points for it. To me, if I look at a dish and feel the irresistible urge to eat it, it is the biggest achievement for the chef.Dont have the ingredients for a tiramisu but have a sudden and insatiable craving for one? Try making it with jaggery, Mascarpone cheese and kalua (coffee liquor). Always experiment in kitchen, it will do wonders for your palate and cooking. The one person I want to cook for is someone who is a better chef than me, someone like Massimo Bottura."

If the decision is implemented, those families which were part of the BPL list and are now in the non-priority category will benefit.In a Facebook post, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has come out against the propaganda blaming the LDF Government in the state for the crisis in the ration sector. He said the Food Security Act should have been enforced by the previous UDF government, but it dilly-dallied on it citing various reasons.When the new government assumed office, barring Kerala most of the other states had already enforced the Act. The Union Government adopted the stance that rice allocation to the state will continue only after enforcing the Act, he said. However the propaganda is being carried out in such a way to create an impression that the crisis was due to the LDF Government, he added.The Chief Minister pointed out that the Statutory Rationing System came to existence as part of major agitations led by leaders like A K Gopalan. However with the new Act, the Centre has taken a stance that Kerala cannot be given an exemption from the decision that free rice would be given only to those in the priority list.With this, many families which were earlier in the BPL list are left without sufficient ration. Thats why the government is thinking about increasing the free rice quota of families which were earlier part of the BPL list and are now in the non-priority category. Along with this the government will also take all possible steps to ensure that Kerala gets a special consideration from the Centre in connection with rice allocation.Will do needful to get Centres spl considerationEarlier speaking at a programme at Mathamangalam near Payannur, Pinarayi Vijayan said the government would do the necessary to get a special consideration from the Union Government for rice distribution to the ration card holders.Its not the poor governance of the LDF Government that plagues the ration system in the state, but the delay caused by the previous UDF Government in processing and implementing the Food Security Act, he said.The Central Government has stated that they cannot provide ration concession to Kerala alone. As a result of this, many who were in the BPL list, were added to the APL list, he said."

After promising a solution to the woes of the people post-demonetisation, nothing has happened after the set deadline of 50 days.Team Modi is repeatedly trying to fool people through the governments ill-thought policy measures, he said while inaugurating a commemoration meet on the occasion of the 55th death anniversary of T M Varghese, former speaker and minister of erstwhile Tiru Kochi and Tiru-Kochi state Congress president.It is curious to note that how Modi is waxing eloquent on a cashless system in the country even after the negative impact of demonetisation is telling and the reality is that banking activity and a tech savvy handle are virtually alien to a vast majority of the populace.The KPCC president also flayed the State Government for burdening the people. Pinarayi Vijayan government is vying with the Modi government on how to throw people into more and more miseries. Welfare pension of 5.5 lakh beneficiaries has been slashed now without even proper verification. Even as the price of rice is soaring in the open market,the government is unable to make any effective intervention or put the ration system back on the rails.

He cooked beef soup and rice for the dogs on the first day of 2016.Located about 20 km from Darjeeling, Tamang got up quite early and started preparing biryani for the dogs. The dogs arrived at his Doranga Hatta home much before the feast was ready.For the past six years Tamang has been organising New Year picnic party for the stray dogs every year. Today at least 15 dogs from the locality feasted on the biryani in different plates lined up for them, he told HT.But why he is doing the favour only on the first day of every year? Kamal said I do give food to stray dogs regularly. But hosting picnic party for the dogs has its own significance to him.We human beings observe different festivals and parties, but the dogs who are very faithful to us cant celebrate.

When they returned, Sonu was weak and admitted to a hospital.Wadwis son survived and made a full recovery but about 400 other children died from malnutrition-linked illnesses in Palghar between April and November 2016 -- a rising trend that campaigners put down to an annual pattern of migration for work.In the last three years, malnutrition has claimed the lives of about 1,600 children in Palghar, a tribal region battling high unemployment and poverty, with national headlines over child deaths prompting government action to address the problem.Read: Maharashtra tribals dont eat wheat, barter it for salt, oil, says studyKhoch lies 150 km from Indias commercial capital Mumbai and close to the border with Gujarat, one of the countrys most prosperous states, but unemployment is forcing parents to move to cities to find work to feed their children.Palghars problem of malnutrition is shocking because of its proximity to Mumbai, but it is migration to Mumbai that is at the root of this problem, said Milind Thatte, founder of Vayam, a movement for tribal development.People from Palghar migrate to Mumbai for work, but the cost of living there is very high. They dont eat to save money.Villagers start leaving Palghar in December for the Mumbai satellite towns of Thane and Bhiwandi where they often work 12-hour shifts at construction sites or road building projects.Once the monsoon season halts construction, workers return to villages in July for a jobless spell until October, when the start of the harvest provides daily work on farmland.Locals refer to September as starvation month, when many people are unemployed and childrens deaths peak.The end of the harvest in December again signals the end of the villagers home stay.We have no work now, but we will leave soon. We are waiting for the seth (the construction site contractor) to come and take us, Wadwi said.BOTTOM OF THE LADDERNamdev Savara, a member of the Kathkari tribe, has devoted an entire wall of his one-room hut in Khoch to colourful depictions of Indian gods and goddesses.So when his son, Ishwar - which means the supreme lord in Hindi - died in September, he hung a black and white picture of the child on this wall of worship.Savara said he will not leave Khoch in 2017 and he will work on a local road construction project with his wife. The couple will stay close to their two other children who go to school.According to government data about 39% of Indian children suffer from chronic undernutrition and around 42.5% are underweight.In Palghar, malnutrition most affects the Kathkari tribe -- a one time forest community which is among the lowest in the pecking order of the Indian caste system.Most children who died this year due to malnutrition-linked illnesses were from the Kathkari community, said Nidhi Chaudhari, who heads the Palghar local government office.Vivek Pandit, an activist who has represented the area in the Maharashtra state assembly, said Kathkari people dont have land and are handpicked for their ability to do strenuous work.They work at construction sites, break stones for road construction or at brick kilns, Pandit said.Employers usually prefer to hire Kathkari couples as they coordinate better and are cheaper than two men, with men paid around 200 rupees daily and women anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees.The migrant workers survive on rice and the occasional dish of potato and onions, saving their money for the jobless months.WEAK AND VULNERABLEDoctors said children suffer due to irregular feeding patterns when both parents work long hours.The parents priority is not their childs health but to earn their daily wages, said Ramdas Marad, superintendent at the Palghar sub-district hospital that runs at twice its capacity in the monsoon months between June and September.Children are more vulnerable to disease such as pneumonia or respiratory infections during this time as they are weak and their immunities are compromised.The government is drawing up a list of Kathkari tribe members to ensure they benefit from the government schemes for jobs and education, among the others that they are eligible for.The government has even started a new road project in Khoch to attempt to slow migration, but only a handful of people who have bank accounts are so far eligible.Savara is among them but his decision to stay in Khoch this year is an anomaly in the village where migration began last month.Many, such as Wadwi, even committed to leave in September, when a contractor visited families and bought promises of migration against an advance payment.I know my child was malnourished when we migrated last year. But what will I feed him if I dont work? she said."

She never imagined it would be more than half a century before shed see him again. Like many Vietnamese women married to Japanese soldiers, Xuans family was split up, victimized by the stormy relationship between the countries.Watch What Else Is Making NewsToday, the former foes enjoy strong bilateral ties, with Japan and Vietnam cooperating economically as well as in other areas, including defense and security.In a sign of just how far the relationship has come, several surviving widows and families of former Japanese soldiers  including Xuan  will have an opportunity to meet with Japanese Emperor Akihito when he visits Vietnam for the first time this week.Japanese troops invaded Vietnam in 1940 and remained there until Japan surrendered to the allies in 1945, ending World War II. Xuans husband, however, was among some 700 Japanese soldiers who remained in Vietnam after revolutionary leader Ho Chi Minh declared independence from French colonial rule in 1945.The Japanese soldiers helped train Ho Chi Minhs Viet Minh to fight the French. But after the Viet Minh defeated the colonial forces in 1954, Xuans husband was one of 71 former Japanese soldiers who had to leave the communist North without being able to bring their families, because Japan was on the other side of the Cold War. He left behind his two children and his pregnant 29-year-old wife.I thought he was on an assignment for one or two years, but we then had no information about him, Xuan, 92, said recently.She said that after not hearing from her husband for six years, she and her family thought he had died, and set up an altar to worship him.Xuan had to raise her three children on her own by working on a rice farm in a village outside Hanoi. Villagers would call her Xuan Nhat, or Japanese Xuan, mocking her marriage to a Japanese man. Her children also were mocked.People called me Japanese son, son of a fascist. There used to be a lot of discrimination.

He said this while addressing the gathering after inaugurating a tribal convention, organised by the Social Welfare and Backward Classes department at the Dasara Exhibition grounds here. The CM said that he has instructed deputy commissioners of respective districts to clear the pending applications of the tribals.He called upon the tribals to provide education to their children so that they could join the mainstream of the society. Without education, it is not possible for the communities to attain development and achieve social, economic status in the society. There is a demand for upgrading the Ashrama Schools to PU colleges, and it will be reviewed. To encourage tribal people to pursue education, the state government has been issuing pension to educated unemployed youths of Koraga and Jenu Kuruba communities, he said.On the occasion, cash prizes of Rs 2,000, Rs 2,500, Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,500 were distributed to students, who have completed SSLC, PUC, degree and post-graduation respectively in the academic year 2016-17. Highlighting the Special Component Plan (SCP) and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP), the CM said, the funds under the schemes are allocated on the basis of population, and 24.1% funds have been reserved for SC/ST communities. In 2016-17, of Rs 85 crore under the scheme, Rs 19.542 crore has been spent on SC/STs.Siddaramaiah said, the state government will increase the quantity of rice being distributed to BPL families under Anna Bhagya from April 1. He issued sanction letters and other benefits to the beneficiaries on the occasion. Siddaramaiah said, the state government has been providing rice, edible oil, ghee, salt, eggs, sugar and nutritious food under various schemes to a select tribals and the scheme has been extended to the tribals in Chikkamagaluru district.Social Welfare Minister H Anjaneya said, forest personnel are creating problems for tribals, who reside inside the forest, and urged Forest Minister B Ramanath Rai, who was present in the event, to take measures to protect the interest of the tribals. Rai assured to look into the issue.Tribals seek internal reservationKarnataka State Lamps Cooperative Federation president M Krishnaiah urged the CM and other ministers to provide internal reservation for tribals to achieve political, social and economic equality.Madegowda, a PhD holder from Soliga community, said, even though he has earned a PhD degree, he is struggling to get jobs in universities and thus the government should provide internal reservation in employment."

The state has witnessed an unprecedented spike of 40 per cent in rice prices in the last four months. The increase in the price of Jaya, a variety sourced from Andhra, is attributed to the shortage of supply. There is a steep decline in the stock of Jaya rice this year. The prices were around Rs 37-38 last year, said a trader. He said rice traders had supplied a major chunk of their stock during the Onam season at Rs 28-30 per kg.The situation will improve by mid-April as mills start procurement after harvest, he added. The state consumes about 38-40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum and Jaya and Surekha account for at least 22 lakh tonnes of total consumption.Another reason for shortage of rice is the drought condition prevailing in the rice producing states. The yield has been very low this year compared to the previous year. The farmers have suffered huge loses said the trader. Food and Civil Supplies minister P Thilothaman said there was a spike in the price of Jaya rice due to shortage of supply. He said the popularity of the rice variety might have prompted the traders to create an artificial shortage. However, he said the government was considering market intervention including opening of more rice stores."

The Nazi symbol was drawn on the base of the founder William Marsh Rice's 2,000-pound statue in the heart of the Academic Quad lawn at Rice University, the Houston Chronicle reported.It accompanied the word ""TRUMP"", referring to the new US President Donald Trump. The incident was the third act of racist vandalism on the campus this month. Rice was not Jewish although the prestigious university does have a large Jewish student population. ""I have had it with this behaviour,"" undergraduate dean John Hutchinson said in a statement released by the university that was also posted on Facebook.""The use of the swastika clearly reveals that whoever did this is either ignorant of the history of true evil associated with this emblem of hate or is genuinely motivated by blind hatred."" If a student is discovered to have drawn the graffiti, he or she faces expulsion from the university, Hutchinson reportedly said. Meanwhile, similar signs were found in Chicago and New York too.Chicago Police released a surveillance video yesterday that shows a man smashing the front window of a synagogue and placing swastikas on the front door. In the video, the suspect pulls up to the synagogue curb in a dark-coloured SUV just after midnight, places the stickers on the front door and then breaks the glass with a metal object. He then gets back in the car and flees the scene.The incident is being investigated as a hate crime. And in New York City, passengers encountered swastikas and Nazi slogans scrawled on a subway train car last night. The sign also caught the attention of former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, who tweeted about it. ""We will not let hate win,"" Clinton said."

Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being served at the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalWith nine children falling sick after dead rats were found in their food, the spotlight is back on mid-day meals. The Indian Express tracks the food from the kitchens to the students, and discovers some bumps along the wayA peppery aroma emanates from the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur, amid a sputtering of machines and flurry of human activity. On a Wednesday morning, nearly 70 men  supervisors, cooks, housekeeping staff and helpers  mop the 3,400 square yard area, load three 500 kg capacity steamers with potatoes, wash over 2,000 kg of rice, roll out 50,000 puris, temper over 800 kg of curry, and, finally, test the quality of food. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.We have 104 people and the second shift, which prepares meals for evening schools, is at work now. Between midnight and 5 pm, our kitchen prepares meals for 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools, which is about 80,000 students, says Godfrey Pereira, the NGO secretary. His is one of the 43 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to 18.46 lakh children in Delhi schools, run or aided by the Directorate of Education, the north, east and south civic bodies, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board.Unlike rural centres, there are no kitchen-cum-stores on school campuses in Delhi, primarily due to lack of space. All mid-day meals are prepared and delivered by NGOs, selected through a tender every three years Its a massive operation, and a small mistake at any of the levels  procuring, cleaning, cooking or serving  can have major repercussions, says Pereira, 58, whose NGO has been a part of the programme since 2003. Ye floor se paani saaf karo, Pereira instructs one of the helpers, pointing to the water that spread after rice was drained. He has just begun his rounds of the kitchen and will inspect all departments  grain clearing, cooking, vegetable cutting, dish washing, frying and storage areas  over the next few hours.On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.The small mistake Pereira refers to is what could have led to dead rats slipping into mid-day meals served at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli earlier this month. Nine students were hospitalised after consuming food provided by Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, one of the 16 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to Delhi government schools. The incident prompted Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to ordered an inspection of 33 such kitchens by secretary-level officers.Pereira feels that though checks and balances are in place, an error can occur, or be introduced, at any stage, including after food has left the kitchen. You can never rule out sabotage. Its a competitive field and anyone who has lost out on the tender can bribe a driver or helper to spoil food, he says, checking the tempering of the potato curry. Jaldi karo, vans aane waali hongi, he says.Narender Singh, a member of the Suparbhat Education and Social Welfare Society, which supplies mid-day meals to 28 Delhi government schools, feels that problems run much deeper. While 43 NGOs get the contract to provide these meals, they end up sub-letting their duties to other organisations. In case of Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, food was being provided by a third party. In such situations, monitoring quality becomes difficult, alleges Singh, whose NGO has been delivering meals since 2004. Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas refused to comment on the matter. Then there is the issue of training the staff. These third-party vendors simply hire daily wagers. The government must look into this, he adds.***Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalThe mid-day meal scheme has been operational in Delhi for nearly 15 years now. A November 2001 Supreme Court order made it compulsory for all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide the meals. Two years later, the programme was first implemented in Delhi in 410 MCD schools, and in 2004, it was extended to primary classes of Sarvodaya schools, under the Directorate of Education. In October 2007, the scheme was revised to cover children in upper primary classes as well  VI to VIII.Since then, selected service providers have been supplying meals with a minimum of 450 calories and 12 gm of protein to children in Classes I-V, and with 700 calories and 20 gm of protein for students of Classes VI-VIII.Pereira, now checking the consistency of the kadhi in an 800 kg aluminium vessel, says that while NGOs try and stick to the calorific and protein requirements, the budget for meals is very low. We try and add ingredients such as soya chunks to meet the protein content, but apart from grains, which we get from the Food Corporation of India godowns, there is no subsidy on any ingredient and we pay market prices. We add seasonal vegetables, which are cheaper, but that is it. Spices, kidney beans, are expensive, he says, adding that the gas subsidy provided earlier has been taken away too. We use 90 cylinders a day; heating up large vessels requires a lot of fuel.The NGOs get Rs 4.13 and Rs 6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary classes, respectively. The organisations also get Rs 1,000 per month for the cook-cum-helpers that serve meals at schools and for Rs 750 per metric ton for transportation. The cost for the entire programme is shared between the Centre and the state on a 60-40 basis.Narendra Singh, whose NGO supplies food to schools in northeast Delhi, also complains about delays in payments. We are yet to receive money for December. In such situations, many NGOs are likely to falter on quality, he says.So, will increasing the number of service providers help? Not at all, in fact it will increase bureaucracy and make monitoring even more difficult, says a member of another NGO, which supplies food to 44 schools in northwest Delhi. You need to empower existing organisations. Increase funding, expand infrastructure and workforce Provide raw material and verify the stock on a monthly basis.Pereira agrees. The problem is that we are not considered a part of the government. The moment there is an incident, such as the one at the Deoli school, there is a blame game, and all fingers are pointed at NGOs. But its only if the government and the NGOs work as a team that issues will be resolved, he says.***The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schoolsThis is not the first time that the Delhi mid-day meal programme has come under scrutiny. In 2013, an audit conducted by the Union HRD Ministry found that the meal served in schools in the capital did not meet prescribed nutritional values. About 95 per cent of 365 meal samples failed to meet nutritional requirements in 2011-2012, and 98 per cent of 322 samples failed in 2010-2011. Seventeen NGOs were found violating norms.Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been part of several research projects on the subject, says, In cities, there is no space for kitchens on campus and that is where problems begin. Tamil Nadu is the best model where, except for Chennai, all food is prepared on campus. They dont rely on centralised kitchens (like the ones in Delhi). In Andhra Pradesh, sub-letting is not allowed. In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Tripura, all grains come from the nearest public distribution system store, so it is all subsidised. Why cant other states follow this model, and link PDS or Kendriya Bhandars with mid-day meals?***Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis SultanpurOperations at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys kitchen have picked up pace. Four delivery vans have started queuing up at the entrance. Inside, cooks and helpers are putting final touches to the food. Hundreds of stainless steel vessels are being rinsed in potassium permanganate liquid and wiped, before food is packed in them. A few women are locking the vessels with a plastic seal.Hansika Rawat, a teacher from the Tughlakabad Extension government school, has arrived for inspection. Teachers from schools we supply meals too conduct inspections. We get three-four teachers a day, he says, directing one of his supervisors to show Rawat around. Following the inspection, teachers are expected to fill up a questionnaire with queries such as: Is there proper arrangement for drainage of waste water? and Are CCTVs installed in all the compartments?.Pereira appears confident. We follow all directions. I can monitor CCTV footage on my phone. It is a 24/7 kitchen and that is the first thing I do when I wake up at 5 am, he says.The vans take off on their journeys to schools, some as close as a kilometre away, others at least 6 km away. This is another problem. I dont supply food to the government school right next door, some other NGO does. Schools need to be allotted according to location of kitchens, he says.One of the schools Pereiras organisation provides food for is the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School, in Deoli, a kilometre away from the school where dead rats were found. Before children take their seats on durries in the corridor, a series of steps need to be followed: The room where food is served is mopped, then two cook-cum-helpers open seals of vessels in the presence of Ram Kumar Meena, the mid-may meal in-charge for the school, and then Meena, a few other teachers and two parents  who were there to speak to teachers about their wards  taste the aloo-puri. Following approvals, at around 3.20 pm, the cook-cum-helpers begin serving the meals to Class I students, who have brought their own bowls and plates. We send the food back if we feel it is spoiled. But then students suffer. It is difficult to prepare the meals again at such short notice. We give students biscuits, etc. on such days, says Meena.Soon, the conversation drifts towards the neighbouring school where dead rats were found. My eldest son studies in Class VI in that school and he loves the kadhi-chawal. But since the incident, I have been packing his lunch from home, says Indu Devi, 40, one of the parents tasting the meals.At the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli, meals continue to be served by the same NGO. No one, apart from students, is allowed to enter the school. Principal sahab baat nahi karenge, says the guard through a small hole in the gate. A little after 3.30 pm, a few students scale the school wall and jump outside. One of them walks over to the general store and buys a packet of chips. I dont like the mid-day meals too much, says the Class VII student.Ask him about students who fell ill, and pat comes the reply: Yes, a few students were vomiting, but they werent from my class. Today kadhi-chawal is being served, but I will go home and eat, he says, walking away with his friends, all of whom have decided to give school a miss today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

There was no conspiracy, Beale said, adding that any questions of exhuming the body were ridiculous.Beale said he met Natarajan on a number of occasions.Sasikala was present much of the time and was closely engaged in the care in supportive manner, Beale said.It was a completely unexpected cardiac arrestwhy? We dont know. For someone in their more mature years, hypertension and diabetes, recovering sepsis may have contributed, said Beale, who had been flown in from London for the treatment.Beale was flanked by P Balaji of Madras Medical College and K Babu of Apollo Hospitals, who had signed in election forms on which her thumb impression was taken.Balaji said the former CM was fully conscious when she put her thumb impression on the poll papers.She was talking, eating, interacting with officials for about a week her sepsis made her tired, her breathing was getting worse she was put on a ventilator and sleeping medicinesfor 10 days she wasnt able to communicate continuouslybut she did so by signsafter we conducted a tracheostomy, she was awake for 10-12 days awake and communicating by sign and lip reading, said Balaji.She was completely aware and interacting for days, said Beale. He added that there no questions of releasing photographs of Jayalalithaa arose because it would breach privacy and confidentiality. No CCTV footage existed, he added.The doctors said she intermittently talked to the medical staff about what she liked to watch on TV, food and her rehabilitation.At a personal level, it was clear to me what a most remarkable lady she was. It was a privilege to be involved in her care. I could sense her dedication, said BealeShe was eating curd rice and watching television when she suffered the unexpected cardiac arrest which was witnessed, doctors said. She was given CPR for 20 minutes but when it failed, she was put on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 24 hours. It was then we realised that continuing care was futile. It was relayed to senior government officials and family, Balaji said.(With agency inputs).(With agency inputs)"

The state is now getting 14.25 lakh tonnes annually.After the meeting, Paswan tweeted a photo of him standing with Pinarayi. But he termed the Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam. However, Pinarayi took the episode lightheartedly. Pinarayi asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, Kerala needs higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed several demands in front of us. One is increasing foodgrain allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters. Pinarayi also demanded more subsidy as the state wanted to give subsidised sugar under the PDS. At present, subsidised sugar is supplied only to BPL families. The state has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrain allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state. It has also sought Central support to make extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here Monday his government is planning to hold another all-party meeting to resolve the BJP-RSS violence in Kannur.We had called an all-party meet earlier to ensure peace. We are planning to convene one such meeting again, he said.In Delhi to fulfil a wish list from the Centre, Vijayan met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and discussed Keralas ration issue and other pending projects, including the airports and an AIIMS.While trying to play down the protests over the Kannur killings, Vijayan said the RSS too must refrain from political violence in the state before campaigning against it at the national level. If the RSS is campaigning against violent politics, it must also refrain from all sorts of violent politics. The government does not support any kind of violence. We are taking necessary steps to maintain peace, he said.On a two-day visit to Delhi, Vijayan made light of the BJPs threat to impose Presidents rule in Kerala. He said a lot has changed in the country since the state government was dismissed in 1959 by the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Such threats will not affect us. The state government was once dismissed in 1959. Since then, a lot has changed. The BJP needs to understand that, said Vijayan.His statement came following Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu last week warning the LDF Government of serious consequences if it continued to unleash political violence on its rivals."

The last meeting is scheduled in Guwahati on February 15, sources said. Other places where the consultations were held are Delhi, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar and Bengaluru.With India having lakhs of people suffering from micro-nutrient deficiency related health disorders such as neural tube defects, blindness and anaemia, food fortification has been on the government radar for long as a viable option to address these problems.Past medical research in India suggested that fortifying food with multiple micro-nutrients or iron improved the level of biological markers like iron and haemoglobin. Multiple fortification was recommended over single fortificants because of increased health benefits.Members of the new FSSAI panel are Ambrish Mithal from Medanta Hospital; C S Pandav and R K Marwaha (Retd) from AIIMS, Delhi; Anura Kurpad from St Johns Medical College, Bengaluru; Yogeshwar Shukla from Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow; HPS Sachdev from Sita Ram Bharatia Institute of Science and Research, Delhi; K M Nair from National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad; P Ramachandran from Nutrition Foundation of India; Sumit Arora from National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal; Sirimavo Nair from the M S University, Baroda, and Abhya Harsulkar from Bharati Vidyapeeth, Pune."

He claimed that the farm sector in Odisha is in a bad shape due to lack irrigation facilities, while unemployment and migration are on the rise.Drawing a parallel between his 23-month rule, Raghubar said Jharkhand is making progress. Jharkhand is aggressively working to double farmers earnings with stress on consumption of locally grown agriculture produce. My Government pays old age pension of Rs 600 while it is Rs 300 in Odisha and the quality of `1 rice is very poor in Odisha, Raghubar said. Neighbour helps a neighbour and as a good neighbour, I have come to appeal to you to jerk this inefficient BJD Government from its slumber, he added.Stating that the BJP-ruled States are progressing rapidly, Raghubar called upon the people to vote for the party and pave the way for installing BJP Government in Odisha. Oram, in an appeal to the people, said, I am feeling alone and the victory of BJP candidates in rural polls will help me in spending more funds in the district.Oram said his Ministry has a budget of Rs 5,600 crores and he wishes to allot special grant of Rs 100 crores to Rs 150 crores to Sundargarh, but the State Government is preventing him.

After the BJP came to power, there was an alarming increase in the price of essential commodities. The Modi government has only been following a policy helping the corporates, he said.The Thiruvananthapuram leg of the rally will be led by N K Premachandran MP.

The death of Rohit Vemula only showed how much hatred the government had built up in society, he added.Referring to demonetisation, Sudheeran said it was a big failure. The Prime Minister, who claims everything would become normal in a few days, has not yet said when it is going to happen, he said.He lashed out at the Centre for insulting IUML leader E Ahamed, who had a cardiac arrest while in the Parliaments Central Hall. It was an insult meted out to the deceased parliamentarian.

Shubhangi Khapre Beedi workers fear that if they dont update their accounts regularly, factories may manipulate their wages. Shubhangi KhapreDattubai Krishnai Jadel (70) is a widow. At 11 am, after making a meal of dal, rice and bhakri, she settles down to roll beedis. She has a target of 800 to complete. This would fetch her Rs 110. In the heart of Solapur city, clusters of row houses with women furiously filling tobacco into neatly-cut leaves rolled into beedis is a common sight. Renuka Balaji Bilgunde (40) has set the target of 1,000 beedis. This would earn her Rs 140. Surajana Konda, bogged down with domestic duties, manages 800 beedis. Away from the heat and dust of electoral politics, 65,000 beedi workers in Solapur have only one issue on their minds: Will someone help them overcome the ordeal of running to banks twice a month to collect their payments?WATCH VIDEO | Fake Rs 2,000 Notes From Pakistan Smuggled Into India Through Bangladesh BorderThe Centres demonestisation move and push for cashless transactions has compounded their woes. An average beedi worker, who earns Rs 110 to Rs 140 daily, would earlier be paid a sum of Rs 870 to Rs 987 once as week. Now, every time they go to the bank to withdraw money, they have to wait in queue for almost three to four hours. Moreover, they only get Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000.Surajana explains, Earlier, if we earned Rs 1,200 or Rs 2,400, we were immediately paid the entire amount. Now, banks either pay us Rs 1,000 or Rs 2,000. The missing Rs 200 pinches. We do not oppose the fight against corruption or the change. But somebody should end our ordeal. If we spend four hours at the bank, our work suffers. Who will compensate for the loss of Rs 110 daily? she asks.In the city, there are 12 beedi factories with 137 branches, which provide daily wage work to almost 65,000 women. The beedi workers are unfamiliar, and hence apprehensive, about technology. Laxmibai Perala says, Prior to cashless transactions, we had fixed dates for payment. The factory supervisor would maintain a register. We would get our daily wages every month on 2, 9, 17, 24. We knew exactly how much to expect and if there was a discrepancy, it would be pointed out on the spot. Now, we cannot immediately update our pass books, as it requires another visit to the bank.Beedi workers fear that if they dont update their accounts regularly, factories may manipulate the wages and cite some reasons to justify underpayment.There are other complaints against factories. Renuka says: Every day, we collect tobacco and bundles of leaves from the factory. The process of putting the leaves in water, cutting them and rolling the beedis follows. But when we take the beedi bundles to factories, they reject them and cut our payment if the leaf has colour variations. To ensure quality, we have to shell out money from our own pockets.Says CPI (M) leader Adam Master, What is more worrisome is the Centre incorporating difficult provisions that would impact beedi workers. Now, they want factories to have a label saying tobacco chewing is harmful for health. Or they want to do away with this work. The question is, what will happen to the 90 lakh beedi workers across India?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But now, I think I found my Valentine. The Vellore Culinary Trail organised by KeyTerns and curated by Foodie From Madras took 20 enthusiastic foodies (and some self-confessed non-foodies) on a trip to Arcot and Vellorevia Kanchipuram.The trip began with a battle between biryani and thayir sadam  two comfort foods by which you can judge a person! But at the end of the trail we knew who would win. The team of 20 including youngsters and the young-at-heart, bonded over food within the first 30 minutes of the journey. We knew who liked or disliked what.Kanchipuram idli, biryani, makkanpeda and filter kaapiFirst stop was on a road side. No, not shop, but literally, the side of the road. Our organisers wanted us to experience the traditional Kanchipuram idli, due to time constraints we had to eat inside the bus. Nevertheless, that did not stop us from enjoying the kovil idli.While this is circular and cut into semi-circular pieces, the common somewhat-cylindrical idlis are called tumbler idlis.A tumbler is coated with ghee and the fermented dough with pepper and curry leaves are mixed together and steamed. The ghee is to ensure that the idli comes out in shape, explained Gowrishanker Siva aka GS, the Foodie From Madras.Like every Tam-bram, I like my breakfast with a steaming hot cup of filter kaapi. Only coffee to the rescue! The shop, as the name suggests, was started in Madhuranthagam, and the franchise on the Kanchipuram highway serves more than just coffee. Served in a brass davara-tumbler, the coffee, took me back to my Coimbatore days, where every other day I would take time out to have a cuppa at the famous Annapoorna Hotel, which too serves similarly.Breakfast done. Nap taken, we reach Arcot at noon. We stop the bus on the narrow road, much to the ire of the lorry and two-wheeler drivers. We were standing outside a small shop that claimed to have introduced the Nawabi sweet, Makkan Peda to the public. Made with 11 ingredients, it is a meal in itself! This shop is 185 years old and five generations of our family has been running this, beamed Sundaram Chettiar.Legend has it that his great-great grandfather, Govinda Chettiar was close to the Nawab of Arcot. When the Nawab invited him for lunch, he was served this sweet. He tried to replicate the sweet based on what he saw, because he couldnt decipher it based on taste. Initially, we added palkhova, dalda, raisins, and a few nuts, he shared.The 20 of us loved the sweet, forgetting for a moment that biryani was awaiting us.The non-vegetarians were surprised when Sundaram Chettiar announced that he had specially packed authentic Star biryani.The hotel opens at around 10 am and you get their biryani only if you are lucky, told Srinivasan from KeyTerns. And our group was lucky or what! Packed in Mandhara elai, the fragrance of the biryani stayed intact and two people were asked to share one packet as wait for it, this was round one!The real deal was set up at The Vellore Kitchen. I get turned off by the pungent masala smell from biryanis. But this was mild. Thats the specialty of Vellore biryani. People here like it mild, so we make them that way, said P Gokul Raj, proprietor of the hotel. The rice is half cooked and the dum (vegetables and spices) is added and then cooked for a while. The rice used here is Seeraga samba, which is heavier than the normal rice.Suddenly, the trail turned into a sweet walk. We roamed the streets of Vellore looking for the oldest hotels and shops selling sweets and biscuits. Imagine finding an authentic Rajasthani hotel in a place in South India, which was ruled by Nawabs. Talk about cultural diversity!Dilip Rawals family served the North Indian doctors from Christian Medical College, Vellore. Over years, they have been famous for their lassi.Double Malai Lassi, Badam Pista Lassi and Badam kheer are famous here. Students from VIT come here just to have that and it is filling, he said, and yes he was right. The lassi was thick and filled with malai that it was even hard for two people to complete a glass. After a short walk, we reached Delhi Sweets, which has been doing business for 70 years.A spoon full of their fruit halwa, (another version of the kasi halwa) and a bite of khova jangri is enough to give you a sugar rush.As the trail ended, we made a wise decision to stop at Ratnagiri temple, only to go up and down the 150 stairs to digest what we had eaten over the day.(For details about food trails, visit their page on FB, FoodieFromMadras)"

The most affected districts, according to the NHRCs statement, are Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam (the delta region), Villupuram, Pudukottai, Ariyalur and Cuddalore.S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, cites monetary crunch triggered by demonetisation as the primary reason for the current state of affairs.When a farmer realises that he or she does not have immediate cash to attend to the ailing crop, he or she feels depressed. There are reports of farmers dying out sheer helplessness and shock, he says.An agricultural expert, who wishes to remain anonymous, says most of those who had died are senior citizens.An official in the Agriculture Directorate, clarifying that it is the job of the Revenue Department to handle issues concerning compensation, points out that a number of officials of the State government are visiting the drought-hit areas for an on-the-spot assessment, after which the government will announce the next steps.The insurance salveThe official explains that under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana [the new crop insurance scheme launched by the Centre in January 2016], 13 lakh farmers have, so far, been covered against eight lakh farmers last year under the earlier crop insurance scheme.Nearly 80 per cent of the farmers in the Cauvery delta region has been roped in under the new scheme, which entails higher compensation, the official says, adding that the government will come to the rescue of even those farmers who have not been covered under the insurance scheme.Mr. Ranganathan says the government and the farming community should do everything to increase productivity so that rice production does not go down steeply even if the crop area gets shrunk during any drought in future.Also, as more and more farmers are using high-powered pump sets, the capacity of distribution transformers need to be immediately augmented.The power supply for the pump sets should be provided on rotational basis so that the farmers do not use water and electricity indiscriminately.For the next five or six months, landless labour should be employed only for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, providing a period of holiday for agriculture, he added.Besides the likely fall in production, the State is witnessing a spike in deathsof farmers"

Radhakrishnan and AnuSivaraman, had stated that the articles brought by pilgrims in the Irumudikkettu should not be reused or recycled.The foremost question raised by pilgrims is what made the TDB authorities sit quiet on the High Court order for all of 23 months, instead of taking necessary steps to procure quality rice for Appam preparation?The FSD officials have been periodically inspecting the Appam-Aravana plant at Sabarimala since the beginning of the ongoing pilgrim season.PerplexedPilgrims appear perplexed over the inordinate delay in complying with the court order and the time chosen by the department to act against non-compliance of the High Court order by TDB.Interestingly, the TDB decision of 2015 to fully mechanise the Appam preparation at Sabarimala too remains a non-starter, despite the successful installation of a demonstration unit in June, 2016. The TDB still follows the practice of engaging contractors."

But in this year of monsoon failure and drought it is found to be easily taking hit leading to failure of crop, said P.T.Rajendran, a lead farmer and district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam. Amirthalingam, a farmer in Kappalur, cultivated Bapatla in three acres and ended up harvesting only 15 bags. Another farmer Sampath in Kalasapakkam got nearly 10 bags per acre by cultivating Bapatla. However, traditional varieties of paddy like Kalarpalai and Vadansamba, naturalised hybrid variety like Ponni , time-tested hybrid varieties of ADT series fared better , he added.I myself cultivated Kalarpalai, Ponni and Bapatla in my land. While Kalarpalai gave excellent yield, Ponni withstood well and Bapatla wilted quickly. It is not the government but only the market that fulfils the needs of the farmers. Traders promote certain varieties of seeds without much local field trial . Farmers dont even recall the names of the varieties that they cultivate, Mr.Rajendran said.Officials in the agricultural department spoke on condition of anonymity that the Central government was no more subsidising the seeds of time-tested varieties such as ADT 37 (called Gundu) and ADT 43 (called deluxe). It insisted that subsidy could be given only to newer varieties of seeds. But it was hard to find successful alternatives to these varieties. About 75 per cent of seeds required by farmers were supplied by the market. When asked for better practices to be adopted during drought, he said over-use of urea made crops greener but they easily wilted in the drought."

However, if you are hungover today, go for a greasy English breakfast complete with sausages, fried eggs, toast and orange juice.Comedian Sanjay Manaktala says, ""Hangover is nature's way of telling you that you're no longer superman and it's time to come back down to earth  one headache at a time. To get over my hangover , I drink a cold glass of water the second I wake up, go to the gym for an hour and then have a biryani.""Dr Sagnik Chattopadhyay says, ""Keep a large jug of glucose water on your bedside table and keep yourself hydrated at all times. Also, keep a couple of paracetamols and D-colic tablets handy. Antacids, such as Pantoprazole with Domeperidone or Ranitidine, can be useful. Disprin helps some people, but it is not recommended unless prescribed by your doctor. You can also have black coffee, but remember to follow it up with a lot of water as it is also dehydrating. Have your doctor's number on speed dial so that you can notify him in case of emergency.""""A hangover is best handled with the consumption of water. I would say drink (only fruit juices, green tea and water) like a camel. Eat plenty of fruits and veggies to flush out toxins after the party binge. Lemon, ginger and honey in warm water is also good,"" says fitness expert Wanitha Ashok.In an ideal situation, it's advisable to apply a soothing under eye gel and moisturize your face before going to bed. But if you are too far out to carry out this ritual, put a cold towel on your face for at least 10 minutes to de-puff your facial skin. Ice closes your pores and returns the elasticity. Sucking on ice cubes also helps in making you look fresh and rearing to go!"

MustafahK_K_Mustafah;K_K_Mustafah -Water scarcity in drought-hit Palakkad has worsened with the eastern and western regions of the district witnessing alarming depletion in groundwater level.As per the Ground Water Authority, groundwater depletion is alarming and unprecedented.While the Chittur- Vadakarapathy- Eruthempathy- Kozhinjampara belt in the eastern region recorded an average depletion of eight metres in groundwater table, the rate is five metres in the western region comprising Pattambi and Thrithala.Because of the failed monsoons, groundwater recharge has not happened in these areas. The poor state of the Bharathapuzha and its feeder streams has also contributed to the grim situation in the western region.In the eastern region, borewells beyond the permissible depths are the villain. It is estimated that Eruthempathy grama panchayat alone has 500 illegal borewells and Vadakarapathy 580.While the rules stipulate a maximum depth of 160 ft, most borewells in the region are over 1,000 ft. The borewells have contributed to the drying up of the Bharthapuzha river basin months ahead of the summer months.The district is facing acute drought despite it having three major rivers and more than a dozen reservoirs. The rainforests of Silent Valley and Parambikulam have also failed to minimise the impact of summer.Paddy cultivation in the traditional rice bowls of Chittur taluk has been affected with the lack of irrigation water. The drought is almost complete in Alathur region.Poor state of MalampuzhaThe Malampuzha dam, the biggest irrigation dam in the State, which supplies drinking water to Palakkad town and six adjoining grama panchayats, has not much in stock to meet the requirements of the summer months. The badly affected municipalities are Ottappalam and Shoranur.Among the dams, Kanjirapuzha, Mangalam, and Pothundy have witnessed a drastic fall in water level. The Walayar dam has dried up already. Last week, the Kerala Water Authority sought police protection for its 15 pumping stations in the district fearing attack from people facing acute drinking water shortage.Normal functioning of the Ottappalam, Shoranur, Ongallur, and Vallapuzha drinking water schemes has been affected in the last two months.Water scarcity is acute in in the 745 sq km stretch of the Attappady tribal belt."

As many as 850 million people across the world suffered hunger while in India, it was 260 million.Our dependence on a few crops has negative consequences for ecosystems, food diversity and our health. The food monotony increases the risk of micro-nutrient deficiency. We are slowly forgetting how to identify, cultivate, cook and conserve hundreds of local varieties that have adapted over time to the climactic conditions and the characteristics of every kind of land, he said.Millets are off the kitchens because people dont know how to cook them. Wheat and rice are the only two cereals Indians eat. This situation has led to vitamin deficiency in many people. Our grandmother knows better than anyone else about a balanced diet.Diet modification can do the trick. Eat a diverse diet and that will lead to a healthy ageing, he urged. The challenge is to find out ways to add the taste factor to healthy foods.A cookery competition on low cost nutritious recipes, model and poster presentation on Food Science and Nutrition and organic food stalls by women entrepreneurs of COWE was organised on the sidelines.COWE chairperson A.

The restored message will be handed over to the civic body in Solapur, where Kotnis was born, on Sunday.Later on Tuesday, an unveiling ceremony will take place at the Mumbai University and it will be attended by Chinese ambassador Luo Zhaohui.The document, which has been penned in traditional Mandarin using a special ink, is about 3-ft long and has been made from traditional rice paper. Kotnis' family had donated the document to the Solapur civic body which had put it on display at a museum there. The restorated document is expected to become an attraction at the Solapur museum.An associate research expert at the Gansu museum, Zhao Li , who is an authority on restoring calligraphy art, and a retired cultural relics research and restoration officer at Shanghai Museum, Zhu Pinfang, have restored the document. The restoration work took nearly two weeks.In 1938, Kotnis, who was working at JJ Hospital, was sent to China on a medical mission. He served on the frontline and saved the lives of many Chinese soldiers during a war with Japan. He later married a Chinese, Guo Qinglan , and died at the age of 32 after spending four years in the country. Touched by Kotnis' service in China, Mao, a master calligrapher himself, wrote the moving tribute that says: ""The Chinese Army has lost its arm and the nation its friend.""Explaining the importance of the document, Zheng Xiyuan, consul-general of the People's Republic of China in Mumbai, who is spearheading the exercise, said, ""The calligraphy artefact sent by Chairman Mao is priceless and shows the historical friendship between the two countries and the regard for Dr Kotnis. The Chinese leadership has kept in touch with the family and made it a point to meet his sister Manorama every time they visit India.

Still, the northern fringes of Puzhal and Red Hills are fighting perception battle, bringing to the fore the working class north and the posh south division, prevalent in the city.A closer look at the developed pockets in the city reveal that the state government's backing is all that is required to give the developemental boost to an area. The IT corridor on Old Mahabalipuram Road, the well planned East Coast Road were pet projects of former chief ministers M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa respectively. The urban growth on GST Road is also seen as a peripheral development to the IT corridor. Now GNT Road is waiting for the much-needed government boost to transform the area into a planned urban township.And why not? Realty developers describe the area as a 'hidden gem' which has cheap prices, good road connectivity and water resources but yet few people choose to live on the stretch. Data with the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) reveals the southern fringes have 10 times more housing projects underway when compared to the north. While the authority granted planning permission to more than 4,300 dwelling units in the areas spread between Perungalathur and Guduvanchery last year, it has given nod for a little over 400 dwelling units in the stretch from Madhavaram Bypass and Red Hills. ""One can have a 1 bedroom flat for a monthly rent of Rs 2,000 here. This pricing is unimaginable in the southern fringes of the city,"" said Govindaraj, a resident of Puzhal Camp, an erstwhile suburb which was merged with Greater Chennai Corportion. The cheap prices, however, do not draw people and some residents feel it is so because the negative perception about north Chennai as a hub of criminal activity, has a cascading effect. ""These perceptions are baseless,"" said Hussain, a resident of Sakthivel Nagar in Puzhal.Connectivity being a major factor in development, the south outshines the north in this department as well. On GST Road, three rail over bridges have been inaugurated in the past five years and work is underway on two more. Moreover, the National Highways Authority of India is planning to convert GST Road from Perungalathur to Chengalpet a eightway lane by building an elevated corridor. On the other side, the 10km stretch on GNT Road lacks road infrastructure projects. The IT hub at Ambattur seems to have little impact on the stretch, unlike the information technology corridor of OMR, which spurred real estate projects in the neighbourhood.Ajit Chordia, former president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India Chennai chapter observes that the government has a major role in making the stretch a residential area. He attributes the unequal development between GST and GNT to the way the city was planned, where in the industrial corridor was in the north and residential areas in the south. ""The northern fringes of the city are ideal for residential apartments. But, the initiative has to come from the government, where Tamil Nadu Housing Development Board need to take up projects,"" he said, adding that the speeding up the Smart City project at Ponneri could be a spur.Grievances of little attention is paved towards launching new initiatives in these areas was visible among the locals. C Manoharan, a resident of Redhills said this stretch cannot be associated with any industry expect for the traditional rice mills. Noting that defence establishments at Avadi changed the face of the area he said. ""Land at the airstrip in Sholavaram is unused for a long time. Why not the government explore a major initiative that would usher in development in our locality?"""

Murugesan, a marginal farmer from Sambakulam in Mudukulathur block, the worst affected area in the district, had cultivated paddy in two acres and chilli in one acre after borrowing Rs. 50,000 from a local money lender and virtually at the crossroads after losing the two crops.As there were problems in securing farm loan from the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Credit Society (PACCS) after demonetisation, he had borrowed money on three paise interest to raise the paddy crops, spending Rs. 20,000 and the chilli spending Rs. 30,000 but lost both the crops due to the failure of north east monsoon.He, like scores of other farmers in the block, took up the cultivation in August-September last year pinning hopes on the five madai Public Works Department kanmai (waterbody) in Sambakulam and three madai Union kanmai in Udaikulam but both went dry this season.The paddy crops were 60-days-old when the rains failed during the crucial terminal stage and he lost everything, he said. In a bid to make good the loss, he had cultivated chilli (Ramnad Mundu variety) and that too withered, he said sharing his tragic story with The Hindu at Udaikulam on Saturday.Overnight he became a labourer and goes for wood cutting and other odd jobs to eke out a living.He managed with free rice distributed in the ration shop but payment of interest (about Rs. 1,500 per month) to the money lender was a huge burden for him. He also has to mobilise money for the studies of his son, a polytechnic student in a private college. I swear in the name of Sun God that I feel like ending my life every day, he says with tears welling up in his eyes.K Viswanathan, a marginal farmer from Udaikulam also has a similar story to share. He had borrowed Rs. 90,000 from a money lender for paddy and chilli cultivation and to meet the educational expenses of his son. Both farmers complained about procedural difficulties in obtaining farm loans from PACCS.They would be able to repay a portion of the loan if the government helped them with drought relief. They had insured the paddy crops but could not mobilise Rs. 1000 per acre to insure the chilli crops. Mobilising Rs. 3,000 to insure chilli crops raised in three acres turned out to be a huge task for the poor farmers. They wanted the district administration to come to their rescue by arranging credit facilities for paying premium through PACCS."

It's aptly called the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, but a doctor from Mahad , a four-hour drive from Mumbai, recently found out that the presence of ajinomoto salt  better known as mono sodium glutamate or MSG  in Chinese food could even lead to life-threatening swelling of tissues.A 23-year-old who had eaten triple fried rice around 8pm one evening was rushed to Dr Himmat Bawaskar 's hospital around 6.30am the next day facing difficulty in breathing, swallowing or speaking.Dr Bawaskar discovered that the patient's uvula  the pendulum-like projection hanging above the throat  was so swollen, it was touching the base of his tongue.""We couldn't examine his throat because of this swelling,"" said the doctor, who has published a report on the incident in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine.Experts say the first thing a doctor is likely to ask a patient complaining of migraine is whether they had just eaten Chinese food. ""MSG could be the cause of migraine in people who are sensitive to it,"" said Dr Altaf Patel, director of medicine at Jaslok Hospital , adding that the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome was a well-recognised phenomenon first described in the early seventies. ""It is not common, but it isn't unheard of,"" he added.Why is MSG a problem? ""Australian studies have shown that MSG produces an-gioedema  swelling underneath the skin 16 hours after ingestion,"" said Dr Bawaskar.Chinese food also contains preservatives such as meta-bisulfate soya sauce, and colouring agents such as sunset yellow or tartrazine that could stimulate allergic reactions.Dr Bawaskar's report reads, ""A sensitive individual may suffer from headache, giddiness, sweating, abdominal pain, and urticaria (rashes) within a few hours of consumption of MSG. Angioedema (swelling of tissues) may be delayed up to eight to 16 hours after... and it may persist for 24 hours."" Dr Bawaskar said the swelling of the uvula can be lifethreatening unless patients and physicians are aware of unusual medical reaction to MSG. As for his 23-year-old patient, the doctor gave him an adrenaline injection, which helped the swelling subside."

""The government states that this would allow the poor to celebrate Pongal with joy, but unfortunately a section of Tamils have been discriminated against,"" he said. Only rice card holders are considered for such government welfare schemes like 20kg free rice, fan, grinder and mixies, he added.The activist said there are many poor people like small tea shop owners, sweet stall owners who preferred a sugar card for whatever reason. ""It is hard to accept the logic of denying free gifts to sugar card holders,"" he said. The special Pongal gift hamper contains one kg of raw rice, sugar, cashew nuts, raisin, cardamom and two feet long sugar cane each.Originally, at the time of issue and renewal, the public were given the option of either a rice card or sugar card. Anyone could apply for a ration card. There is no eligibility criteria. Once they choose the type of card, the public cannot change it, said the activist.The activist in his petition stated that out of the 2.05 crore ration cards in Tamil Nadu, 1.74 crore are rice cards. Police cards account for 69,000. There only are 11 lakh sugar card holders. ""When the government is prepared to provide free gifts to nearly 1.90 crore card holders, denying the same to 11 lakh sugar card holders alone in Tamil Nadu without any basis is discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable. Even the consideration given to Sri Lankan refugees is not given to sugar card holders of Tamil Nadu,"" he said.The activist plans to move the high court if the government fails to respond in this matter."

In Goa, the preparation is called shevyo or shirvaleo, researchers say, adding that it has been known to this part of the globe since the 1st century AD.Unlike in other regions, where the dish comprises part of a whole meal and is eaten with meat and/or fish curries, in Mangaluru and Goa, it is generally consumed as a light breakfast or an evening snack and relished with a sweetish, coconut-based dressing locally called ros.In these parts, shevyo is also made from ragi (finger millet) flour, particularly for those seeking a healthier option. Rice shevyo, however, is still the more popular of the two, with the ragi version almost non-existent in Goan homes now.Nevertheless, shevyo makes a rare appearance on our breakfast tables because it is quite a cumbersome dish to make; a tasty delight like it cannot come easy. Another reason is that the shevgo, a bronze or iron instrument used to press rice or ragi balls into noodles, are found only in a few homes.""To make ragi shevyo, boil water and add ragi flour and salt to it. Prepare the dough. Make balls according to the size of the shevgo being used, put them in boiling water and let them cook for 15 to 20 minutes. Break open one of the balls to ensure they are cooked well inside. Once they are fluffy enough, remove them from the water,"" explains Vasundhara Naik of Savoi Verem.These ragi balls are then put into the three-legged shevgo container and pressed into noodles.To prepare the ros, grated coconut is ground and the milk is extracted. This coconut milk is then cooked in water to which salt and jaggery are added.Further south of the continent, the method adopted to prepare these noodles is different. The dough is prepared by adding salt and water to the flour and pressed into noodles. These are them placed into idli cookers and steamed. A wheat version also exists down south, but is not heard of in Goa.The freshly-pressed noodles are traditionally placed on banana leaves or fine, linen cloth to keep them from sticking to one another.Just a taste of shevyo, made either from rice or ragi, will hit home why it has persisted among communities ever since its first-known mention in Tamil Sangam literature."

The general refrain is that food quality has deteriorated further on running trains. Stale food, inflated bills and demand for tips are some of the most common complaints passengers register during or after their train trips.Most of the passengers of Patna-New Delhi Rajdhani Express (12309) TOI recently talked to alleged that the quality of meals has deteriorated in the premier train. ""In the name of meals, passengers are being served stale food in the Rajdhani Express,"" said one of the passengers travelling in the train.According to the aggrieved passengers, while quality of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals served in the Rajdhani Express is poor, the quality of tea and breakfast also needs to be improved. ""Railways is charging flexi fare in the Rajdhani Express from passengers. Thus, elite passengers expect better quality of meals in the train,"" said Ashutosh Sinha, an aggrieved passenger.The plight of passengers does not end here. All trains originating from Patna Junction are reaching Delhi abnormally late these days due to foggy weather condition prevailing in the north central region. The passengers, therefore, are served just rice and pulse or rice and 'chhola' as 'additional food'. Poor passengers have no option, but to fill their empty belly.Railways has taken over catering services from Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) under the new catering policy of the Indian Railways. However, IRCTC is still providing catering services in Rajdhani Express and Shatabdi Express trains.""Railways has directed all its zones to set up a cell for strict monitoring of supply and quality of meals and other items served to passengers on running trains or at railway platforms,"" an IRCTC official said. According to sources, Railways has set up a team of commercial inspectors in every zone to carry out surprise check of food quality served to passengers on running trains. These inspectors are authorized to check premier trains like Rajdhani Express and Sampoorna Kranti Express to ensure supply of quality food to passengers.Maintaining cleanliness and hygiene while serving food to passengers on running trains is a must for pantry car staff. Under the new catering policy, the Railways has also decided to maintain quality, quantity and price (QQP). However, all these measures, it seems, are on papers only as the ground reality is quite different. ""The Railways should implement its proposals and improve quality of food on running trains,"" said Amal Gupta, another passenger of the Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express."

Essentially a kind of theatre or performance arts, puppetry  in its own charming manner  strings together elements of music and storytelling too. The city is now gearing up for the latest edition of the Dhaatu International Theatre Festival, which will see puppeteers from different corners of the world exhibiting their art. Describing puppetry as a grand, versatile and entertaining form of art, festival director Anupama Hoskere says, ""This year, we have as many as 16 artistes taking part in the event, who, apart from performing, will also run workshops and conduct conferences.""According to Anupama, unlike some other art forms, audiences do not necessarily require prior knowledge to understand and appreciate puppetry. ""It has a vibrant and universal appeal that makes way for a curious quest. In India, our traditions are contemporary cultures too,"" she says.Anupama adds, ""An art form may become stagnant for a while, but does not actually die out. The way things are practiced may change with time, people and social structures. The goal of this festival is to blur the difference between urban and rural artistes, and make puppetry mainstream. This will not only lend a modern perspective to this art form, but also craft and create a platform for struggling artists from remote areas of India. Participation of international puppeteers means there will be a lot of exchange of ideas too.""In Karnataka, Bengaluru, Mysuru, Tumkaru, Mangaluru, Bellary and Belguam are places that majorly nurture puppetry. Shadow and stringed puppetry are the popular types practiced in the state. The Dhaatu puppetry group have had performances in Russia, China, France, Belgium and the US, apart from conducting sessions in various schools, universities and corporates in India.""We are bringing a special Ramleela performance, which comprises 11 characters, to the festival, this year. We travel to different parts of the country and also work in association with the Sangeet Natak Akademi. Puppetry is a progressive form of storytelling that speaks for a cause. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao has been a constant theme of our shows. Through our art, we want to eradicate superstitions and blind beliefs that engulf our society. Our shows are popular in some places, but financial constraints remain. Last year while travelling to Bengaluru by train, we failed to get seats reserved and so had to keep standing throughout the journey. Puppet shows get lost in big cities, where people prefer big music and theatre events. The payment we get are sometimes not enough to sustain,"" says Rajan Kumar Srivastava, a puppeteer from Varanasi.Traditional puppeteer from Hassan, Gunduraju, says, ""Puppetry shows are very popular among in the villages of our district. In a year, we carry out up to 300 shows. Children like comic performances more, while the elderly are moved by kathas particularly stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata. I specialize in leather puppetry, and have conducted shows and workshops in India and abroad. I believe that puppetry has all the potential to go mainstream. All we need is to invoke a little more interest among the urban folk.""Puppets are an ancient and popular form of folk entertainment. Puppetry is said to have originated in 5th century BC in India. There are four types of puppets  glove, rod, shadow and string. Glove puppets are worn on hands, and the middle finger and thumb act as hands of the puppet, whereas the index finger acts as the head. Rod puppets are manipulated by rods, and usually three joints. Shadow puppets are made from leather and the moveable joints are supported by a thin bamboo strip. String puppets are made of wood, wire, cloth stuffed with cotton, rags or saw dust. They are manipulated with 5-7 strings that are tied to a prop-up.Translating to 'a play of leather dolls', this form of shadow puppetry is unique to Karnataka. The first mention of leather puppets are found in the puranas. The earliest patrons of Togalu Gombeyatta were the Rashtrakutas, and subsequently, the Pallavas, Kadambas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Marathas of Kolhapur. In Karnataka, shadow puppetry owes its origin to chitra katha or scroll paintings.The Gombeyatta presents stories from epics and the puranas. The music is dramatic and is a blend of folk and classical styles. The performances usually start with an invocation to Lord Ganesha, Goddess Saraswati or any other Hindu god, and usually begin at night and continue till dawn. It can sometimes go on for as many as nine days. There are over 40 types of composed scenes, where as many as 10 puppets are in a scene. There are a 6-8 people in a group. Most puppeteers are said to be farmers, who believe that a show brings long life to their cattle and protects them from draught and other natural calamities. There are 4-5 musicians, who sit behind the screen and play instruments such as madalam, harmonium, tal, cymbal and mukhabeena.Some scholars have classified Gombeyaata into three broad categories  Badagalapaya (North Karnataka), Tenkalapaya (Old Mysore state) and Mudalapaya (the border of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh). This is based on parameters such as the size of the puppets, the stage and the positioning of the artistes.The puppets are usually made from goat or deer skin as they absorb colour easily. The characters are then drawn on the skin, cut out, decorated with dots, lines and holes, and painted using the mural style. The puppets are supported with a thin strip of smooth bamboo that is fixed vertically along the middle on either side. The puppets have joints on the neck, shoulders, elbows, waists and hips, and are styled on the figures depicted in the Chalukya, Vijaynagar and Hoysala temples. Red, blue, green and black are the colours used for the puppets.Bengaluru is said to have the largest collection of leather puppets in the world, which is housed at the puppetry gallery at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishat. The over 3,000 leather puppets have been sourced from the erstwhile Hyderabad State, Mysore State and Madras Residency, apart from Adoni, Madhugiri, Ballari, Ananthapur and Nagamangala areas.This string puppet play is highly stylized as it adheres to the norms and standards of Yakshagana Bayalata. This form involves wooden puppets that are about 18 inches high, which are adorned with costumes, elaborate makeup, heavy jewellery and colourful headgear that look like those worn by the characters of Yakshagana Bayalata. Episodes enacted in this Gombeyatta are usually based on Prasangas of the Yakshagana plays. Like Togalu Gombeyaata, the music that plays at these shows is also dramatic and blends folk and classical elements. This puppet show is a big draw in the Uppinakudru village in Udupi's Kundapur, where it has survived the onslaught of social and economic ravages. It is now practiced by a handful of devoted practitioners.The puppets are made out of light wood, and have joints at the legs, shoulders, elbows, hips and knees. They are manipulated with 5-7 strings that are tied to a prop-up. Some of the more complicated movements are manipulated by 2-3 puppeteers at a time. Some puppet troupes have now replaced strings with rods for easier manipulation. The puppets look different, depending on the region. Those made in North Karnataka are short and slim in appearance, having a pair of legs and hands, whereas those of South Karnataka are three-feet-high and without legs."

Suvarna, a class 2 dropout, trained under 21 different gurus. Suvarna, who belongs to a poor family and dropped out of school in class 2, said that learning the dance form was the only option he had.""At that time, survival was key. So, I started learning Yakshagana. Like in the gurukul system, I'd live with my gurus, learnt from them, performed chores and they'd take care of my food and stay. Initially, that is what I was interested in. However, after getting into it, I grew interested in preserving our ancient traditions,"" said the director of Yakshagana Kendra, Udupi.Performing at the two-day seminar organized by Dhaatu, titled 'The philosophy of the culture of the rice belt art forms in India', ahead of the international puppet festival , Suvarna enacted snippets from a typical Yakshagana fare, like the scene preparing for war. Vidya Shankar Hoskere, co-director of Dhaatu, an NGO, said India was revered the world over for being the motherland of puppetry , but we were letting go of this ancient gift.""In 2011, we got the chance to learn about puppetry as an art form in countries like the Czech Republic, France and Belgium. Once there, we saw how much more foreigners knew about our culture. They have taken the basic format from us and adapted it to their culture, like producing Romeo and Juliet,"" he said. This year, there are participants from Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Czech Republic.Hoskere said puppetry is a composite art form, which, though not classical itself, draws from music, dance, theatre and poetry to create something new. From a presentation on the masks of Sri Lanka to a discourse on the nature of dance sculptures in Karnataka, the seminar covered a variety of topics. The annual puppet festival has been a hit for the last many years. This year among other things, people can look forward to swinging marionettes from the Czech Republic and string puppet shows from across the country.Of Yakshagana's enduring appealA single bell, hundreds of which form the anklet that Guru Sanjeev Suvarna wears during his performances, costs nearly Rs 100. The market price for the ordinary ones though is just Rs 3. This is because there's only one family left in Udupi which crafts these bells with silver and an alloy and the tinkling sound they produce is unique.S A Krishnaiah, a researcher of Karnataka folklore, says so nuanced is the sound of bells made with silver and an alloy that they were first incorporated into Bharatnatyam and then Odissi; such is the impact Yakshagana on other art forms. Sharanya, a theatreperson and an Yakshagana student under Guru Suvarna, says that it is one of the oldest functioning theatres in the world.""There are over 300 seasonal melas and festivals, especially in Malenadu, that go on all night. People still come in hordes and pay to see it, as they can expect something different each time,"" says Sharanya. According to her, the source of Yakshagana's enduring appeal lies in the fact that it has evolved with time, and accommodates spontaneity in narrative, allowing the individual to improvise on stage. ""Interestingly, during the emergency when free speech was restricted, Yakshagana dancers incorporated their dissent into the dialogues,"" she recalls."

We learnt that many children in government schools lack nutritious food. Through our mid-day meal scheme, we wanted to provide hot, tasty and nutritious food. In June 2003, we set up a kitchen to cook for 10,000 students in four days. By November 2003, we were serving 16,000 students and by June 2004, 24,000 children. Today, we have 5 kitchens and serve over 2 lakh students.Serving quality meals was not enough for us. So, we set ourselves a goal - eliminate garbage and fossil fuels from kitchen. Vegetable peels were used in compost and coconut shells as fuel. While paper waste was sent for craftwork, water used for washing rice went to the garden. In a week, we managed to cut down from 500kg of garbage a day to zero waste.Nothing has gone from our kitchen to the municipal bin for the past 6 years. We moved to renewable fuel like bio briquettes, biogas and coconut shells, saving 15,000 LPG cylinders per year.The pass percentage among students increased from 30% to 90% and the number of first-rank holders rose from 70% to 94%. Incidences of anaemia reduced to 3% and protein deficiency to 5%.

58e52c547be9e05a951f508a,Genome map boost for tea,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1170105/jsp/northeast/story_128603.jsp,2017-01-05,"Guwahati, Jan. 4: Scientists from tea research institutions of the country are working on developing a genome map for Indian tea, which will help the industry get new tea clones with high yield and superior quality. A genome is an organism's complete set of genetic instructions. Each genome contains all the information needed to build that organism and allow it to grow and develop. A genome map will help understand the exact genetic control of different characters of tea that govern its yield, quality and other attributes. It will help tea scientists develop tea clones/varieties with desirable attributes and, thereby, help the industry to get new tea leaves with high yield and quality. Genome mapping is used to identify and record the location of genes and the distances between genes on a chromosome. It is a critical step in identifying the genes involved in a genetic disorder. ""Tea, a popular drink in India, is facing challenges in production because of different types of abiotic and biotic stress. Around 40 to 50 per cent crop loss is reported because of this. To combat climate change and reduce the chemical load on tea, development of quality planting materials through biotechnological interference using DNA markers is highly needed for plant breeders,"" A.K. Barooah, director of Tocklai Tea Research Institute, told The Telegraph. He said the project would provide a new opportunity to develop a super tea variety with pre-designed traits like excellent quality, high yield, climate resilience and resistance to pests and diseases. The four-year project is being supported by the National Tea Research Foundation (NTRF), Calcutta. The collaborating institutions are National Research Centre for Plant Biotechnology, ICAR, Tocklai Tea Research Institute, Jorhat Darjeeling Tea Research & Development Centre, Kurseong, UPASI Tea Research Foundation Tea Research Institute, Valparai, and the Institute of Himalayan Bio-resource Technology, Palampur. The NTRF, set up in 1988, supports innovative research on all aspects of tea, particularly non-conventional approaches. Selection of plant materials will be done by Tocklai Tea Research Institute. Tea ( Camellia sinensis) is an economically important global beverage with a world production of 5,305 million kg in 2015 and China and India as the leaders. In India, the crop is infested by various insect and mite species that cause substantial damage to this foliage crop. Drought is another major constraint for the growth, yield and quality of tea plants. Climate change is another major factor and is very likely to affect future tea growth and crop management. Variations in tea productivity and quality because of weather have been reported in many studies. A new study has revealed that climate change will make many tea-growing areas in Assam unsuitable by 2050. Rice is the first crop plant whose genome has been compiled. Experts say tea genome size is bigger than rice and the work will be a tough one."

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah launched Anna Bhagya scheme to supply foodgrains at subsidised rates to the poor and the needy.However, at the behest of some higher officials, the government stopped the supply of foodgrains at subsidised rates and had decided to credit the amount to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries.Food and Civil Supplies Minister U.T. Khader, on December 21 last year, had announced that the government would credit Rs. 800 to the bank accounts of Anna Bhagya beneficiaries and would stop supplying foodgrains.This move would hit families who were unable to buy foodgrains paying advance cash.

Chandrasekhar Rao had decided to give an extension to Mr. Pradeep Chandra, who went to Delhi along with the Chief Minister in November last week and handed over his application seeking the extension personally in the DoPT.

(AFP) Guwahati, Jan. 1: The World Bank is expected to clear $200 million for a new agri project in Assam by March. The Assam Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project will give impetus to establish new small and medium agri enterprises, facilitate agribusiness investments through inclusive business models that provide opportunities to small holder farmers to actively participate in the value chains. Official sources said the estimated date for the bank board approval is March 9. The total project cost is $250 million of which the bank would provide $200 million and rest will be borne by the state government. The bank said the recently-concluded Assam Agricultural Competitiveness Project has been instrumental in increasing on-farm productivity and diversification of agriculture in the state. The project laid the foundation for the transformation of Assam agriculture by shifting the focus from rice production towards diversification into high-value agriculture production. ""Diversification to high-value commodities (vegetables, spices, fish and dairy) opens up significant opportunities for the farming communities of Assam, along with associated challenges for this transformation. There is a need to reorient policies and institutions to support a shift from production targets to income growth through diversification to high-value agriculture, higher productivity of crops and livestock through technology and innovation,"" the bank said. The World Bank said for the proposed project to be a success, Assam needs to: Promote greater infusion of technology, good supply chain practices and market intelligence to enhance efficiency Harmonise agriculture marketing regime and support development of alternative marketing options for farmers Facilitate development of organised micro, small and medium enterprises, both for value addition and job creation Address the growing food safety concern that is exposing consumers and producers, to food safety and human health risks. Assam has recently launched a transformative agricultural development strategy - Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana - which aims to double the farm income in the state, thus transforming the sector into a stable source of growth and broad-based economic development. The strategy of the proposed project primarily focuses on specific agriculture and allied sectors, including high-value agriculture, livestock, fish, silk, food processing and logistics. The project is the nucleus of a much larger government agribusiness and rural transformation programme. The project will be implemented in 16 districts of the state and will support identification and development of enterprise and production clusters. It will have four components enabling agri enterprise development, facilitating agro cluster development, fostering market-led production and resilience enhancement and project management, monitoring and learning. Three World Bank global practices - agriculture, trade and competitiveness and finance and market - will aid the Agribusiness and Rural Transformation Project to ensure that the Assam benefits from innovations and global knowledge. During implementation, these practices will be further strengthened to support the state government initiatives on creating an enabling investment climate for agribusinesses and other enterprises. The management and co-ordination of the new project will be done by the Assam Rural Infrastructure and Agriculture Services Society, an existing state-level registered autonomous body, which has completed two World Bank-financed projects."

It also took exception to Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a package for farmers, self-help groups and others during his address to the nation on the New Year's Eve. The party wanted all central government advertisements listing its achievements should immediately be stopped in view of the panchayat polls in the state, scheduled on February 13. The BJD today urged the State Election Commission to ""stop this propaganda"" and take action against the people responsible for violating the model code of conduct, which was enforced in the state on December 27. An advertisement carrying the photograph of the Prime Minister, issued by the Union food and public distribution ministry appearing in a section of media, gives a break-up of the sharing of cost on rice and wheat being distributed through the public distribution system. It says the Centre is providing Rs 29.60 against the state's share of only Rs 2 to make rice available to the poor people at Re 1 per kg. In case of wheat, the Centre spends 21.45 per kg, while the state and beneficiaries share Re 1 each to make wheat available Rs 3 per kg. A BJD delegation, led by vice-president Surya Narayan Patro, today met the commission and said: ""The advertisement is in gross violation of the model code of conduct."" The Prime Minister's announcement of a package of assistances for farmers, self-help groups and pregnant women on December 31 flouted the poll code in the state. Reacting to the allegation, BJP leader K.V. Singh Deo said: ""The advertisement is part of a national campaign and not restricted to Odisha. Odia newspapers are circulated in neighbouring states such as Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh. Odias living there have a right to know about the food security scheme and the Prime Minister's package."" State Election Commission secretary R.N. Sahu said: ""The commission is examining the BJD's petition, and we will take appropriate action on it."" A poll panel official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Centre's advertisement was in violation of clause seven mentioned in chapter IV of the model code of conduct. The relevant clause states: ""No advertisement or publication at the cost of Central or State Government/Public undertakings/Corporations/Co-operatives, etc. highlighting achievements, which will have the effect of influencing the voters in elections shall be issued/published"". The cheap rice scheme had been the prime electoral plank of the Naveen Patnaik government since 2008. The Congress-led UPA government, too, had objected to the BJD's claim about the scheme and unsuccessfully tried to highlight that the Centre had subsidised the maximum amount to the rice scheme. After the BJP-led NDA government came to power at the Centre, the BJP had been aggressively highlighting the Centre's contribution to the cheap rice scheme by putting up big hoardings and distributing leaflets. In another development, the BJD has begun the task of selecting candidates for the three-tier panchayat body. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik met party leaders from Ganjam district and sought their views. The party has asked the district units to finalise the lists as early as possible."

Under the scheme, the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre provides subsidised cooking gas to families living below the poverty line (BPL). The BJD had asked the commission to step in, accusing the Centre of violating the model code of conduct, which is in force in the state. A commission official said a letter had been sent to the ministry asking it to stop the campaign in Odisha. He, however, refused to elaborate whether the advertisements amounted to the model code violation. But, the BJD's problems with the Modi government's media campaign listing its achievements are far from over. Notwithstanding its protest against the ministry of food and public distribution system's advertisement yesterday, the Centre today released another advertisement on its newly-launched Atal Jyoti scheme. The BJP, on the other hand, accused the BJD of displaying hoardings listing the Naveen Patnaik government's achievements. The ministry of new and renewable energy's advertisement says the Atal Jyoti scheme will be implemented in 202 undeveloped districts of five states, including Odisha. Under the scheme, solar LED street lights will be installed along the roads of rural and semi-urban areas. It appeals to the intended beneficiaries to apply through their local MPs. The BJD's contention is that the model code of conduct prohibits issue of advertisements highlighting achievements of the government and announcement of any new scheme to influence the voters. A BJD delegation today met State Election Commissioner R.N. Senapati and brought the matter to its notice. The party yesterday objected to the Centre's advertisement highlighting the subsidised rice scheme and also the salient features of the National Food Security Act. It had staked claim on the populist Re 1- per-kg rice scheme. Today's advertisement carry the photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee. ""In spite of our repeated complaints, these advertisements continue to be published and telecast in local newspapers and TV channels,"" said BJD general secretary Rabi Narayan Nanda, who led the delegation today. Commission officials said the new petitions of the BJD and the BJP were being examined. Undeterred by the BJD's allegations, a BJP delegation today called on the commission and accused the Naveen government of violating the model code of conduct by putting up hoardings on the state-funded schemes. ""Big hoardings carrying photographs of chief minister Naveen Patnaik have been displayed near the hospitals highlighting the Niramaya Yojana for providing free medicines to the poor. Similar publicity materials are on display on the aahar yojana, under which meals are being provided at Rs 5 per head, and the Public Service Act scheme, under which applicants need not have to submit attested copies of the documents required to get various public utility services. These are clear violation of the model code of conduct,"" said Mohanty."

Perhaps, you should embrace Natyashastra, a treatise on performance arts written around 200 BC, which find their origins in the rice-growing belt of India.At the Dhaatu International Puppet Festival, a five-day event that began in the city on Wednesday, the importance of the Natyashastra and its influence in Indonesia, the Czech Republic and Sri Lanka is being explored through conferences, performances and workshops.For organiser Anupama Hoskere, the foray into the world of puppetry has been a journey of realisation of how much Western puppetry owes its origins to the weary puppets resting in Indian museums. Often, I hear from puppeteers in Belgium, Prague and Czech Republic that Indians have given birth to this art form. When they marvel at our intellect, I feel uncomfortable as I strongly feel we have not done much after that.Sanskrit scholar S.R. Leela concurs. The Europeans must be appreciated for giving finishing touches to cultures that they have borrowed from.Speaking about the art forms from the rice belt of India and South East Asia, Guru Sanjeev Suvarna, director of Yakshagana Kendra in Udupi, said, Traditional art forms have helped humans attain intellectual stimulation.In the evening, Chapparamane Sridhar Hegde gave a Yakshagana performance on a Ramayana episode.

It extends from Sundakkamuthur Main Road in the north to Edayarpalayam in the south and from Sundakkamuthur in the west to Palakkad Main Road in the east.The Ward has very few industries and most of the commercial activity takes place on Palakkad Main Road.

Garden and a few more.The residents said that most of the residential areas did not have storm water drainage and the entire Ward did not have underground drainage facility. With the number of people increasing, it was important that the Corporation provided the amenities at the earliest, said V. Shanmugam, a resident of Cholan Nagar.The water supply situation had worsened in the recent past, thanks to the poor storage position in the Siruvani Reservoir, but their problem was that the Corporations supply was irregular. The residents were clueless about the water supply time; sometimes it would be around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m., complained M. Chitti Babu, a resident.The other big problem - something that is common across other added areas - is the number of unapproved layouts where the Corporation cannot provide basic amenities such as street lights or drains.Not only in the layouts, but in many other areas in the Ward, the street lighting is poor, complains E. Suresh, a resident of J.J. Nagar.One of the big-ticket development projects that the residents want is a link road from Edayarpalayam to Sundakkamuthur Road so that residents of the area could easily reach Selvapuram by taking Kovaipudur Bypass Road.Former Councillor of the Ward, Amutha Arulmozhi, said that she had taken up with the Corporation the need for the road and was pursuing it with help from the Municipal Administration Minister.The other demands include an end to the illegal dumping of waste and debris along Sengulam Tank bund road and in new layouts."

Moreover, a majority of the farmers were yet to get the minimum support price, they said.Earlier the government had provided a monthly pension of Rs. 1,000 to all farmers irrespective the seize of their landholdings, but it was now restricted to the farmers holding two acres of land, Mr. Swamy said. Such a discretion could not be justified, especially when climate change is wreaking havoc on farming in the State, he said."

Ratheesh KumarC_RATHEESH KUMARThe ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) organised a mass protest march to Raj Bhavan on Saturday, accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government of adopting a vengeful attitude towards people of the State by allegedly attempting to scuttle the public distribution system.Inaugurating the agitation, Communist party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] State unit secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said the implementation of the National Food Security Act had had disastrous effects on Kerala with 54% of the population being denied commodities under the rationing system.Severe omissionWhile 1.54 crore of households would benefit from the system, there are several more who would be left out of its ambit and would have to depend on the market for commodities. At present, the State was entitled to only 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, much less than the previous allocation of 16.5 lakh tonnes, prior to the implementation of the Act, he said.While former Union Minister of State for Food and Public Distribution K.V. Thomas had promised to assuage the concerns, the present administration had chosen to neglect the assurance. Besides, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ignored the States plea for additional allocation. Market intervention efforts will be undertaken by providing rice at Rs.25 a kg through the Maveli stores, he said.Speaking on the occasion, Kerala Administrative Reforms Commission chairman V.S. Achuthanandan alleged that such policies were intended to punish people for choosing against voting for the BJP in the polls.The allocation of foodgrains has been cut despite the Centre benefiting through revenue from export of agricultural, dairy, and marine products from Kerala. The stance of the National Democratic Alliance government could hamper Centre-State relations in the long run, he said.Imminent price riseCommunist party of India (CPI) State unit secretary Kanam Rajendran said that the cut in allocation of essential commodities could lead to the public distribution system going haywire. Such a scenario would lead to a rise in prices."

Photo: AFPThe dusty figure is lowered slowly into the ground like a bucket into a well, armed with just a crowbar, a shovel and an old, unreliable headlamp.In the surrounding countryside, bodies rise and sink from hundreds of holes just wide enough for a man. Children run between the rubble and the smell of cooking wafts from the makeshift shelters. Guards armed with hunting rifles stand by, turning the settlement of Betsinefe into a threatening scene. In the world of Madagascan sapphire mining, there are few rules.Vast depositsSapphires were first discovered in Madagascar in the late 1990s, and already the Indian Ocean island is one of the worlds largest producers of the precious stones. Its 250-kilometre-long deposit is among the biggest in the world and has sparked a sapphire rush.Activity at this informal, though not entirely illegal, mine in the southwest of the country was suspended recently by authorities after scuffles broke out between villagers and would-be miners flocking in from the rest of the island.Says 19-year-old student Andry Razafindrakoto, a student from the nearest big town of Tulear who was one of the many hoping to make their fortune: I came here to mine sapphires because its difficult to find work in other areas.When he sold his haul of stones for some four million ariary ($1,200), he bought his own equipment and today manages a small team of nine miners.But success stories are rare.Like most of his fellow miners, Albert Soja does not earn wages for his countless, gruelling trips underground. To make money, he must find and sell stones. Of course its scary, but when you want to succeed, you have to take risks, he said. Just digging the hole itself takes time, almost two weeks. Sometimes we find nothing...it can take months to find something interesting.Without sapphires to sell, he depends on the mine bosses  gem shop owners, usually of Sri Lankan origin, in the neighbouring town of Sakaraha  for a few handfuls of rice or manioc to survive.The bosses pay for our food and materials, which helps us hold out. Without their help, we would starve, said Soja. After that, were obliged to sell them the stones we find.Lucrative tradeSitting behind his desk in his gem shop in Sakaraha, Sunil W.J.  as he calls himself  examined his latest buy of blue and pink and light yellow sapphires under a lamp.His two bodyguards toured the surrounding mines to collect the stones and pay for miners food. The best finds are sent to Sri Lanka, to be polished, cut and sold, Sunil explained.Theoretically, the extraction of sapphires is regulated by Madagascars mining code, which insists on permits and the redistribution of a share of the taxes to benefit local municipalities.In practice, the industry is largely unregulated, but it is a lucrative trade, said Sunil. A stone that fetches $300 in Sri Lanka costs him less than a tenth of the price to buy from a miner in Madagascar.On the question of taxes, Sunil was less certain of his figures, but said he paid a 10 per cent export tax to authorities in the capital Antananarivo.These small sapphire mines are beyond the control of the state, so there are no official statistics, Mines Minister Ying Vah Zafilahy told AFP, vowing industry reform to bring them under formal regulation.A local elected official in Sakaraha, who asked to remain anonymous, said the municipality was not receiving any taxes or income from the many mining operations under way.Some days are better than others, but this business has a future, said Sunil, laughing.

Rahul, who picked the famous Urdu saying to get back at Modi, was not present in the Lok Sabha when the Prime Minister gave the speech in which he defended the demonetisation drive and criticised the Congress governments and the Nehru-Gandhi family. The Congress vice-president was in Meerut to address a campaign rally with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. After tweeting the saying, Rahul took to the social networking site again to say: ""PM mocks the tragedy of Uttarakhand and insults freedom struggle but has no answers to the opposition questions."" The Prime Minister had referred to last night's tremor in Uttarakhand to heap scorn on Rahul for saying earlier that there would be an earthquake if he spoke on his allegation of personal corruption against Modi. ""The earthquake finally reached Delhi. If someone sees service in SCAM, even mother earth gets angry,"" Modi had said. The Congress sought to turn the tables on Modi by alleging he had been insensitive to the people of Uttarakhand. Harish Rawat, the chief minister of the election-bound state, said: ""The Prime Minister should be ashamed for making fun of the earthquake in Uttarakhand. Despicable statement."" Turning Modi's comments into a poll plank, the Congress posted several messages on its official Twitter handle. ""Modi using natural calamity like earthquake to make a political point shows the depths to which he will descend to. The Prime Minister thinks even Parliament is an election platform. Has no respect for parliamentary dignity,"" a tweet said. The party held a media conference where spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi said: ""Our prayers and sympathy are with the people of Uttarakhand, who are still recovering from the shock of the earthquake. The people will feel hurt and humiliated by the Prime Minister's tone of humour and mockery."" Gogoi lamented that the Prime Minister had not expressed any sympathy for those who lost their lives because of the demonetisation. Many Congress MPs alleged Modi had ""failed miserably"" to defend the demonetisation. Rahul posted five questions for the Prime Minister: ""Amount of black money recovered after November 8, 2016? Economic losses to the nation and number of jobs lost? How many people died due to demonetisation and has compensation been paid? Who all did the PM consult on demonetisation; why were experts, economists, RBI not consulted? Who all deposited more than Rs 25 lakh in bank accounts in six months preceding November 8?"" Congress members kept interrupting the Prime Minister during his speech, asking questions on alleged corruption involving the BJP like the Vyapam scam, the Vijay Mallya default and escape, the mining scam in Rajasthan and the graft over rice distribution in Chhattisgarh."

Telegraph picture In a rare show of responsibility, teachers of a state-run middle school in Tharpakhna, Ranchi, are spending money from their own pockets to feed children hot midday meals even though the carelessness of a former principal has blocked their access to government funds. Some eight teachers of the school are bearing the expenses of lunch since past one month, spending at least Rs 800 per day on vegetables, eggs, rice and pulses to feed 93 children every day. But, the reason why teachers can't withdraw government funds from the school's bank account is surprising. Then principal Tanuja Pandey, the joint account holder with the in-charge of midday meals, did not hand over the chequebook to the school before her transfer. Transferred on December 31, 2016, Pandey should have, according to norms, handed over the chequebook to senior teacher Meena Bharti assigned by district superintendent of education (DSE) Subhendu Kumar to replace her. ""Pandey joined a new school on January 2, but the chequebook and passbook of our school are still with her. So, since the last one month, we are providing meals to the children with the help of assistant teacher Amit Kumar and others. We are facing problem in continuing the scheme. If the situation remains the same, midday meals can stop anytime,"" school management committee Ashok Kumar recently wrote to the DSE. ""On an average, we spend Rs 800 a day. Some of us buy vegetables and others bring eggs or arrange rice and pulses. As the number of children is limited, we somehow manage. We must have spent Rs 25,000 since January 1. Though it gives us satisfaction to see poor children eating lunch, we also wonder how careless a principal can be,"" said a teacher requesting anonymity. Sangeeta Minz, convener of Saraswati Vahini Samiti and the joint account holder, agreed that had teachers not come forward, children wouldn't have had their midday meal. But, when this correspondent contacted Pandey, she dodged questions. ""Sorry, wrong number,"" she said the first time. The second time, she said she could not hear and did not take calls thereafter. When contacted, area education officer, Ranchi Sadar, Haquimuddin said action in the matter has already been taken. ""We have informed Tanuja Pandey to hand over the chequebook to senior teacher Meena Bharti within seven days,"" he said. Under the midday meal scheme, the government disburses funds to provide a protein-rich lunch to poor students in state-run and state-aided schools, a major initiative to reduce dropouts."

58f4d57e60de470aa339c8a1,The smart watchman,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/opinion/story_133287.jsp,2017-02-01,"Economics excites economists no end, and bores the rest to death. The Economic Survey is an ideal tome for the bedside, and a perfect cure for insomnia. Having realized this in his short tenure, the chief economic advisor last year brought out a colourful summary full of charts in which arrows told you what to look for. He laid out an agenda of goods and services tax, strategic disinvestments, improving the twin balance sheets (of banks and their corporate borrowers), and better targeting of subsidies for the poor. Just in case his political bosses had opened the brochure, they would have found a rich reform programme, including his own jam - transferring subsidies into the Jan Dhan accounts of the poor identified by their Aadhar cards so that they could spend the money through their mobiles. The finance minister did not pick up a single idea from Arvind Subramanian's repertoire. Nevertheless, a great visual salesman had somehow got into the government - someone to watch out for. So I waited for the mid-term survey, which he usually brings out towards the end of the calendar year. But there was none this year. It may have been because he would have had to report some bad news. For one thing, foodgrain procurement and distribution have done poorly: rice procurement this year is less than half of the normal, and offtake a third less. Wheat stocks are down too. It is unclear whether this is bad luck, or whether a policy decision was taken to neglect PDS. The October index of industrial production was 2 per cent lower than the year before; the capital goods index was a whopping 25 per cent lower. Output of all energy products - coal, crude oil and natural gas - was down. Trade balance till November was slightly improved, but that was entirely due to the fall in international oil prices; the oil war between the United States of America and the Arabs had been good for us. Budgetary deficit in all its definitions had fallen in the first half of the last financial year; this year it went up. And a quarter of the 270 million Jan Dhan accounts had zero balance, the average balance in the rest was about Rs 3,300, 8.3 million account holders had asked for an overdraft, and 2.4 million had got one of Rs 1,300 on the average. The rest were refused. But to say that he avoided the bad news is unfair or premature, for Subramanian has promised an old-style Economic Survey of the past year some time in the coming year. He has completely changed the form and intent of the regular Economic Survey. It concentrates entirely on fundamental questions, which the finance ministry in my time left to the Planning Commission. I had tried to raise them in my first Economic Survey in 1992; but I was eased out soon after, and the initiative died. Subramanian has gone deep, covered both short-and long-term issues, and involved an amazing number of people - about 200, both outside and inside government - in the debate the survey encapsulates. Even the finance minister is supposed to have written a chapter, though which one is not revealed. The Economic Survey compares India with other countries in many dimensions. It draws three major lessons: India has been stepmotherly towards the private sector, it has a pretty inefficient government, and the government has actively, but ineffectively, redistributed incomes. This is a good summary of two generations of Independent India; demonetization is the latest instance of this inefficient redistribution. But its aim of digitization of payments was good, and should be promoted by introducing GST and extending it to real estate transactions, reducing income tax rates, widening the income tax net, reducing corporate tax faster and reducing discretion and increasing accountability in tax administration. Preference for cash is not just because people dislike paying taxes; it is also because taxation is inefficient and corrupt. Improving it is more important than making everyone use cheques and cards. The Economic Survey goes in some detail into what it calls the twin balance sheet problem - companies borrowed from banks, and did not repay the loans, making the balance sheets of both unsound. This has happened in many countries; elsewhere, it led to bankruptcy of banks. It did not happen in India because most of the banking system is owned by the government; mounting bank losses simply meant that the government's equity in the banks was wiped out. But if companies do not repay loans, accumulating interest on them keeps raising their liabilities; and if banks cannot realize loans, they cannot give fresh loans. For instance, state electricity boards do not pay power generation companies for electricity, the generators cannot repay loans or expand capacity, and growth in the power sector comes down. The Economic Survey's suggestion is that the government should set up an asset reconstruction agency, which would take over big bad debts from the banks and resolve them in various ways - taking over the assets of debtors and selling them, selling the businesses to new entrepreneurs at a loss and converting some of the loans into equity. This is pretty obvious, and has been tried before, in the 1990s. It may resolve the problem for now, but it will recur for a reason the Economic Survey does not mention: Sebi has killed off the equity market, and the government has banned new private banks. The result is excessive debt-equity ratios, which lead to bankruptcies from time to time. The Economic Survey gives much attention to a problem that has not occurred, namely public debt. So many countries across the world have run into intractable debt problems; Greece is the most notorious example. India has avoided it. The Economic Survey attributes the success to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act of 2003, and the subsequent, relatively responsible, behaviour of the states. I would trace it to another cause, namely India's high growth, which has continuously reduced the debt-GDP ratio and raised government revenue. In my view, the problem lies elsewhere: it lies in the poor quality of government. It spends so much and so inefficiently on consumption, and so little on investment. As a result, India's infrastructure has continued to be poor. The Economic Survey points out India's low tax collection, and proposes raising it. That would be even worse if the government continues to be as inefficient as it is. I hope that the chief economic adviser will spend this year studying why the government works so badly and what can be done about it. There is so much more in the Economic Survey. I have not even come yet to universal basic income, for which the Survey has made news. I have not discussed it largely because the underlying idea is good: the dozens of personal subsidies the governments give need to be unified, and the corruption in doling them out eliminated. But they need to be subjected to good empirical analysis. This is a subject to which Arvind Subramanian should give some attention in the coming year. The other issue on which he might spend some time is prioritization amongst his myriad policy ideas."
58f4d5e760de470aa339c946,Govt warns planters on ration,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170121/jsp/northeast/story_131552.jsp,2017-01-21,"Guwahati, Jan. 20: Assam tea tribes welfare minister Pallab Lochan Das today said the government would take action against tea gardens, including sending showcause notices, if they stop providing ration to workers in violation of their ""agreement"" with the Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS). There have been reports that the gardens will stop providing rations to workers after this month. Sources in the tea industry, however, said there was no agreement between garden owners and ACMS for continuing rations. ""The garden owners continued providing rations out of their own volition as the practice was in place since Independence,"" one of them said. The government had brought tea workers under the National Food Security Act in December 2015. Under the NFSA, a worker gets 5kg rice at the rate of Rs 3 per kg per month from the government. Previously, a garden worker used to get rice and flour at 50 paise per kg from garden owners, who got the same from the government at Rs 8.30 and Rs 6.30 per kg respectively. ""Now garden owners buy foodgrains at market price and distribute among workers at Rs 0.50 per kg. This means that tea garden workers now get rations from both ends - garden owners and the government. But it is not possible for garden owners to bear the cost for long,"" a source in the tea industry said. The ACMS, led by Congress leader and former Union minister Paban Singh Ghatowar, had yesterday protested after coming to know that the gardens would stop providing rations after this month. The ACMS blamed the state government and the Centre for the development. ""How can the ACMS blame us if tea gardens do not provide rations to the workers?

ACMS is playing politics with the workers,"" said Das. He alleged that the ACMS had an ""understanding"" with the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations, apex body of all tea producers' associations in the country, for which it was blaming the state government and the Centre instead of protesting against garden owners. ""If the gardens have violated the agreements signed with you (ACMS), why don't you protest against them or inform the matter to us instead of misleading the workers against us?""

58f4d63860de470aa339c9cf,Note recall & bank transfer hit rice scheme,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170203/jsp/bengal/story_133769.jsp,2017-02-03,"Calcutta, Feb. 2: The Centre's demonetisation drive and the Bengal government's decision to transfer money directly to the bank accounts of paddy farmers have cast a cloud on a pet scheme of Mamata Banerjee under which cheap rice is provided to 2 crore people. ""We have been able to procure only 1.97 lakh tonnes of paddy since December 27. We need at least 3 lakh tonnes of paddy every month to run the Khadyasathi scheme. The shortage of cash in banks in rural areas has done the damage,"" said Jyotipriyo Mullick, the food and supplies minister. The scheme is heavily dependent on government procurement of paddy from farmers. In addition to the beneficiaries of Khadyasathi, around 6.01 crore more people in Bengal receive cheap food grain under a central scheme. The Bengal government has decided to directly transfer the money to the bank accounts of farmers in the aftermath of allegations that the agencies entrusted with the job of procuring paddy were delaying payments to them. However, because of the cash crisis precipitated by the demonetisation and the cap on cash withdrawals, the farmers have not been able to take out money from banks, forcing them to sell their produce at lower rates to local traders. ""Although the restrictions on withdrawals have been eased, banks in rural areas are not being able to offer more than Rs 5,000 a week to each customer. Farmers need cash to invest in the winter crop besides meeting their daily expenses,"" an official said. The state government buys paddy from the farmers at the minimum support price of Rs 1,470 a quintal and produces rice. The rice is sent to ration shops, where it is sold to Khadyasathi beneficiaries. More than 1.03 crore people get 5kg of food grain at Rs 2 a kilo every month and around 97 lakh people get 1kg of food grain at Rs 13 a kilo. ""To run the scheme, we have a target of procuring 35 lakh tonnes of paddy this year. For that, we need to procure 3 lakh tonnes of paddy a month. But we are lagging behind,"" a food department official said. The Centre can supply grain from other states if enough procurement is not done in Bengal, but the state government has to arrange for the rice required for Khadyasathi. According to sources in Nabanna, the progress of the procurement has worried the government. ""Soon after harvesting the monsoon crop in November and December, farmers sell a large portion of their produce to reinvest in the winter paddy. It is clear from the early signs that we will face problems in meeting the procurement target this year,"" a source said. An agriculture department official said the government had received reports from the districts that the farmers had sold the bulk of their produce to local traders at rates lower than the minimum support price. ""The farmers avoided going to the government procurement camps and sold their paddy to the local traders at around Rs 1,200 a quintal. They did not sell their produce to the government because the money would have been transferred directly to their bank accounts,"" the official said. Subol Das, a farmer from Raipur near Bolpur in Birbhum, said he had produced 32 quintals of paddy this year, but did not sell it to the government. ""I have sold a portion of the produce to a local trader who offered me Rs 1,190 a quintal. It is better because I got the amount in cash and did not need to visit the bank several times to withdraw the money,"" Das said."

Pallab Lochan Das, minister of state with independent charge for the labour and employment and tea tribes welfare departments, told the Assembly that stern action would be taken against tea garden managements if they do not provide subsidised rations to their workers. Das made this statement after BJP MLA from Duliajan, Terash Gowalla, raised the issue during zero hour and said violent protests could erupt in tea gardens if the supply of subsidised rations to workers is stopped. The practice to supply subsidised foodgrain has been in place since Independence, but sources in the tea industry maintain that there is no legal binding on tea garden owners to follow it. Till now, they had been providing the rations on their own accord, the sources said. Earlier, a garden worker used to get rice and flour at Rs 0.50 per kg from the garden owners, who used to buy the same from the state government at Rs 8.30 per kg and Rs 6.30 per kg respectively. The Assam government also used to provide APL (above poverty line) rice from the PDS (public distribution system) stock, but this was stopped after the National Food Security Act (NFSA) came into effect. The government brought tea workers under the National Food Security Act in December 2015. Under the act, a worker gets 5kg of rice at Rs 3 per kg per month from the government. ""Now garden owners buy foodgrain at market price and distribute among workers at Rs 0.50 per kg. This means that tea garden workers now get rations from both ends - garden owners and the government. But it is not possible for garden owners to bear the cost for long,"" a source in the tea industry said. In the Assembly, Das said there was corruption by the previous government in providing PDS rice to the tea gardens. He said the previous Congress government had showed that they were providing 12,000 metric tonnes of PDS rice to 19 lakh tea workers in the state, but there are only nine lakh tea workers in the state. ""It means that a large quantity of PDS rice was diverted in the name of supplying it to tea workers, which needs to be probed,"" the minister said. AGP MLA Ramendra Narayan Kalita said an inquiry by either a sitting high court judge or the CBI should be ordered into it. Parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary accused the Intuc-affiliated Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) of spreading misinformation that the BJP government had stopped the distribution of subsidised rations. ""But it was the Congress, which is responsible for this situation since it was during its tenure that the NFSA was implemented in the state,"" Patowary said. Das also attacked the ACMS by accusing it of compromising the tea workers' interest by signing an agreement with the Consultative Committee of Planters' Association (CCPA) last year and pegging the minimum daily wage for tea garden workers of the Brahmaputra Valley at Rs 115, whereas the government wants it to be Rs 143. The Congress Legislature Party hit back at Das by accusing him of misleading the House by giving wrong information. The CLP submitted a memorandum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal requesting him to ensure that the supply of subsidized ration to tea workers is not affected. CLP leader Debabrata Saikia said instead of addressing the problems faced by the garden workers, the government was creating controversy on the issue of subsidised rations."

There have been reports that the gardens will stop providing rations to workers after this month. Sources in the tea industry, however, said there was no agreement between garden owners and ACMS for continuing rations. The garden owners continued providing rations out of their own volition as the practice was in place since Independence, one of them said. The government had brought tea workers under the National Food Security Act in December 2015. Under the NFSA, a worker gets 5kg rice at the rate of Rs 3 per kg per month from the government. Previously, a garden worker used to get rice and flour at 50 paise per kg from garden owners, who got the same from the government at Rs 8.30 and Rs 6.30 per kg respectively. Now garden owners buy foodgrains at market price and distribute among workers at Rs 0.50 per kg. This means that tea garden workers now get rations from both ends  garden owners and the government. But it is not possible for garden owners to bear the cost for long, a source in the tea industry said. The ACMS, led by Congress leader and former Union minister Paban Singh Ghatowar, had yesterday protested after coming to know that the gardens would stop providing rations after this month. The ACMS blamed the state government and the Centre for the development. How can the ACMS blame us if tea gardens do not provide rations to the workers? Provision of ration by garden owners was the result of an agreement between the owners and the ACMS. The government has been providing subsidised rice to the workers under NFSA. ACMS is playing politics with the workers, said Das. He alleged that the ACMS had an understanding with the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations, apex body of all tea producers' associations in the country, for which it was blaming the state government and the Centre instead of protesting against garden owners.

The Rs 50 crore is for the period from April to July 2016, a part of which is also to be given to the transporters as their commission, which is also pending. The fair price shop owners had earlier threatened to stop supplying food grains from October last year. ""We were supposed to close down our shops in October last year. Then the state government promised to release all pending commissions till September. The government later said they had released the amount but we are yet to get it,"" said Hemanta Deka, general secretary of Xodou Asom Xulobh Mulyor Byobaxayi Xontha, an association of the fair price shop owners. Sources in the food and civil supplies department said Dispur had released the commission to the deputy commissioners to distribute to the fair price shop owners and transporters. ""But the offices of the deputy commissioners have failed to realise the urgency of the matter because of which the funds have been lying there. Several notices have been sent to all the DCs to clear the payments,"" a source said. Assam has 37,126 fair price shops which distribute rice under the NFSA. While some districts have received commission till April 2016, many have received only till February and March. Deka said the pending commission amount is between Rs 250 to Rs 300 crore. The fair price shop owners will meet at the playground of Hatigaon High School here on Sunday to discuss their problems. ""In the meeting we will take a decision on our next course of action,"" Deka said. ""We are running the shops hoping that the government will release the commission. The commission is also very less - Rs 1.10 per quintal of rice. We have been demanding Rs 3 per quintal. Some fair price shop owners are thinking of closing their shops and look for other sources of livelihood,"" said Deka. Meanwhile, the state food and civil supplies department is facing confusion following an instruction by Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu, asking the director of the department to take steps to recover the price of rice that ""ineligible"" beneficiaries have consumed since the launch of the scheme in December 2015. ""Ineligible"" beneficiaries are those who have surrendered their ration cards. People whose annual income is below Rs 1 lakh are only entitled to get the family ration cards under the NFSA. State food and civil supplies minister Rihon Daimari had appealed to people whose annual income is over Rs 1 lakh to surrender ration cards. Sources in the department said they were unaware of any step taken by the state government to recover the price of the rice the ""ineligible"" beneficiaries had consumed since December 2015 till surrendering their ration cards."

It was difficult to meet the needs of the remaining population with four lakh tonnes, especially in a State reliant on the public distribution system. Hence, there was an urgent need to raise the foodgrain quota.Raise sugar quotaThe government also wanted the Centre to raise the sugar quota. The 3,600 tonnes of sugar being provided at present was insufficient to meet the demand. It should be enhanced to 8,600 tonnes, the meeting felt.As directed by the Centre, the State government had identified 200 acres at Kinaloor in Kozhikode for setting up an all India institute of medical sciences. The MPs were requested to persuade the Centre to set up the institute.The government also wanted them to raise the need for setting up a tertiary cancer care centre at the Malabar Cancer Centre.Once the State GST and Inter-State GST Bills come up for discussion in Parliament, the MPs should press for the States demand that tax collection from traders with an annual turnover below Rs. 1.5 crore should be vested with the State government and also adequate powers on cross empowerment too should be delegated to it.Insurance schemeThe government wanted the Centre to provide 60 per cent funds for the insurance scheme envisaged for migrant labour. The meeting also discussed the need for launching the proposed industrial corridor linking Kochi and Palakkad. This needed to be expedited in the wake of the formation of the National Industrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust, the meeting felt."

Spinach or Cheera, in particular, is cultivated in all their homes, with the programme being given the moniker Cheeragramam.The vegetables they grow, while not sufficient to meet the needs of the household, is much tastier than the store-bought items, says Abhirami, a member of the club.True to the spirits of organic farming, these young farmers follow the mantra of no waste, no chemicals.While at GHSS Venganoor, it was the plastic bottles and other containers collected during a cleaning drive that were used as pots for plants, at BRMHS Ilavattom, the wooden stands and PVC pipes left behind after painting jobs, and broken boxes from fish outlets have been used for cultivation. Leftovers from meals are deposited in these boxes as fertilisers.At GVHSS Vithura, it is the Student Police Cadets, or Kutti Police as they are fondly known, who have taken to the soil with the help of the police themselves.

Mazhaippongal, which is observed in April or May, is an integral part of the lives of the Paliyan tribe in the hilly regions and rain forests of Tamil Nadus southern districts.The Anthropological Survey of India says it is observed in Dindigul, Madurai, Theni, Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar districts in southwestern areas.This is a rain-invoking ritual beseeching the deity Palichiyamma to bestow showers. The members make pongal from grains and rice and pour it over the stone, which, they believe, is their chief deity. The deity then blesses them with rains, the Deputy Director of Anthropological Survey of Indias Southern Regional Office in Mysuru, C.R. Sathyanarayanan says.Millets-rice pongalMazhaippongal is generally observed during the months in which rains are sparse. We collect millets and rice from our community and go into the forest to make Mazhaippongal. It is a long ceremony where all our members are present, says Latha Rajan, a community member and resident of Paliyankudi.An earthen pot is decorated and placed in front of the holy rock that symbolises Palichiyamma. Wild twigs are used to heat it and when the pongal boils over, the priest whips himself with marulikkai, a wild creeper, to appease the gods. The boiling hot porridge is then poured on the holy stone to invoke rains.Tribal rights activist S. Thanaraj contends that although Paliyans are among the list of Scheduled Tribes (ST), the community should be included in the list of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTG), given their long legacy.Most members of the nomadic tribe, earlier associated with hunting and food-gathering, have been relocated from interior forest areas to foothills and now work as agricultural workers."

Narsipur in Mysuru district has reaped rich dividends this drought-hit season with just 25 per cent of the normal water usage.With reduced cost of cultivation, M.K. Kailash Murthy has turned the current agricultural economics upside down at a time when many of his ilk are abandoning the profession because of poor returns and increased expenditure.For Mr. Murthy, a retired bank official-turned-farmer, experimenting on his 11-acre land at Madarahalli in T. Narsipur has paid rich dividends, and the method adopted by him may perhaps hold the key to reducing water consumption in agriculture without hampering food security.The normal expenditure on one acre of paddy is Rs. 15,000, but he spent less than Rs. 7,000 and got a yield of 24 quintals, while others around him managed less than one quintal. Mr. Murthy said that with the available water resources of the region, farmers can produce four crops, not one.I tried natural farming in paddy cultivation, eschewing chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Irrigation was done once a few days, only to keep the land moist, unlike the traditional practice of waterlogging the field for nearly 120 days and thus wasting precious water. Besides, no organic matter was removed from the field and this increased soil fertility, said Mr. Murthy, who cultivated the Salem Sanna variety of rice in his experiment.Unlike conventional agricultural practices which entail maximising the use of chemical fertilizers and preparing the land using heavy machinery such as tractor, Mr. Murthy went for manual preparation as he believed that the organic content in the subsoil would get destroyed by chemical inputs.In the long run, soil turns alkaline and becomes unfit for agriculture, he said, adding that he plans to abandon land preparation for the next season. I will straight away opt for sowing just to see the results.There is enough scientific evidence to indicate that waterlogging of paddy fields results in the release of methane and other gases into the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect. We can reduce the emission of gases significantly to address climate change issues and also conserve water, Mr. Murthy said.He has also taken up natural farming on his 10-acre plot of dry land at Doddinduvadi in Kollegal taluk of Chamarajanagar district, which is a treasure trove of biodiversity.

PHOTOs: LEJU KAMALLejuKamalPaddy farmers in Pathanamthitta that houses the Upper Kuttanad rice bowl of Central Travancore region are a worried lot as armyworms have started devouring their well-nursed crop.District panchayat member and Upper Kuttanad Nelkarshaka Samiti president Sam Eapen told The Hindu that not less than 500 acres of cropland in the Upper Kuttanad region have already been infested with the caterpillar locally known as Pattalappuzhu.The armyworm menace is spreading fast in the already water-scarce Upper Kuttanad paddy fields, says Mr. Eapen.The menace is spreading to the paddy fields in Kadapra, Niranom, Nedumpram, and Kuttoor panchayats.Mr. Eapen said the speed at which these caterpillars were attacking crops in the region was unprecedented and is almost taken an epidemic proportion.The otherwise water-rich Upper Kuttanad region is faced with severe water scarcity due to drying up of many canals and ponds.Experts say this humid atmosphere is conducive for the rice swarming worms to flourish.The mature larvae of the armyworm (Mythimna Separata) are three to four centimetre long and their migration is facilitated by the absence of standing water in the fields, says experts.The caterpillar infestation is also severe in the paddy lands of Naduvathody, Narikuzhy, and Vettakkulam in Vallicaud panchayat near Pathanamthitta.These areas too have been identified as highly water scarce.There were also reports of infestation in the paddy fields of Vallamkulam and Kaviyur Puncha.The armyworms are found hiding under soil clods and in cracks and crevices along the bunds of rice fields during the day time.Officials of the Agriculture Department have inspected the affected areas in Vallicaud and Upper Kuttand.Mr. Eapen has called for immediate intervention of the Agriculture Minister to reddress the grievances of the paddy farmers.He said the Minister should visit the affected areas and issue necessary directives to the officials concerned to effectively address the menace on a war-footing."

Antony said here on Monday that neither the Communist Party of India (Marxist) nor the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was sincere when it comes to putting an end to the politics of murder in which both are engaged.The CPI(M) and the RSS are of the view that such murders provide the required fertile ground for the growth of their organisations in the State. The CPI(M) has spread a feeling that to escape from the RSS, one has to be with the former. Likewise, the RSS too has spread such a feeling.Mr. Antony said this while addressing a gathering on Monday after inaugurating a building to house the Shakthikulangara mandalam committee office of the Congress. He said polarisation of the country on communal grounds was the biggest achievement of the Narendra Modi government during the past three years.Modi criticisedThe main agenda of the Modi government appears be to provide all help for the growth of the RSS, he alleged. Mr. Modi had come to power by showering a litany of promises that triggered dreams in all sections of the people. But in three years time, Mr. Modi has ruined the Indian economy. He said the true ill-effects of demonetisation were yet to come.Almost every day, the Modi government is engaged in inflicting a shock to the common man and the latest is the hike in cooking gas prices, he said. The people are by and large dejected. Similar are the affairs of the Left Democratic Front government ruling the State , he said.The price of rice has soared to Rs. 50 in the State and the Pinarayi government is ignoring it."

Previously, 20 kg of rice per month was supplied to the card holders; but now, it has been reduced to 10 kg. Also, the free of cost rice given to people below the poverty line has been stopped, and instead, wheat is being provided, the petitioner alleged.Relying on media reports for his allegations, the petitioner submitted that it is the duty of the State government to guarantee availability of food for its citizens.

The party has also drafted a well-crafted strategy to dislodge the CPI(M) from its Dalit-Adivasi plank by seizing the opportunity to penetrate the segment by grabbing the leadership of land struggles which the CPI(M) has been hesitant to champion.The agitations will be set in motion on Thursday, less than 24 hours after the finalisation of the action plan, when Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activists will confiscate rice from a Food Corporation of India godown at Kozhikode. The agitation will continue till January 25.Another war frontThe party will open another war front against the CPI(M) on January 24 when State chief Kummanam Rajasekharan visits activists at the Gavi land struggle. The State council of the party, which concluded its meeting here on Wednesday, identified 18 centres of land struggles where the landless, mostly Dalits and Adivasis, were engaged in struggles, most of them independent of one another, as the mainstream political parties, especially the CPI(M), had failed to extend leadership to their struggles.In most cases, the landless have been provided with papers by succeeding governments, but none had provided them the land, said Mr. Rajasekharan. It is not because of dearth of land with the government. Large areas of land are usurped by private parties even after their lease period had ended. In addition, there are puramboke land in the hands of the government. Its a question of political will, he said.Politics of violenceThe party has also decided to take on the CPI(M) on the issue of politics of violence. The BJP will take the ashes of a party worker who lost her life in an alleged attack by CPI(M) cadre in Palakkad district in two yatras. One taking the ashes to Kasaragod and another taking it southwards. The yatras have been scheduled for the last week of February.Attack on cultural iconsIn an apparent effort to mend the damages suffered by the party following criticism from cultural icons of Kerala following the tactless views expressed by one of its general secretaries on film director Kamal and later against M.T Vasudevan Nair, the party has called a meeting of its own cultural leaders who are ready to criticise the CPI(M) at Thiruvananthapuram. Mr. Rajasekharan, however, maintained that along with these agitations the party would focus its attention on strengthening the organisation at the booth level. The booths numbering about 22,000 would play the key role in the emergence of the party as a viable alternative, he said."

Although the research scholars and faculty members spared no measures to save the paddy crop raised on about 40 cents on the research plot of the campus, the continued drought condition has impacted the crop.Normally, the harvest of this variety commences with the Pongal festival, but this year, we are forced to postpone the harvest to the end of this month as the crop is yet to register full growth, said P. Pandiyarajan, Dean of the Institute told The Hindu on Thursday.He said that the variety was released by the Institute about a decade ago and it is specially suited for the alkaline soil or sodic-affected fields where the salt content was severe. In fact, the college was founded in the Manikandam block in the district and this block accounts for 5,000 hectares -- the largest single block with sodic-affected area in the district.In the initial period, the paddy variety, with a duration of 135 days, registered 2.25 tonnes an acre.But, this year, the yield is expected to be around 1.8 tonnes an acre, the Dean said. He said that the variety has a milling percentage of 71.30 and head rice recovery was 66 per cent.The variety was resistant to diseases, including leaf folder, stem borer, brown spot, sheath rot, and sheath blight.In 2015, the yield per acre stood at 2.4 tonnes and in January 2016, it had shot up to 3 tonnes.The only solace for scientists and research scholars of the institute is that the achievement had been recorded after a close follow-up on the growth of the plant. Mild showers during Vardah cyclone brought some hope for rejuvenating the plant but it was short-lived as there was no spell of rain after that, said G. Subramanian, Head of the Department of Agronomy.T. Ramesh, Assistant Professor of Agronomy said that peacock menace posed another problem this season.On the peacock menace, he said that a muster of peacocks assemble in the paddy fields, particularly in the early morning and late evening to eat away the paddy grains.Research scholars have taken efforts to prevent the growth of weeds in the crop by using herbicide. The crop would be harvested before January 30, according to the Dean."

In the previous years, the severity of the dry spell had forced hundreds of farmers to sell their healthy cattle to slaughterhouses. Almost all the water-bodies in the district have dried up this year following scanty rainfall and dry weather.Subsequently, the district administration has decided to stock fodder partly by establishing fodder banks in all seven taluks in the district.A drive to procure fodder, launched on December 26, has received a good response, L. Prakash, Deputy Director, Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services, said. Speaking to The Hindu , he added that following the drive, there would be no scarcity of fodder in summer.A total of 418.98 metric tonnes of dry grass has been procured from farmers till Monday. On the other hand, the department has sowed green grass on 29 acres of government land in different parts of the district expecting a yield of at least 400 metric tonnes. The collection would cross at least 1,200 tonnes before the commencement of the monsoon, another officer said.The cattle population in the district is 5.13 lakh and the stock at the fodder banks will be sufficient for the next 16 weeks, Mr. Prakash said.The district administration has banned the transportation of fodder from the district."

These second generation farmers wish to market chemical-free and pesticide-free farm produce directly to the consumers and eventually become entrepreneurs.A stall has been put up by them at Bahuroopi where they have been marketing their produce, explaining the importance of the produce and how they have cultivated them the natural way as popularised by Subhash Palekar. Be it Kempakki (a red rice variety) or Amaranthus seeds (which are rich in nutrition) or toor dal and ragi grown naturally, the young farmers  some of them who have just passed out of college and want to step into their fathers shoes  have managed to draw the attention of those visiting the festival. Identified with Amrita Bhoomi, a charitable trust and an international centre for sustainable development, which is managed by Chukki Nanjundaswamy, daughter of veteran farmer leader M.D. Nanjundaswamy, they launched the initiative of taking farmers produce to the consumers here on December 25 last year.The naturally grown produce is available in front of Kukkarahalli Lake here every Sunday from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. Abhilash, a BA graduate farmer from Hosamalangi village in Kollegal taluk, whose father Rechanna won the prestigious Plant Genome Saviour Community Award in New Delhi in December last for preserving exotic paddy varieties, says, I want to make it big like my father. I want to produce seeds and distribute it among fellow farmers. Abhilash has grown Kempakki  which he claims has medicinal value and is good for joint aches. Inspired by Mr. Palekar, Naveen Kumar B.I. from Hassan district has cultivated yelakki banana using the zero farming method. Similarly, Raghu from Jyothigowdanapura and Mallikarjun from Hondarabalu village have grown toor dal using the same method. Muttegowda has produced ragi, veggies and leafy veggies.Tanuja, an MBA graduate from University of Mysore, whose father is a farmer in Kollegal taluk, assists them in their marketing on behalf of Amrita Bhoomi. As a steady stream of visitors throng the stall, Ms. Tanuja explains to them how different are the products sold at their stall from what is available elsewhere.She explains the difference between the banana grown the usual way and that is grown the natural way, which is available at their stall. Since the start of Bahuroopi, over 500 kg of bananas have been sold.She says Amaranthus seeds, which is the secret behind the strength of Soliga tribals and grown extensively by them, has found many takers."

On December 31, Janaki received a court notice directing her to reach Bhanjanagar court on January 9 to give her testimony in court as a witness. She did not have any money for this journey. It would have cost her more than Rs. 200 for the to and fro journey. Janakis family, comprising of her husband and five children, is extremely poor.According Bimbadhar Sarangi, a lawyer of the Bhanjanagar court, who decided to help Janaki in her fight for justice, the woman, along with her six-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son, decided to walk to Bhanjanagar.With only a few clothes and some flaked rice packed in a gunny bag, the three started their journey on foot from Pureipadar on January 1. They also did not have proper shoes for this long walk.On their way, they sought help from locals. They had walked almost 100 kms when on January 8, while crossing the Kalinga ghat road, a person took pity on them and helped them get a lift to Bhanjanagar, Mr Sarangi said.When the lawyers and others came to know of the plight and determination of Janaki, they came out to help her. Localites collected over Rs. 2500, which was handed over to her. After the journey she would have some money left which would be a small gift for the poor family, he said."

Sheikh Arejulla Hossain, who makes a living by writing poems on social evils, said the villages in his area were so hit by the demonetisation drive that he had been finding it difficult to sell his booklets that cost just Rs 5 a piece. Arejulla recites one of his poems in Joyrampur The 67-year-old poet from Joyrampur said he used to make at least Rs 100 daily before the note recall decision was announced. ""I can't even sell two books now,"" he said. For the past week, Arejulla has been venting his frustration through his poems. Armed with a loudspeaker and microphone, he has been roaming the villages on his cycle every morning, reciting his lines on demonetisation. "" Takar emon obhab keu dyakheyni kono kaley/ Jyano bajraghatey andhar raatey shob hoyechhey shesh/ Shesh hoyechey byacha-kena bajar poribesh (such a dearth of money nobody has ever seen in the past/ like a thunder in a dark night that destroyed everything/ buying-selling, market, everything has been destroyed),"" goes one of his rhymes. Asked why he was criticising the note ban, Arejulla said he though the poor villagers, who form the vast majority of India's population, had been the worst sufferers of the Prime Minister's decision. ""I am just giving voice to their anger. From November 9, the poor suddenly became poorer. I know many, many people who have not been able to afford two square meals a day since demonetisation kicked in,"" said the villager, nicknamed kobiraj (king of poets) in the area. ""I am not doing this for money. I want to let everybody know about the eccentric decision taken by Narendra Modi,"" he added. Besides the Rs 100-odd he used to make daily from the sale of his poetry booklets, Arejulla used to depend on the money sent by his sons - Amjad, Mazarul and Zahidul - from Ernakulam. The currency crisis not only forced them to stop sending the money home, they had to return to the village after losing their jobs. Mazarul has since been acting in local jatras (plays). The other two brothers have not been able to find any employment. The poet said his family had been surviving on rice and salt for the past one month. ""Similar is the condition in about 900 families in the panchayat area, where over 2,000 youths have returned home after losing their jobs in other states,"" Arejulla said. ""Everyone is angry. But they can do nothing. The thing I can do is write about the anger."" A school dropout at 14, Arejulla is a self-taught man who reads several vernacular newspapers daily. Since he cannot afford to buy papers every day, he goes 2km from his home to a tea stall."

One of the four agencies engaged by the state government, the Assam State Agricultural Marketing Board took the lead in surpassing the target yesterday. The state had set a procurement target of 1,42,000MT during the kharif marketing season in 2016-17. The board has to lift 40,000MT from paddy growers during the season. ""This is unprecedented and quite in contrast to the trend last year when the board could lift only 11,000MT from paddy growers. It's a jumpstart for sure, thanks to the coordinated efforts of the state food and civil supplies and agriculture departments,"" an official of the board told The Telegraph today. The other three agencies -Food Corporation of India (FCI), National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) and National Federation of Farmers' Procurement, Processing & Retailing Co-operatives of India (Nacof) - are yet to start procurement. The FCI is set to procure 62,000MT paddy during the season, while Nafed and Nacof will buy 20,000MT each. The official said the Assam Food and Civil Supplies Corporation would soon provide Rs 4 crore to the board to speed up the process. ""We are not only on course but will surpass the season's target. The corporation's support will definitely lend impetus to our procurement. It is a development that has taken place at the behest of state food, civil supplies and consumer affairs minister Rihon Daimary,"" he said. Under the programme, procurement of xali rice (first crop) started from January 1 and will continue till March 31. Boro rice will be procured from May onwards. Milling and delivery of custom milled rice will begin thereafter and continue till September 30. Paddy is being procured from farmers across 41 paddy procurement centres in 28 districts. Sources in the agriculture department said bulk of the paddy was bought from growers in central Assam districts, particularly Nagaon, Darrang and Sonitpur in the first fortnight. ""The process will pick up in Upper Assam in the next fortnight,"" an official said. Last year, Assam had failed to meet the procurement target of about 1 lakh MT, falling short by 37,000MT. The objective of the paddy procurement programme is to ensure that the farmers get the minimum support price, a rate fixed by the government to protect the producers/farmers against excessive fall in price during the bumper production years and prevent distress sale. The procurement is done so that a state is not dependent on the public distribution system of another state. The government had last year hiked the minimum support price of paddy by Rs 60 to Rs 1,470 per quintal for the 2016-17 season. On the mode of payment given the cash crunch post-demonetisation, the board official said the farmers are being paid through real-time gross settlement, where the payment transactions are being settled as soon as they are processed. A rice-surplus state since 2010-11, Assam produced 51.93 lakh MT rice in 2013-14."
58f4f2ca7be9e018510a0099,Contraband racket worry for police,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170116/jsp/odisha/story_130510.jsp,2017-01-16,"Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: Police claimed to have seized 634 grams of brown sugar from various places across the city last year and touted it as a major achievement for the force. In reality, however, network of drug peddlers remains widespread and they have managed to turn Bhubaneswar into a haven for peddling contraband. The seizure of brown sugar having a market value of Rs 60 lakh was the highest in a single year since the inception of a separate commissionerate in 2008. According to official statistics, the cops managed to recover only 8.7 grams of brown sugar in Bhubaneswar between 2011 and 2015. While there was no seizure of the contraband between 2011 and 2014, the police recovered 8.7 grams in 2015 alone. Several residents felt that the failure of the police to crack down on peddlers five years ago had resulted in the proliferation of the brown sugar racket. ""The sale of brown sugar was low five years back. Most peddlers were involved in the ganja trade at that time. Besides, the sale of brown sugar was restricted to habitual addicts,"" a police official said, on the condition of anonymity. Sources said over the years, the peddlers have started adopting different ways to conceal the contraband. ""It's very difficult to conceal ganja, which is procured in kilograms. But in the case of brown sugar, the peddlers have become very smart. During raids, we have found peddlers hiding the drug inside shoes, ice cream containers and even in rice containers, which makes it difficult for us to seize it,"" said a city excise official. The contraband is mostly smuggled into Odisha from states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Bengal. Small time traders in slums procure it from Balasore and its adjoining areas and sell it in the capital at hefty margins. The city police decided to crack down on drug peddling after an engineering student died of an overdose of an alleged brown sugar overdose last May. ""The most difficult part of detecting such rackets is gathering intelligence. We have to often depend on addicts, but they cannot be relied on completely. If we send decoys, the peddlers don't sell to them out of suspicion,"" said another police official. Deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the police had created a database of the city's peddlers, who have been arrested in the past. ""We have directed local police stations to keep track of the peddlers after they are released on bail. Besides, we are keeping a close watch on slums where the contraband is sold,"" said Bhoi."
