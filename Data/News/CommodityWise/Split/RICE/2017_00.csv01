It also asked the Central government to extend the rice procurement period for three months.Kerala had rolled out the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in November 2016, under which foodgrains are sold to the poor at a highly subsidised rate of Rs.1-Rs.3 a kg via the public distribution system (PDS), also called ration shops.The Kerala Chief Minister has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under the NFSA, Mr. Paswan told reporters after the meeting.In the meeting, sources said that the Chief Minister demanded that the State be given foodgrains for PDS supply that it used to get before implementing the NFSA.Under the NFSA, the State is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, lower than 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.Uniform formulaTo this, the Food Minister said that a uniform formula has been applied to all States while allocating foodgrains under the food security law.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account the last three years average foodgrains lifting of the State. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is being given to protect poor people, a senior Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. It has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes a month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the State. PTI"

""I am not bothered about my life but as long as I live I will continue my fight against domestic violence and in favour of social uplift of Muslim women. My life has been a struggle since childhood. I am not afraid of any threats,"" Najima said. Najima is a candidate of activist Irom Sharmila's party, the People's Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA), and will contest from Wabgai constituency. Najima said she was attracted by Sharmila's 16-year-old fast against the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and decided to join her when she formed a political party. ""Sharmila's fight has always fascinated and inspired me. Her relentless fight against all odds is an example of how strong a Manipuri woman can be. So, when she decided to join politics, I decided to stand shoulder to shoulder with her. If I become an MLA, I will have policies for education, women's issues, against AFSPA, for small scale employment generation and many other things, which I want to use to help society we live in,"" Najima said. But her decision to join politics and contest elections has kicked off a storm as she's facing a fatwa in her home constituency of Wabgai. Religious leaders in Santhel Mamang Leikai have publicly announced that Najima will be given no burial ground after her death. The people of the village are discouraged to talk to her because of her political involvement. ""What I do in my lifetime is important. If I am able to work for the uplift of women, it would give me more peace. What will I do by knowing what is being done to me after my death?"" she asked. Najima said there are people with an orthodox mentality who have always come in her way of work. ""When I used to travel on a cycle to the meetings, people used to make fun of me. So when they made fun of me, I instead got encouraged. There is something special in what I am doing, which they can't handle"". From being the only girl in her class and the first girl in the family to complete her class X, amid taunts and harassment, Najima has come a long way. She was forced to get married as soon as she completed her class X. But she ran away from home and married a man she had only met twice. Her husband turned out to be abusive and she walked out of the marriage within six months. After her divorce, she realised the importance of self-reliance and economic independence for women. She initiated a programme for local women called cheng marup, a rice thrift fund. ""Everyday the women in the group would take out a handful of rice from the quantity to be cooked at home. These were collected and kept in my house, and twice a month, whoever's turn came, she would get the entire rice and sell it to earn some money. It was looked with suspicion by the Leikai people, as I was divorced and our savings are considered theft, but we were determined to keep it running,"" she said. It was a workshop on gender equality in 2001 that proved to be a turning point in Najima's life, who is in her forties. ""I decided to help any and everyone possible and wanted to ensure that women don't face harassment, abandonment and violence,"" she said. Najima now runs a shelter home for destitute women. ""In 2006, religious leaders issued a fatwa against me and I was socially abandoned in the village. I was not allowed to take water from the community pond now allowed to buy anything from the village shops. So, I am used to it. It really doesn't make a difference. My only aim in life is to work for the social empowerment of woman so that they don't face abuse,"" she said."

58f4fcb1a3d24b0b70c1bda9,Surviving the drought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Surviving-the-drought/article17031553.ece,2017-01-13,"Tamil Nadus move to declare a drought, ironically on the eve of the harvest festival of Pongal, is an important step to address the agrarian distress that is sweeping the State following poor rainfall during the northeast monsoon. Even with relatively better governance structures, desperation among farmers has resulted in a spate of suicides, particularly in the Cauvery delta rice belt that has received little water from Karnataka in recent times. An official declaration of drought brings relief: postponement of loan recovery, waiver of land tax and alternative employment through schemes such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. The challenge now is to infuse confidence among farmers that the government is fully behind them. As agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan has pointed out, there is a need to look ahead and institute reforms in drought management for effective distress mitigation. These should be founded on a participatory approach, one that intensively engages the farm community year-round. A monsoon management centre drawing upon the expertise of multiple departments would, for instance, help use scarce resources conservatively during a drought, and maximise their potential in good times. It is also crucial to preserve the health of cattle and other livestock, as they tend to suffer irreparable harm during drought, with cascading effects on their future productivity. The Centre should provide all support to achieve this under the National Disaster Response Fund and the Prime Ministers crop insurance scheme.The importance of welfare support for small and marginal farmers cannot be overstated, given the vagaries of the monsoon. More than a decade ago, the National Commission on Farmers pointed out that successive droughts, illness, high expenditure on social obligations and asset loss push farmers to the brink. Yet, not much has changed in the management of drought from the low-budget practices of the colonial era, as the Swaraj Abhiyan case in the Supreme Court last year revealed. No more time can be lost in making the administrative system for agriculture responsive to todays needs. The Centre has to ensure that the Drought Management Manual is updated to reflect farmers concerns, chiefly, giving weightage to the amount of rainfall deficit and declaring a drought without delay. In Tamil Nadu, excessive reliance on water-intensive rice cultivation, and lower priority for hardy millets have raised the risk for many farmers. Active recharging of groundwater and harvesting of surface water are vital to meet the challenges."

Picture by Nagendra Kumar Singh Patna, Feb. 23: Governor Ram Nath Kovind's speech on Thursday underlined the 10-month total prohibition as a panacea for many ills afflicting the state while highlighting the government's achievements in the past year and setting goals for the new fiscal (2017-18). Addressing both Houses of the state legislature, Kovind said: ""Total prohibition has empowered society. People have become healthy and disciplined. The prohibition's impact is manifesting progress in the state. Murder, loot, dacoity and kidnapping for ransom have gone down by 22 per cent, 18 per cent, 23 per cent and 42 per cent respectively between April 2016 (total prohibition was clamped on April 5, 2016) and January 2017. Domestic violence has diminished remarkably."" Prohibition occupied bigger space in the 17-page governor's speech drafted by the Nitish Kumar-led cabinet. It was dealt in two longish paragraphs. But the chief minister's saat nishchay (seven resolves) - his cardinal electoral promises - were dealt barely in one paragraph. ""The benefit of the seven resolves has been percolating down to one and all without differentiation. The government is working to ensure potable water, electricity, toilets, education in skill and self-reliance to youths and women between 2015 and 2020,"" said the governor, amid thumping of desks in Treasury Benches. Leader of Opposition in the Council, Sushil Kumar Modi, however, ridiculed the government's claim. ""The government has so far not released funds to the panchayats to carry forward the seven resolves. It is setting new priorities while relegating the old one into the background,"" Sushil said, talking to reporters in his Council chamber. Kovind dwelt at length on how Bihar gave a strong message for total prohibition through the 12,760km-long human chain 3.02 crore people joined on January 21. The governor also announced that the state government would pay Rs 11 lakh as compensation to martyrs, hailing from Bihar, in war or war-like situations anywhere in the country. He also said the government would pay Rs 51,000 for the marriage of granddaughters of freedom fighters and reserve two per cent seats for them in government jobs. Kovind said: ""The government has introduced the Right to Service Act to end corruption at the lower-level of bureaucracy and empower people. So far, the government has disposed of 14.92 crore applications received under the Right to Service Act."" Showing how the government was concerned for the Extremely Backward Classes (EBC), believed to be the Nitish-led JDU's core base of voters, the governor said: ""The government has reserved 21 per cent seats in judicial services for the EBCs against 12 per cent for the Other Backward Classes (OBC) and 16 per cent for the Scheduled Castes."" -OVERMATTER- Kovind, in his 70-minute speech, also enumerated steps taken for modernisation of the police force. ""The government has built as many as 151 police buildings, which include Banka police lines, Naxal police stations and tourism police stations. The government has also built 559 toilets for women police personnel across police stations and police lines in the state,"" he said. The governor said Bihar was ahead in national average in terms of production of paddy, wheat and maize. ""The state is estimated to produce 84.9 lakh metric tonnes of rice during 2016-17, which is a record of sorts,"" he said. Kovind also enumerated the work being done under the agriculture roadmap, mission human development, skill development mission and industrial promotion scheme. ""The government is working relentlessly for the all-round development of the state under its broader vision of nyay ke saath vikas (growth with justice),"" he said."

(Animesh Sengupta & Bhola Prasad) An Under-18 football team from Madhya Pradesh, participating in the Jamshedpur leg of the ongoing I-League, was forced to vacate a steel city hotel on Wednesday evening after its owner defaulted on bills. The tired and famished players of Pride Sports, which lost a closely fought tie 1-0 to Tata Football Academy (TFA) earlier in the day, had to survive on a dole of snacks till they found shelter and their first proper meal in days at JRD Tata Sports Complex, 3km from the hotel in Sakchi, later in the night. Team owner Sukanto das, who is based in Calcutta and had allegedly remained incommunicado for three days, told this newspaper on Thursday that he was trying to make alternative accommodation arrangements. Pride Sports have to play three more matches in Jamshedpur. The team will take on North Eastern Re-organising Cultural Association (NEROCA) on February 24; clash with Aizawl FC on February 26; and play another tie with TFA on February 28, when the league ends in the steel city. Owner of Hotel Holdei Inn Md Merazuddin said he was left with no choice but to issue vacate orders after the outstanding amount touched Rs 1.03 lakh for the 33-member team, including three coaches, which had checked in on February 17. ""In a goodwill gesture, we had not taken any advance from Pride Sports. But, when asked to foot the bills, team officials said the owner was not sending any money. They said the owner's phone was switched off for three days. What choice did we have?"" the hotel owner said. Himself a former footballer, Merazuddin was gracious enough to treat the boys to samosas and also arrange and pay for public transport (auto-rickshaws) till the residential wing of the JRD complex. He also informed Tata Steel sports department and Sakchi thana to avoid hassles and complications. The match ended at 3.50pm and the team reached hotel at 5.10pm. The players packed their bags and left around 8pm and reached the sports complex at 9pm. Pride Sports head coach Lalita Kumari and assistant coaches Ashish Pillai and Sumit Srivastava said they pleaded with the hotel owner to let them stay for a few more days, but admitted that they understood his situation too. Assistant coach Srivastava said the team morale had hit rock bottom. ""The boys did not get a proper meal ever since they arrived in Jamshedpur. We (team coaches) spent from our own pockets to offer them food, but they are not getting the solid diet that they need,"" he rued. One of the players, winger Balraj Hela, said they were served rice, chapatti and chicken for dinner at the JRD complex on Wednesday evening. ""It was the first time we had non-vegetarian meal here. Else, we were eating only bread and bananas."" Defender Bipin Mairam said if breakfast was bread and bananas at the hotel, lunch was rice and dal at roadside eateries in Sakchi. ""Sometimes we ate only biscuits and tea. We are footballers; we need stamina to play well; and stamina doesn't come out of an empty stomach."" Speaking from Calcutta over phone, team owner Das said he could not send money because sponsors were not obliging. ""I am extremely sorry for the inconveniences faced by the boys and support staff. I am trying to send money by this (Thursday) evening to clear hotel dues and arrange for another accommodation."" Das, however, clammed up when asked why his cellphone had remained switched off for three days. How can the state ensure proper hosting of guest teams? Tell [email protected]"
58f4fdbfa3d24b0b70c1be9a,Focussing on the marginal farmer,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Focussing-on-the-marginal-farmer/article17057550.ece,2017-01-19,"The sluice gate on the Bhakra main line canal in Khanauri-Kalan village in Sangrur district, Punjab, has become infamous. According to reports, it is a suicide point for farmers and their families. Typically, 30-45 corpses are found in the canal on average every month. Farmers suicide in Punjab is a major worry: over 2,632 farmers are reported to have committed suicide between 1995 and 2015,in the land famed for its Green Revolution, according to State government records. Mansa district alone accounts for 1,334 suicides. Adding farm labourers raises the total to 4,687 reported suicides. The reasons for this vary: cotton crop has been whittled by whiteflies, basmatis market price has declined, the local moneylender has hiked up rates to 20 per cent. The farmer ekes his way to penury.Farmer suicides are not a new trend. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 2,195 marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in 2015 (of which 834 were in Maharashtra), while 3,618 small farmers undertook such drastic steps, with Maharashtra alone seeing 1,285. More curiously, a larger number of small farmers rather than marginal farmers reportedly committed suicide in States like Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka. Somehow, small farmers are also bedevilled by the agricultural crisis, and this is not the case in just the traditional drought-stricken States.On input costsAgriculture in States like Punjab is typically a monoculture of wheat and paddy. When input costs associated with fertilizers, crop-protection chemicals and seeds rose, along with fixed costs associated with agricultural equipment such as tractors and submersible pumps, agriculture became economically unviable. Prices have risen  of arhar seeds and staple crops like paddy and sugarcane, of fertilizers and plain barley. The old days of farmers handing seeds as family heirlooms to their sons are long gone. Hiring labourers and animals is expensive. With an increase in application of crop-protection chemicals, soya bean has seen a massive jump in pesticide cost. Given a jump in input costs, cultivation costs have gone up in multiples. The total cost of cultivation for wheat rose three times from 2004-05 to 2012-13.While traditionally the blame is cast on the usurious local moneylender, NCRB data highlight that 2,474 of the 3,000 farmers who were reported to have committed suicide in 2015 had loans from local banks, while those who had loans from moneylenders were just 9.8 per cent of the total. Maharashtra reported 1,293 such suicides for indebtedness, while Karnataka had 946. Meanwhile, farmers in Punjab are estimated to have an outstanding debt of Rs. 69,355 crore. Somehow, the traditional moneylender is seemingly more flexible than local banks.Retailoring agricultureSolving this crisis requires an inclusive approach. Our policies should encourage integrated pest management, an approach that focusses on combining biological, chemical, mechanical and physical means to combat pests with a long-term emphasis on eliminating or significantly reducing the need for pesticides. In Vietnam, over 2 million of the Mekong Deltas rice farmers adopted a no spray early rule, curbing insecticide applications within the first 40 days of rice planting. Predatory beetles that commonly prey on rice pests were sustained, encouraging the crop while cutting pesticide use by over 50 per cent.The local fertilizer industry needs support  timely delivery of subsidies would improve working capital requirements, enabling them to manage costs through internal sources rather than external loans. Delayed payments can cause an interest outgo of Rs. 3,500 crore for fertilizer firms annually. State seed policies should focus on encouraging contract farming, along with identification of new genotypes for treating pest and disease syndromes, as well as adverse weather conditions. Precision-farming techniques like Systematic Rice Intensification can help increase seed production in this regard.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment and implements that are currently imported. Subsidies should be rerouted to ensure lower collateral requirements, longer moratoriums and payback periods for farmers seeking to buy equipment and entrepreneurs seeking to setup Custom Hiring Centres (CHC) for agricultural equipment. Companies with a corporate social responsibility focus on agriculture can be further encouraged to invest in capacity-building initiatives, skill development and the establishment of CHCs.We need to ensure that institutional financing is available and accessible and benefit provision is simplified while disbursed funds are effectively monitored. States should seek to establish early warning signals, monitoring farmers who go past set limits and seek unsustainable loans. Village-wise lists of deeply indebted farmers must be prepared annually to identify farmers on the flight path to penury and potential suicide. The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, along with the local administration, should be tasked with analysing such lists for macro and local policy interventions, along with devising timely loan restructuring initiatives, insurance claim settlements and better counselling.Finally, such individuals must be treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Given the hard struggle of making a living in agriculture these days, such farmers face big odds for sustaining their families and educating their children. Travelling through the by-lanes of suicide-stricken villages in Bijnor, Bahraich, Kheri, Allahabad, Aligarh and Moradabad is a humbling and disconcerting experience. Even distributing Rs.50,000 per distraught marginal farmer family has had little impact; so deep is the scale of agrarian distress. Our efforts in crowdfunding have been a palliative for over 3,000 farmers, but only systemic change can transform their situation. The marginal farmer requires more than just hope now.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency for the BJP.Our farm equipment policy needs to be retailored with a focus on manufacturing farming equipment that is currently imported"

Studies showed a direct correlation between white rice consumption and prevalence of diabetes, said V. Mohan, Chairman, Dr. Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre and Director of Madras Diabetes Research Foundation here on Monday.Speaking at the inaugural of the Centres branch in Thanjavur, Dr. Mohan pointed out that there were an estimated 70 million people with diabetes in the country and about 80 million had pre-diabetes, the onset stage.Prevalence of diabetes in urban Tamil Nadu used to be around two % and in rural areas just about one % in the 1970s. These figures had risen to over 25 % in Chennai and around 14-18 % in cities such as Coimbatore, Madurai, Tiruchi and Thanjavur.Even in rural areas of the State, diabetes prevalence had risen from one % to 8 or 10 % in the past four decades or so. It could not be explained by genetic factors, as our genes had not changed much in the last 30 or 40 years, Dr. Mohan said.Two environment factors stood out as far as Tamil Nadu was concerned. Instead of eating traditional food such as hand-pounded rice or brown rice that were high in fibre content and also had lower glycemic index, people were preferring highly polished white rice which had a very high glycemic index and lower fibre content. Another factor was the rapid decline in physical activity because of motorised transport and domestic automation. The situation needed a lasting solution, he said.Killivalavan, Consultant Diabetologist, will be heading the Thanjavur branch which plans to conduct free screening camps in collaboration with agencies such as Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation.Subham Bardhan, CEO, Dr. Mohans Group of Institutions, said the Thanjavur facility was their 25th branch."

The water was left over after rice for the midday meal was cooked. ""We found that the cooks didn't dispose of the hot water properly after cooking the meal,"" West Champaran deputy development commissioner Rajesh Meena told The Telegraph by phone on Friday. ""Had they done so, the incident would not have taken place."" Meena headed the committee that had Narkatiaganj sub-divisional officer Arvind Mandal and its sub-divisional police officer Aman Kumar as members. The committee had been drafted by the district administration. Meena said he would now submit the report to the district magistrate on the basis of which action would be initiated against the persons concerned. Shubham Kumari received burn injuries when she fell into the pot containing hot water on Tuesday while trying to collect a plate from the school kitchen for the midday meal served at the government middle school at Bhitiharwa Ashram in Gaunaha block, around 210km northwest of Patna. The incident took place around 12.30pm on Tuesday. The half-an-hour lunch break had just started. The girl suffered 60 per cent burns and was rushed to a local primary health centre and from there to AJK Hospital in Bettiah, the district headquarters town of West Champaran district, where she died on Wednesday. Following the incident, the state government provided Rs 4 lakh in compensation to the girl's family and initiated an inquiry. The education department has transferred all five teachers to other schools while the six cooks, who cooked midday meal for about 300 students, have been asked not to come till further orders. The school has students up to Class VIII. ""We deputed teachers of this school to other places as there was anger against them among the residents,"" Gaunaha block education officer Vijay Kumar Verma said. The department would decide on departmental action on the findings of the inquiry, he said. To ensure teaching is not hit, five teachers from nearby schools have been deputed to the Bhitiharwa Middle School and a senior among them, Chandra Prakash Ram, has been made headmaster in-charge for the time being, the block education officer said. No midday meal was cooked on Wednesday and Thursday as the cooks have been asked not to come to the school till further orders. Friday was a holiday because of Shivratri. ""We have requested the Vidyalaya Siksha Samiti to recommend at least three to four names of cooks so that midday meal can be served at the school from Saturday,"" Verma said. The Samiti consists of village residents and cooks are appointed on the basis of its recommendations.

File picture Shillong, Feb. 27: Meghalaya's indigenous innovation in developing living root bridges has been recognised for an award. The state, which will celebrate National Science Day for three days from tomorrow at the state central library here, is looking for more such indigenous innovations in various fields. Speaking to reporters here today, the officer on special duty for the state council of science, technology and environment, Augustus Suting, said 44 indigenous innovations from Meghalaya - including the eco-friendly crematorium designed by the late C. Shullai and a technique for trapping rice bugs in paddy fields, developed by assistant agronomist in the Ri-Bhoi district agriculture office, K.D. Kharkongor - have been recognised by the National Innovation Foundation (NIF) in the last few years. National Science Day is celebrated to mark the discovery of the Raman effect by physicist Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman on February 28, 1928. To observe the day, the state council of science, technology and environment, in collaboration with the Shillong Science Centre and Meghalaya Basin Development Authority, is organising various activities from tomorrow till Thursday. ""This year is an innovation year. These 44 innovations will be on display at the event, which is a platform for innovators from across the state to showcase grassroots innovations,"" Suting said. Senior manager of the Meghalaya Basin Development Authority's knowledge services division, Wankitkupar Swer, said living root bridges were community-driven innovations. The living root bridges have been nominated for national recognition in the upcoming ninth biennial competition of the NIF, which will be held at Rastrapati Bhavan on March 4. ""The recognition is not for any single community but for all communities engaged in growing the living root bridges,"" Swer said. He said some of the communities engaged in growing living root bridges include the villages of Nongriat, Nohwet (Riwai, Mawlynnong), Kudang Rim, Nongthymmai, Mawkyrnot, Nongblai, Khonglah, Padu and Shnongpdeng. ""There are many lesser-known communities that grow living root bridges that we are yet to identify. We would tremendously appreciate it if anyone could kindly carry the message in case there is any community that has not been represented in the list,"" Swer said. According to Swer, scouting of the living root bridges was conducted for about a year by the NIF in collaboration with the Meghalaya Basin Development Authority and state council of science, technology and environment. As part of National Science Day celebrations, various activities, including competitions for schoolchildren will be organised. Meghalaya deputy chief minister R.C. Laloo will inaugurate the event tomorrow at 11am. A regional innovators conclave, in which innovators from various states of the Northeast will showcase their talents, will also be organised."

(Bhola Prasad) They can give British Sikh centenarian marathoner Fauja Singh a run for his money. Shopkeeper Achinto Pramanik (64) and college teacher Shanti Mukta Barla (52) put their age behind them and blazed the tracks at the 38th National Masters' Athletics Championship held in Hyderabad from February 21 to 25. Nicknamed Turbaned Tornado, Singh is a world record holder among athletes of his age. His current personal best time for the London Marathon (2003) is 6 hours, 2 minutes and his marathon record, for age 90-plus, is 5 hours and 40 minutes at the age of 92, at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon. With no sponsorships, the two spent their own money to go to Hyderabad. Pramanik, who runs a general shop near his Gamharia residence in neighbouring Serikela-Kharsawan, slotted home four medals, including 3 gold and a silver, at the national meet. Barla, a BEd lecturer at Jamshedpur Women's College and a resident of Adityapur, claimed a silver and bronze to win laurels for Jharkhand. Pramanik, who bagged gold medals in the 800m, 1500m and 200m steeple chase as well as a silver in the 4x400m relay, said running was his passion. ""I wanted to prove my fitness and send a message that age is not a barrier when there is passion and zeal to excel,"" said the Gamharia resident who has won medals in national meets for master athletes held earlier. Barla, who work out for three hours under mentor and former international athlete Saroj Lakra at JRD Tata Sports Complex, said she loved to win and keep herself in fine shape. ""I sustain myself on simple food and seldom go for the junk variety. I believe in working hard and leaving the rest to the almighty. Remember, hard work and sincereity always pays,"" she told The Telegraph. Pramanik, who sweats it out for four hours every day to keep himself fit, leaves home at 4am to run along the 4-km Gamharia-Kandra Road. His routine is the same in the evening. What about diet? ""It is simple and vegetarian. I take two chapattis with a cup of tea for breakfast, rice and dal for lunch and chapatti and milk for dinner. In between, I don't eat anything except a lot of milk and curd,"" he revealed. Both athletes rue lack of sponsorship from the Jharkhand Masters Athletic Association or Athletic Masters Federation of India. ""We had to arrange money on our own. We spent over Rs 10,000 each for the trip to Hyderabad. We know spending on our own will not help but our passion for running keeps us going.

Hailing from the same village in Seraikela-Kharsawan district, the 22-year-old accredited climber understands the hardships children born and brought up in remoteness, far from the flame of literacy, face as adults. No wonder she took up the cudgels to make BPL youths of Batabera computer-literate and has trained more than 100 since she launched her programme at her ancestral home in late 2014. ""I don't come from an affluent family. My father is a rice trader and I studied in the village pathshala (school). I worked very hard to get to college and stand up on my own feet. I wanted to give something in return to a village that supported me to the hilt when life became challenging,"" Chandana, an epitome of courage and compassion, told this newspaper on Wednesday, the occasion of International Women's Day. Having recently joined Tata Sponge Iron Limited at Joda in Keonjhar district of Odisha as a gym manager, Chandana has roped in two trained youths to run her computer classes in Batabera. ""I am not able to devote as much time as I would want to because of my job. But, the programme is on. The current batch strength is 65. My primary objective is to groom young boys and girls in life skills for which the computer programme comes in handy,"" said the arts graduate from Jamshedpur Workers' College who also has a diploma from Indian Institute of Networking and Hardware Technology, based in the steel city. Apart from her computer literacy programme, Chandana is also educating Batabera about and against social ills such as child marriage. ""Raising a girl child in a remote village is not just difficult, it is perhaps the toughest challenge. Child marriage means incomplete education, which forever leaves her at the mercy of men in our patriarchal society. I have convinced some people of Batabera to let their daughters study and become something in life. I have faith that they will lead by example,"" the climber said over phone from Joda. Her target always tall, Chandana completed her basic mountaineering training from Atal Bihari Institute of Allied Sports in 2014 and finished her advanced course from the same institute in 2015. She has trekked to Greenland - a massive island and autonomous Danish territory between the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans, which is about 80 per cent ice - and has scaled Mt Aconcagua, which at 22,837ft is the tallest peak in the southern and western hemispheres. Chandana has also explored Mera Peak (23,490ft) and Mt Baruntse (23,000ft), both in Nepal. But, it goes without saying that her tallest challenge is bringing her native Batabera to age."

While some officials described the transfer of Anil Verma as routine as it was one of the many replacements announced today, others said initiatives to make the paddy procurement process more transparent could have influenced the move. ""It is a routine transfer. Secretaries of the departments of personnel and administrative reforms (PAR), self-help groups and fisheries were also transferred at the same time. A majority of these officers had spent enough time in their departments. So, the transfers were inevitable,"" a Nabanna official said. Among the others transferred today were Prabhat Mishra, the fisheries secretary who was sent to the PAR department and Manoj Agarwal, the PAR secretary who will replace Verma in the food and supplies department. Verma would take over the charge of the self-help group department, replacing Sunil Gupta, who will be the new fisheries secretary. Sources said the chief minister was not happy with Verma after the procurement process that started in December last year did not gain momentum under him. ""The chief minister was given the feedback that the initiatives put in place by Verma were causing trouble. The chief minister was all the more worried because her pet project Khadyasathi, under which cheap foodgrain is supplied to 1.7 crore people, depends heavily on the government's paddy procurement,"" said a source. Officials said the steps initiated by Verma included:  Benefits would be transferred directly to the bank accounts of farmers so that they don't have to depend on co-operatives or rice mill owners  One farmer would be allowed to sell a maximum of 45 quintals of paddy so that more and more growers get a chance ""Along with these restrictions, the Centre's demonetisation drive caused the slump in the paddy procurement,"" an official said. The Bengal government could procure only about 1.5 lakh tonnes of paddy in the first month, much lower to meet the state's annual requirement of about 55 lakh tonnes to run the cheap foodgrain scheme."
58f507557be9e018510a1ce2,Indus Valley 'urban' tag contested,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170306/jsp/nation/story_139226.jsp,2017-03-06,"Excavations at Masudpur in Haryana, one of the many rural settlements of the Indus Valley civilisation. Picture courtesy: Cameron Petrie New Delhi, March 5: Archaeologists have challenged the prevailing view that the Indus Valley civilisation was primarily an urban culture, nestled close to rivers, and vanished rapidly because of failing rains. Relying on excavations over the past decade, a team of Indian and British researchers has suggested the Indus civilisation's rural settlements have been under-appreciated, and that its people used multiple water sources and were resilient enough to adapt to the increasing aridity. They say their excavations indicate the Indus people harvested diverse crops, thrived in rural and urban settlements, and seemed prepared to respond to the rainfall decline that occurred between 2100BC and 1900BC and has long been linked to the civilisation's end. ""Some chapters about the Indus civilisation need to be rewritten,"" said Ravindra Nath Singh, professor of archaeology at Banaras Hindu University who is collaborating with archaeologists from the University of Cambridge to examine the civilisation's rural sites in northwestern India. Almost all archaeologists agree that the Indus civilisation's largest settlements such as Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Ganweriwal, Rakhigarhi and Dholavira emerged around 2500BC and flourished up to 1900BC. But the cause and pace of the civilisation's decline has remained a puzzle. Many researchers have attributed it to weaker rainfall starting about 2100BC. The drier weather, according to this emerging view, led the Indus people to abandon their cities and move eastward into the fertile Gangetic plains. Some archaeologists have proposed that the failing rains merely hastened a decline that had already started. Ravindra Singh Bisht, former deputy director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India, who had directed excavations at Dholavira, says weakening trade with contemporary Mesopotamia around 2000 BC ruined the civilisation's economy. ""The trade failure and the persistently failing rains may have both contributed to the end,"" said Bisht, who is not associated with the BHU-Cambridge study. ""The Indus civilisation still poses mysteries. We still do not know who founded the civilisation or exactly how and why it ended. Some of these mysteries may remain as long as the script remains un-deciphered."" The BHU-Cambridge researchers say the patterns of ancient settlements do not reveal an abrupt or massive migration of people between 2100BC and 1900 BC. Instead, they suggest that the transition from the Indus Valley to the Gangetic plains was slower and smoother than presumed. ""The decline of the Indus cities appears not to have been a classic collapse, but was something that took time,"" Cameron Petrie, a South Asian archaeology specialist at Cambridge, told The Telegraph. ""It may have (taken) up to 400 years. The dating is not precise and is a topic for future research."" Singh and Petrie will later this month launch fresh excavations at Lohari-Ragho in Haryana's Hissar district, which preliminary excavations suggest had been inhabited from 3000BC to about 1500BC, to piece together a sharper timeline of events. ""We've learnt from childhood that the Indus civilisation was an urban culture but it now appears that its cities were exceptions,"" Singh said. ""There is evidence for more than 3,000 village settlements across the region. They did not have the large buildings and drainage and bricks seen in the Indus cities. There was diversity in the way of living."" The Indus civilisation has long been portrayed as a riverine culture. But the archaeologists say that while cities like Mohenjodaro and Harappa were close to rivers, others such as Nausharo and Ghandi Umar Khan were in alluvial areas. Some sites in Sindh, Cholistan and Gujarat were in areas that were arid and lacked perennial rivers. In Haryana, for instance, the Ghaggar was dry during several months of the year. Rakhigarhi too is far from any major river. ""Even with no river (nearby), the civilisation flourished there,"" Singh said. ""We believe the people depended not just on rivers but also on water from wells and ponds and lakes that filled during the monsoon."" The BHU-Cambridge team has published its review of the excavations, conducted since 2007, in the journal Current Anthropology. Its studies also indicate that the Indus civilisation's farmers had domesticated rice long before rice from China spawned the crop's cultivation across the Gangetic plains. The researchers say their studies show that the Indus people grew rice, millet and tropical pulses and had adapted to living in different environmental conditions even before the emergence of the Indus cities. ""We have proposed that there was considerable variation in the ways the Indus populations accessed water... including direct rainfall, floodwater run-off, wells, pooling, and ponds,"" Petrie said. The diversity of crops and the multiple sources of water would have helped the Indus populations adapt to the rainfall decline. Petrie said: ""We think some of the ideas about climate and civilisation collapse and culture change are too simplistic and need to be re-evaluated."""

Deputy chief minister and finance minister Chowna Mein made the announcement on DBT in the Assembly while presenting the 2017-18 budget today. Launched in 2013, the DBT scheme, transfers subsidies directly to the people through their bank accounts with the objective of checking leakages, delays and corruption, among others. Presenting a Rs 689.28-crore fiscal deficit budget with thrust on skill development, recruitment reforms, women empowerment, tourism, infrastructure development and law and order, Mein said under the DBT scheme, Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households would get cash equivalent of 35kg rice and other priority households would get cash equivalent of 5kg rice per person at the rate of nearly Rs 24 per kg. For a family of five, this translates to Rs 600 per month directly to the bank account of the head of the family. Mein said, ""Arunachal Pradesh will be among the first states in the country to implement the DBT scheme in food subsidy and surely the first to do so in the entire Northeast. It reaffirms the commitment of our government to root out corruption, which has plagued society for long and will be a major pillar of governance reform.""

Increase the length of the Question Hour if needed."" The chief minister accused the Opposition of acting against the Council rules. ""When they cannot have their way they rush into the Well of the House to protest,"" he said. The Opposition was in no mood to relent and Nitish's comments added fuel to the fire. The Council was adjourned when Zero Hour had just started. The Council met again at 2.30pm. Wednesday's ruckus was mostly because of the BJP-led Opposition blasting the government over what they called tardy pace of paddy procurement in the state. Answering a question by MLC Sanjay Kumar Singh, food and consumer protection minister Madan Sahni said no target for paddy procurement was fixed for the last kharif season as the state's yield was at a record high of around 90 lakh tonnes. Sahni also revealed that altogether 10.34 lakh tonnes of paddy had been procured from 1.59 lakh farmers in the state till March 7, around 1.5 lakh tonnes more than last year. Leader of the Opposition in the Council Sushil Kumar Modi alleged that the ""entire paddy procurement in the state was a failure"". The senior BJP leader said: ""Altogether 4.76 lakh farmers have registered themselves for paddy procurement, but only 10.34 lakh tonnes have been procured from 1.59 lakh farmers so far. How can the government procure paddy from the remaining farmers by the end of the financial year? There is so little time remaining, while farmers have been waiting since November last year after harvesting their crop."" He also pointed out that the state government was paying Rs 2,376 for a quintal of rice to primary agriculture credit societies (PACS) instead of the Rs 2,454 prescribed by the central government. Alok Kumar Mehta jumped into the fray as his department is connected with paddy procurement through PACS, and a shouting match ensued. BPSC examination Opposition lawmaker Nawal Kishore Yadav said the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) fails to conduct the state civil services exams on time and then goes on to combine the examinations for different years and conduct them jointly. He alleged that the delay harms candidates. Energy and commercial taxes minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav denied that the practice harms candidates, but said the government would request the BPSC to conduct exams on time. He also assured the House that he would get Nawal's allegations examined. Temple land Replying to a question by BJP member Mangal Pandey, revenue and land reforms minister Madan Mohan Jha said 3,389 of 8,722 religious trusts and temples in the state were registered with the Bihar State Religious Trust Board.

But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

Picture by Anirban Choudhury Alipurduar, March 8: Three young teachers appointed to a government school in Alipurduar that reopened after five years have been going door-to-door to persuade people to admit their children. Bachyu Memorial Primary School had to close down in 2012 because of lack of students. Sources said the medium of instruction, which was Bengali, prompted the students to shift to other schools as the area where the institution is located is predominantly Hindi-speaking. The number of students dwindled from 10 in 2010 to two in 2012, when it eventually closed down. Local people took away the doors and windows and the benches. Primary teachers Ajoy Kumar Jaiswal, Pawan Yadav and Ria Das joined the school on February 7 and have since been going around the town persuading people to admit their children. The teachers, who have pooled in money to buy a few stools, have managed to get around 40 students enrolled till date. As of now, the trio have been taking classes for one hour a day from Monday to Saturday. Jaiswal, the teacher in-charge, said: ""All the 40 children belong to poor families and want mid-day meals, which we cannot provide now because of shortage of rice. But it should start soon. Else, the children will leave again. The school doesn't have proper infrastructure. We are trying to improve it."" Prem Kant Kamti, the sub-inspector of schools, has changed the medium of instruction to Hindi in line with the linguistic composition of the population. ""I have already requested the higher officials to provide Rs 35,000 for repairing the school. I have also written to the food and supplies department for rice for the mid-day meals,"" Kamti said. Some guardians appeared doubtful of letting their children to continue in the school. ""When the teachers had come to my house, they had assured me that mid-day meals would be given to the students every day. They had promised books and dresses too. But a month is over since the classes began. They still haven't kept a single word,"" said Shibaji Singh, a guardian."

A sudden jump in cashless transactions was registered in the city after the note ban. ""Before November 8, 2016 there were hardly 2% buyers who were using credit/debit cards at the petrol pumps. However, the number shot up to 35% after the demonetisation,"" said MP Petrol Pumps Dealers Association president Ajay Singh. The situation changed by the end of December last year. ""The number of customers using cards to purchase fuel dipped to 25%,"" said Singh. There are 105 petrol pumps in the city. About the reason behind the decline in customers using cards, he said it might be because of the availability of cash in the market. ""I can't say it for sure, but it may be because of the easy availability of cash now,"" he said.The scenario is no different when it comes to grocery stores. There are around 50,000 grocery stores in Bhopal. Bhopal Kirana Vyapari Sangh president Sunil Punjabi said the customer is not prepared to shift to cashless transactions at present. ""Hardly 4 to 5 per cent retailers are into cashless transactions. The situation is even worse among the dealers. Hardly 2% dealers are into cashless transaction,"" said Punjabi.Citing the reason for not much cashless transactions, he said, ""For buying a chocolate or even one kg of rice neither customer nor vendor are ready to swipe card or paying through any other payment gateways. It will take time."" Even the roadside vendors who have started using payment gateways felt that people are also keen on making cash payment as the flow of cash is returning to normal in the market. ""For past one week I am getting more payments in cash. I had started the service to facilitate cashless payment, but people are in such haste that they do not want to spend much time on making payment for a tea or samosa,"" said Prakash Chandra, a small breakfast shop vendor.Few vendors felt that it will take time to inculcate the habit of cashless transaction. ""After the increase ATM withdrawal limit to Rs 10000 a day customers have started returning to the cash mode,"" said another street vendor selling Chinese food."

Corn markets were unchanged despite expectations for ample South American production, while wheat fell 0.5 percent. The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade dropped 0.1 percent to $10.24-1/2 a bushel. They closed down 1.2 percent on Tuesday, after hitting their weakest since Feb. 27 at $10.22-1/4 a bushel. ""Brazilian farmers are more than 50 percent through what is shaping up as a very large soybean crop,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. Broker and analyst INTL FCStone on Tuesday pegged the 2016/17 Brazil soybean crop at 109.07 million tonnes, up from its previous forecast of 104.09 million. The harvest has already started in Brazil, the world's top soy exporter. Meanwhile, dry weather has improved conditions on a key Amazon road between soy fields and northern Brazilian ports, ending an immense backlog of trucks carrying the beans, the country's army said on Monday. The most active wheat futures fell 0.44 percent to $4.54-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The most active corn futures were unchanged at $3.76 a bushel, after ending down 0.66 percent in the previous session, when prices hit a six-day low of $3.73-1/4 a bushel. INTL FCStone on Tuesday pegged the 2016/17 Brazil corn crop at 93.3 million tonnes, 1.8 million tonnes higher than its February outlook. Analysts also noted an outbreak of avian flu on a farm in Wisconsin as an area for concern for the market. A widespread outbreak could depress demand for corn, widely used to feed livestock. Traders are looking towards the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest outlook for South American crops in its monthly supply and demand report on Thursday.

The earlier nature of the scheme was take home supplement, under which students were given 3 kg rice every month. In 2001, after the Supreme Court 's instruction, the scheme began providing cooked food.Earlier last year, in order to promote transparency in the mid-day meal scheme in the government-aided schools, the state government made keeping an online record of the ration used for the daily meals mandatory."

Turning nostalgic, he said, ""I came here way back in 1968. There were just 20 to 22 of us here then.""Now, the city of lakes has become the second home to 1000-odd Odia families. The unmatched weather and beauty of the city was one of the main reasons for the community to come calling to Bhopal. Many of them say that the local climate here keeps them reminding of the pleasant weather in their original homeland -- land of Lord Jagannath.Another major attraction for the community was BHEL which provided a great job opportunity to the educated community that was in search of greener pastures. ""Between 2006 and 2008, there was a buzz about recruitment in BHEL. Hence, many people from Sambalpur and Kalahandi and other parts of Odisha came to Bhopal. Today, we are in thousands,"" said Sanjeeb Nanda.The community also brought with it the rich traditions of their state and integrated them seamlessly with the local culture.

It can be garnished by turmeric, mustard seeds and panch phutana.Former director of medico-legal institute Dr DK Satpathy's interview.I came here as a medical student in 1968Education was always good in Odisha, but job opportunities were not enough. BHEL was a major attraction for many Odias.As a member of the non-Hindi speaking community, I was felicitated by the then chief minister Arjun Singh in 1985 for my contribution to the Hindi-speaking state.Yes. I know someone who makes really good kheer, chhenapod and laddu. Now, he is in Bhilai. I have asked him to shift to Bhopal and start a sweet-shop. Hopefully, he will start in another two years.During Nuakhai festival, we invite people from diverse communities. Kids also take part in our festival and contests.What about the Odia kids here?

These huts, without any flooring or walls and dry leaves for roof, stand on land provided by the government after years of struggle.""There are 90 of us who live here and 42 of them have received their voting cards. Our primary demand is better housing. During monsoon, water gushes down the hill and we have nowhere to go,"" says Gopal Pawar, pointing to the huts.The only solace they have for now is that they aren't faced with eviction threats. ""We don't have any favourites. No politician has visited us so far. Whoever promises to help in solving our problems will get our votes,"" says Pawar.The two temporary tanks, their only reservoir for drinking water, is at the foot of the slope and tribesmen fear confrontation with locals when they go down to collect water.The traditional occupation of Vanarmare , as their name suggests, involved killing monkeys and make a living selling their meat. The bow and arrow has been kept aside to comply with the forest and wildlife laws. Today, they work as daily wage labourers or some even have taken up fishing to make ends meet.For this small tribe that has its roots across the border in Maharashtra, there is no end to their woes. A few months ago, they were hounded by the locals and their houses were burnt down. The government has now deployed police for their protection.Food is scarce and the basic diet comprises boiled rice with some red chilli powder. The nearest medical aid is 20 kilometers away and there's no medical facility available. ""Till now, we haven't encountered any serious medical emergency,"" a tribe member says.Electricity, though erratic, is provided by solar cells, just enough to light a bulb and charge their mobile phones.But the Vanarmare haven't lost hope. They may not have a roof over their head or food to eat, but that has not stopped them from sending their children to school.

It has, by and large, succeeded in reaching out to the grassroot levels given the reduced area. This is evident from the response to Praja Vani (public grievances redressal) programme in the three districts. The four districts, including the residual Karimnagar, are competing with each other in campaigning for making their respective districts open defecation-free (ODF) by construction of individual sanitary latrines setting the deadline of January 26.In spite of inadequate staff and poor infrastructure, each district is progressing on various fronts. For instance, in Peddapalli district, Collector A.S. Alagu Varshini utilised the NREGS for removing bushes and silt from the SRSP canals to ensure that water reached the tail-end regions.She launched a campaign to check misuse of Rs. 1 a kg rice scheme by educating the beneficiaries to inform the revenue authorities if they do not want to consume the rice.Jagtial Collector A.

Immediately after coming to power, the Congress announced the price of rice at Rs. 1 per kilo for below poverty line (BPL) families.

Just about 30% of the students from standard VI to VIII (middle school) in the state can carry out division and not even 60% from standards III to V can subtract when given maths problems, the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) by non profit organisation Pratham released on Wednesday said.The ASER 2016 survey was conducted across Maharashtra in 33 rural districts, 973 villages and 19,430 households by 11 NGOs, 23 colleges and various universities in the state. As many as 26,393 school children participated in the survey . The report is an indicator of the poor impact the state government's flagship programmes like Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra have had on improving the quality of education.The survey put forth arithmetic questions related to recognition of randomly chosen numbers from 1 to 99, 2-digit numerical subtraction problems with borrowing and 3-digit by 1-digit numerical division problems.The reading test comprised a set of common, familiar two-letter words and one or or two matras in Marathi. The standard I text has simple six word sentences and the standard II texts have short 7-10 sentence stories with common words and a familiar context.A look at the trends over the years shows that reading levels in the primary section seem to have improved but have fallen in the upper primary classes.If 73.2% students from standard V could read standard II level text in 2010, about 62.2% could do so in 2016. On the other hand, if 91.7% students from standard VIII could read standard II level text in 2010, only 75.9% could do so in 2016.The percentage of children in standard III who can read standard II level text in government schools was higher (41.2) than private schools (38.8). But the arithmetic levels have dropped in both government and private schools over the years.While the director of primary education did not respond to calls made by this reporter, the findings are a worry for other educationists who said there was improvement in infrastructure, but not the quality of education.Former chairman of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Vasant Kalpande said, ""Many schools have got computers, good buildings and even ISO certification but the learning quality has not improved. There is chaos in policy decisions or schemes in the education sector with little guidance or direction. Educationists and teachers should be roped in to help the department. There is a push and pull from all directions resulting in zero effect as of now.""The state government has to pull up its socks if it wants to improve the quality of education which cannot be achieved by making schools digital in villages that have no connectivity or telling teachers to take selfies with students to improve attendance. Students must have dedicated and innovative teachers who are free from non-academic work like weighing rice for midday meals. Many teachers in government schools have found ways to overcome a resource crunch and ensured effective learning. They need encouragement. Most importantly, the teaching profession has to be accorded due status and respect to make it a good career option that will attract the best."

Some industrial and business houses, too, are sponsoring the food items for the past three days, say student activists.Usually, distribution used to be a major problem when thousands of people gather, but the protesters have been maintaining self-discipline which has made the job of distributing the food items and water sachets easy.While many volunteers order the breakfast, lunch etc in hotels, messes etc, some have made special arrangements for cooking the same in common place. The general public, and members of various welfare associations, traders bodies and trade unions who visit the venue to extend their support also bring biscuits, glucose etc. People residing in the nearby residential localities, too, cook food in their houses and supply it to the protesters. They have also been allowing the students to use facilities like bathrooms etc in their houses.The protesting students have set a worthy example by taking special initiative to remove the garbage from the venue and handover the same to the Corporation authorities. All the roads leading to the Collectorate look neat and tidy and garbage-free and full credit should be given to the students for the same, said A. Baskar Perumal, a social activist.Folk artistes and folk troupes have used the opportunity to create awareness among the youths on folk art forms. The artistes enthralled the youths by demonstrating silambattam, playing thaarai, duff etc. Street plays and skits underlining the importance of jallikattu and other traditional events are also staged at regular intervals.Credit should also be given to the police force for initiating effective steps for maintaining law and order under trying circumstances. When Sanjay Kumar visited the venue to hold discussion with the protesters on late Wednesday evening, water sachets were hurled towards him forcing him to leave in a huff.Some of the protesters even hurled water sachets etc on the running buses on Periyar bridge.

Instead, biryani, fried rice and momos rule the chart, with dal makhani and shawarma being the surprise entrants, according to a food order survey carried out across 800 restaurants in the city .""Unlike other metros, Kolkatans have diverse food preferences. They are open to experimenting with other cuisines. Only 8% of daily orders received on Swiggy are for Bengali food,"" said Swiggy vice-president (marketing) Srivats TS.RJ Mir, a self-confessed foodie, isn't surprised that Bengali dishes are not much in demand. ""We Bengalis are extremely finicky about our own cuisine. If it's `singi maachher jhol' or `sorshe ilish', it has to taste the way our mom or aunts cook. The belief is that the best Bengali food is cooked at home. So why order from restaurants? If one has to experiment, it is best to do with other cuisines,"" he reasoned.In desserts and snacks though, traditional sweets with an innovative twist are still the favourites. Baked rosogolla from Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick , dab sherbat from Paramount and fish kabiraji from Mitra Cafe are enjoyed not just by the locals, but even by visitors who want to savour Kolkata's best.The pan-India survey that analysed food delivery data collated from 12,000 restaurants has at least one or two local delicacies making it to the top-five food picks in other big cities. While Delhi loves to order butter bun, pav bhaji is Mumbai's favourite.Chennai orders idli, masala dosa is the favourite in Bengaluru and Hyderabad orders veg biryani the most. Only Bengalis savour international cuisines like Japanese, Lebanese, Mexican or exotic seafood. Pradip Rozario , who ushered in the concept of fusion with Italian and Mexican dishes in the 1990s, said Bengalis were by nature the biggest connoisseur of new delicacies. ""If they are fed up with egg or chicken roll, they will give shawarma a try,"" he added.According to Mir, Kolkata's cosmopolitan outlook is reflective in its taste buds. ""We tom-tom with our Bengali `kaalchaar' (culture) but welcome others with open arms. We love our maachher jhol-bhaat but we can never say no to momos and thukpas. If you go elsewhere, you won't find a single food joint that cooks Bengali food the way we love it. Yet in Kolkata, you will find scores of places serving authentic Chinese, Tibetan, Lebanese, Thai and Mughlai. From literature to international affairs, we have diverse preferences, so why not in cuisine?"" he countered."

58f519067be9e01a17c9295c,The summer fruit king,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/the-summer-fruit-king/articleshow/58087550.cms,2017-04-09,"Summer is the time for nature to put the brightly coloured kokum or bhirandam fruits on their trees, mainly in India's Western Ghats region. Seven species of this garcinia indica are endemic to the Ghats, growing its dense canopy of leaves and yielding fruit even with little or no care.It is no wonder, then, that Goans, as in the rest of the Konkan, learnt to harvest this fruit in the summer and devised ways to use it year round. Just like the mango panh or panak, the fresh bhirandam fruit is also used to make a refreshing summer drink.The fruits are washed and broken open to separate the seed and outer rind. Adding water little by little, the pulp is extracted from the seed and skin of the fruit. As bhirandam are known for their sourness, one requires at least half a kilo of jaggery for the extract of every 15 medium-sized fruits. Dilute the mixture of the pulp and jaggery to a thin, transparent consistency and add salt and pepper and cardomom powder to taste.The skin of the fruit left behind can then be dried in the summer sun to get the blackish solam, which are preserved and used as a souring agent in food , in place of tamarind, round the year. Usually, the rind of bhirandam are dried without extracting the pulp and if you have made your solam after taking the pulp from it, you will need to add more of them to achieve the sourness you desire.To store the kokam extract like a squash, much after the summer is gone, add minimal water when extracting the pulp and add jaggery and salt to it and bring the mixture to a boil. Cool and store in a bottle in the refrigerator. This squash can be preserved for up to six months, if done right.If you are not a fan of sweet drinks, just soak the dried sollam into some water and squeeze the sourness out of them. Add salt, finely chopped green chillies, asafoetida and coriander and dilute with water to make a drink of thin consistency. This footi kodi is usually had following a meal and is believed to help digestion. But one may also gulp it down as a drink with a ting of jaggery for taste.Kokum also gives us the famous Goan sol kodi, with coconut milk, had as an accompaniment to a rice meal.Solam are also locally used to rub on insect bites for relief from the sting.They are especially useful when cooking local forest produce like aalloo, surran and maadi, which are rubbed with the sollam so that they do not irritate the mouth on eating. The solam are rubbed on the hand while cutting these foods too, to safeguard the hands from the itching sensation.Sollam are a key ingredient in tisreo sukhem, the vegetarian gravy tondak where sollam add the flavour in the absense of onion in the masala and in the mixed vegetable Goan khatkhatem. It goes with any fish curry too.If you have a kokum tree in your reach, the tender, reddish leaves of the tree are also edible and carry the same sourness as the fruit. Eating these leaves with salt is just a fun, childish thing to do, if you find yourself in the Western Ghats, near a kokum tree in the summer."

The party's electoral ally in the Hills, Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, is on a politically sticky wicket. Pushed to the wall by an aggressive Trinamool Congress, which is keen to reap the dividends of crafting out a separate Hill district  Kalimpong  GJM faces a tough test to retain its Hill stronghold.According to sources, GJM is all too likely to rake up its time-tested Gorkhaland card. But it wants BJP to echo the issue in Parliament to assuage its voters back home in Darjeeling and the foothills.The more cornered GJM is, sources said, the more shrill its Gorkhaland pitch is going to be.For the state BJP, however, it has become a tightrope walk. As a national party, it cannot be seen as rooting for separatist voices. Moreover, the Centre is a key stakeholder in the tripartite Gorkhaland Territorial Agreement.Ahead of the 2016 assembly polls, the Centre had authorized the Tea Board to take over management control of seven gardens of the G P Goenka-headed Duncan Industries in north Bengal by invoking a rarely used section of the Tea Act of 1953. The Centre, thus, attempted to send a message that it had acted while the state dithered.A year on, this has led to nothing. Embroiled in a protracted legal battle, the Mamata Banerjee government has made it all too apparent by providing Rs 2-per-kilogram rice and mobile health units to these ailing tea gardens and its 17,000 employees. The state BJP feels this is now turning into a liability ahead of the civic polls.Dissidence in ranks is also hurting the party. A party leader recently graduated from critical social media posts against Ghosh to openly airing his grouse in the media. A senior party MP still chooses to work at cross-purposes with the party's stated line on the child trafficking issue."

Yet, most argue over this usually pocket-friendly cuisine because of the use of flavour enhancers, which aren't good for health. Addressing this concerning in the legislative assembly, Bengaluru Health Minister Ramesh Kumar recently was quoted as saying, ""Successive governments have failed in controlling the rampant use of flavour enhancers such as Mono-Sodium Glutamate (MSG) in the preparation of Chinese dishes such as Gobi Manchurian and Fried Rice. It is taking a toll on the people's health, we are thinking of prohibiting the usage of flavour enhancers in food.""He further added, ""I have directed my department officials to submit a report on the usage of MSG and other flavour enhancers. Following the report, we will decide on the next course of action.""It was in the late 90s that Gobi Manchurian, Veg Noodles and Veg Fried Rice moved from the Chinese restaurant kitchens to fast food restaurants and street stalls. Priced around `15 a plate, these became a hit for outings for students and even families when they were too lazy to cook. Food and beverage consultant Aslam Gafoor says, ""Street food is intrinsic to any city's foodscape. They not only cater to low price eating for fun but are also means to daily sustenance for many. The now popular Indo-Chinese cuisine made its foray in Bengaluru because people were fascinated to have something 'foreign' when they went out. It became easily accessible and also grew popular as it was affordable. But, to add a certain amount of X factor to their food, they used flavour enhancers like MSG. Of course, these made people flaunt it more, despite people talking against it and highlighting the health issues. Most of the Oriental restaurants have found replacements that are not as harmful. These smaller vendors also need to be made aware about the same to ensure everything is back to how it is meant to be. It is hard to keep street food out of bigger metropolitan cities like Bengaluru."""

Corn was poised to end the week with slight gain on strong U.S. exports while wheat faced a second week of losses amid plentiful supplies although rising demand kept a floor under the market. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active soybean contract lost 3.6 percent in its biggest two-week fall since early February. Corn is up half a percent this week, recovering from a 4.3 percent decline last week, and wheat is down 1 percent after dropping almost three percent last week. ""Brazilian crop is so big that it is hard for soybeans to rally,"" said Kaname Gokon at brokerage Okato Shoji in Tokyo. ""There is going to be pressure on prices as Chinese buyers shift to South American markets and the demand for U.S. products weakens."" Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said U.S. soybean supplies will be bigger than expected at the end of the marketing year as a record harvest in Brazil will flood the global market. Argentine corn and soybeans should benefit this season from high yields brought by good weather, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Thursday, adding that it may increase its harvest estimate above the current 54.8 million tonnes. Corn was benefiting from strong demand for U.S. shipments. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported weekly export sales of old-crop U.S. corn at 1.255 million tonnes, above a range of trade expectations and the most in seven weeks. The wheat market is under pressure but strong demand is expected to underpin values. Egypt has been buying wheat on global markets at a breakneck clip in recent months in what grain traders say is an effort to keep up with its cash-strapped population's growing reliance on subsidised bread. The acute political sensitivity of the availability and price of the staple leaves the government with little choice but to ensure supplies, despite an economic crisis caused by six years of drift since an uprising ended Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule. The USDA said private exporters sold 120,000 tonnes of U.S. hard red winter wheat to Algeria for 2016/17 delivery.

The distress of farmers is real and deserves attention. But appeasing farmers may not solve the several fundamental problems that ail the state's agriculture  problems which require major structural reforms and not just band-aid solutions.While the shortage of water owing to a lack of large perennial rivers is a major problem in the state, another deficiency is the fragmentation of land holdings. The average area of landholding in TN is around two acres, which in turn is insufficient for profit-oriented agriculture. Farmers abandon such lands, leaving them fallow or sell them at distress prices.Villages today suffer from unremunerative agriculture also due to the shortage of young male labour. Mathew Morell, director general of International Rice Research Institute, Manila recently said agriculture in India was mostly manned by people aged above 50. Most of them are not literate in remunerative farming practices.TN's agricultural growth rate has declined considerably since the green revolution (mid 1960s). The average annual rate of growth of foodgrain in TN has been just 1.67% compared to 11.13% of Punjab and the all India average of 4.4%.Benefits like waiver of farm loans, reduction in crop loan interest, increase in food, power subsidies and subsidy on agri-machinery dished out by state governments have also not helped in improving the situation. In 2006-2007, the state announced the waiver of cooperative bank farm loans to the tune of `6866 crore. When the cooperative banks levied 7% interest on farm loans in 2007-2008, the state government over a span of four years helped reduce the interest rate from 5% to 0% on prompt repayments. Market support price was also progressively increased for sugarcane through state advised prices. Despite the measure, TN slipped as a large producer of sugarcane in recent years. The sugar production of the state which was 25L tonnes five years ago dropped to 11L tonnes this year.The state has also been extending support for crop insurance and subsidies on agri machineries and drip irrigation. Yet, farming continues to be in distress and the contribution of agriculture has been steadily declining, and at present accounts for 8% of the state's GDP (against 14% for the nation).There is thus the need for a major reform in the agriculture sector. Chief among these is to agglomerate small land holdings without alienating ownership and violating land ceiling laws. This will allow farmers to use technology and farm mechanization for better productivity. States like Punjab and Rajasthan have already implemented this.Organisations like the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) offer a wide range of information and support services that help in mapping land for soil conditions and water. TN universities and colleges with the help of such organisations can train undergraduates to interpret such data for farmers.Horticulture can also be taken up as a remunerative form of agriculture. There are progressive banana farmers like A K Karuppaiah of Farm Fresh, who have reaped the benefits of research findings on tissue culture. In less than five years they have revolutionised production of banana in the state, making TN the number one producer of banana.With land prices in the state so high, TN cannot survive by producing low yield/low priced crops on traditional practices. The alternative lies in attempting quantum jumps in yields with high quality seeds and effective linkages to the market.The state should make a paradigm shift from the existing practices and move away from water intensive crops like sugarcane and rice to floriculture, horticulture and oil seed production.(The writer is the editor of Industrial Economist)"

Yet farmers thanked the nature and sun god.The cheer was missing and the celebration looked a mere ritual, said an advocate. In many villages, people could not afford to give a white-wash to their houses. People used to decorate the village but the pomp was missing this year, S. Murugesan, a farmer from Thiruvadanai, said. Not all could afford to buy new clothes, he said."

The distress of farmers is real and deserves attention. But appeasing farmers may not solve the several fundamental problems that ail the state's agriculture  problems which require major structural reforms and not just band-aid solutions.While the shortage of water owing to a lack of large perennial rivers is a major problem in the state, another deficiency is the fragmentation of land holdings. The average area of landholding in TN is around two acres, which in turn is insufficient for profit-oriented agriculture. Farmers abandon such lands, leaving them fallow or sell them at distress prices.Villages today suffer from unremunerative agriculture also due to the shortage of young male labour. Mathew Morell, director general of International Rice Research Institute, Manila recently said agriculture in India was mostly manned by people aged above 50. Most of them are not literate in remunerative farming practices.TN's agricultural growth rate has declined considerably since the green revolution (mid 1960s). The average annual rate of growth of foodgrain in TN has been just 1.67% compared to 11.13% of Punjab and the all India average of 4.4%.Benefits like waiver of farm loans, reduction in crop loan interest, increase in food, power subsidies and subsidy on agri-machinery dished out by state governments have also not helped in improving the situation. In 2006-2007, the state announced the waiver of cooperative bank farm loans to the tune of `6866 crore. When the cooperative banks levied 7% interest on farm loans in 2007-2008, the state government over a span of four years helped reduce the interest rate from 5% to 0% on prompt repayments. Market support price was also progressively increased for sugarcane through state advised prices. Despite the measure, TN slipped as a large producer of sugarcane in recent years. The sugar production of the state which was 25L tonnes five years ago dropped to 11L tonnes this year.The state has also been extending support for crop insurance and subsidies on agri machineries and drip irrigation. Yet, farming continues to be in distress and the contribution of agriculture has been steadily declining, and at present accounts for 8% of the state's GDP (against 14% for the nation).There is thus the need for a major reform in the agriculture sector. Chief among these is to agglomerate small land holdings without alienating ownership and violating land ceiling laws. This will allow farmers to use technology and farm mechanization for better productivity. States like Punjab and Rajasthan have already implemented this.Organisations like the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) offer a wide range of information and support services that help in mapping land for soil conditions and water. TN universities and colleges with the help of such organisations can train undergraduates to interpret such data for farmers.Horticulture can also be taken up as a remunerative form of agriculture. There are progressive banana farmers like A K Karuppaiah of Farm Fresh, who have reaped the benefits of research findings on tissue culture. In less than five years they have revolutionised production of banana in the state, making TN the number one producer of banana.With land prices in the state so high, TN cannot survive by producing low yield/low priced crops on traditional practices. The alternative lies in attempting quantum jumps in yields with high quality seeds and effective linkages to the market.The state should make a paradigm shift from the existing practices and move away from water intensive crops like sugarcane and rice to floriculture, horticulture and oil seed production.(The writer is the editor of Industrial Economist)"

Each team of the enforcement wing would consist of four retired officials drawn from the police, Commercial Taxes and Revenue Departments and the Food Corporation of India, since there was shortage of manpower within the department.The enforcement wing was established to improve the prestige of the Civil Supplies Department in the eyes of the people. The main activities of the Civil Supplies Corporation were procurement of paddy under minimum support price (MSP) operations, milling of paddy under custom milling of rice, procurement of superfine variety rice from millers for supply to government hostels and schools under the mid-day meal scheme, and rice for public distribution system, he said.Although the annual turnover of the corporation was about Rs. 10,000 crore, shortage of staff has been a major hindrance in its efficient functioning. The enforcement wing would book cases under the Essential Commodities Act on diversion of PDS commodities.In spite of measures being taken to control diversion of commodities, such irregularities were still taking place, though there was some improvement during the last two months.Officials for the enforcement teams were taken on contract basis for a period of one year. Each team would be headed by a retired Superintendent of Police with one retired tahsildar, one retired DCTO/ACTO, and one Inspector/Sub-Inspector.The team members were also being provided with a hired vehicle each, and they would be supervised by retired SP K.

""It is a time of nostalgia and since I am interested in organic farming I have been volunteering on farms. This time I went to a site near Avadi to try my hand at harvesting with a sickle,"" says Deepa, who often gets her 10-year-old son to accompany her on her farmers' day out. The weekend she says is a time for celebration at another friend's farm.theThough Pongal marks the end of harvest season, members of Valam Community Farm , which was formed a few weeks ago, will mark this weekend as the beginning of their farming initiative.""We are a group of 25, mostly IT professionals, with an interest in farming. We have leased a 5.2-acre farm near Chengalpet and plan to organically grow a traditional variety of paddy,"" says Gopinath Jayaraja, one of the founding members of the group. This Sunday, the group will be crushing eggshells, mixing them with dry fish scales and fruit peels to make an organic nutrient for the soil to prepare the soil for the coming season.""This initiative is not to earn money but for people to learn farming,"" says Jayaraj.While it will take a while for Jayaraj and his team to reap the fruits of their labour, Pongal came early for Jaya Hepzibah , who cultivated her first crop in December from her 2-acre farm near Ranipet, 100km from the city. ""I have always wanted to try organic farming. Last July, I managed to convince my husband to buy a plot of land where I could grow paddy,"" says the 43-year-old homemaker, who then contacted Chennai Green Commune. With a little help from the organic farming group, Hepzibah set out to turn her land into a patch of organic green among farms that practised chemical farming.""I was told by farmers to go back and not try to bring ideas to the village that are unprofitable,"" she says. ""But I was persistent and at the end of 120 days I had 1,400kg of native samba variety rice. A sweet pongal for me I would say, as some dealers also offered to buy my crop,"" says Hepzibah, who cannot wait to start working for the next season and plans to convert another 2-acre land into a poultry farm with a vegetable patch."

Enterprising produce suppliers across the country are filling up our larders with locally grown exotica. The latest addition, little jars of organic capers in brine and sea salt, is already inspiring menus at restaurants in Mumbai and Kochi.At The Bombay Canteen, executive chef Thomas Zacharias serves his gremolata with a caper chutney drizzle, or tops his haleem with the caper salt from Ishka Farms. You would never tell the caper is from India, says Zacharias who, together with culinary director Floyd Cardoz, has been showcasing locally sourced, seasonal produce at the celebrated Mumbai restaurant.Clearly, the capers producers are on the right track, for Fiona Arakal of Ishka Farms hopes to convert people already acquainted with imported capers before moving on to the first-timers. I have made a wish list of restaurants in the country, and many are already taking well to our organic, home-grown variety, says the former HR professional.Kochi resident Arakal and her husband Srikant Suryanarayans three-year journey to get the capers from farm to jar hasnt been easy. When Srikant purchased 365 acres of arid land in Ettayapuram, Tuticorin, there was not a tree in sight, forget birds or bees. Youd expect the normal reaction to a mid-life crisis to be to go out and get a Ferrari or a girlfriend! says Arakal. Their family business of photography supplies was managed by an efficient team, giving them the freedom to rejig (their) lives and focus on value addition not box selling.Capers, an odd choice in a region that is known to harvest sunflower, black gram and chillies, was courtesy a chance meeting between Suryanarayan and an Argentine farmer in St. Petersburg. Suryanarayan then travelled to large caper farms in Argentina and Mexico, before deciding on his plan of action. We wanted a crop that would produce right through the year, would require less water and that was different from what everyone was growing in India, says Arakal. The challenges were many, from amending the caper plant import rule to finding a place for said plants to be quarantined.Then came the lessons in agriculture, finding farm hands, customising drip irrigation and a water management system for the capers, and driving 45 minutes from the farm just to get a cell phone signal. Their decision to cultivate moringa in the interim had great results. Srikant is the ideas man, I am the realist, says Arakal, who has been marketing moringa powder over the last year, together with recipes for moringa in bread or in mango curry.At the farm, the capers (capparis spinosa) cover 100 acres, each plant resembling a bridal bouquet. The tiny flower buds are harvested by hand at the crack of dawn. They are intense and peppery on the tongue, and Arakal attributes this to the black cotton soil, the water from the farm, and the local sea salt used to preserve them. If left alone, the buds bloom into delicate white-and-purple flowers, and this, together with the moringa trees, attracts a fair share of parrots and peacocks.We are also working on tissue culture, as mortality is high with the imported plants, says Arakal. She has a team of 21 daily wage earners. We are doing our bit towards women empowerment, and have got them bank accounts. A lot of our women are the highest earners in the family and we are considering a cooperative farming model in the near future.These women are yet to take the caper to their kitchen, she admits. Till they can eat it with rice and pappadam, they will not get it. And that is why we are hoping to work with pickle outfits soon.For more on how to order capers and moringa, visit ishkafarms.comWe wanted a crop that would produce right through the year, would require less water and that was different from what everyone was growing in IndiaFiona ArakalCapers are intense and peppery on the tongue, and Fiona Arakal attributes this to the black cotton soil, erve them"

It was a turning point in the history of paddy cultivation when he started distributing the seeds to farmers through a seed festival For R Jayaraman, it was a journey in search of traditional paddy seeds, earning him the name `Nel' (paddy) Jayaraman. A great challenge indeed, and he was not tired. But today , this 52-year-old is having a tough time.Jayaraman was diagnosed with `malignant melanoma' (skin cancer) in January .Though many activist groups posted messages on social networking sites seeking funds from public for his treatment, some withdrew the posts due to objection raised by Jayaraman himself.His nephew told TOI that Jayaraman underwent an immunotherapy session on Tuesday at a private hospital in Chennai. ""The treatment has started and the first session got over today . The bill was Rs 3 lakh. We don't know what to do, we are struck,"" said S Rajiv.A school dropout-turned farmer, Jayaraman revived more than 150 traditional paddy varieties as part of the Save our Rice (SoR) Campaign, a national movement aimed at conserving traditional varieties of paddy a decade ago. A staunch follower of organic farming guru Nammalvar , Jayaraman, a native of Adirangam village in Tiruvarur district, realised through various experiments that native paddy seeds were best suited for coastal districts prone to climatic variations.Jayaraman won the Best Organic Farmer Award in 2012 and 2013 from the Agri culture department of the state government.""The Immunotherapy treatment recommended for his condition would provide him the best chance of survival. This is an expensive protocol and is expected to cost at least `10 lakh. We, his friends and associates, are seeking help for this indefatigable activist. We hope to bring him back to health,"" said a post that appeared on a social networking site. The post even had an account number to which the contributions can be sent.When contacted, the person who posted it said, ""We are sorry. He (Jayaraman) is not happy with our request.He doesn't want to disturb the public.""Others said Jayaraman was right and no one could question his dignity. ""Why can't the government take over his expenses. He is the one who revived paddy cultivation in the state. The government has a great responsibility. I hope the new CM will do something immediately,"" said K Subramanian, a Chennai-based farmer."

Thomas Isaacs budget speech was a literary thread. Weaving the speech around the works of one of Malayalams most loved writers M.T. Vasudevan Nair, Dr. Isaac paid a literary tribute as well as made a political statement, as the writer was recently the target of the Sangh Parivars anger, following his comments on demonetisation.So, Dr. Isaac began his speech from those very comments in which MT compared demonetisation with the reforms of Mohammed Bin Tuglak. From then on, he made a virtual tour through the writers oeuvre, drawing on his characters to make his point. Recalling the proclamation of Appunni against feudal hierarchy from the novel Nalukettu , will growwill mature and live without fearing anyone, he said the expectations of the educated new generation far exceeded those of Appunni.In announcing the allocations for the Aardram project for quality care in hospitals, he referred to MTs short story Bheeru , in which a character talks about his wifes hatred for hospitals due to the pathetic conditions there. On the need to protect public education, Dr. Isaac referred to the writers recollections of his school days in the short story Thettum Thiruthum .The section on womens welfare begins with Gandharis classic line from Randamoozham, All men in the clan of Kuru (Kuruvamsa) used to find joy at seeing the tears of women. Dr. Isaac said the budget gave emphasis to preventing atrocities against women.Dig at CentreDr. Isaac compared the Central governments stance on providing the States share of rice to that of the character Valiyamma in MTs Naalukettu , recalling the line Not even a single grain of rice will be given Let me see will you learn a lesson or not. On the drought situation, he draws on the vivid descriptions of the drought in Vaishali , in which the sandy wind shakes bare trees under the blistering sky.The character Muthachi from the novel Nalukettu , a destitute who was helped with rice, money and shelter by others, is used to talk about the informal system of social security in the State. The budget announced social security pension for all above 60, except those who receive service pensions, persons with more than 2 acres of land and income tax payers.Aminumma, another character from Nalukettu , was remembered for her kuri, when the Minister talked about chit funds for NRIs.On the issues faced by the differently abled and the need for special focus on these, Dr. Isaac referred to the tragedies of Velayudhan in Iruttinte Athmavu and Kuttiyettathi . Announcing a social security fund for destitute circus artistes, he talked about the circus-themed story Valarthumrugangal .Dr. Isaac chose to end his speech with another political statement, extensively quoting MTs reflections on the spreading of segregation all over the country, even in his own village of friendship."

A name that you will likely find on the ingredient list of an essential oil, a perfume, or a body moisturiser. But, did you know that you could also find it in your backyard?Standing at a modest 10-12 metres, the plain-looking Moringa oleifera, popularly known as the mushing or the drumstick tree, is renowned the world over as the miracle tree. And rightly so. Every inch of the moringa  from its leaves, flowers and fruits (drumsticks) to its bark, roots and seeds  abounds with medicinal properties. For one, it contains 18 of the 20 amino acids  the building blocks of proteins  including the nine essential ones that the human body can't produce. It is also packed with Vitamin C , protein, calcium, potassium, and iron, making it an effective solution for malnutrition, particularly among infants and nursing mothers.Researchers say few other floral varieties can come close.While the leaves and drumsticks are commonly used in a variety of dishes, it is the flower that makes a rare appearance in Goan cuisine. Creamy white with bright, yellow stamens, they are widely consumed in Bangladesh for instance, and star in its local dish, sojne phul torkari (Moringa blossoms curry).In Goa, one of the few preparations the small yet nutrient-rich flowers are used in is polle (rice pancakes).The process is uncomplicated. Soak rice in water overnight and grind to a fine paste the next morning. Add a fistful of washed moringa flowers to the batter, along with salt and some finely chopped onions and chillies. Using a ladle, pour some batter onto a pre-heated, greased skillet in a circular motion and fry for a few minutes before flipping the pancake over for uniform cooking. And voila! You have a simple yet power-packed breakfast food ready just like that. Meera Salgaonkar , an Aldona-based homemaker who often prepares these polle for her family, swears by the goodness of the moringa tree - leaves, blossoms and all. Its drumsticks, flowers and leaves are a great alternative for vegetarians because of their high protein and calcium content. They are particularly beneficial for lactating women, she says.Incidentally, Goas warm temperatures and soil cover are conducive to the proliferation of the moringa. So, it might be a good idea to ditch those packaged health shakes and supplements and invest in a moringa sapling instead. In a few years from now, you'll have a treasure trove of nutrients and medicinal remedies right in your garden itself."

Shivarudraswamy told The Hindu that a DNA test, which proved the paternity of two of the accused, had played a key role in building evidence.The blood samples of the victims and the accused, besides the bones of the deceased babies, were collected and sent to Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL), Bengaluru.The bodies of the babies had been buried, but permission was taken to exhume the bodies and collect their bone samples.In both the cases, the paternity of the accused was confirmed through DNA tests, he added.POCSO Special Judge V.M. Pawale, earlier this week, sentenced 60-year-old Mahboob Pasha of Ghousia Nagar in Mysuru to undergo 12 years rigorous imprisonment and pay a fine of Rs. 50,000 for raping a 14-year-old girl when she came to his provision store to purchase rice in February 2013.Mr. Shivarudraswamy said the victim delivered a female baby in December 2013, but the baby subsequently died in October 2014.In the second case, the judge sentenced 65-year-old Mani from Hunsur town to undergo 12 years rigorous imprisonment and pay a fine of Rs. 10,000 for raping a 17-year-old, who was under his foster care.His wife Sarojamma was also convicted and sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 for destroying evidence and another six months for not reporting the matter to the police.The victim delivered a baby girl in September 2013 in the house of the accused, but the accused shifted the newborn to a different village near Kushalnagar.However, the baby died in October 2013.

Boron may become the nanomaterial of the century as scientists have found that two-atom-wide ribbons and single-atom chains of the element possess unique properties.For example, if metallic ribbons of boron are stretched, they morph into antiferromagnetic semiconducting chains, and when released they fold back into ribbons.Experimental labs are making progress in synthesising atom-thin and fullerene-type boron, which led Boris Yakobson, researcher at Rice University in the U.S. to think 1-D boron may eventually become real as well.Mr. Yakobsons lab creates atom-level computer simulations of materials that do not necessarily exist yet. Simulating and testing their energetic properties helps guide experimentalists working to create real-world materials.Carbon-atom chains known as carbyne, boron fullerenes and two-dimensional films called borophene, all predicted by the Rice group, have since been created by labs.Changing formsOur work on carbyne and with planar boron got us thinking that a one-dimensional chain of boron atoms is also a possible and intriguing structure, said Mr. Yakobson. One-dimensional boron forms two well-defined phases  chains and ribbons  which are linked by a reversible phase transition, meaning they can turn from one form to the other and back.To demonstrate these interesting chemomechanics, the researchers used a computer to pull the ends of a simulated boron ribbon with 64 atoms.This forced the atoms to rearrange into a single carbyne-like chain. In the simulation, researchers left a fragment of the ribbon to serve as a seed, and when the tension was released, the atoms neatly returned to ribbon form.  PTI"

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. This chicken tinga taco's filling has shredded chicken, slow roasted tomato salsa and chipotle chillies. These blazing hot chillies turn the predictable tacos into loaded, sizzling time bombs.

This starter is a Vietnamese speciality of potatoes tossed with herbs and hot Sriracha chilli sauce. Sriracha chillies come from the coastal city of Si Racha, in Chonburi Province of eastern Thailand . The beauty of this dish is that the hotness of the chilliesexplode in your mouth before dissolving in a haze of piquancy.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted withsaffron to balance the hotness of the prawns.This oh-so-hot starter is prepared with lantern chillies, ginger and green onion. These chillies come from China and are used for not just its flavour but also for the special heat they add to the dish. The chillies are revered for their intense pungency and take the typical chilli chicken to a zone of untasted white-hot flavours.One of the staple dishes of Kerala, mutton pepper dry has boti pieces of mutton roasted with crushed Malabar pepper and Kerala spices. The tadka also consists of dhani chilli powder, which adds to the spicy taste of the dish. The dhani or bird's eye chilli is tiny but packs a punch in terms of spiciness. It is used not only for cooking but also in chutneys and pickles.It will set fire to your taste buds, but is worth a try. Tenderloin cooked in roasted, blended spices with Andhra chillies, which adds that extra spicy kick to this bestseller at Bodega. It is served with soft ladi pav.It embodies the simplicity and beauty of the people it represents. Not for nothing is ema datshi known as the national dish of Bhutan. Ema is chilli and datshi means cheese. It is made from different types of hot chillies (green, red or white) and cheese (datshi, the local Bhutanese cheese). This hot stew of chillies and cheese is unique and can be had as a soup or a dip. The melted cheese and the punch of chillies leave a beautifulaftertaste. It is a big hit with youngsters and vegetarians who throng this restaurant. A word of caution: if you are not used to hot spices, you might want to have a fire extinguisher handy, or some other form of quick relief, when you try this out. Also, The Blue Poppy's momos are as famous as its momo sauce. The extremely spicy momo sauce has a pinch of dalle chilli (from Sikkim) paste  one of the hottest chillies of the northeast known for its sting and flavour.Laal maas, which literally means red meat, is a traditional Rajasthani dish that combines royalty with hotness. Succulent pieces of lamb are cooked only with roasted dry red chillies (locally called tikha laal), pounded in desi ghee and fragrant whole spice mixture or khada masala. It isprepared in a huge handi by simmering for hours together, letting the spices penetrate the chunks of meat and allowing them to be perfectly cooked. It is indeed not for the faint-gutted! The Rajputs used to have this with makkai ki roti, but you could even try it with roomali rotis or jeera rice.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted with saffron to balance the hotness of the prawns."

FUNDAMENTALS * Chicago Board of Trade soybeans have given up 2.8 percent this week, falling for five out seven weeks. * Wheat is down almost 2 percent this week after climbing for the last two weeks. * Corn is down 3.6 percent, set for its biggest decline since the week ending Aug. 26. * The soybean market is facing headwinds as the U.S. Department of Agriculture in a monthly supply/demand report increased its forecast of Brazil's 2016/17 soybean harvest to an all-time high 108 million tonnes, from 104 million in February. * The agency also cut its estimate of U.S. 2016/17 soybean exports, citing competition from the big Brazilian crop, and consequently raised its forecast of U.S. soy ending stocks to 435 million bushels, above an average of analyst estimates. * Earlier on Thursday, Brazil's agricultural statistics agency Conab raised its estimate for the country's 2016/17 soybean crop to 107.6 million tonnes on Thursday, more than 2 million tonnes above its previous forecast. * Recent rains in Argentina's main soy-growing regions have helped maximize yields in higher-altitude areas not affected by floods that have soaked lower-lying fields, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said in its weekly crop report on Thursday. * The corn market is facing pressure as the USDA upped its estimates of corn output in Brazil as well as Argentina. The USDA raised its forecast of global 2016/17 corn ending stocks to 220.68 million tonnes, above an average of trade expectations and up from 217.56 million last month. * Wheat is down for the week, but the market on Friday found underlying support after the USDA trimmed its forecast of U.S. 2016/17 wheat ending stocks to 1.129 billion bushels, down 10 million from last month. But forecasts calling for much-needed moisture in the Plains kept a lid on gains. * Commodity funds were net sellers of Chicago Board of Trade corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts on Thursday. Trader estimates of net fund selling in corn ranged from 10,000 to 20,000 contracts and in soybeans from 8,000 to 11,000 contracts.

What has helped the model succeed is its simple menu  an idli for Re 1, a plate of curd rice for Rs 3 and a full meal of sambhar rice for Rs 5. Inspired by these canteens in Tamil Nadu, which were named after Amma, the nickname of late chief minister J Jayalalithaa, officials in Haryana are planning to come up 'Kaka canteens'  Khattar is often referred to as 'Kaka' in the state's corridors of power.Though the project is still in a nascent stage, the state labour department wants to set up such canteens in Gurgaon as pilot.

We're hoping for an early launch,"" said a senior official at the labour department. The proposed eateries will have a unified IT backbone, which will give migrant workers access to subsidised food across Haryana.""Beneficiaries will have to register themselves using their Aadhaar cards. Their labour card data can also be linked to it, which, along with UID numbers, will be saved in the permanent records. Once registered, workers can visit any of these canteens anywhere in the state and have food. This is to help unorganised sector workers who are often forced to migrate from one place to another in search of employment,"" the official added.The data thus generated will also help the government assess various aspects like workers' migration patterns and volume of economic activities in a particular part of the state."

More importantly the heavy dependence on just one type of grain has made our diet quite unwholesome,"" she said.Agriculturalist Emani Raman said, ""Most of these plant species can be grown in mixed plantations and orchards. Some of those with exceptional health benefits can also be marketed in urban areas and this can generate a lot of revenue for farmers."" Raman said there were a few agriculture experts who have taken up re-planting of certain species in the plains.""This trend has just caught up in the divisions south of Anakapalli and a number of NGOs are involved in promoting these varieties with the help of central and state government agencies,"" Raman said.An NGO LAYA, which had done extensive research in native species especially in the East Godavari agency area, has come up with a herbal plantation-cum-nursery to promote naturopathy. They even run a naturopathy clinic in Addataeegala."

But supplies are falling even from this centuries-old Arabian sea route that is one of the last lifelines to a country on the brink of famine.A two-year-old civil war has severely restricted the flow of food into the main Yemeni cargo ports of Hodeidah and Salif on the Red Sea, where all the large grain silos are located.The small wooden boats sailing from souks in the UAE are moving small but vital supplies by making for the smaller ports to the south coast that are of little use to larger vessels - and often sidestepping military inspections that choke traffic by dropping anchor at secluded coves nearby.The deals originate in the sprawling Al Ras Market, a collection of dusty alleyways near the Dubai Creek where an array of food and spices are on display including colourful sacks of Pakistani and Indian rice.The dhows - plying the ancient trade route that once carried the likes of pearls, frankincense and myrrh - supply 14,000 to 18,000 tonnes of foodstuffs a month to Yemen, according to traders. That represents a drop of about 30-40 percent over the past year because of problems with payment, as well as adverse sailing conditions.""The Yemeni currency is destroyed, sometimes we can't get paid enough. We can only go once a month because the seas are too rough,"" said trader Mohammed Hassan, at a docking station at nearby Port Khaled in Sharjah""Sometimes we have to wait 40 days.""The volumes of food carried on this route represent a small fraction of the supply to Yemen, which relies on imports for 90 percent of its food. But it has become increasingly important as fighting has raged, the economy has collapsed and Yemen has needed all the help it can get.PORT DAMAGEThousands of people have been killed in the civil war pits the Iran-allied Houthi group against a Saudi-backed coalition - which includes the UAE - fighting to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.The conflict has choked imports. Sixty percent of Yemenis, or 17 million people, are in ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" food situations, according to the United Nations.While vessels seeking access to Houthi-held areas must face inspections for smuggled weapons, the government-controlled south has less restrictions.Food imports into Hodeidah have fallen relentlessly, with only a few ships arriving each week - compared with dozens before the war - and more shipping lines pulling out due to the growing risks, according to aid and shipping sources.In recent weeks damage to infrastructure in the neighbouring port of Salif has also cut food deliveries, aid officials said.""The country is living on its reserves,"" said Robert Mardini, International Committee of the Red Cross regional director for the Near and Middle East in Geneva this week.""There is a lack of liquidity, no payment of salaries, which means that the spending power has collapsed and that the price of food is soaring whenever it is available.""'PAY THUGS'UAE-based dhow captains avoid these snarl-ups by steering clear of the big Red Sea ports and instead ply their trade to the south, often docking at informal inlets.The average journey takes about five to eight days, with the boats capable of taking up to 2,000 tonnes of goods, still small fry compared with cargo ships that could provide more relief to one of the poorest and most unstable countries in the world.Trader Ali Mahdani ships his goods out of Dubai to the southern Yemeni ports of Aden, Mukalla or Mokha, goods worth 4-6 million UAE dirhams ($1.1-1.6 million) per month, around 2,000 tonnes of mostly rice, spices or cooking oil. To avoid payments in the battered Yemeni currency he gets paid in Saudi riyals.There are few issues upon arrival. That's a sharp contrast the scrutiny that any vessels hoping to access the north would be subjected to as the Saudi-led coalition search for weapons which may be headed into Houthi hands.""You may have to pay thugs every once in a while but otherwise it is all good to go,"" said Mahdani, dressed in a flowing white robe.Trader Amin Baghersh ships powered milk, tomato paste, sugar and rice from Al Ras to Yemen, selling about one million UAE dirhams worth per month.He and others rely on hawala, an informal trading system through exchange houses based on trust and personal ties.Most of his goods make their way to Mukalla and Aden and surrounding areas. But he, like others, has taken a heavy hit from the Yemeni currency crisis and payment problems caused by the war.An Iranian trader had similar complaints.""I used to transfer about 2,000 tonnes of food a month,"" said the trader, who declined to give his name. ""In the last three or four months people asked me for supplies but I am reluctant to deal with them.""($1 = 3.6724 UAE dirham)(Additional reporting by Jonathan Saul in London and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Editing by Pravin Char)"

Ongur river that swelled beyond its capacity in December 2015 had flooded their fields and covered them with layers of sand.While other areas of Kancheepuram district are struggling with water crisis, villages in Madurantakam taluk such as V.K. Agaram and Vilambattu have to deal with the problem of loads of sand left on their fields after the floods receded.Despite hauling away tonnes of sand with the support of National Agro Foundation (NAF), a non-governmental organisation, many villagers say the fields still have sand to be cleared.Residents recalled that the surplus water from Ongur river, which swelled during December 2015 floods, damaged the regulator of a water channel and inundated the fields of three villages. A portion of bund of the water channel, which carries surplus water of Ongur river to Sunambedu lake, was washed away and later constructed with the help of the NAF. The 42-km Ongur river, which originates as a surplus course of Saram tank in Tindivanam, carries water from Nedunkal Odai in Kancheepuram district and finally drains into the Bay of Bengal. It feeds a few water bodies en route.M. Babu, a resident of V.K. Agaram, located about 30 km away from Madurantakam, said most residents have not cultivated for over a year now as the Ongur river and water bodies are fast drying up.We are managing with rice provided at ration shops and meagre income from cattle, he said.The local people wanted the State government to provide a weir, which could act as a regulator or a check dam to manage water needs and prevent flooding.Boopalan said nearly 90 acres were affected during the floods and sand was noticed in March after flood waters receded.Only a few farmers recently cultivated water melons. Officials of the Water Resources Department said the stream did not have a regular flow and narrowed down near the tailend. While it was difficult to regulate the river flow, steps would be taken to repair the damaged regulator."

The woman complained to Khader that the shop run by Naguri Vyavasaya Sahakari Sangha did not issue rice to her under 'Anna Bhagya' for the month.The shop had allegedly denied rice for the month on March 23 despite a government order that makes it mandatory for shops to continue distribution of foodgrains till the end of the particular month. The person at the fair price shop reportedly asked the woman to visit the shop again in April citing no stock of rice.On reaching home, the woman called the minister and explained her grievance. The woman told the minister that the shopkeeper did not listen to her when she questioned about the violation of the government order that mandates continuous distribution of food grains all through the month. She also made mention about similar experiences she had in the past.Responding to the woman's complaint, Khader directed department deputy director A T Jayappa to conduct an inquiry.

Instructions are given to refer to anganwadi workers as anganwadi teachers.At the time when Telangana was formed, the salary of anganwadi teachers was `4,200 per month. The CM had enhanced the salary to `7,000 per month when he had a meeting with anganwadi teachers on February 28, 2015. Now, the salary has been hiked to `10,500 per month.

This strong statement has come from one of Punjab's respected economists R S Ghuman in his study titled 'Water Use Scenario in Punjab beyond the Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal'.The study was published in 'Economic & Political Weekly' journal in its January edition and some of its observations are crucial at a time when Punjab and Haryana are eyeball-to-eyeball over the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal.Ghuman, professor at CRRID, who was earlier heading the economics department of Punjabi University, has pointed out that there is need to address the problem of excessive irrigation for paddy, lesser rainfall and canal water coupled with growing number of tubewells and its result in depleting water table in the state.Ghuman told TOI, ""On the SYL canal, there is need for review of the water supplies of the Beas and Ravi calculated to be 17.17 million acre feet (MAF) as part of the agreement in 1981. The situation in Punjab has changed drastically since then.""""A serious review, taking into account the current availability of the quantity of water, is of utmost importance. The optimum use of water, especially for paddy irrigation, can save substantial amount of water, thus, reducing the intensity of conflicts over river water sharing. The two states need to give increased attention to sustainable use of water, along with asserting their claims over the river waters,"" said Ghuman, who is former vice-president of Indian Society of Labour Economics.""There is also an urgent need to have a strong policy intervention to reduce the area under paddy or find less water consuming varieties of paddy. Micro irrigation, direct sowing and sowing on raised beds need to be promoted in a big way. Rainwater harvesting, conservation of water and sustainably-informed use of water are necessary routes to save Punjab and Haryana from turning into a desert,"" added Ghuman.PADDY PROBLEMTraditionally, Punjab has never been a rice producing and consuming region. Paddy accounted for only 6% of the cropped area in 1960-61 which increased to 69% in 2012-13. The share of area under paddy in kharif cereals increased from 33% in 1961 to 96% in 2013.Paddy has been the main culprit for depleting water table as it needs 22-25 irrigations in a span of four months. The combined evapotranspiration in wheat and paddy is 1,030mm.The problem of groundwater scarcity started raising its head during the 1980s and was highlighted by the Johl Committee reports on crop diversification. However, the Punjab government responded for the first time in 2004 by constituting a state-level committee on ground- water resources estimation. The committee submitted its report in 2012 without any effective recommendations. The state's policy of giving free electricity to the farm sector (followed also by Haryana) further hinders crop diversification and results in unsustainable use of water.LESSER CANAL WATERAt the same time, availability of canal water to the state has been drying up. ""Out of the total irrigated area of 20.20 lakh hectares in 1960-61, 58% was under canal irrigation. It declined to 27% in 2014. The area under canal irrigation reached at its plateau (16.60 lakh hectares) in 1990-91, thereafter it started declining.""TUBEWELL TROUBLEThe result was, says Ghuman, that most of the farmers have already deepened their tubewells six to eight times during 1975-2005. ""The number of tubewells in Punjab increased from 1.92 lakh in 1970-71 to 13.85 lakh in 2013-14. The per hectare tubewell intensity, in terms of net sown area, increased from 0.047 in 1970-71 to 0.334 in 2013-14. In 2000-01, the share of tubewell irrigated area increased to 76% (30.74 lakh hectares) and thereafter, its share remained around 73%. Not only the area under irrigation - and that too under tubewell irrigation - increased but irrigation intensity also increased from 54% in 1960-61 to 99% in 2011."" The net deficit of groundwater for irrigation development in Punjab increased from 8.01 million hectare feet in 2004 to 12.02 million hectare feet in 2011.POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS""In view of the ensuing assembly elections in Punjab in February 2017, the political atmosphere is highly surcharged over the SYL canal issue. There has been a water war between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over Cauvery water. The SYL canal has similar seeds in its bed,"" adds the study."

Overlooked since the Green Revolution of the 1960s, these forgotten food grains are on the comeback trail precisely because they have proven to be drought-resistant.Tamil Nadu was reported to have produced over 29 lakh tonnes of millet last year (up from 9 lakh tonnes), a significant shift indeed away from polished rice. The food grain production went up from 110 lakh tonne to 128 lakh tonne last year.The low glycaemic index of millets (a measure of how fast our body converts food into sugar) compared to rice, is one of its many nutritional advantages. Many health experts think that switching over to millets will decrease the future risk of diabetes.The number of non-governmental organisations promoting organic farming and ethnic food grain cultivation has grown in Tamil Nadu, including its Tier II cities like Tiruchi. The recent three-day ethnic food festival organised by the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meals Programme and Integrated Child Development Services Scheme in Tiruchi, was proof of this revival. But more than just food, there is also a growing awareness about an alternative lifestyle that respects nature.Millets missionThe parent company of Mithraa Millets, Sri K.S. Lakshmi Agri Clinic and Agri Extension Centre, is better known for its innovative device, a helmet fitted with a rechargeable light that helps jasmine harvesters in Tiruchi district to go into the fields early in the morning or late at night, and stay safe from injury and snakebites.In fact, proprietor and agricultural entrepreneur K.Suresh Kumar is in Hyderabad to receive an award for the helmet (distributed to 360 farmers in Tiruchi district in collaboration with the National Horticultural Mission) when we call him.As a graduate in Agricultural Science, I wanted to do something useful for the farming community and also for our own food habits. Most agriculturists are not educated, and usually go for high yield crops that need chemical fertlizers and pesticides. We are trying to refocus their attention on traditional and eco-friendly methods of farming, says Mr.Suresh Kumar, whose venture is the first agri-clinic of its kind in Tamil Nadu.For the past two years, their food brand Mithraa Millets has been popularising alternatives to the rice-based dishes with its millet flour and plant-origin ready mixes. Among the products that the brand has developed are dosa/pancake, puttu (steamed flour) and other ready mixes from kambu (pearl millet), cornmeal and kezhvaragu (finger millet).Ragi and kambu should come back into our diets in a big way, says Mr.Suresh Kumar. The other millets were more commonly used as cattle fodder.The company operates two stalls at the Uzhavar Sandhai (Farmers Market) in Anna Nagar and K. K. Nagar. We are doing this so that the farmer can earn a reasonable amount as profit, and also make millet-based foods available to more people.The stall at Anna Nagar does brisk business in steamed ragi puttu from 7 am to 8am.We sell at least 10kg of ragi puttu on Sundays, because it is tasty and nutritious, says Mr.Suresh Kumar. In our soup mixes, the murungai (drumstick) leaf broth is an excellent tonic that can substitute green tea.Spending a week at a workshop on sustainable living conducted by organic farming pioneer G Nammalvar in 2013 convinced G. Sathyabhama to switch over to a more nature-aware lifestyle and set up a shop to sell organic food products.Formerly working in an ancillary unit for a heavy engineering firm, Ms.Sathyabhama found chemical-free food to be the perfect antidote for her chronic ulcer problem.Her Evergreen Organic Store in Srirangam sources groceries like unrefined sugar, cooking oil, wild rice and millets, besides beauty products from nearly 15 suppliers all over the state.She rues the absence of a pricing and quality control body that could standardise the organic food business in Tamil Nadu. Currently, all our organic produce is sent to metro cities like Chennai and Bangalore. The shortage causes a hike in prices locally.Among the heirloom grains in her store are kaattu arisi, a type of wild rice that is harvested from open grounds, and mapillai samba, which is said to increase the haemoglobin count in the blood and also fight cancer.Online and awayE.Gopalakrishnan, a veteran of agriculture-based business, has now shifted to the next level  his Millet.In brand products are sold exclusively on Amazon.com. I realised that setting up retail outlets was not suitable for my kind of stock, because I have to be personally involved in its production, so I decided to concentrate on what I could do best, he says.Going online has freed up time for him to supply bigger retailers of organic products, and also to come up with new ideas from the comfort of his home in Tiruchis Srinivasa Nagar (where he maintains a garden of medicinal plants).It is always healthier to opt for kanji (gruel made by boiling the millet) rather than kool (mushy porridge made by cooking millet flour), according to native medicine, says Mr.Gopalakrishnan. His ready-to-cook kanji mix is among the top sellers of Millet.In.Besides this, he also has a regular clientele for his karsilankanni (Eclipsa Alba) hair oil and mudakattan (Cardiospermum halicacabum or balloon vine) massage oil. Since the oils dont have any chemical additives, they last for at least 3 years, says Mr.Gopalakrishnan.He is currently developing flatbread flour mixes to be sold in a ready-to-eat form. Im planning to sell kneaded ragi flour dough that can be rolled out as rotis and cooked on the day of purchase.As our customer base changes, organic food and product manufacturers must also adapt to modern sensibilities, he says."

Nowruz , literally translating to ""new day"", is celebrated here by the Zoroastrian and Mughal Iranis alike, with equal fervour. And though the observances are largely familial, the day is welcomed with goodwill and hopes for the year ahead, inundated with interesting rituals and traditions...After the customary spring cleaning, restaurateur Rustom Irani 's house in Kondhwa wears a festive look. His wife Fauzia, sons Shahnawaz and Farheez, and their wives Rukhshin and Farzana bustle around the house, readying the ceremonial Haft-Seen table.The Haft-Seen is at the heart of the celebrations. Rustom says, ""Literally translating to 'the seven seens', the table comprises an arrangement of items (atleast seven) beginning with the Persian letter 'seen'."" He says that these elements represent key symbols of life. ""Sabzeh (wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish  symbolising rebirth), Samanoo (a sweet, creamy wheat germ pudding  symbolising affluence), Seeb (succulent apples  symbolising beauty and health), Senjed (sweet, dried sea buckthorn fruits  representing love), Seer (garlic  representing good health), Sumac (a Persian spice  representing sunlight and light overcoming darkness), and Serkeh (vinegar  representing age and patience)  these are the key elements we place on the table,"" explains Farheez.Getting all this together takes days of preparation. ""Customs have changed with regional variations, but at the core, the table represents a gesture of thanksgiving to God for the year gone by and the new one,"" adds Shahnawaz.Myriad food preparations are associated with the new year, differing across the countries where Nowruz is celebrated. But Fauzia has laid out a real feast for the day. She suggests starting off with Kookoo Sabzi, a traditional Nowruz dish of fluffy Persian herb omelettes. Next comes the Sabzi Polo Mahi, a mildly spiced chicken or mutton pilaf infused with the flavours and textures of sumac, coriander, spinach, cranberries and dried fruits. ""This usually goes well with the mahi or fish,"" says Fauzia, who has smeared the fish well with a paste of rice flour, chickpea flour, fennel seeds and black salt, and steamed it to tender perfection. The meal can be ended on a sweet note with Baklava (a sweet pastry of filo layers enriched with chopped nuts and the flavours of orange blossom and rose water), traditional ice-cream Falooda and Samanoo, the traditional wheat germ pudding that's a must.Nowruz is a time of glad tidings for the community. At Ramtekdi resident Kashmira Irani's house, the day will begin with 'Jashn'. ""The priest will come over and perform the 'Jashn' or prayer for everyone's happiness,"" says Kashmira. She will prepare the auspicious 'khana' comprising Mora Dal Chawal, Kolmi no Pattia (a rich prawn preparation), Patra ni Machchi and Salli Boti. ""At Nowruz, an Iranian salad - potatoes, spring onions, egg and a whole lot of spices - is a must,"" Kashmira adds. The Iranian Gaz (a Persian nougat), Daal ni Pori and the traditional ice-cream Falooda will feature on the table as well.A similar celebration will ensue at the house of Dr SMM Irani of Taboot Street's Husseny Bakery. ""Today, it is customary for us to say a special prayer, wishing for not just the family's, but everyone's best in the new year,"" says Dr Irani. At his place too, Sabzi Polo Mahi will be prepared and enjoyed."

The query pertained to the subsidy for one rupee kilo rice scheme.Demanding to know who deleted the question, Kishan Reddy said, ""I want a ruling on this. I would like to know who did it and would like action taken on this matter."" Even as he was speaking, Assembly secretary Raja Sadaram was seen briefing the Speaker, ostensibly on this matter.The Speaker explained that another similar question was posted and the deleted portions of Kishan Reddy's question were tagged to that and the BJP member was also added to the list of questioners. Kishan Reddy took serious objection to this and wanted to know if his question was considered unimportant that it could be cut and added to someone else's query. As leader of the opposition K Jana Reddy of the Congress also weighed in on the issue, calling the development 'highly objectionable', the Speaker said such things will not be repeated.""We are accepting,"" he added, in possible reference to the mix-up regarding Kishan Reddy's question."

Health Department officials found this out the unpleasant way as they arrived on a visit on Friday, only to be greeted by rats and cockroaches.The visit came a day after three boys in the hostel died in a suspected case of food poisoning. The kitchen was not clean at all. There were a lot of rats, one of the officials said, adding that the floors had clearly not been cleaned in a long time and the walls not painted at all. The cereals, rice and vegetables were kept open on the floor. When we went there, rats were feasting on them. The lighting was also poor.The official said the kitchen, built of hollow concrete block, seemed to be a temporary arrangement even though the hostel has been running without permission for three years now. The department will submit a report on this to the Deputy Commissioner soon, the official said.Y. Shreyas, a class 8 student, Akanksh Pallakki, a class 10 student, both from Thimmanahalli in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk, and Shantha Murthy, a class 10 student of Srirampura in Hosadurga taluk, Chitradurga district, died on Thursday after consuming food at the hostel on Wednesday night.A parent, who did not wish to be named, acknowledged the poor condition of the kitchen. It resembles a cow shed, he said.According to a source familiar with the hostel activities, the head cook, Shivanna, cooks the food for both lunch and dinner, but leaves by afternoon. It is the responsibility of the assistant cook, Rangalakshmi, to prepare rice for dinner. The sambar and other items prepared in the afternoon are used for dinner also, the source said.District Surveillance Officer Puroshottam said 18 samples of rice, sambar, vomitus and raw materials used for cooking have been sent for testing to the Public Health Institute in Bengaluru. He said until the biological and chemical analyses reports come out, the cause of death cannot be established.According to Rudra Murthy, resident medical officer of the district hospital, the autopsy had revealed that the trio had digested the food completely.Relatives protestRelatives of Shreyas and Akanksh, along with many others from their village, staged a protest in front of the Huliyar police station on Friday, demanding that a criminal case be registered against those responsible for the deaths.The agitators withdrew the agitation after Deputy Superintendent of Police Venugopal promised to consider their complaint and carry out a thorough probe.E. Shivanna, district president of the Students Federation of India, said, There has to be an impartial police investigation... the president of the school is a former BJP MLA. The government has to cancel the permit to run the school and make alternative arrangements for the students studying there.However, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Manjunath, said the school management had permission to run the school but not the hostel. Action will be taken after getting the report of the BEO, he said.RecoveringMeanwhile, school watchman Ramesh, who also took ill on Thursday morning, continues to be on ventilator. District surgeon Veerabhadraiah said he is responding to treatment but is not out of danger yet.Four employees of the hostel  Shivanna, Rangalakshmi, mess in-charge Suhas and attender Jagadish  who were arrested have been released on bail."

Among those sharing their culinary expertise isof MasterChef Australia fame, now a popular face on TV.asked her about fame, food, an)d the challenges of opening a restaurant.There is nothing more rewarding and exciting to a chef than to have an event full of passionate foodies.It's a place where you can talk all things food for hours and nobody cares, a place to celebrate local suppliers and encourage people to experiment at home.At the end of the day, food is art and we all need to eat.I think the exposure of home cooking through the above platforms absolutely played a part in encouraging people to experiment.However, deep down I think cooking is inside all of us, if we properly give it a go.Absolutely. I think it's great to encourage kids from a young age and not only is it fun for them but it also teaches them respect for produce, and to also know what they are putting into their bodies.First, test your passion and love of food. Get out there, work in the industry, work in a restaurant, travel, get inspiration, and if it's a true passion and you're cut out for the hard work, then go for it. For me, 'Antares' has been a dream project and extremely rewarding.I wouldn't say almost a second home, it's as home to me now as Australia is! This question I used to be able to answer, but the more time I spend in India the more favourite Indian dishes I have. Kheema, aloo-gobi, coconut chutney, fish xacuti, and so many more - the list goes on. My new-found love is for anything rice based - masala dosa, idli, appam, they're all filling but feel so light in the tummy.

Once looked down upon as a poor man's food, the fruit, which is now being hailed as the new vegan superfood , is making its way into everything from biryanis to burgers.From the unripe pods to seeds and the ripe fruit, all forms of the bumpy green fruit with a golden heart is making its way to Indian meals. Malayalis use it to make everything from vegetable dishes to payasams, for Bengalis, it is the ""gaach patha"" or ""mutton that grows on the tree"". In the West, the chewy pods are fast becoming a substitute for meat while, in India, people are using it to replace carbohydrates.Jackfruit is high in dietary fibre, is a rich source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, and is packed with phytonutrients, which may reduce the risk of many cancers, says Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital.""Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron,"" she says. The fruit is also a rich source of riboflavin, which helps to heal oral ulcers, and the Vitamin A in it prevents macular degeneration of the eye. ""It is also an important source of magnesium so it further helps in the absorption of calcium, and fights osteoporosis."" It is these health benefits that people abroad are discovering says Regi Mathew, mentor and director of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, a `neo'stalgic gourmet company. Praveen Anand, executive chef at ITC hotels, says it is being used extensively in their hotels. ""In north India, we have kathal (jackfruit) ki biriyani, as well as kormas, and kebabs made of it,"" he says.The fruit is said to be among the top food trends of 2017. ""This January, at the Fancy Food Show in the US, the star ingredient was jackfruit,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan, adding that it is used as a meat replacer in restaurants in New York and San Francisco.""The young fruit is considered a good replace ment for pulled pork and is served on burgers along with caramelised onion chutney ,"" says Mahadevan. He is planning to stock jackfruit chips and jams in Hot Breads stores there.Entrepreneurs have been quick to spot the marketing potential. Keralite James Joseph gave up a flourishing career with Microsoft to launch Jackfruit365 in 2013. ""I have always wondered why jackfruit doesn't feature on the menu in five-star hotels,"" says Joseph, adding that he realised it was because the fruit was `too sticky, smelly and seasonal'. So he came up with the idea of selling freeze-dried jackfruit.""The ripe fruit can be used to make pies and panna cotta, while the unripe pods can replace meat or tofu,"" says Joseph. After Jackfruit365 became a 100% diabetic diet company , they sell only unripe fruit online. ""The dried, sliced jackfruit can also be powdered and the flour added to idli or dosa batter and phulkas,"" says Joseph.Studies have revealed consumption of unripe jackfruit can help fight high blood sugar level. Bajaj stresses that ripe pods are not good for diabetics. ""The ripe fruit has a glycemic index (GI) of 63, while the unripe pod has a GI of only 52,"" she says.""Since it fills you up it helps cut down on rice and wheat."""

The main reason for this is that they easily fall prey to middlemen and wholesale traders, who often take them for a ride, quoting low prices.That sad story may now come to an end, if the state government has its way .In a first of its kind, the Karnataka Agriculture Pricing Commission has mooted a proposal to enact the Right to Remunerative Prices Act to give statutory powers to its agriculture agencies to initiate legal action against those who buy goods below the minimum support price (MSP).KAPC chair man T N Prakash Kamaraddi said the government, as of now, has no powers to initiate action against anyone who buys crops from farmers for less than the MSP . By giving statutory status to the commission and state agriculture department, he said it can guarantee income security to all farmers of the state. ""Under the proposed law, the government can initiate legal action against traders that includes confiscation of stock, imprisonment, penalty , among other things,'' he added.Impressed by the proposal, he said the government referred it to National Law School, Bengaluru, to seek an expert report before preparing a draft bill. Kamaraddi said the support price will ensure farmers get the actual cost of production for crops.Welcoming the move, Kurbur Shantakumar, state president of the Sugarcane Growers' Association, said it has been one of their long pending demands. Though the government announced MSP for various crops, no traders bought at that price, other than the government agencies.This, he said, was because they knew the government could do nothing if they buy at a lower rate.He cited the example of paddy , where the government announced MSP of Rs 1,500 per quintal. But farmers across the state were forced to sell their produce to private rice millers and traders at much lower rates. ""Many of them ended up selling for Rs 700 to Rs 1,100 per quintal,'' he alleged.As of now, only the Centre has the powers to announce statutory minimum price and fair and remunerative price for sugarcane, and the power to initiate legal action, if they find anyone buying produce for prices less than MSP ."
58f5440b7be9e01a3579d004,The Road Widening Fallacy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/the-road-widening-fallacy/articleshow/57089001.cms,2017-02-11,"Another wound pierces the green heart of Goa along the highway leading down from Verna to the Zuari Bridge. From times immemorial, lush and well-irrigated rice paddies have lined both sides of the road, always glistening brilliant emerald with multiple crops throughout the year. That emblematic sight is now forever marred. Tens of thousands of square metres of the richest agricultural land in the state have been overnight filled up for pointless ""road widening"", expanding the perfectly adequate highway to a vast tarmac. Like similar works under way across the bridge on the bypass at Agasaim, it appears the contractors acted without consulting local authorities and stakeholders, and before undertaking the necessary environmental impact surveys.The hasty, shoddy, careless nature of yet another deeply dubious and wasteful scam infrastructure project by the current administration will come as no surprise to state citizens. Over the past five years, Goa has seen its public debt soar past sustainability to danger of bankruptcy, as the cabinet of ministers wilfully approved a long string of alleged ""development"" that no one wants, needs, asked for or benefits from  other than a small coterie of cronies and crooks. The modus operandi has been near identical in each case  highly opaque procedures, instant approvals without any public oversight, huge cost overruns, and zero accountability.Rampant road widening under way all across tiny Goa's landscape are inevitably described as ""essential"", an imperative need. Whenever traffic jams state highways and bridges  as routinely occurs throughout the winter months  this administration seizes on the delays as its excuse and justification to continue to spend thousands of crores, and consume vast amounts of farmland, for ""infrastructure improvement."" But that reasoning is thoroughly fallacious, and has been comprehensively debunked everywhere in the world. In fact, road expansion inevitably leads to more traffic with increased numbers of vehicles. As the noted American urban planner Lewis Mumford wrote, ""building more roads to prevent congestion is like a fat man loosening his belt to prevent obesity.""Decades ago, transportation experts detected a broad phenomenon they called ""induced demand"". Mumford was among the pioneer researchers. He wrote in 1955, ""people, it seems, find it hard to believe the cure for congestion is not more facilities for congestion."" He found that everywhere and always, expansion of road facilities have never resulted in a decrease in traffic. Instead, several other converging factors quickly come to bear, to ensure no perceptible or lasting change. Some commuters are emboldened to change their driving schedules, others switch routes, and even greater numbers become motivated to purchase individual vehicles rather than rely on the vagaries of public transport.One of Mumford's immediate successors, Anthony Downs then formulated a ""universal law of highway congestion"" that ""on urban commuter expressways, peak-hour traffic congestion [always] rises to meet maximum capacity."" It has been proven again and again  no matter how many lanes, no matter how wide the roads, the entire system will inevitably and unavoidably become choked with traffic unless two other crucial factors come into play. The first is congestion pricing, which is likely unworkable in Goa (with the possible exception of Panaji). The other is the most abused and ignored aspect of India's infrastructure  robust and scalable public transportation.In this regard, Goa's abject failures merely reflect a wider national disgrace. India's transportation woes severely drain on the economy and carry a critical price in multiple areas, from food security to public health. Chaos and mayhem on the roads are a major factor in the perilous air quality which plagues most urban centres in the country. According to World Health Organization 's air pollution database, 10 of the 20 unhealthiest cities on the planet are in India, with by far the main cause being vehicular congestion. Air pollution is one of the biggest causes of death in India. The average citizen loses years of life simply by breathing.There is no excuse at all for Goa to plunge directly to such hazards, but that is precisely what is unfolding in plain view. Just last year, the Goa State Pollution Board warned repeatedly that alarming spikes were recorded in ""respirable particulate matter"" (which is caused by vehicular exhausts) in both Vasco and Panaji, that were more than two times the national ambient air quality standard. It's a clear red flag that points to a frightening impending health emergency. Whatever political alignment shapes the next government of the state, the lurking air pollution problem deserves priority, along with its interlinked corollary, a working and adequate public transportation system.The writer is a photographer and widely published columnist."

The Rice Memorial Church opened its doors to devotees on January 27, 1917 in what was then Bangalore Petah The communion service at the church held on Sunday as part of the centenary celebrations had two special visitors: Douglas Walthew Rice, and his son, Benjamin Rice, the descendants of Reverend Benjamin Holt Rice , after whom the church has been named.Citizens cutting across barriers of religion thronged the church on Sunday, to partake of the celebrations. In keeping with tradition, the service was conducted in Kannada. Their inability to comprehend Kannada did not deter the Rices from soaking in the festive atmosphere at the church.""To be a part of the service at a church that bears the name of my ancestor was overwhelming. The singing was great. We were engrossed in the service, though we could not follow the language,"" said DW Rice, who has come to the city from London, with wife Alsion and son, for the occasion.An imposing structure on Avenue Road, Rice Memorial Church, however, had a humble beginning. In 1834, it was a small structure called Canarese Chapel. Reverend Rice, of the London Missionary Society , came to the city as postar in 1837, and essayed a vital role in transforming the chapel into a full-fledged Protestant church. After 50 years of service to the church, he passed away in 1887. His daughter, Jane Rice took on the responsibility of erecting a church at the location, and named the structure in Benjamin Rice's honour.Reverend Rice is fondly remembered for his contribution in the field of education. A crusader for girls' education, the Bangalore Girls High School, now called Mitralaya Girls high School, on Mission Road, which was started in 1842, is a living testament to his efforts."

Three successive generations of the Rice family  Benjamin Holt, Benjamin Lewis (BL) and Harold Douglas (HD)  have left indelible imprints on the pages of Karnataka's history .For Douglas Walthew Rice , who has come to the city from London, it is a sort of homecoming. ""My great-grandfather, BL Rice was born here, and served the state of Mysore. His father, the Reverend spent 50 years here, and ultimately died in the city. We visited his grave at the cemetery near Richmond Town,"" he said.Benjamin Holt's son BL Rice is revered among Kannada academicians as Purathathva Pitamaha (grand old man of inscriptions) for his pioneering work in translating more than 9,000 Kannada inscriptions. His work was compiled in the compendious Epigraphica Carnatica, which runs into 12 volumes.SL Srinivasamurthy, a Kannada scholar who has authored a book on Bl Rice, said, ""Through him, Kannadigas learnt of the rich heritage of their language.""Among his other accomplishments can be counted his contribution to Mysore state's education policy in the capacity of the first director of public instructions. He opened the united Mission High School for Boys on Mission Road in Bengaluru - an institution that counts Sir M Visvesvaraya among its alumni.BL's son Harold Douglas kept alive his family's longstanding ties with Karnataka, making a huge contribution to the state's irrigation infrastructure. Harold Douglas was an assistant engineer in the team that built the Vani Vilas Sagar Dam across the Vedavathi River in Chitradurga, the construction of which was commissioned in 1897.DW Rice, who visited the dam, said that while the dam was well maintained, the government needed to ensure effective garbage management at the site. He was also part of the team that developed a railway line that connected Mysuru and Nanjangud. He also developed the road on Chamundi Hills in Mysuru.""I visited Mysuru, and it felt as if I was conversing with my ancestors,"" said Benjamin Rice, DW's son."

The bride is the daughter of well-known musician-composer Rajesh Sarkate.The guests for the ostentatious affair ranged from an unprecedented number of VVIPs to bureaucrats and commoners from Aurangabad and Jalna. Among the politicians who turned up were two Shiv Sena ministers of state, opposition leaders and MLAs cutting across party lines.""Over 30,000 guests attended the marriage ceremony,"" said state BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar. ""This is not unusual as lots of people love Raosaheb Danve, who has been in public life for almost four decades.""A structure resembling a huge medieval palace was set up on the sprawling Jabinda Estate on the outskirts of the city, where the marriage was conducted. The entrance to the estate was brightly lit with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling while a red carpet rolled from here to the stage where the couple was seated.The police kept a watch on the proceedings through drone cameras that hovered over the venue at regular intervals.The ceremony was reminiscent, though on a smaller scale, of the marriage function of Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari's daughter in Nagpur in December last year. At least ten chartered or special flights carrying VIPs were flown in to the city for the ceremony. Among the VVIPs were Rajnath Singh , Amit Shah, Fadnavis, Mohan Bhagwat, Maneka Gandhi and Baba Ramdev.It may be mentioned here that a bill in the Lok Sabha seeks to put a limit on the number of guests to be invited and dishes to be served at weddings to check the ""show of wealth"". The bill also wants those spending above Rs 5 lakh to contribute towards the marriage of girls from the poorer sections of society.Public sentiment about the lavishness of Danve's son's marriage wasn't exactly complimentary. Many felt the celebrations could have been toned down given that the entire Marathwada region had reeled under severe drought for years, with several farmers ending their lives out of desperation.The commoners who attended the wedding were upset that the dinner fare was not standard for all guests. While they were served chapatis, puris, dal, rice and vegetables, the spread for the VVIPs included several Maharashtrian, South Indian, North Indian and Chinese dishes. In addition, the VVIPs were served five or six types of sweets.Office-goers staying in the Beed bypass area were particularly inconvenienced because of the marriage. The administration had shut the major flyover linking the Beed bypass localities to the general public and two-wheelers. Only VVIPs travelling in cars were allowed to take the flyover to reach the marriage venue. Office-goers complained of having had to take a longer route to reach home as the police had blocked the flyover much ahead of the wedding ceremony that began at 7pm.Though the ceremony went off smoothly, roads were again shut to the general public later to ensure that VVIPs had an easy exit.Sena minister of state Arjun Khotkar, who belongs to Jalna district, addressed the gathering and said he was extending his best wishes to the Danves on behalf of the citizens of Jalna. Others who extended the their wishes included Fadnavis, former chief minister Narayan Rane, opposition leader Dhananjay Munde and BJP MP Sambhajiraje Bhosle."

Corn edged lower, with the grain poised to finish the week down 3 percent, while wheat was on course to post its biggest one-week fall since 2016. The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade fell 0.5 percent to $9.86 a bushel, the lowest since Nov. 18. Soybeans closed down 0.9 percent on Thursday. Soybeans are down nearly 1.5 percent for the week, the third straight weekly loss. Analysts said soybeans remain under pressure from ample global supplies, despite the recent strong demand for U.S. supplies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said soybean sales topped trade forecasts at 738,200 tonnes for 2016/17 shipment. ""Investors are thinking: how much longer can that last? Big South American crops are now arriving on to the market,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Ample global supply expectations were further stoked as Argentina's 2016/17 soy crop was estimated at 56.5 million tonnes, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said on Thursday, up from the previous outlook of 54.8 million tonnes. Global stocks are expected to be boosted further as the USDA is scheduled to release its annual prospective plantings report late next week. It is expected to show record-high soybean acreage. The most active corn futures dropped 0.1 percent to $3.56-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.56 percent in the previous session. Corn is down nearly 3 percent for the week, after posting gains of nearly 1 percent a week earlier. The falls come despite the USDA pegging corn exports in the last week above trade expectations. The most active wheat futures climbed 0.12 percent to $4.21-1/2 a bushel. In the previous session, they ended down 0.3 percent, when prices hit $4.20 a bushel, their lowest since Feb. 7. Wheat is down nearly 3.5 percent for the week, set for their biggest weekly fall since Dec. 23.

She drags her unsteady feet till they can't bear her weight any longer and has to be helped back to the chair. But Victoria Thokchom looks undeterred and ready to walk a longer distance. The 26-year-old nurse from Manipur, who had slipped into coma after being hit on the head by a dengue patient with an iron rod last October, needs to undergo a prolonged therapy to get back on her feet. Discharged from hospital on Wednesday after three-and-a-half months, she also needs treatment to regain her speech.""I am happy that my daughter is finally out of hospital but she stares at an uncertain future. Victoria needs therapy to be able to resume normal physical activities. So, she must be in Kolkata now. I would like to stay back in the city and continue her treatment rather than take her back to Manipur,"" said her father Kunjabihari Thokchom, who has been fleeting in and out of Kolkata along with her younger daughter.On October 20, Victoria was on duty at the ICU of a nursing home in south Kolkata when a dengue patient assaulted her with a rod. She suffered a fracture in her skull and multiple clots in the brain. She also lost the ability to speak.Victoria had slipped into coma for a month and went through two successful surgeries. Ever since, she has been recovering slowly. ""It has been a long process but she has recovered very well. It could take her several more months to regain her movements and speech, provided she receives the right therapy,"" said RP Sengupta, chairman of the Institute of Neurosciences Kolkata (INK) where Victoria has been undergoing treatment.Her family fears that her recovery may hit a stumbling block due to lack of facilities and funds. ""With generous help from her professional colleagues in Kolkata, we have somehow managed to bear the treatment expenses. But we have run out of funds and can only afford rice and dal at home, which she won't be able to consume. Also, she needs therapy which can only be done in Kolkata. But I don't have a place to stay in the city,"" said her father. Thokchom has been living in a rented apartment in Dhakuria but would prefer to move either to the Manipur House or to a cheaper accommodation."

This time, the heat is being felt especially by consumers in the coast, who love their red variety of rice - used extensively in the coastal belt.The price of this rice has shot up by about 20%, making it very dear for daily users.Majority of the people in the coast consume par boiled rice or what is commonly known as boiled rice.The red variety rice, kaje 's price has gone up from Rs 36 per kilo to Rs 42 to Rs 44 per kg (depending on which retailer it is sourced from).The reason for the price hike seems to be due to the increased price of kaje paddy grown in Kodagu and Chikkamagaluru areas and shortfall in production. H K Shenoy, sole distributor of one popular variety of Kaje rice in the region, said ""The reason for the price rise is due to increase in rates of paddy used for kaje rice and the production shortfall. The prices are unlikely to go down till a fresh stock comes, which is about six to eight months away.""But the retailers are not happy. A major retailer said that when prices of many rice of varieties went down few months back, the kaje variety did not see any decrease. ""But when recently, there was an increase, the red variety saw a hike. So, it was a double whammy of price hike. The reason we got for price remaining high is the red variety of paddy and rice has good market in Kerala and the supplier was not bothered about reducing rates,"" said a retailer.Another retailer said that the demand for red variety has tapered down by half in his shop. ""Where consumers used to buy red variety are now buying the Gidda variety (white parboiled rice), which is retailing between Rs 36 and Rs 38 depending on the quality,"" the retailer said. Some hotels which offered red rice have switched over to cheaper gidda rice. Srinath, who cannot do without red rice, said, ""It's hard on the common man. When we thought that there was a bit of semblance in prices, we see the balance being tilted. It is unfair. Most of the people from the coast settled elsewhere, especially Bengaluru, Mumbai prefer boiled variety of rice for consumption.""So, for the time being, kaje lovers have no choice but to swallow red rice with indignation till price correction takes place."

Only it isn't. It's a five-foot kolam 'framed' on the floor of Mangalam Srinivasan's home in Srirangam, Tiruchy, and just one of the 51-year-old home-maker's intricate, elaborate, exquisitely created designs that has made her quite the sensation on Facebook.""70,000 likes and counting is what my daughters tell me, though I don't understand it,"" Mangalam admits. ""All I know is that almost every day I get requests from strangers in different countries to do certain kolams, questions from them about my work, and sometimes just a thumbs up,"" says Mangalam, who laughs that the people on her street still don't know about her work, but strangers from cities she has never heard of write and call about it.Mangalam's kolams, made both from rice flour and rangoli powder , range in size from a few inches to 11 feet (a kolam of Lord Shiva) and in theme from gods and goddesses to even a replica of the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa (which Mangalam says adorned her house on the morning of December 6, the day after Jayalalithaa's death).Theme from gods to replicas of paintingsThough she has been drawing kolams in the living room and kitchen of her home for decades now - an art she picked up from her mother and then later honed the skill through a painting class - it was her daughters who got her fan club up and running on Facebook. ""My mother has been drawing kolams for years but she never talks about it, so it's just a few relatives who know about her work,"" says Bhargavi, one of Mangalam's daughters. So in 2013, Bhargavi decided to start the Facebook page 'My Mom's Art Gallery', and post a picture a day at least of her mother's work.""I didn't think it would become such a hit. She has so many fans, we get messages on the group almost everyday,"" says Bhargavi, who adds that she put her mother on the e-map only to let people know what a ""wonderful artist"" she is. Mangalam's husband SV Srinivasan, General Manager, at BHEL, films the kolams as they are being drawn - some like the Ravi Varma taking hours -- and makes them available on YouTube as mini tutorials.""Getting the correct shade of the gold zari in powder is the most difficult part of my kolams,"" says Mangalam, who, over the years of dotting several Tanjore painting type designs, has mastered the art of turning powder to gold - a mix of lemon yellow, ochre, orange and dark red.""In the beginning I never used to want to wipe them off the floor because of the work that went into them. But now, knowing that I have fans who look forward to my work, it keeps me motivated. I just have to do a kolam a day whether it takes me minutes or hours. I stay up nights thinking of what next,"" she adds.""I can't let my daughters down. After all it is their mom's art gallery,"" she laughs."

As many as 4,537 cardholders are likely to benefit from this move, officials said. Plans are also on to extend facilities in 1,250 ration shops across the district. According to data obtained, there are around 7.5 lakh ration card holders in Agra.The department has also been conducting awareness programmes to guide customers making payments via cell phones using the USSD. District supply officer B K Shukla said, ""Cardholders using digital payment methods will be provided ration on priority basis. Each fair price shop will make a separate queue of priority customers. Those who are still making cash payments will be sensitised about digital mode of paying.""In the digital payment system, the cardholders' mobile numbers are first registered with the banking services and payments are then channelized through USSD application using Mobile Money Identifier (MMID) code. It is not compulsory for the customers to have a smartphone to avail this service and they will only have to send a text message, said officials.Under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) ration cardholders get food grains at subsidised rates. Every eligible person gets wheat at Rs 2 per kg and rice at Rs 3 per kg up to a maximum quantity of 3.5 kg and 1.5 kg respectively."
58f54dc67be9e01a3579db01,Lapses in PDS rock assembly,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/lapses-in-pds-rock-assembly/articleshow/57742365.cms,2017-03-21,"Chennai: The assembly on Monday witnessed a heated debate over shortage of essential items in the public distribution system. The main opposition DMK alleged that the state failed to supply essential commodities like dal and palm oil under special PDS for the past three months, despite its claims that it has allocated Rs 5,500 crore annually towards food subsidy.The DMK held state-wide protests charging the state government with non-performance in PDS recently, leading to large-scale detention of cadres and leaders. Participating in the budget debate, Krishnagiri MLA T Senguttuvan said the crisis was huge in the Cauvery delta region, where the agriculture sector was already experiencing distress. ""There will be an additional burden of Rs 684 crore if the Centre's subsidy for sugar is stopped from April. Are you then going to shut down the PDS outlets?"" the MLA demanded to know, adding that the supply of foodgrain by the previous DMK regime went off without a hitch.Reiterating the government's commitment to continue universal PDS, and the special PDS for which tenders had been floated recently, food minister R Kamaraj intervened to say that there was a hitch in the supply when O Panneerselvam was chief minister. ""There was a delay in the process of extending special PDS after its term ended in December,"" the minister said, setting off heated exchanges. The DMK MLA reminded the minister that he headed the food ministry even during OPS tenure. ""The state's reversal of stand on the National Food Security Act, when Jayalalithaa was hospitalized, will lead to additional financial burden of Rs 2,500 crore,"" Senguttuvan said.Energy minister P Thangamani said the state did not oppose NFSA, but endorsed the scheme after concerns raised by the state were acceded to. In its communication to the state government in October 2016, the Union government said there was no further allocation of food grain would be made to the state under APL and BPL category. The Centre also conveyed to the state that minimum support price-derived rate for rice was Rs 22.54 per kg, while the state was getting 15.15 lakh MT of rice annually under APL category at Rs 8.30 per kg. The state joined NFSA in October, after Kerala joined."

The 'KCR kit' will have 16 items, including diapers, with a funds allocation of Rs 605 crore.The kit to be given for three months will comprise baby shampoo, baby oil, powder, napkin, dresses, mosquito net, small mattress, diapers, towel and toys. Also, handbag and cotton sarees for mothers.The scheme is modelled around the 'Amma Kit' distributed for babies and mothers in Tamil Nadu. A team of higher officials from health department and chief minister's office visited Tamil Nadu to study the scheme introduced by late chief minister Jayalalithaa. Women and child welfare department or health department will be the nodal agency to supply the kits.The government will also provide aid to pregnant women who visit government hospitals. A total of 12,000 will be disbursed in three phases - 4,000 upon visitng hospital, Rs 4000 after being discharged and 3000 for vaccination of the baby.The government will also supply superfine rice through anganwadis for babies, pregnant women and new mothers. Anganwadi workers will be elevated as anganwadi teachers.The government has allotted Rs 1731.5 crore for women and child welfare for the coming fiscal, a slight increase from last year's allocation of Rs 1553 crore.State government also allocated Rs 5976.17 crore for health department in 2017-18 budget. Key aspects of the outlay will be construction of three more super-specialty hospitals in Hyderabad and one in Karimnagar. Fifty more new vehicles will be arranged to take bodies from government hospitals to homes. New beds, saline stands, bedsheets will be given in place of spoiled ones."

However, with favourable conditions like ample water in irrigation projects, minor irrigation sources, improved groundwater table, and nine-hour power supply to the agriculture sector, the farmers were expecting a bumper yield this season.Dispelling doubtsCultivation of paddy on nearly six lakh hectares this yaasangi are also dispelling apprehensions of whether there would be enough procurement of paddy to meet the requirement of rice needed for welfare schemes such as public distribution system, supply of super fine variety rice to school and college hostels, and the mid-day meal scheme, a senior official of the Agriculture Department told The Hindu .Based on the increasing demand for energy from the agriculture sector, the Energy Department was estimating that that cultivation of paddy could have been taken up on nearly eight lakh hectares. On our part, we are prepared to meet the demand from the farm sector as the total demand has been ranging between 150 to 170 million units (MU) a day for over a month now, a TS-Transco official stated.Considering the plans of the Irrigation Department to give water to about 22.35 lakh acres (8.94 lakh hectares) this season under major irrigation sources and estimates of cultivation of another 7.11 lakh acres (2.84 lakh hectares) under minor irrigation sources, the cultivation during rabi could be on over 12 lakh hectares with three-fourths of it covered by paddy.Minister for Irrigation T. Harish Rao recently stated that they were expecting about 30 lakh tonne of paddy production this yaasangi season, indicating that the actual cultivation of the food crop could be much higher than the statistics of the Agriculture Department."
