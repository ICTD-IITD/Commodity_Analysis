Chandrasekhar Raos decision to revive the sick powerloom industry with his assurance of providing a minimum wage of Rs. 15,000 and above per month to each powerloom weaver.On Tuesday, Handlooms Development Corporation Director Shailaja Rama Iyer and Collector Krishna Bhaskar visited the textile town and interacted with the weavers and trade union leaders to gather their opinion. They would submit the same to the State government.Hailing the State government for taking all measures to revive the powerloom industry, Kishore, president of Sizing Workers Union, said the government should strictly abide by its decision to increase the wages of the weavers as they were underpaid for several years. Powerloom Workers Union president S. Mallesham welcomed the governments decision in this regard.On several occasions, the powerloom weavers have gone on strike demanding increase in wages, but the owners betrayed them after promising a hike, he mentioned. He opined that the Chief Minister should have convened a meeting with both the powerloom owners and weavers to have some clarity on the issue.Rajesham, president of CITU, suggested that the government should provide at least four powerlooms and supply yarn for producing fabric which should be marketed by the government itself. He also said the government should provide 35 kg of rice to all the weavers under Annapurna Antyodaya scheme.Skill upgradationThe weavers also urged the government to provide training for skill upgradation among them. They said that the government should procure all the fabric produced by the powerlooms to provide regular employment to the weavers in Sircilla.Thrift schemeMr. Rama Iyer said the State government was working out modalities to increase the wages of powerloom weavers. She said the government was planning to formulate a thrift scheme for weavers by collecting contributions from weavers and owners including the State government. The amount collected under the scheme would be given to the weavers to meet their expenses."

According to call record details obtained by Bankura police , Sharma too had visited Bhopal on a number of occasions. Udayan had even marked these ""occasions"" on the calendar with red ink. Police claim that this revelation was enough to raise questions on the motive of the murder.Police said that his plan to kill Akansha wasn't on the spur of the moment. ""Udayan was addicted to crime thrillers. He had watched the 2013 film `Devil's Knot' several times before deciding to apply the same methodology while murdering Akansha,"" said SP (Bankura) Sukhendu Hira.""The claim by Udayan that he had killed Akansha after he found that she was still talking to her former boyfriends holds little ground. The call record details and messages sent from Akansha's mobile before June 29, 2016 -the day she supposedly shifted to Bhopal's Saketnagar with Udayan -does not show the existence of any secret admirer thus far,"" said an officer. Udayan was questioned for over four hours on both Tuesday and Wednesday evening at the SP's office.Police say there was a complex world that Udayan had created for himself where he would spend lavishly and would not care for anyone but himself. ""Udayan believed that the only way he could stop his parents and the outside world from rebuking him was to get rich at any cost,"" explained an officer.It was this mentality that led him to create over 110 fake email and Facebook accounts. ""He would note down the email IDs and passwords and then use them to comment on his own posts. He even posted likes from different accounts just to portray that he was successful and accepted in life,"" said a source.For most part of Wednesay , though, Udayan remained unfazed by the continuous questioning. ""He did not break down even once during interrogation. He tried to lead us astray saying he would love to complete his higher studies,"" a source said, adding: ""He ate egg curry rice with shukto, pumpkin curry and even dal.""He has also refused to speak to anyone at the Bankura Sadar police station other than senior officers.Police now have evidence that shows Udayan had become restless for the two years after he began running out of the money he had gained by selling his Raipur residence. ""He knew that his father had kept Rs 8 lakh as fixed deposit. He tried to call the bank manager at Raipur and even shifted his father's accounts to Bhopal. But the bank kept denying him the money . We suspect it was around this time that he convinced Akansha to transfer her money to him by bringing her to Bhopal. ""The fact that of the Rs 1.20 lakh kept in the account only Rs 9 remained shows that Udayan had managed to access her account. The murder for gain theory thus finds much more credence,"" an officer said."

And Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certified ones at that, with manufactured, expiry and best before dates stamped on every serving.It isn't just the menu that's modern at the Jaya Durga Peetham , the service is too. Here, you will find visitors slipping token into vending machines to collect boxes of their 'pret-a-prasadam', prepared with precision in the automated temple kitchen.K Sri Sridhar, a herbal oncologist who helped set up the temple, says his idea to serve up desserts and sandwiches as part of the temple prasadam has rustled up quite a bit of interest among locals and tourists. ""The idea was to show that anything that is nutritious and prepared in a clean kitchen with a clean mind can be served to God. It doesn't have to be only traditional dishes,"" says Sridhar.A few months ago, the temple even introduced the 'birthday cake prasadam' for its devotees. ""We maintain a computerised register of their birth dates and addresses and door deliver a cake prasadam to them. It's a hit among the elderly devotees, because coming from the temple it adds a special touch to the occasion,"" says Sridhar.On Saturday, for instance, 81-year-old Subbulakshmi was more than pleasantly surprised when she received a cake prasadam. ""It was so pretty with flowers and icing,"" says the 81-year-old, adding it was her first surprise cake ever. ""And it came with an agar deepam (a traditional oil lamp) instead of candles which was so nice. Just like they light at the temple,"" she adds. ""When we set up the temple we thought we should give Gods the food we relish,"" he says. Guess nothing says that better than a butterscotch mousse."

Kotnis was among the five-member medical team that went to China in 1939 in response to a call seeking medical assistance during the second Sino-Japanese War.He worked tirelessly in China for four years, before he passed away at the young age of 32. Touched by Kotnis's work in China, Mao, a master calligraphist himself, penned a moving tribute and condolence message to his family in Solapur.The 3-foot-long letter was written on traditional rice paper using charcoal black ink. A few years ago, the letter was handed to the Kotnis museum operated by the municipal corporation.The condolence message had undergone wear and tear over the years and plans to restore it began in 2014 when the then Chinese consul general in Mumbai heard about this gem.""The chief of relics from China visited Solapur and discussed ways to restore the letter. It was decided to send two experts from China,"" Guo Taojie, chief of political section, consulate general of the People's Republic of China in Mumbai, said.The consulate got in touch with Zhu from Shanghai museum and Zhao from Gansu museum in August 2016 and requested them to travel to Solapur. When the duo saw the frayed letter with its fading ink and moth-damaged fragile paper, they knew they had a huge task on hand.They combined their collective experience of nearly 80 years, used specialised tools from China, followed traditional and new scientific methods to restore the letter.""We brought all the tools, restoration material and ink from China. We had to peel the three layers that make the rice paper and fix the wear and tear one small step at a time,"" Zhu said. She has worked in China and other countries to restore Chinese calligraphy works for more than40 years. ""This is out first time to India and we did not know what to expect. The food here is nowhere close to our's.Instant noodles were the closest,"" Zhu said. Li added that working conditions in Solapur were not as good as in China, but the people were extremely helpful. ""They went out of their way to ensure that we got all that we needed."""

Soybeans rose for a second session, underpinned by slow selling by Brazilin farmers while corn edged higher, snapping two sessions of gains. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract lost 0.3 percent to $4.46-3/4 a bushel by 0345 GMT, after earlier touching its lowest since Feb. 21 at $4.45-1/2 a bushel. Wheat closed down 1.2 percent on Friday. Soybeans rose 0.3 percent to $10.27-3/4 a bushel, having firmed 1.3 percent on Friday. Corn added 0.2 percent to $3.64-3/4, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. Wheat is under pressure from rising global supply which is increasing competition for U.S. wheat. Argentina will likely harvest a record 18.3 million tonnes of wheat from the 2016/17 crop, 11 million to 11.5 million tonnes of which could be exported, Agriculture Minister Ricardo Buryaile said. The U.S. government projected a 7 percent decline in corn production in the 2017/18 marketing year to 14.065 billion bushels, but ending stocks were expected to remain burdensome at more than 2 billion bushels. The soybean market is finding support as farmers in Brazil have slowed sales of their record-large crop after prices dropped to their lowest since Jan. 12 last week. ""Market chatter has been focused on the fact that Brazilian farmers have been more patient soybean sellers this season,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

58f55b587be9e01a3579ef3f,Midday meals offer food for thought,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/midday-meals-offer-food-for-thought/articleshow/57301221.cms,2017-02-23,"NEW DELHI: The discovery of two rats in the food delivered to a government senior secondary school in Deoli a few days ago might have raised concerns over hygiene in the preparation of mid-day meals, but cleanliness is a very small part of the problem related to the school meal scheme in Delhi. For one, delay of payments to vendors affects their capacity to source supplies, leading, in turn, to compromises in the nutritional norms of the meals.Avnesh Goyal, manager of Matri Research & Development Foundation, a vendor based in Rohini, said he has been told the unpaid dues will reach them by second week of next month at the earliest. ""It has been three months since we received our payments,"" he said. Another NGO manager, Jaspreet Singh of Stri Shakti Foundation, said delays of a few months are now routine, sometimes even touching five months. ""It becomes difficult to manage because we only get wheat and rice from the government. We still need to pay the costs on water, electricity, gas, vegetables, dal,"" Singh said.Delhi government officials claim they have been unable to disburse money due to delays in release of funds by the central government. Atishi Marlena, advisor to education minister Manish Sisodia, said, ""We have yet to receive the centre's share of the mid-day meal funds. We are planning to pay the vendors using our own funds and release the money at the earliest."" The mid-day meal is a part of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, funding for which is shared by the centre and the state government.Lack of funds can adversely affect purchases and food quality. The vendors are supposed to add mashed vegetables to the dal and daliya to make the meal wholesome, but some are constrained to use inexpensive seasonal vegetables, often precluding leafy greens. Meena Sharma, principal, Sarvodaya Co-Ed Senior Secondary School, Rohini, pointed out, ""The vendors sometimes cook bottle gourd, even cauliflower, because these seasonal vegetables cost the minimum when spinach or leafy vegetables are unavailable.""Nutritionists point out that though the menu offers wholesome food the students, the meals need to be hot and served in adequate quantities. As per regulations, the vendor must weigh the cooked food before transporting it to the schools, and a school, on receiving it, must weigh it too. However, the practice is not followed in Delhi, where the food instead is ferried as per the student strength.""The food needs to be served to the kids in the morning around recess time and weighing it in the kitchen and then in the school can prove time consuming,"" defended a senior education department official. ""Usually, the vendors know how much food each school requires because the attendance is fairly stable. And that is also how food is sent.""However, this logic can fail. Principals have pointed out that on days that the school is scheduled to get aloo puri, a favourite with students, even twice the designated amount is not enough.""The kids love eating aloo puri. But on days daliya is served, most of it is returned because the children don't like eating it,"" said Seema Sharma. To which nutritionist Rekha Sharma said, ""Aloo puri has little nutritional value, daliya has enough."" So, the nutritionist said, it was important that children ate their food, whatever it may be, in proper portions. ""The menu is not the problem,"" she added. ""But having a childeat just one spoon of food will not suffice even if that food is nutritious.""Though the quality of food prepared in the NGO kitchens is normally monitored, the mid-day meal management committees of many schools sometimes send back the meals for being unpalatable. In such cases, the children are given biscuits in lieu of cooked meals. ""The food is tasted by members of the mid-day meal committee and sent back if it doesn't taste right,"" said the education department official. ""But it is not feasible for kitchens to prepare the meals all over again. It is in cases like this that biscuits are distributed.""The education directorate penalises the vendor every time the food is returned, either by fining it on the basis of per-child cost or by not paying it for the food that was rejected.Vendors say directorate officials inspect the NGO kitchens at least twice a month, and almost every day by the school teachers or principal. However, Delhi government accepts that the checks on how mid-day meals are being prepared need to be more diligent.""We need to improve the inspections that our officers conduct in these kitchens to make sure no untoward incidents take place. We need better standard operating procedures and are working towards this,"" said Marlena."

He has been repai ring cycles for 45 years.""""I too remember working in the fields in the younger years before I managed to get a work permit for Canada and started working at a radio station there. My two brothers did their MPhil and are now working as teachers. We owe it all to our father,"" he added. When Mann's car diologist friend Dr Anmol Kapoor posted pictures of the battered hands of Mann's father on Twitter on January 1, they got 282 retweets and 321 likes. ""It was a tough task for me to come back (from Canada) but he encouraged me to take the plunge,"" said Mann.Mann recalls working in rice fields in his childhood and his father ensuring that he and his siblings work with utmost honesty. ""This is something that he expects from my political career too. Whenever I get a chance to catch up with him, he asks me to give it my best,"" said Mann.But coming from an economically weak background has its disadvantages.""I could not complete my studies and one of my sisters still works in a thread factory. It is a big task for someone who puts punctures on bicycle tyres to make his children to become financially self-reliant,"" he said."

Corn prices were flat after hitting a three-week low the session before, while wheat was largely unchanged. The most active Chicago Board of Trade soybean contract, for March, climbed 0.17 percent to $10.08-1/4 a bushel. It closed down 0.45 percent on Friday, after marking its lowest since Jan. 11 at $10.03 a bushel. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday raised its forecast of Brazil's soybean crop for 2016/17 to a record 108 million tonnes, from the 104 million predicted last month. Brazilian agricultural statistics agency Conab on Thursday raised its estimate for the country's 2016/17 soybean crop to 107.6 million tonnes, more than 2 million tonnes above its previous forecast. ""The prospect of season 2016 (soy) inventories rising when record acreage is on the cards for season 2017 is not a price friendly combo,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The most active corn futures were unchanged at $3.64-1/4 a bushel on Monday. They ended down 0.75 percent in the previous session, having hit their weakest since Feb. 24 at $3.62-1/2 a bushel. The USDA raised its forecast of global 2016/17 corn ending stocks to 220.68 million tonnes, above the average trade estimate and up from 217.56 million last month. The most active wheat futures were little changed at $4.40-1/4 a bushel, after closing down 0.8 percent on Friday.

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade rose 0.2 percent to $4.21-1/2 a bushel. They closed down 0.9 percent on Monday when prices hit their lowest since Feb. 1 at $4.18-1/4 a bushel. * The most active soybean futures climbed 0.26 percent to $9.74 a bushel, having closed down 0.44 percent on Monday, when prices marked their weakest since Oct. 17 at $9.68-1/4 a bushel. * The most active corn futures advanced 0.3 percent to $3.56-3/4 a bushel, having ended the last session down 0.14 percent. On Monday, they touched their lowest since Jan. 12 at $3.54-1/4 a bushel. * Wheat prices were under pressure as rains forecast for the next 10 days are set to boost wheat growth in the U.S. Plains and southwest portion of the Midwest. * Analysts polled by Reuters expected the U.S. Department of Agriculture to show stockpiles of U.S. wheat, corn and soybeans as of March 1 larger than at the same point in 2016. * The analysts also predicted U.S. soybean plantings for 2017 will rise nearly 5 million from 2016. Corn seedings were forecast at 90.969 million acres, down about 3 million. * The Buenos Aires Grains Exchange last week raised its outlook for Argentina's 2016/17 soy crop to 56.5 million tonnes from 54.8 million, the latest in a series of upgrades for harvests in South America. MARKET NEWS * The dollar limped away from multi-month lows against its major peers early on Tuesday as the previous day's rout petered out, but the U.S. currency remained on shaky ground with much of the lift from the ""Trump trade"" now gone. * Oil resumed its slide on Monday as investors remained uncertain whether producing nations would extend an OPEC-led output cut beyond the end of June in an effort to reduce a global glut of crude. * U.S. equity index futures fell to a six-week low on Sunday in a sign Wall Street would start the week defensively after Republicans pulled legislation to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system in a stunning setback for President Donald Trump.

58f55c6ba3d24b0b70c206fc,Millets all set to stage comeback in Odisha,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/millets-all-set-to-stage-comeback-in-odisha/article17328312.ece,2017-02-19,"The growing popularity of millets among the health-conscious urban population has sparked hopes of revival for millet cultivation in the tribal dominated regions of Odisha.Millets, which are small-seeded grasses grown as cereals or fodder, are rich in fibre, iron and calcium. With the tribals in the State aping the food practice of non-tribals thanks to greater interaction between communities, millets lost out to hybrid rice and wheat even in areas that were its strongholds.Even till a decade ago, tribal residents from 14 villages under the Guma gram panchayat of Kandhamal district were dependant on millet-based farming. But, this was before the locals turned to rice and wheat.Four decades ago, in 1978-79, millets were cultivated in an area that spanned over 5.49 lakh hectare, which dropped to 2.01 lakh hectare by 2001-02. By 2008-09, the crop covered less than 1 lakh hectare (around 66,000 hectares), which was barely 1.12% of Odishas total cropland. In 2014-15, millets covered barely 51,000 hectares.Reverse trendNow, with the trend starting to reverse, the tribal population is happy at their staple food making a comeback. Packets of powdered ragi are selling like hotcakes in cities like Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Rourkela. Encouraged by the demand for ragi, the tribals have again started cultivating millets.Earlier, over 50 types of millets were grown in the highlands of Odisha, especially in the southern and western regions. At present, only 12 to 13 varieties are cultivated. Efforts to collect lost millet species have already begun in Kandhamal, Rayagada, Koraput, Malkanagiri and some pockets of Nuapada and Balangir districts.It was Bhubaneswar-based NGO NIRMAN that took up the task of popularising the cereal by establishing seed banks, sharing knowledge with the community through learning sessions, and reviving millet-based farming systems.Today, as many as 30 millet varieties were collected in just one crop year. This was besides mixed crop being taken up. While reviving millet farming took a little push in Guma, the villagers response was spontaneous in pockets of Kalyansinghpur block of Rayagada district and Komna block of Nuapada district.Better market links also helped boost demand for millets, besides generating interest among farmers. Millets, once known as the poor mans grains, needs to be promoted in tribal pockets as it takes care of the nutritional requirement of the community where malnourishment is not uncommon. What is expected from the State government is a mechanical solution for cultivators when it comes to harvesting millets and adopting it in public distribution systems and midday meals, said Prasant Mohanty, member of the Millet Network of India (MINI).Millet MissionTaking note of the fresh interest in millets, the Odisha government has launched a Millet Mission in order to secure nutrition and mitigate droughts in the southern districts. The programme looks to improve the millet-based cropping system over nearly 30,000 acres in 30 blocks across seven districts. Also, the government wants to increase household consumption of millets by 25% to enhance household nutrition security and boost demand for millets.Sanjay Pani, an officer working with the programme, said it would be replicated in other areas if it achieved the desired objectives over the next five years. However, one year after it was announced, the programme is still awaiting budgetary provision.According to MINI activists, millets are very resilient when it comes to adapting to ecological conditions. It can be ideal in coping with climate change, they said.Ulladu Majhi of Tuakela village in Kandhamal district said, We never discarded our favourite grain. What is required is a helping hand from the government in ensuring steady supply of seeds and making the processing mechanised."

Of this 86,14,222 cards covering 3,23,23,108 people have been issued so far, Das Burma said in a written reply to a question from BJP MLA Dilip Ray The minister's reply showed that out of the 1,22,292 cardholders declared ineligible, maximum 12,592 cards were cancelled in Balangir district followed by 9,585 in Ganjam. Bargarh, Cuttack, Khurda and Sundergarh districts accounted for 8,000 cards each with Cuttack registering the minimum such cases - 1400.Each card entitles a beneficiary to 5kg of rice or wheat per month at Re 1 per kg. The cost of subsidised foodgrain is almost entirely borne by the central government. For one kg of rice the central assistance is to the tune of Rs 27.94, with the state providing Rs 2 and the remaining Re 1 borne by the beneficiary. In case of wheat, the Centre provides Rs 20 per kg, the minister said.Following the introduction of NFSA, the issue of ration cards had emerged as a major controversy amid allegations that the ruling dispensation had allowed ineligible candidates into the subsidy fold, bypassing the nine exclusion criteria, for political gains.Mounting public pressure sparked by demonstrations and dharnas forced the government to have a re-look into the beneficiary list. As many as 6,786 criminal cases were filed against ineligible cardholders for violating the Odisha Public Distribution (Control) Order 2016 and 353 persons, mostly women, were arrested.Sensing that police crackdown could invite severe political backlash, the government later decided not to initiate criminal action against the ineligible beneficiaries and announced its decision to withdraw the cases already registered.BJD insiders, meanwhile, said criminal cases against ineligible candidates and arrests of mostly women affected the party's chances at several places in the panchayat election"

The general refrain is that none of the government schools in Khagaul follow the government directives while serving meals to students as per the menu fixed for each day.A visit to these schools revealed that most of the schools do not have their separate kitchens to prepare meals. The cooks prepare midday meals under the trees. The condition of Kanya Vidyalaya at Chhoti Khagaul near Kacchi Talab is no different. ""The school has no separate kitchen for preparation of midday meal. As a result, the cooks prepare food for us under the shade of a tree,"" said a student of the school.The aggrieved students pointed out that the daily menu for meals was never followed in their schools. Even the cooks are not familiar with the menu. ""Tuesday's midday meal menu for government schools is 'jeera rice' and 'soybean'. However, we are being served simple rice, cauliflower as vegetable and watery pulse,"" they said.Even school in-charges or headmasters are not aware of the daily menu for midday meals. They order meals as per students' attendance. Interestingly, the government either supplies raw materials to schools or gives money to them to purchase it, sources said .The government had launched midday meal scheme with an aim to increase students' enrolment and check dropout rate in rural and semi-urban areas. ""It would be better if the government gives meal quota of rice and pulse free of cost to parents of the students. This would check unnecessary expenditure being incurred in the name of midday meals at government schools and we would provide quality food to our children at home,"" said a local.Danapur education officer Akhilesh Prasad Singh said he would look into the matter."

Residents can have a thali with two rotis, a bowl of dal, sabzi and rice each at just Rs 25.The government is now trying to introduce the scheme across all the bus stands in the state.Himachal Pradesh transport minister G S Bali had come up with the idea in view of frequent complaints from passengers travelling by Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) buses regarding overcharging at dhabas, where buses halted during the journey.Bali said after the success of Rajiv Thali scheme, the department is now aiming to provide quality food for passengers travelling by Volvo buses. ""Price would be bit higher for such passengers. At present, we are working to identify the places where the facility could be started for Volvo buses,"" he added.Initially, it was difficult for the transport department to find contractors to run the scheme who saw no or marginal profit. ""In the beginning, nobody had come forward, forcing us to issue the advertisement twice,"" the minister said.He claimed that the situation has now changed as they roped in an unemployed youth and cooperative societies to run the canteens. ""If a person sells 500 thalis in a day and save Rs 2 per plate, his daily income will be Rs 1,000,"" he added.""With the introduction of Rajiv Thali at identified bus stands of state, we have tried to end complaints of overcharging at dhabas. While running the scheme, we have only provided the required infrastructure to keep the thali price nominal,"" Bali told TOI.He said to ensure that quality food is served to people at these canteens, HRTC has provided space and HP Civil Supplies Corporation provided utensils under CSR initiative.Bali said customers are also provided packaged drinking water at Rs 5 on no-profit basis.

The traffic police have been booking cases against erring auto drivers for overloading, faulty meters, over speeding and other violations.Drivers have paid Rs 29 crore as traffic penalties in the last five years. Their compliance rate at over 80 % is better than two-wheeler riders with a compliance rate of 60 %.The huge number of seized autos forced the city traffic police to organise a Lok Adalat mela in 2016 which resulted in auto drivers paying Rs 1.50 crore, which is half the amount of the total pending penalties while the other half was waived off by the police.In wake of the two inci dents involving the tragic death of rice mill worker in Old City and another woman being dragged by auto at Attapur, traffic police has taken up a special drive against the errant auto drivers. ""We along with RTA officials are jointly starting a special drive against auto drivers from Monday .Public safety is the prime concern of the traffic police"" said deputy commissioner of police, traffic, A V Ranganath.Days after the tragic auto accident which took place at Shamsheergunj , the south zone police approached the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) with a request to install rubber speed breakers at busy crossroads. The south zone police and traffic cops conducted a joint inspection of the site of the accident. In due course, the observed that vehicles, especially autorickshaws, are moving at high speeds. The police have also found that it was due to overspeeding that the accused auto driver, Mohammed Mehtabuddin , was unable to control the vehicle after its front tyre came off which resulted in the instant death of daily wager A Jangaiah. Apart from this, the local public too requested cops to install speed breakers in the area and complained that many vehicles, including buses, drive on the wrong side of the road causing grave danger to the pedestrians."

In the spirit of traditional home-style cooking, members of the International Students' Association of JNU had prepared the dishes themselves.Cuisine of Armenia, South Korea, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Tibet, Thailand, Russia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Nepal and Syrian Arab Republic pampered the palate of students and staff, with the first stall put up and the first bestseller of the day being the momos prepared by Tibetan students. But Ghapama - pumpkin cooked with rice and dry fruits by Armenian students - quickly caught the attention of the eaters.Among the most popular was the South Korean stall with its live counter. From Korean-style sushi to Bibimbap (a unique rice and vegetables dish) and the innovative kimchi paratha, the food had people wanting more. Heejoo, an undergraduate student in the School of Languages, said, ""Our set menu tried to offer as many varieties of food as we generally have at home.""To add to the atmosphere, there was a sideshow of cultural performances from across the world, with students presenting songs and dances from their countries.There was also a stall belonging to Unnoticed JNU, which was selling salads and snacks, but also folders and hand-painted greeting cards. Unnoticed JNU is an NGO formed by students to take care of children of labourers working on the various construction sites on the campus. The NGO, which supports the kids in their education, collected a fair amount for their objective. And for many, that was as deeply satisfying as the piquant kimchi."

Soybean prices rose as delays in Brazilian farmer sales supported the market, while corn gained for a second session. The Chicago Board of Trade's most-active wheat contract has climbed 4.7 percent so far in February in what would be the strongest monthly rise since September 2015. Soybeans are at a similar level to the start of February and corn is up 2.7 percent for the month, its third consecutive monthly gain. The wheat market hit a near one-week low on Monday at $4.38 a bushel, pressured by a favourable outlook for northern hemisphere production. ""There should be some demand returning for U.S. wheat after the fall in prices that we have seen,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. ""But inventories where they are, there is not much upside potential."" Wheat prices have generally been buoyed by a U.S. Department of Agriculture forecast earlier this month for strong exports. Investors in the agriculture market will be closely watching a tender issued by Egypt's General Authority for Supply Commodities to buy an unspecified amount of wheat from global suppliers for shipment from April 1 to 10. Traders and analysts on Monday predicted moderate deliveries against CBOT March soy futures on Tuesday, the first notice day for deliveries against the contract. Commodity funds were net sellers of CBOT corn, wheat and soybean futures contracts on Monday, traders said. Estimates for fund sales of corn ranged from 8,000 to 16,000 contracts. Estimates for other commodities were tightly bunched.

MARKET NEWS * The dollar was steady early on Tuesday, enjoying support after U.S. President Donald Trump flagged a big boost in government stimulus, and sought a ""historic"" increase in military spending. * U.S. crude oil edged higher for a second day on Tuesday, underpinned by high compliance with OPEC's production cuts even as the market remains anchored by rising U.S. production. * U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Monday and the Dow closed at a record high for a 12th straight session.

58f569127be9e01a17c99745,"Murder for gain, not in rage",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/murder-for-gain-not-in-rage/articleshow/57048765.cms,2017-02-09,"BANKURA/BHOPAL: Triple-murder suspect Udyan Das may have killed live-in partner Akansha Sharma for a mere Rs 1 lakh, and not in an insane moment of jealousy, police in Bankura said on Wednesday.Udyan wasn't fazed by the hours of interrogation and was in a chatty mood, especially after relishing a Bengali menu of sukto, egg curry, pumpkin curry and dal-rice, say sources in police. He refuses to speak to anyone apart from ""senior officers"" at Bankura Sadar police station Realising that he is a master manipulator investigators are taking his ""confessions"" with a bucket of salt but they are pretty sure he kills for gain, not out of impulse.An officer said they have ""clinching evidence"" that Udyan had become restless after blowing up, in just two years, all the money he made out of selling his parents' Raipur property after their murder.""He knew that his father had Rs 8 lakh as fixed deposit in a bank. He called up the bank manager at Raipur and even shifted his father's accounts to Bhopal. But the bank kept denying him the money. We suspect it was around this time that he decided to convince Akansha to transfer her money to him by bringing her to Bhopal,"" an investigator said.Police say Akansha's account is left with Rs 9 though it had Rs 1.20 lakh when she left her home on June 29 last year. ""This shows Udyan had managed to access her account. The murder-for-gain theory thus finds much more credence,"" an investigating officer explained.Udyan visited Rajasthan and Delhi frequently after 2012 to meet Akansha. Call record details indicate she visited Bhopal a number of times, said police, adding that Udyan had ""ecstatically"" marked these occasions on the calendar with red ink. This revelation, too, raises question marks about the motive of the murder.""Thus the very claim by Udyan that he killed Akansha after he found out that she was still talking to her former boyfriends holds little ground. Call record details and messages on Akansha's mobile before June 29, 2016, do not show the existence of any secret admirer,"" said an officer.The plan to murder Akansha was not taken at the spur of the moment, police say. ""Udyan was addicted to crime thrillers. He watched the 2013 film 'Devil's Knot' several times and used the same methodology to kill Akansha,"" said Bankura SP Sukhendu Hira.Udyan was questioned at the SP's office over the last two days. ""He did not break down even once during the interrogation. He even tried to lead us astray, saying he'd love to complete his higher studies. He ate egg curry with glee and loved all the Bengali dishes served to him thus far  rice with sukto, pumpkin curry and dal,"" said a source.Police say there was a complex world that Udyan had created for himself  where he would spend lavishly and didn't care for anyone but himself. He had no real friend all through his school life. ""He was always teased for being short and dark-skinned. His mother pushed him into engineering although he liked arts, leading to his failing Class XI. This led to more teasing by schoolmates. Udyan believed that the only way he could stop his parents and the outside world from rebuking him was to get rich at any cost,"" said an officer.It was this mentality that led Udyan to create over 110 fake email and Facebook accounts. ""He would note down the email IDs and passwords and then use them to comment on his own posts. He even posted likes from different accounts just to portray that he was successful and accepted in life,"" said a source."

Corn edged up from a more than a two-month low, while corn prices also climbed. The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade advanced 0.46 percent to $9.76 a bushel. They closed down 0.44 percent on Monday, having marked their weakest since Oct. 17 at $9.68-1/4 a bushel. ""You can't escape fundamentals, and the reality is that without a change in supply, you won't see much upside beyond the odd bit of bargain-buying,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. Large South American production this season has stoked expectations of ample global supply, while U.S. farmers are expected to sow larger amounts of the oilseed next season. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to predict U.S. soybean plantings for 2017 will rise nearly 5 million from 2016. Analysts polled by Reuters expected the USDA in the same report to show stockpiles of U.S. wheat, corn and soybeans as of March 1 larger than at the same point in 2016. The most active corn futures advanced 0.3 percent to $3.56-3/4 a bushel, having ended the last session down 0.14 percent. On Monday, they touched their lowest since Jan. 12 at $3.54-1/4 a bushel. Corn seedings were forecast at 90.969 million acres, down by about 3 million acres. The most active wheat futures rose 0.12 percent to $4.21-1/4 a bushel. They closed down 0.9 percent on Monday when prices hit their lowest since Feb. 1 at $4.18-1/4 a bushel.

However, based on the complaints and requests received it was decided to make representation to the central government to increase the quota of rice. The central government agreed to give additional quota of rice to the state, and since September, the quantity of rice given to the families was doubled. In reply to a question, Radadiya said that earlier when the state used to supply 1.76 lakh metric tonnes of food grains under the act, the same since September has increased to 1.86 lakh metric tonnes. He said that against the allocation of 16.21 lakh metric tonnes, the state has till December distributed 16.20 lakh metric tonnes of food grains. In another reply, the government said that in Ahmedabad alone the government has given tur dal at Rs 60 per kg. In Ahmedabad city 89.16 metric tons of tur dal was distributed to 89,162 families."

Every year, he leases land and cultivates three or four kinds of rice and vegetables. At 63, he says all his enthusiasm seems to be draining because of the hardships. ""There are challenges for farmers. Everybody wants to eat 'safe' food. Not all can take up large scale cultivation. If there is practical support from government departments, I would like to continue. The last three years haven't been so.""This year, he has cultivated four varieties of paddy . He goes all the way to Wayanad to collect original rice seeds and now has his own.""Only half the produce has been processed.There are very few good rice mills where I can also be assured that my organic rice will not become inorganic by the time it is out of the mill.""Farmers, be they paddy cultivators or horticulturists, all face the problem of marketing their produce. ""I call up friends and through word of mouth, I carry and sell the produce.Since it is completely organic, many people trust me. This is not how it should be,"" he said.Shankar C V , a horticulturist from Palak kad said that the government has announced the Participatory Guarantee System (PGS). It should be adopted for organic certification, but that's not been happening. ""It helps clusters of farmers. According to the PGS programme, the principal agriculture office will act as the regional council and they will monitor the farms,'' said Shankar.The officials of the agriculture department are expected to check whether the farmer is following organic cultivation and issue a certificate which can help them sell produce at a higher price. ""We don't get any support from our agriculture department. They are too busy with their paperwork. Some officers are helpful. They connect us to prospective buyers. But let's hope something will happen when the Kerala brand is launched,"" said Johnny Xavier , a farmer from Ernakulam.Shortage of labour, difference in land patterns and hence lack of uniformity in production costs is a huge challenge for farmers.""There's no proper definition for organic produce. The state's farm lands have different patterns. It depends on the kind of farming also. But before the consumer, they are all the same. This is a huge challenge we face,"" said Arun, another farmer."

The 2,000- year-old artefacts recovered at the Limb village talk of a cultural continuity that has seeped into the present era, believe the excavators. Major findings include a coin from the Satavahana period , fragments of jewellery and pots besides rice grains and pulses.The diggings, which began on December 20 last year, came to an end in early February. Amit Pendam, research assistant at the Deccan College, led a team of three PhD scholars and 49 MA students from the college, thus exposing the aspiring archaeologists to essential fieldwork. Anita Agashe, Indology researcher from the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapeeth, was co-director of the project.The excavation site was located on the banks of the River Krishna, where three trenches of 5X5 metres were laid. A major and only numismatic find was a coin from the Satavahana period, which helped in dating the artefacts more accurately.""The lead coin is comparatively rare to find as silver and copper ones were common. One side of the coin is inscribed with the name of the King in the Brahmi script, 'Rayosri Satakarni' and on the other is a swastika and an elephant,"" Pendam added.The team found brick structures which were probably part of a house from either the first or second century AD, fragments of shell bangles worn by women and a common feature across country from early historic period were available. Beads of stone, glass and areca nut shaped beads made of terracotta were found as well.""The flooring was laid with brickbats at first and a layer of lime and husk was placed on top of it. We also stumbled across fragments of globular pot made of red ware and red slip ware which was in all likelihood used to store grains. Also, miniature bowls made of black and red ware were found at the site,"" Pendam added.Speaking on choosing the site after preliminary exploration, Pendam shared that there are many 17th and 18th century Peshwa temples in the area.The excavation has yielded close to six gunny backs of pots, besides cattle bones and grains of rice and pulses. The samples are currently being analysed by archaeo-botanists to shed more light on what the villagers then ate and grew, besides suggesting domestication of cattle in the area.Vasant Shinde, vice-chancellor of Deccan College, said, ""The findings will help in reconstructing and understanding the culture of the people. The retrieved pots suggest that the technique employed in making them 2,000 years ago hasn't changed today. Even the crop pattern seems to have remained unchanged, grains of rice, sorgum, cotton, millet and wheat have been found, which are still grown and consumed in the region. Cattle bones indicate domestication was common, but further analysis is required to determine if cattle was consumed by the people in the region or not."""

Wheat edged away from a one-month low touched in the previous session, while corn prices were unchanged. The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade had fallen 0.22 percent to $10.03-3/4 a bushel by 0240 GMT. That was near their weakest since Jan. 11 at $10.03, marked earlier in the session. ""All the news points to really good South American (soy) production, which means there is a lot of kicking around globally,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. Increased South American production comes as U.S. farmers are expected to plant more soybeans next season, adding to global inventories. Private analytics firm Informa Economics raised its 2017 U.S. soybean plantings forecast to 88.7 million acres, from 88.647 million in January. The most active wheat futures rose 0.23 percent to $4.31-1/2 a bushel. They closed down 2 percent on Monday, after hitting their weakest since Feb. 9 at 4.30 a bushel. Despite edging higher, wheat remains under pressure from forecasts for beneficial rains for U.S. crops. The Commodity Weather Group said updated forecasts raised the likelihood of much-needed rain in the U.S. Southern Plains, although showers could miss some dry areas. The most active corn futures were little changed at $3.60-3/4 a bushel. They closed down 0.9 percent in the previous session, when prices marked their lowest since Feb. 1 at $3.60-1/2. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported export inspections of U.S. corn in the latest week at 1,547,022 tonnes, at the high end of a range of trade expectations. Private analytics firm Informa Economics raised its projection of U.S. 2017 corn plantings to 90.8 million acres, from its January forecast of 90.5 million, trade sources said.

When asked about the missing seven kg of sugar in each bag, they had no answer.But they privately admitted that they received the sugar bags from the common pool of the State-run warehouses and were directed to sell them without raising such queries.As the news of underweight distribution of sugar spread, the ration card holders sent complaints about the irregularities to Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam MLA P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan through the complaint boxes he has installed in his constituency.MLA visits outletsThe MLA visited a couple of ration shops and inquired with the salesmen, the people said.He assured the consumers that he would take up the issue with higher officials.When contacted, an official at District Supply Office said they would look into the complaints as they had designated squads to check such issues.Out of the 9,47,177 valid family cards in the district, 84,610 were eligible to get sugar, 7,98,267 rice and other commodities.

Rice now costs Rs 56 a kg, the highest ever, while prices of products like cashew, sugar, pepper have also increased sharply.Raw rice, which could be had at Rs 47 a kg in the wholesale market in January 2015, cost Rs 56 on Tuesday, a jump of nearly 19%. The price of sugar rose from Rs 31 a kg to Rs 43 a kg, a rise of nearly 39%, while that of cashew soared by a massive 84% over the two-year period. Retail prices were nearly 5% more. Ghee prices too have climbed steeply by nearly 25% in the past week -from Rs 5,300 for a 15 kg tin to Rs 6,500 a tin. ""This is an unprecedented rise in one week,"" said a trader.""I have never seen such a pathetic condition in the delta (Cauvery delta) in the last 65 years,"" S Ranganathan, general secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Association , told TOI. This is the first time in many years that the southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon have failed and there have been many farm sui cides. On an average, 83 lakh tonnes of paddy are cultivated in the delta. ""This time, I will be happy if it's 35 lakh-40 lakh tonnes,"" Ranganathan said, adding that the yield could be poor even in areas ready for harvest. The erratic rainfall in Karnataka has further fuelled prices that can only be tamed, say traders, by releasing rice from the strategic reserves and increasing supply through the Public Distribution System (PDS). ""There is limited scope for a further increase in rice prices,"" one trader said, but added that if speculative buying set in, the price of the staple food could touch Rs 60 a kg this summer.Last year was the driest monsoon in Tamil Nadu since 1901, with a deficit of nearly 65%, forcing the government to declare, early last month, all the 32 districts ""drought hit"".Sugar prices are firm too. ""This year has been a good one for sugar mills. Prices are firm. But next fiscal could be a problem as the area under cultivation is falling due to drought in Tamil Nadu,"" said N Srinivasan , finance director of the Murugappa group. Several mills expect a shortfall in domestic production next fiscal, paving the way for imports."

While a probe into the case and arrests have been progressing in fits and starts, it has emerged that the rot that resulted in the lack of progress into the investigations began at home, within the forest and police departments.Multiple sources confirmed at least one field level officer of the forest department as well as the police department have been acting as moles for the gang of poachers who now officially include Akbar Khan , a powerful local ruling TRS leader from Mahadevpur More shocking was the admission by a senior officer in the forest department that some officers had got calls from TRS leaders in the government to go slow on the probe. This was confirmed by another official in the department.The confirmation of the moles came after two raids since this Sunday by a top forest department official ended with the teams returning empty handed. All it took was the 10 or so minutes lead time in both cases, the raid on Akbar Khan's residence in Mahadevpur on Sunday and the one on the house where Gattaiah , one of the new additions to the list of accused in the case, also in Mahadevpur, on Monday.The raids were led by additional principal chief conservator of forests Swargam Srinivas who has been in the area since Sunday. On Monday, a raid on the house where Gattaiah lived that began with a 10-minute lead time, resulted in officials finding a locked door. However, a mobile phone soon rang from in the house that brought Gattaiah's wife rushing from a neighbour's house. It was learnt that officials overheard a man's voice asking her if 'the things from the other day' have been removed from the house. She told officials that she had been away from the house for more than an hour. It is learnt that officials, who found rice being cooked on a live stove lay bare her story. On Sunday too, it was the same case with Akbar Khan's house being locked and when officials called his wife - the local ZPTC member - on her phone, she came but 'failed' to provide any information on her husband's whereabouts. Officials did not find anything related to the poaching incident in the house during their inspection."

The mid-day meal is served to 63.5 lakh school children in the state.According to officials, a meeting to this effect was recently held in Delhi and modalities of introducing this are being worked out. In Rajasthan double fortified salt and fortified oil have already been introduced in the mid-day meal programme. The school authorities have been directed to procure fortified salt and oil from the nearest Annapurna Bhandar.Fortification, especially of food items like wheat flour, oil and milk are considered to be a good strategy to reduce dietary deficiencies as per capita consumption of wheat, milk and oil is higher than the average consumption in India. Hence, these are good vehicles for fortification.Following the Copenhagen Consensus in 2008, fortification of food was given top priority in fight against malnutrition compared to other alternatives like nutritional supplements and dietary diversification.However, there is some procedural problem in introducing fortified wheat flour in the mid- day meal programme. The wheat and rice supplied for mid-day meal is done under the National Food Safety Scheme . The Food Corporation of India (FDI) supplies wheat and rice to schools directly and they locally process the wheat. Since local fortification of wheat is not a viable option, the government has to find a way to supply fortified wheat flour to the schools instead of wheat.National programme of Mid-Day Meal in Schools (MDMS) is a flagship programme of the Government of India aiming at enhancing enrolment, retention and attendance and simultaneously improving nutritional levels among children studying in government, local body and government-aided primary and upper primary schools across the country."

58f573b37be9e01a357a0f25,"Shrikhand-Puri, Pulihora and Meethi Tahiri to usher in the new Year",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/gudi-padwa-ugadi-cheti-chand-food/articleshow/57853651.cms,2017-03-28,"Besides the symbolic gudhi, traditional flavours play a key role in the Gudhi Padwa observances. For other communities also ushering in the new year this week, new beginnings are all about traditional food that celebrates myriad flavours, imitating life. We visit their kitchens to take stock of these traditions...Pen and pad in hand, youngsters Sanat and Shaunak Sarpotdar stand on the verandah of their 82-year-old family guest house overlooking Laxmi Road. They are finalising the Gudhi Padwa menu. This time, the young guns of the Sarpotdar family have taken it upon themselves to plan the naivedya (foodoffered as part of worship) and traditional fare that will be partaken of by family, friends and guests.The New Year is no time to compromise, so they've decided on 'paanch pakwan', a medley of five sweets. ""There's gulab jamun, shrikhand, basundi, jilebi and aamras. These are traditional, but the sweets might vary across households,"" informs Sanat. Why five, we ask. ""It's symbolic of a true feast; the fact that there's more than one sweet being offered today,"" Shaunak replies.Sanat's mother, Sadhana, has prepared the aamras specially using payri mangoes. ""This cultivar is pulpy and easy to digest, hence it is ideal for aamras, but some may use the hapus variety too,"" says Sadhana, who insists that the aamras should contain traces of mango bits for added texture. Fresh mango pickle, kairichi dal (prepared using soaked split Bengal gram, raw mango and condiments) and kairi panhe (cooling raw mango juice enhanced with spices and jaggery) are other preparations that will feature at the guest house on Gudhi Padwa.Kothrud resident Shilpa Bhide, who specialises in Maharashtrian cooking, explains one of the reasons why mangoes might find place on the table on the propitious day. ""The season for the king of fruits begins around this time, and especially in the Konkan region, the mango is a staple fruit. It's believed that there's no better prasad one can offer God,"" says Shilpa. Many households also prepare amrakhand (mango shrikhand), consciously incorporating the seasonal fruit into the day's menu. Shilpa adds that puran (a chickpea-jaggery mixture, enhanced with cardamom, saffron and nutmeg) is also a must during celebrations, which is why puran poli enjoys equal place on the table. ""It was customary for my grandmother to ready a katori of puran and kheer to offer for naivedya,"" adds Shilpa.But the neem chutney, or kadulimba is at the core of the meal. Sadhana says, ""It is made using new neem leaves, jaggery, tamarind, chillies and salt, and is considered a blood purifier."" Shilpa adds that some homes don't make this chutney. Each family member will then consume a neem leaf after praying. ""The leaves are bitter, so as children, we dreaded this ritual, but my grandmother would insist we each had a leaf,"" she quips.NIBM area resident Kavitadevi Vangala, her husband Hanuman and son Vishal are busy readying their home ahead of Ugadi, the New Year of the Telugu and Kannadiga communities, that falls on Wednesday. Besides the preparations, there's much to be done for the naivedya alone.Ugadi pachhadi is a key offering, synonymous with the festival, Kavitadevi tells us. ""This rich brown concoction is made with six ingredients or 'shaddruchi' (six tastes)  neem flowers, raw mango, fresh jaggery, fresh tamarind, salt and green chillies. It is enhanced with fresh coconut and bananas. The bitter, sweet, sour and other tastes of these elements come together, symbolising life's happy and all other moments we must embrace,"" says Kavitadevi. Her family will begin the day with a spoonful of this mixture post the prayers. Other traditional dishes that will be offered as naivedya comprise pulihora (tamarind rice), a rice/semya payasam, garelu (udid vadas), and boorelu (balls of puran dipped in an udid dal-rice batter and deep-fried).Like the Ugadi pachhadi, the Kannadigas prepare a similar offering, minus the spices, calling it bevu-bella. Fatima Nagar resident Chandrika Rao says, ""It's a simple mixture of tender neem leaves and powdered jaggery, offered to God."" After prayers, the mixture is distributed among the family. Chandrika adds that a feast on a banana leaf is customary during the New Year. ""The meal comprises a traditional pickle, two types of kosambari (South Indian salads), two vegetables, a vegetable gravy, rice, papad, bhajiyas, dal and payasam. All this needs to be served following a certain order, starting with salt, leading up to rice and dal that is topped with ghee,"" she informs. Puran poli is something that Chandrika will also make for her family.For the city's Sindhi community, Cheti Chand on Wednesday will begin with a journey to the river banks, with a portion of meethi tahiri (a sweet rice dish cooked with sugar, water and ghee).

Corn and soybean prices rose in early Asian trade, although gains were limited by bumper South American supplies. FUNDAMENTALS * Dry weather for hard red winter wheat growing regions in the United States is supporting wheat prices with forecast rains later this week unlikely to provide much moisture, analysts said. * The dollar stayed on the defensive in Asia with bulls still nursing a grudge after the Federal Reserve's rate guidance last week proved to be less ""hawkish"" than many had wagered on. * A weakening U.S. dollar, which makes U.S. commodities more attractive to overseas buyers as well as investors looking for a hedge against inflation, provided some support to grains and oilseeds. * Abundant supplies and the prospects for strong South American harvests of soybeans and corn limited gains. * Argentine corn and soybeans should benefit from high yields brought by good weather, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said last week, adding it might increase its soybean harvest estimate. * Workers at Argentina's biggest agricultural port hub, Rosario, have voted to hold a 24-hour strike on March 30 to demand better wages and an end to dismissals, a union leader said Saturday. * The stoppage will likely affect the shipment of grains and their by-products from global food supplier Argentina, where companies such as Cargill , Bunge and Louis Dreyfus have their own terminals. * Large speculators switched to a net short position in Chicago Board of Trade corn futures in the week to March 14, regulatory data released on Friday showed. * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly commitments of traders report also showed that noncommercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their net short position in CBOT wheat and cut their net long position in soybeans. MARKET NEWS * Asian stocks were slightly weaker early on Monday, following Wall Street's declines and the G20's decision to drop a pledge to avoid trade protectionism.

After all, India is pre-dominantly an agrarian society, and festivals associated with farming culture are many.Anita Shetye from Porvorim says: ""Gudhi Padawa is one of the most auspicious of occasions. It is not only a religious festival, but marks the commencement of spring. Neem leaves, a mango leaves and a garland of red flowers are tied to the tip of a long bamboo on which a copper pot is placed in the inverted position.""Some even tie a coconut on the threshold of their homes to protect to members of the family from evil spirits.There are also a number of traditions that deviate from the ordinary associated with the observance, of which shisharanni of Asali and Vaizawadi in Canacona is one that stands out.In this, rice is cooked in an earthen pot on a traditional three-stone fire stove, only here three heads substitute the stones! Shisharanni is held once every three years.Then there is the dinya zatra that is celebrated by unmarried tribal Velip youth. They dance around the Mallikarjun temple holding a staff fashion out of the dina (Leea indica) plant. In the community, participation in the dance is mandatory.There is also the bathing of the symbolic representation of the clan's ancestor, locally known as 'purush', which is followed in many parts of the state.Food is an important aspect of this festival too, and Shreya Kelkar of Latambarcem in Bicholim says, ""According to beliefs, whatever you prepare and eat on this day will set the tone for the upcoming year's culinary fare, which is why all Hindu families prepare a delicious spread.""Post the feasting, in some parts of Goa there is a custom of reading the annual almanac (panchang) in the evening. The villagers gather in the temple hall where the village priest reads out predictions related to the weather, eclipses, and shares information on auspicious times (muhurta)."

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly Commitment of Traders report, released after the close of the market on Friday, showed speculators expanded their net long position in CBOT corn futures to nearly 81,000 contracts in the week to Feb. 14, their biggest net long since July. Traders await fresh acreage forecasts from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual outlook forum this week. U.S. wheat was bypassed in an international tender on Friday when Egypt's state grain buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 360,000 tonnes of lower-priced Russian, Ukrainian and Romanian wheat. India's wheat imports from Russia, France and Ukraine could come to a halt after March, as New Delhi has asked exporters to fumigate their cargoes with methyl bromide, an insect control gas banned in Europe and the Black Sea region. Currently, food shipments are fumigated at India's ports. After March 31, the plant quarantine authority will only accept cargoes fumigated with methyl bromide at the country of export.

Care has been taken that this does not cause any hardship to ration card holders, who are being given the prescribed ration.Shop owners woesMohammed Isaq, an owner of a ration shop in Kenya village, said no allocation of rice has been made to his shop this month as the entire 99 quintals of rice have been deducted. The authorised cyber centre is delaying scanning the barcodes of food coupons. I do not have rice for the card holders in my area, he said.Similar is the grouse of Satish and his brother, Kumudakshi, who owns another ration shop in Kenya village. Satish said that of the125 quintals, the shop has been allocated only 35 quintals of rice.B.M. Shivaji, from Kotekar Beeri, said he has been allocated only 59 quintals, while P.M. Ismail, from Pavoor Harekala, said he has been allocated only 36 quintals.Timely uploadDeputy Director of Food and Civil Supplies Jayappa said the system of issuing ration based on food coupons was being implemented only in 126 of the 468 ration shops in district. The owners of ration shops are duty bound to upload details of food coupons in time.Apart from select authorised cyber centres, details of food coupons can be uploaded at the taluk office and also at the office of Assistant Director Food and Civil Supplies.As the owners have failed in uploading details, the allocation was reduced for about 15 shops.Cardholders not affectedHowever, Mr. Jayappa said care has been taken that this does not in anyway affect the cardholders who are receiving ration. Steps were being taken to ensure that details of food coupons of these 15 shops were uploaded to the system, he said."

If all parties are willing, the meeting will be held on Wednesday.The LDF which met here had a detailed discussion on the drought situation. Revenue minister E Chandrasekharan who attended the meeting as a special invitee briefed the leaders about the gravity of situation. The LDF asked government to initiate steps to rejuvenate all sources of drinking water in the state. ""We are facing the worst drought in a century . Government initiatives alone can't solve the crisis.Local self-government institutions should unite all people and work towards relief measures,"" LDF convener Vaikom Viswan said. The LDF state committee appealed the Union government to provide maximum help.Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac , who attended the meeting, painted a bleak picture of state's finances in front of the leadership.He said the hopes the state are pin ned on the GST regime which will be ushered in soon. However, Isaac said, the forthcoming budget will be in line with the principles upheld by the LDF .Transport minister A K Saseendran apprised the meeting of the situation faced by KSRTC. The LDF endorsed Saseendran's views and asked the government to take initiative for providing salary and pension without fail to corporation employees. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government was waiting for expert Sushil Khanna's report and once that is submitted, steps will be initiated to bring KSRTC on track.The growing tension between CPM and CPI was raised in the meeting by JD(S) nominees K Krishnankutty and C K Nanu. But, there was no discussion on the issue. Later, Vaikom Viswan said two parties might differ on a number of issues and whenever there were issues they would sort it out themselves, hinting that there would be mutual discussion between CPM and CPI.The LDF also decided to celebrate the 60th anniversary of first LDF government. The first LDF government came to power in the state on April 5, 1957. A week-long programme, starting on April 5, to celebrate the diamond jubilee of EMS government will be organized in the state."
58f578c57be9e01a17c9a998,Worms in rice stump Gadag residents,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hubballi/worms-in-rice-stump-gadag-residents/articleshow/57725097.cms,2017-03-20,"HUBBALLI: Hundreds of people of Betageri town in Gadag district were in for a shock on Saturday. They found worms in the rice supplied under the Karnataka government's Anna Bhagya scheme through a fair price shop in the town.No less than 50 families -comprising labourers, farmers and the underprivileged -complained that rice was infested with worms and pebbles, and found it difficult to sift them through. On learning about the incident, offi cials of the food and civil supplies department rushed to the shop and recalled the spoilt bags. They supplied grains afresh to all the families. Under Anna Bhagya scheme, each underserved family gets 515 kg of rice, depending on its size. This is not the first time such complaints have surfaced in the state. Ratna , a resident of Betageri, bought provisions from the fair price shop (No. 46) and discovered live worms while cleaning the grains. ""I checked with neighbours who also bought rice from the same shop. They confirmed the presence of worms and stones in rice,"" she added.Another resident, Parvati, said the quality of rice was bad, and she needed to clean it at least thrice in clear water.""In these times of crisis when we get water once a month, where do we get quality water,"" she said.According to residents, the entire lot of 125 quintals was of low quality and full of worms. Gadag's deputy director of food and civil supplies, Ashok Kalghatagi, told TOI: ""On receiving complaints, we visited the shop and found the grains were of indifferent quality . We have since withdrawn the stock. Also, five bags of rice supplied from Gadag godown of the Food Corporation of India had worms in them. This could have happened due to an increase in moisture.""The officer said his department will periodically assess the quality of grains at fair price shops, and promised action against licence-holder RM Putti for supplying rice with worms."
58f5793d7be9e01a357a157d,Battle against hunger under a flyover,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/battle-against-hunger-under-a-flyover/articleshow/57588355.cms,2017-03-11,"CHARMINAR: As the sun beats down on bikers speeding down Dabeerpura flyover, the story under the bridge is different. A shatranji - a thick woven cloth - tessellates its stone-paved flooring. Plates are arranged and soon over a hundred poor men and women are served rice and lentils The barefoot man serving them is Azhar Maqsusi , founder of 'Hunger Has No Religion' campaign.Azhar, who runs a small plaster of Paris (PoP) business, has a small office in Dabeerpura. It is from here he manages the campaign.""There are two places in the city, Dabeerpura and Gandhi Hospital , where we serve food for free,"" he says. Azhar keeps count on days of his campaign. ""It has been 1,731 days under the Dabeerpura flyover and 525 days at Gandhi hospital,"" he said.Azhar, who was featured on a popular television programme with superstar Amitabh Bachchan , is no stranger to poverty. He has felt the pangs of hunger. ""My father, who was an auto rickshaw driver, died when I was just four. With the sole breadwinner of the family gone, there have been several days when my five siblings, mother and I had no food or water. All of us lived in a cramped room in Bagh-e-Jahaan Aara ,"" he says.The idea to set up a daily free food camp was born after Azhar saw a destitute at Dabeerpura station writhing in pain. He later found she was hungry for several days. ""I still remember her name. She was Laxmi. That is when I decided to do something. Every day, I would feed the hungry,"" he said. He would often sell PoP raw material to buy rice to make food packets. Five years later, he feeds as many as 140 people under the Dabeerpura flyover and up to 250 near Gandhi Hospital. He's not alone. Azhar also gets help from Good Samaritans. ""A few years ago, an NRI who took a wrong turn chanced upon the camp. I was told he later made inquiries. After being satisfied, he started donating 15 bags of rice. This continued for many years."" His Facebook friends too have been of great help, so much so that Azhar claims the campaign could not have worked without them.His new 'Do Roti' campaign urges professionals, students and others to carry two rotis wherever they go and give it to those in need at traffic signals and other places. ""This is to discourage children from begging at traffic signals. Hopefully, it will have an impact,"" Azhar says."

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.5 percent to $4.45-3/4 a bushel, after earlier touching their lowest since Feb. 21 at $4.45-1/2 a bushel. Wheat closed down 1.2 percent on Friday. * The most active soybeans futures rose 0.22 percent to $10.26-1/2 a bushel, having firmed 1.3 percent on Friday. * The most active corn futures were little changed at $3.63-3/4, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. * Weekly data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed non-commercial traders in the week to Feb. 14 built their biggest net long since July in corn, and the second-biggest since July in soybeans. * Argentina will likely harvest a record 18.3 million tonnes of wheat from the 2016/17 crop, 11 to 11.5 million tonnes of which could be exported, Agriculture Minister Ricardo Buryaile said. * The U.S. government projected a 7 percent decline in corn production in the 2017/18 marketing year to 14.065 billion bushels, but ending stocks were expected to remain burdensome at more than 2 billion bushels. MARKET NEWS * The euro got off to an unusually quiet start in Asia on Monday, having posted its worst weekly performance in three months, as investors await more developments and ratings downgrades from Europe. * Brent oil prices edged up on Monday and were set to rise for five out of seven sessions as a global supply glut appears to ease, but rising U.S. production limited gains.

All seven organic rice brands tested by CERC, were found to have heavy metals, copper and lead, but these were within the safe limits.Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) suggests that short-term exposure to chlorpyrifos can cause changes in behavior or sleeping patterns, mood changes, and effects on the nerves and/or muscles in the limbs.Contrary to the findings, the packaging of most products carried claims such as 'pesticide-free', 'free from chemicals and toxic substances', among others, which are misleading, the study concluded.""The very rationale for buying an organic product is to buy a product free of pesticides and chemicals. Moreover, consumers pay a premium for organic products and despite this, they don't get the proper quality. This is because there are no standards to govern the production and sale of organic food products,"" said Pritee Shah, chief general manager, CERC.In the past, CERC urged the Bureau of Indian Standards and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to formulate standards for organic products through a representation.CERC further emphasized that the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) certification be made mandatory for organic products and not just processes.""Currently, NPOP certifies organic process standards; but it should also certify the final product. While we do encourage promoting consumption of organic products, manufacturers and regulatory authorities must ensure that consumers get quality products. India also needs to follow labelling norms according to global best-practices in the interest of consumers,"" added Shah."

The prices will also be impacted by various activities resulting in a spike in consumption of certain products,"" said a senior government officials quoting the survey report.""The prices of essential commodities and electricity charges are rising but the government is not able to bridge the gap between the increasing cost of life and wages or salaries to the workers and labour of the unorganised sector,"" said Ch Narasinga Rao from CPM party."

The 20kg of rice that was given free to cardholders every month, has now been reduced to 10 kg.Poor people are being forced to take wheat instead of rice, he said, adding that several newspapers had written about the issue.Citing reports, he said the reason for shortage was the failure of the government to place procurement tenders on time. It is the bounden duty of the state government to ensure unhindered supply of essential items, especially in a drought year, the PIL said."

A recent boost in organic farming and awareness on nature care has led to an increase in demand for bamboo rice. To meet the growing demand in the coastal region, the dealers have started procuring bamboo rice through tribals and forest dwellers in Madhya Pradesh. Bamboo rice is sold at Rs 600 per kg at selected shops in Mangaluru.Speaking to TOI, K P Bhat, proprietor of Kudilinga Grameena Naturals, said that bamboo rice is the best gift of nature enriched with many medicinal properties. ""I am procuring bamboo rice through tribals in Madhya Pradesh and supplying here. Initially, a very few people preferred bamboo rice, but now I have a customer-base of over 400 families in Mangaluru who purchase it regularly,"" said Bhat, who promotes the medicinal values of bamboo rice through exhibitions and festivals related to agriculture and organic farming in and around Mangaluru.Hailing from Yethadka in Kasaragod district of Kerala, Bhat started promoting bamboo rice through exhibitions four years ago. He says that consumption of bamboo rice in prescribed quantity can keep doctors away.""It is said to be a very good medicine for neck pain, back pain and effective in the treatment of diabetes and other ailments. Hundred grams of bamboo rice contains 60 grams of carbohydrates, 265 kilo calorie of energy and zero fat. One need not take a large quantity of bamboo rice every day. Consumption of three grams of bamboo rice per day in empty stomach with water or same quantity along with regular rice is sufficient as it has high medicinal values. People in Mangaluru are realizing the importance of bamboo rice. I get more enquiries on my phone (9446961202) and through my exhibition stalls,"" said Bhat, who recently showcased the bamboo rice at an organic farming fair organized by the horticulture department in Mangaluru."

Corn edged lower, while soybeans also fell despite signs of strong demand for U.S. supplies. The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade rose 0.3 percent to $4.59-3/4 a bushel by 0258 GMT, having closed up 1.1 percent on Monday when prices hit $4.62-1/2 a bushel, the highest since Feb. 16. Wheat was supported by dry conditions hampering crop development in the U.S. Plains, traders said. Concerns are increasing about the early emergence of U.S. winter wheat, which would leave the crop vulnerable to a cold snap in the next few weeks. ""The forecasters expect little rain and unseasonably warm temperatures for the next week or so in U.S. hard red winter wheat regions,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""The hard red winter crop still has time on its side but a consistent rise in night temperatures would transform the lack of moisture from a worry to a problem."" Wheat also drew support from signs of growing demand for U.S. supplies. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Monday reported that weekly export inspections of wheat totalled 535,920 tonnes, near the high end of market forecasts. Wheat has been under sustained pressure in recent months amid ample global supplies, though major exporters are likely to see reduced production next season. Australia's 2017/18 wheat crop is expected to fall 32 percent on drier conditions, the country's chief commodity forecaster said on Monday. Farmers in the world's No. 4 exporter will harvest 23.98 million tonnes of wheat, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture, Resource Economics and Rural Sciences forecast. The most active corn futures fell 0.1 percent to $3.78-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.6 percent in the previous session. The most active soybean futures fell 0.1 percent to $10.36 a bushel, having closed little changed on Monday. Soybean export inspections were a bigger-than-expected 921,779 tonnes. Dry weather improved conditions on a rugged Amazon road that serves as the key link between soy fields and northern ports, ending an immense backlog of trucks carrying the beans, the Army said on Monday.

Malayalis are going all out to come to the rescue of their feathered friends this summer,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/hurrah-malayalis-are-going-all-out-to-come-to-the-rescue-of-their-feathered-friends-this-summer/articleshow/57430370.cms,2017-03-03,"It was around mid-February this year that Prasad Dalithan, a freelance film editor from Palakkad, noticed birds in his neighbourhood hovering around water sources and also appearing too tired to fly.As he was contemplating on ways to help the feathered friends, he noticed his buddy and neighbour Ramachandran putting out vessels of water for the birds to drink from. Inspired by the kind act, Prasad decided to follow his example but also wanted more people to do the same. Instead of telling people randomly, Prasad decided to use social media to spread the word. In order to kindle curiosity and make the concept more attractive, he came up with an online challenge, asking people to feed birds in the neighbourhood. ""All you've to do is to keep some food and water for the birds and post a picture of it in your social media page, asking your friends to take up the challenge and do the same,"" he says. He says that to his surprise, not only did people laud the move many also came forward to spread the challenge.""I hung a few vessels and containers in the trees around my house filled with water and food. In no time, the vessels were empty and squeaky clean. From then on, I started keeping food three times a day,"" says Prasad. It's the 'My Tree Challenge', that was a hit on social media a few years ago, that inspired him to spread this cause through the online platforms. Here's how some of them accepted the challenge and did their bit.Tinu Job, a banker from Kollam who has taken up the challenge, says, ""It's been only a few days since I started feeding birds, by putting some bird feed in the balcony of my flat. Now, the birds have made it a habit to visit me regularly in the afternoons. All I share is the food grains at home and also the leftovers of dishes that I eat, like puttu, bread, dosa and the like.I just break them into small crumbs, that's all.""According to Prasad, the birds do not leave the containers dirty ever. ""The containers of food and water that I put out are always left clean and dry. Sometimes when there is excess water, a few birds also ensure that they take a quick shower to relieve themselves from the heat. You wouldn't see them wasting a drop of water,"" he says. Just like Tinu, Prasad too leaves a share of home-made food for birds to feed on. ""I generally keep small pieces of idly or rice, and they finish it off in no time,"" he says.It's after watching a tired bird struck with heat stroke in his courtyard that Rahul P S, a businessman from Kottayam, decided to take up the challenge. He says, ""I tried to approach the bird to take it to a vet, but then it panicked. To prevent dehydration in the birds, I began placing concrete water bowls on my compound walls and under trees. An ornithologist I know also told me that most small birds need to be hydrated twice a day. So I ensure that there is enough water in the mornings and evenings.""Often, the water kept out for birds are shared by other drought-hit animals too. Tinu says, ""Initially, it was only sparrows and crows that came for my buffet. But now, squirrels have also started visiting and I have a feeling that at night, bats too take their share!""Rahul says that sometimes, he has also spotted street dogs and other animals drinking from the bowls, which shows that the summer is harsh not just on birds, but on other animals too. ""Above all, it's a pleasant sight to see birds and animals making a visit to your compound. Moreover, it is the most humane thing one can do to your fellow beings in summer.""Birds need water more than food. Keep plain water in shallow earthen containers so that the water remains cool for them to drink and even splash around.Keep red rice grains, corn and millets alongside.Fruits like banana, guava, grapes and papaya are also much loved by birds.It's best to keep unprocessed food as birds prefer raw food.

The team also found distilled water from the spot. In total, the stock worth Rs 65,295 was seized.""It's known from the earlier instances that the spurious liquor makers add flavour and alcohol with water to fill the IMFL bottles and sell them at premium prices.

Soybeans eased after a two-day fund-driven rally, while corn prices were unchanged. The Chicago Board of Trade's most-active wheat contract had risen 0.3 percent to $4.58-1/2 a bushel by 0342 GMT, after climbing earlier in the session to $4.59-1/4 a bushel, its strongest since Feb. 16. Wheat closed up 3 percent on Wednesday. Soybeans declined 0.1 percent to $10.50-1/2 a bushel, having firmed almost 3 percent in the past two days. Corn was unchanged at $3.82 a bushel, after gaining 2.2 percent in the previous session. ""There is dryness in the Southern Plains which is causing some concern and Egypt made solid purchases,"" said Rajesh Singla, head of agriculture research at Societe Generale. ""U.S. wheat was pretty competitive, it was mainly because of the freight costs the tender was awarded to Black Sea and European suppliers."" Egypt's main state wheat buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), bought 535,000 tonnes of wheat at an international tender. The purchase was GASC's largest since early 2014. Japan's farm ministry bought a total of around 113,000 tonnes of wheat from the United States and Australia in a regular tender that closed late on Wednesday. Weather forecasts showed potentially stressful dry and warm conditions persisting in the U.S. Southern Plains winter wheat belt. Corn and soyoil prices were supported by reports of changes to U.S. government policy that could lift U.S. biofuel production. Corn is the primary U.S. feedstock for ethanol, while soyoil is used in biodiesel. Gains were capped, however, by a lack of confirmation from the Trump administration about any changes. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts on Wednesday.

The minister also listed out various measures, including a scientific reconstitution of price control cell and setting up district-level rice shops, to address the issue.""The state's share of food grains under National Food Security Act was fixed by the previous UPA government when K V Thomas was the minister of state for food and civil supplies,"" Thilothaman said.Coming to his aid, CPM MLA S Sharma said the statutory rationing system in the state was sabotaged by the UDF government, while chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged all parties to stand united in exerting pressure on the central government to retain the state's original share of 16.25 lakh metric tonne of food grains.""It will be the main agenda of the all-party delegation being sent to New Delhi,"" the chief minister said."

It damages the small intestines.Early infant feeding practices can delay the onset of symptomatic celiac disease, an auto-immune disease, shows the study, which was conducted to find out whether breastfeeding and breastfeeding status during gluten (wheat diet) introduction influences the age at diagnosis of the disease. In addition to study, whether the timing of gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of celiac disease.Result of the study shows that the age at onset of celiac disease was below one year in 40.42% of the cases, who had started gluten before six months of age compared to only 12.58% of those who had started gluten later.The study also shows that those children who are breastfed properly as recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO), the age of children diagnosed with celiac disease is higher in comparison to the age of children who are not breastfed properly.The study has been published in international journal of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition (PGHN). It was conducted by Dr Shailja Vajpayee, Dr Shiv Dayal Sharma, Dr Rajkumar Gupta, Dr Alok Goyal, and Dr Aakash Sharma of department of pediatric medicine, JK Lon hospital attached to Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur.One of the authors Dr RK Gupta, who teaches pediatric medicine in J K Lon hospital, said, ""While conducting the study, we have found that if an infant gets exclusive breastfeeding for his first six months of life and post six months, he taken rice and pulses in the form of semi-solid food and also start intake of gluten (wheat) diet which delays symptomatic celiac disease.""But he added the study has not established that exclusive breastfeeding for six months and timing of gluten introduction provide permanent protection against the disease or merely delays the symptoms.The study was conducted on 198 children who have already been diagnosed with the disease. The doctors collected the details of such children whether they were breastfed exclusively for first six month of their life. They also collected information on the time when they started taking gluten (wheat). They were continued breastfeeding at the time of introduction of wheat.Out of 198 cases, 185 had been breastfed as infants and 121 children were exclusively breastfed for first six months. Out of 198 cases, 60 were diagnosed in first two years of life. Among those 14 cases who were not breastfed, nine had onset of symptoms in first 24 months of age as compared to 26.36% in breastfed group. In breastfed children, age of gluten introduction was also significantly higher as compared to other group, revealed the study."

In Manipur, it's just the opposite,"" Union human resource development minister Prakash Javadekar on Monday said, praising Manipur's unique tradition of 'Athenpot'. People bring fruits, vegetables, rice and sweetmeats to pledge support to and bless their candidate.Javadekar was addressing a BJP election rally in the Nambol constituency, where the saffron party is fielding Thounaojam Chaoba Singh , a former Union minister.""The people of Manipur are very good, and your culture is so rich. In all the election meetings I have attended, I have seen this system of Athenpot. People came to the election meeting to give blessings to the candidate. This system is only found in Manipur, which I really cherish,"" said Javadekar.The tradition goes back a long way. Professor of economics at the Manipur University , Amar Yumnam, explains that Athenpot is practised in every social function held by Manipuris. People of a locality bring a variety of goods for offering prayers for and blessing the family which hosts the social function. ""In olden days, people of a locality would share the burden of the one who organized the social function. Now, it is being extended to the election,"" he said. Yumnam added that it is a community tradition and a practice of social capital. Vijaylakshmi Brara , associate professor at the Centre of Manipur Studies of the Manipur University, said this is a special system where people ""contribute their might"" to an individual who is hosting a social function. ""This way, the localities did not allow the individual to bear all the burden. The basic idea behind the system is the collective effort of a kinship network of a locality. In Manipur, localities are clan-based,"" she said. This social system is slowly being extended to the election, where a locality symbolically pledges its support to a candidate. ""It is an attempt to establish a fictitious kinship system,"" she added."
58f582877be9e01a357a21b9,Sri Lankan refugees in dilemma over return,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/trichy/lankan-refugees-in-dilemma-over-return/articleshow/57565017.cms,2017-03-09,"TRICHY: Nearly three decades after taking shelter in India, a majority of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees appear to be in two minds in going back to their country despite normalcy returning to the once war-torn island nation. Uncertainty over a peaceful future back home as well as the consequences of returning to India again are the major deterrents for them.Wounded physically and mentally in the ethnic war in 1980s, Sri Lankan Tamils had found Tamil Nadu to be a safe haven to survive. With the war between the Sinhalese and the LTTE coming to an end a few years ago, the idea of returning to their homeland had blossomed in the minds of many of the refugees in the 112 camps across the state.""As citizens of Sri Lanka , we all long to go back to our country and many of our people are gradually stepping into our home towns. Those who have been repatriated so far are making efforts to rebuild their lives on their . The number of such repatriations may increase if normalcy and freedom continue to exist there in the real sense,"" said a 65-year-old man in one of the two camps in Trichy.In all, 60 refugees had returned from two camps in Kottapattu and Vazhavandhankottai in Trichy since April last year. A similar repatriation has been happening in other camps in the state as well. United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) in Chennai had come forward to help them by providing free flight tickets among other things. The agency had also been helping them clear all procedures like securing a one-way passport and exit pass.Twenty refugees from Kottapattu camp had been repatriated with the help of UNHCR while two refugees moved back on their own. Similarly, 21 refugees left with support from UNHCR and 17 by themselves from Vazhavandhankottai camp. Last month, two refugees from Kottapattu camp were repatriated. At present, 1,389 refugees including 701 males and 688 females are residing in Kottapattu camp while the other camp has 1,420 refugees including 725 males and 695 females. To return or not is the dilemma haunting these people as they stay put in the camps.Tamil Nadu government has been taking care of the refugees for the last three decades by providing shelter on a protected campus, cash dole and free rice. A 37-year-old man from Vavunia told TOI that he is content with what he has been getting from the government under the refugee category. ""We had migrated to Mandapam camp in Rameswaram when I was five years old and then shifted to Trichy camp in 1996. Since then we have been residing here because of the cash dole and other benefits from the government. Even if we return to our home land, we are not sure if we will be able to lead a normal life,"" he said.The monthly cash dole includes Rs 1,000 for the head of the family, Rs 750 for those aged above 12 years and Rs 400 for children below 12 years. They also get 20 kg of free rice per family and have to pay only 57 paise for every additional kilogram. Sri Lankan refugees are happily leading their lives in the camps with the help of the state government. Now, they want to move back home. Very few of them have been repatriated while the rest are hesitating to go there,"" regional special deputy collector S Natarasan told TOI.Though repatriation may be an easy task for them because of the help of NGOs, the refugees are very careful in moving out of India as they cannot be accepted as refugees again if they prefer to return here in case of an unfavourable situation in Sri Lanka. An NGO called Child Fund India recently set up a help centre in Kottapattu camp to provide a clear picture of the circumstances in Sri Lanka to those who wanted to move back home. The refugees have been relying on these inputs to decide about their future plan. "" I have no idea if I can get a normal life there. I have a lot of queries to be clarified before returning. If I am not satisfied, I will not go back,"" said a 25-year-old woman."
58f582ad7be9e01a357a21ec,Government data shows note ban hasn't hit sowing,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-data-shows-note-ban-hasnt-hit-sowing/articleshow/56821760.cms,2017-01-28,"NEW DELHI: With 4-5 days still to go for sowing operation of rabi crops, the country is looking at the prospect of having the highest acreage of winter crops in the past five years. Adding to the good news, rains in some parts of the country in the past couple of days could also mean a better yield situation as well.Latest sown area data, released by the agriculture ministry on Friday, seems to indicate that the fear of demonetisation leading to a drop in farm yields due to cash-strapped farmers inability to access inputs was largely unfounded. It clearly shows that the acreage of major rabi crops (wheat and pulses) has not only crossed the corresponding figures of last year but also beat the 'normal' (expected under positive conditions) sown area of the season.Total rabi sown area as on Friday stands at 637.34 lakh hectares as compared to 600.02 lakh hectares at this time last year (over 6% higher).It has almost touched the 'normal' rabi sown area (638.37 lakh ha) in what could be a clear sign that the sowing operation was not affected by the note ban the way it was feared inmid-November.""Farmers do not need to depend on the market to buy their entire requirement of seeds. As far as other inputs including fertilisers are concerned, they could probably manage it with the system where they can easily get things on credit in rural areas"", said an official.Figures of acreage for wheat and pulses are, in fact, encouraging as sown areas of both these crops crossed their 'normal' area by a good margin. The sown area under wheat stands at 315.55 lakh hectares as compared to its 'normal' area of 304.05 lakh hectares. It was 292.52 lakh hectares at this time last year.Barring winter rice and coarse cereals, other rabi crops have shown much improved acreage.""Since farmers are still left with 4-5 days of sowing operation, it is expected that the acreage this year will cross the 642.89 lakh hectares mark of the year 2013-14 when the country had witnessed good monsoon rains"", said an official in the agriculture ministry who is tracking the development."

He received the agricultural department's award for the high yield during 2015-2016 from chief minister O Paneerselvam.A diploma holder in textile technology, Sankaranarayanan, 49, of Puliyankudi decided to take up agriculture as it was his family tradition for 20 years. Two years ago, he decided to enter the competition conducted by the department of agriculture under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI) and registered for the same. He decided to adopt the technology on one hectare of his field by following the guidelines of the department. He chose the high yielding rice variety of CR-1009 to conduct his experiment and received inputs on organic and inorganic manure as also pesticides. The 150-day cropping yielded 19,750 kg of paddy against the normal yield per hectare of 12,000 kg.As part of the work, a nursery had to be created using 8 kilograms of paddy seeds for cultivating on one hectare, and after fourteen days the best saplings were selected and planted on tiny plots of 2 cm x 2 cm. Last year, however, failed monsoons and drought conditions did not encourage farmers to go for this system, which Sankaranaryanan also did not undertake.Puliyankudi is an agricultural village in Tirunelveli where about 3,000 acres is under paddy cultivation. However, in 2016, less than 700 acres was cultivated and Sankaranayaran is doubtful if they will get even 50 per cent of the expected harvest. Farmers in the region are using well and tank irrigation to save their crops this season. Sankaranarayanan says that agriculture has also been suffering due to lack of farm hands as most of them are working under the government's 100-day employment scheme. The SRI system requires plenty of water and the failed monsoons have dashed the hopes of these farmers of having even a minimal yield."

To the right is the resplendent green of rice fields. Paddy in all its post-monsoon glory, brought to life by the sweat and loving care of local villagers. To the left, glorious greensomething of a rare sight these days in Goahas given way to a wanton scarring of the earth. Trees have been felled, mud has been dumped, tin sheds have cropped up and a cement factoryfor the construction of the new Zuari bridgewill overnight replace the rice and vegetable fields tended over generations. Development in all its muscular forms has descended on yet another village in Goa. Work on the approach roads to the new bridge began a month or two ago. Some 30 houses, eight crosses, a small chapel, acres of fertile land and traditional occupations will be hit by the second bridge. A small price to pay for world class infrastructure, the government would argue.They had no clue their lives were soon to be upturned. They read it in the papers, the villagers said. Governments have a way of doing that. Taking us completely by surprise. Delivering a fait accompli. Decision made, the bulldozers move in.A new bridge for Zuari is unquestionably needed. No arguments there. Village voices, too, have been quelled since by assurances of adequate compensation. But it is still worth analysing the fine print for major infrastructure unveiled at the fag end of a government.When he laid the foundation stone for the new bridge on January 1, 2016, Union minister Nitin Gadkari , promised the eight-lane cable-stayed bridge would become ""a world attraction"". Why not? How many bridges in third world countries have a restaurant and viewing gallery (""to showcase Goa's history"" with a light and sound show) perched on a tower? Estimates of costs for the bridge alone have been scaled up from Rs 2,700 crore to Rs 3,500 crore in a matter of months. The construction of approach roads pegged at Rs 600 crore have been revised to Rs 1,000 crore.Mind-boggling figures, wasteful expenditure, absence of transparency and liability, skewed priorities and piecemeal planning have been the order of business in Goa's 'development' over the years. Braced by its majority in the last election, the BJP has been unapologetic in its pursuit of big-ticket projects, both public and private. The Investment Promotion Board (IPB), constituted to ""fast-track"" approval, has been criticized for its overriding powers and lack of public scrutiny. A clutch of petitions are currently before the high court challenging the constitutional validity of the IPB and its green light to some projectsamong them an eco-tourism resort in Netravali promoted by defence minister Manohar Parrikar 's son, Abhijat.If the BJP fails to make a comeback in 2017, the IPB would, without a doubt, become the first casualty of a new government. Like the PDAs which have acquired notoriety as hubs for kickbacks to those who don't make it to the ministry, in the public mind the IPB, as a nodal agency for far larger projects, is perhaps worse.This is turning out to be an election without any major issue, except for the prevailing undercurrent of anti-incumbency that has spurred a somewhat unified move from both, the right-wingers and the left of centre to send the current lot in government packing. Much of the goodwill the BJP earned beyond its core voter constituency in 2012 has been undone by the party's cynical compromise on corruptionit inducted both Mauvin Godinho and Pandurang Madkaikarin its urgency to return to office. The hypocrisy of the action found resonance in the Church's directive to voters released last week. ""Voters are often tricked by those in power into believing that political opponents are corrupt by appointing inquiry commissions, filing criminal chargesheets that hardly ever result into a criminal conviction or recovery of losses; more often than not, people are told some years later that there was no scam involved.""Whichever party, or coalition of parties and individuals takes over the next government, these inescapable challenges will confront it: finalizing the Regional Plan, sorting out the MoI issue, a decision on the floating casinos and the future of mining.The current government conveniently evaded finalizing RP 2021 or presenting another as promised in its 2012 manifesto, thus encouraging backroom lobbying by real estate interests that hijacked the outline development plans in Panaji, Margao, Mapusa and Mormugao, as this newspaper reported.A new government takes over in the 50th anniversary year of Goa's Opinion Poll. The actual date went largely unnoticed in the swirl of unfolding politics. But it is a milestone worth noting for where we thought we were going and where we've ended up: a state with no long-term planning, a tourist destination with no scientific garbage management, a cosmopolitan hub with few employment avenues and a young, educated class just desperate to get out."

Scientists at the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) and the Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR) have finally prevailed upon rice millers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to reduce the percentage of polishing of grains from the present 10 to 8%.Polishing of rice has always remained the cause of concern in India, even prior to Independence. In fact, Mahatma Gandhi in one of his editorials in his newspaper, Harijan (October 26, 1934), had emphasised on the ill effects of polished rice.NIN director T Longvah said during the release of the `Indian Food Composition Tables (IFCT)' here on Friday that reduction in the percentage of polishing from 10 to 8% will increase the nutrient value of rice. The publication lists 150 nutrition parameters of 526 commonly consumed foods across India. ""The new tables provide the much-needed data in specialised fields and bring about a paradigm shift in nutritional research in the country,"" Longvah said.It is a game-changer in nutrition in our country, Longvah added.The immediate benefit will accrue to schoolchildren, who partake the mid-day meal schemes in government schools in the states of AP and Telangana.The NIN has also for the first time in the world proved that many plant products including rice contain vitamin D2 and D3. ""Many new nutri ents have been analysed and significant variations are reported in composition of micronutrients like calcium, magnesium, riboflavin, and niacin. The availability of new analytical vitamin D data in foods will permit dietary intake assessment.Over the years there has been a change in dietary pattern of Indians, shifting from conventional diet to modified food supply systems. The new data will also help in fighting obesity, non-communicable diseases and cancers, besides improving the nutritional quality of the foods consumed by people in our country. NIN deputy director and media coordinator Maheshwar Mekam was also present at the event."

These and other revelations came to light via a survey conducted by online food delivery startup, Swiggy.Barring Delhi, burger reigned supreme in the snacks category in all other cities, along with street food items like chaats.

There has to be more and more science communication,"" he said. Professor Swamination recalled how a few activists destroyed the golden rice crop, a genetically engineered crop, as there was a fear that it would replace the existing biodiversity.Focusing his lecture on the title 'We Shall Overcome', Swaminathan said that the urgent need in the country is now to overcome the hidden hunger, which is in the form of micronutrient deficiency including iron, iodine and zinc. But for a hunger free India, equal attention has to be given to other two aspects- calorie deprivation and protein deficiency.""While the country has overcome hunger in a broader sense, we are yet to overcome malnutrition among women and children, and spread awareness about climate change,"" he said.Swaminathan went on to explain the role of biofortification in achieving the zero hunger challenge launched by former UN secretary general. He suggested three major approaches of biofortification to eradicate hunger that is use of naturally occurring biofortified plants like moringa, sweet potato, nutria-millets and fruits and vegetables, biofortified varieties including breeding and selection like iron-rich pearl millet and genetically biofortified crops like golden rice. ""Using naturally occurring biofortified plants is one way to overcome micronutrient deficiency,"" he said."

According to sources, many children are earning between Rs 5,000 and Rs 50,000 a month by catching the fish on their own.Interacting with TOI, 14-year-old V Venkatesh from Peda Jalaripeta said he made the mini-boat using waste water bottles, thermocol, plastic rice gunny bags and waste from nets.""I first shaped the boat with the gunny bags. Then, I filled it up with the waste. I took nearly a week to make the boat with an investment of Rs 200. Riding this boat, I can venture into the sea up to 10 kms from the coast. I also do surfing and hook-line fishing with the help of the boat,"" Venkatesh said.Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam District Fishermen Youth Welfare Association executive secretary Arjilli Das said the idea of making boats with waste materials was a novel one thought out by the children themselves.""Nearly 250 such boats are being operated now in Vizag alone. A fisherfolk youth Vadodula Vijay from Pudimadaka earned Rs 40,000 in a week by catching snapper and sheer fish by travelling nearly 15 kms away from the coast on the boat. The cost of making the boat is very cheap. It costs between Rs 200 and Rs 5,000, whereas a fibre boat takes minimum Rs 2 lakh to be built,"" Das said.Das said the fisherfolk collect the plastic waste themselves. ""This idea is not only providing the fisherfolk with means to live, but also cleaning the beach of plastic waste, particularly water bottles and thermocol. If the government supports them in a requisite manner, this will become a source of income and livelihood for many fisherfolk youth,"" Das said.These type of boats are mostly seen in areas like Pudimadaka, Peda Jalaripeta, Gangavaram and Rushikonda beaches.

58f587c77be9e01a17c9bca1,A bit of history to munch on as Maddur of all vadas turns 100,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/a-bit-of-history-to-munch-on-as-maddur-of-all-vadas-turns-100/articleshow/57641903.cms,2017-03-15,"In April 1917, Ramachandra Budhya, who ran a Vegetarian Refreshment Room (VRR) at Maddur railway station, was at his wit's end as the next train was about to arrive in a few minutes and he didn't have enough time to prepare the pakodas that he usually served to the passengers.He calculated the time it would take the train to arrive at the station, slapped all the ingredients at his disposal into a thin patty and fried it. Thus the Maddur vada , which has been the preferred snack of railway passengers across Karnataka and other states, was invented.Budhya, hailing from Kundapura, had moved to Maddur a few years back and had been given permission to run the VRR at the station. He was selling idli vadas to the hundreds of passengers of the many trains running between Mysuru and Bengaluru. On that summer day, he introduced the new snack to commuters and the rest, as they say, is history.Recalling the incident, Jayaprakash, owner of Maddur Tiffany 's, says, ""Ramachandra Budhya got a little creative as the train was just a few minutes from arriving in the station. He took all the ingredients and prepared the vada in a few minutes.""Soon, the Maddur vada became the preferred snack of railway commuters, and a common sight on the train railway journey from Mysuru to Bengaluru.It came to be associated with the Mysuru kingdom, and Ramachandra Budhya's descendants furthered its marketing due to the demand created for the snack in a section of the public.Budhya ran the VRR at the station from 1917 to 1937, and his kin ran the place till 1948.Since 1948, the snack has been made famous by the family of HD Hebbar, whose descendants are now looking after the famous Maddur Tiffanys on the Mysore-Bangalore National Highway in Maddur.Nagaraj, the elder brother of Jayaprakash, recalls, ""HD Hebbar was the man who improved the quality of Maddur vada, which is now preferred by thousands of train commuters. HD Hebbar operated the VRR in Maddur railway station till 1973, which was later given to his son D Gopalaiah.""It was Gopalaiah who took the snack to the next level by making it available outside the railway station too.This demand culminated in Jayaprakash, son of D Gopalaiah, starting Maddur Tiffanys in 1987.This attracted thousands of people to the canteen to have the crispy vada.Jayaprakash said the popularity of the snack was such that one of the members of the Mysuru royal family, Shrikantadatta Chamarajendra Wadiyar, visited the canteen during his father D Gopalaiah's time.He also recalled transporting the snacks to the royal palace in silver vessels.With the passage of time, the snack was introduced in other parts of the country and is available in shops and not just trains and stations.The snack has also become a source of livelihood for those who were once preparing the vadas in Maddur Tiffany's.We didn't wish to have the patent Jayaprakash said that despite the opportunity, they didn't want to hold the patent for the vada.""The snack has been named after this town and it is not fair to have the patent on it. Also, it has given livelihood to so many. So we do not think the snack is limited to our family. But it belongs to entire Maddur,"" he says.Explaining the taste and heritage of the snack, Chathura, a grandson of D Gopalaiah, says, ""We use onion, rava, maida, rice floor and other ingredients in the required amount so that the taste of the snack remains delicious. Importantly, we buy onions only from Pune which are of the best quality. But we manage to use it in sufficient amount only because we have certain demands.""Actor Upendra and music director Gurukiran at Maddur Tiffanys. Uppi is seen showing the symbol of 'SuperOver time, the snack was offered by many including unauthorised vendors in trains which affected the business of VRR at Maddur station.Eventually, the Maddur Tiffany's had to close the VRR at the station as few trains were stopping at the station.On January 28, as the tender was closed, Maddur Tiffany's decided that it was the last time they would run the shop.""We will concentrate only on the hotel now,"" Chathura added.The station master from Maddur railway station, Maniyaiah, said, ""Maddur vada is not only a commercial aspect in this station, but also a heritage of the station. There are many unauthorised vendors who sell vadas here. We penalised them, but they do not stop their business. Such is the influence of the snack between these two cities."""

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade rose 0.45 percent to $10.03-3/4 a bushel after closing down 0.7 percent on Tuesday, when prices hit a low of $9.92 a bushel, their lowest since Dec. 27. * The most active corn futures rose 0.1 percent to $3.62-1/2 a bushel, having gained 0.35 percent in the previous session after earlier hitting a low of $3.60 a bushel, their lowest since Feb. 1. * The most active wheat futures climbed 0.17 percent to $4.31-1/4 a bushel, having closed little changed on Tuesday after earlier hitting a low of $4.28-1/2 a bushel, lowest since Feb. 8. * Soybeans under pressure from expectations of silo-busting production from South America. * Expectations for an expansion in U.S. soybean plantings added to bearish sentiment. A survey of farmers released by Illinois-based research and brokerage firm Allendale Inc projected soybean plantings at 88.8 million acres, up 6.5 percent from 2016. * The survey put corn plantings at 90 million acres and all-wheat seedings at 45.967 million acres. * Chinese importers have booked at least three cargoes of U.S. corn, totaling about 195,000 tonnes, for shipment in the late spring to early summer from the Pacific Northwest, U.S. corn export traders said on Tuesday. * Egypt's General Authority for Supply Commodities set a tender to buy an unspecified amount of wheat from global suppliers for shipment between April 15 and April 25. Results are expected on Wednesday.

58f597a17be9e01a17c9d138,A family with many CM aspirants,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/a-family-with-many-cm-aspirants/articleshow/56990536.cms,2017-02-06,"CHENNAI: With Sasikala chosen chief minister , her family is all set to wield greater power in the administration.There are at least half a dozen other power centres in the Mannargudi clan. However, the family is susceptible to oft-changing power matrix; till Jayalalithaa's demise, all family members were united, but turf war has broken out among prominent members of late.Sasikala's husband M Natarajan is perhaps the only one in the family who has to operate through other members, because the relationship between the couple remains strained. Still, he is a power to reckon with and it is evident from the stream of visitors, mostly officials, to his Besant Nagar residence seeking favours like plum postings. Some have made it a practice to show up every morning and run errands.Sasikala's brother Divakaran, sister-in-law Ilavarasi, her son Vivek, nephews T T V Dinakaran, Venkatesh and Jai Anand - the list of power centres is long. Every member of the family has some clout in the present dispensation. Of late, Dinakaran and Venkatesh are seen as the most influential as they virtually stay at Poes Garden with their aunt. The two played a major role in packing off former adviser to government Sheela Balakrishnan and secretaries to the CM K N Venkataramanan and A Ramalingam. Except Ramalingam, the two were serving extended tenures after superannuation and were accused of pursuing their personal agenda in the administration.The extended family is into a range of businesses from film making to media, distillery, rice mill and plantations. They own real estates across the state.Sasikala will have a tough time managing the turf war within the family. Sources close to the family said there are already signs of skirmishes over who should Sasikala listen to. With each one of them pursuing chief ministerial ambitions, it will never be a smooth sail for her. What could put the brakes on some are the pending cases against them.Even when Sasikala had been staying with Jayalalithaa, the latter had unleashed the state police against many of Sasikala's family members, including Natarajan and Divakaran, in 2012 based on intelligence reports against them. Once Sasikala assumes office as CM, she would revamp the entire intelligence wing, said the source."

The health benefit of preparing food in earthen pots was known to our ancestors, and has been an intrinsic part of the Indian kitchen. However, the tradition vanished with the arrival of steel and aluminum vessels.The canteen, in business for about 15 years now, started using earthen pot only four months ago. They serve palav for Rs 40, which includes more leafy green vegetables and rice. Healthy seeds, dry fruits, ghee, pickle and curd give the food an original taste. ""We use 35 healthy ingredients in the palav. People who are health conscious come here for their meal,"" said Narayan, the cook at the canteen.Ganesh, a customer, said, ""I have food here every day. From my experience, I bet no expensive food matches the health benefits available here. Many people think that paying more gives you healthier food, it's not so. We should prepare such food at home too, and include rural medicinal plants which are ignored.""On the health benefit of clay pots, Dr Chandra Shekhar Aithal from Udupi said, ""Clay has a porous quality. While cooking, heat and moisture circulate through the pot, unlike in metal or enamel-lined pots. Most pots are made with micaceous clay (clay containing mica flecks), which acts as a natural insulator. The speciality of these pots is that the clay is alkaline based, hence it interacts with acidity in the food, neutralizing the pH balance. Cooking in clay pots gives you calcium, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, sulphur and several other compounds that benefit our body. It has the power to control diabetes and blood pressure.""The original Udupi fish curry is prepared in clay pots in villages. Shankari, 67, from Nellikatte, Udupi, said this fish curry can be had for three days without it spoiling. In fact, as it matures, the taste improves, and it just needs to be heated every day.""Making rice in clay pots is difficult because it should be handled with care, but curry can be made easily. I love dishes prepared in pots. These pots are naturally very acidic; hence when we cook tomato in it, it gets a natural sweetness,"" said Shankari."

Corn and wheat also lost ground as investors squared positions ahead of a key U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report on Friday. The upcoming report is expected to show increased U.S. soybean plantings and reduced seedings of corn, as well as bigger year-on-year U.S. stockpiles of corn, soybeans and wheat as of March 1, according to analysts polled by Reuters. ""I think investors are squaring things away before the USDA report,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. ""When you look at the data that has come out in the last one month, there are plenty of supplies. The market is expecting to confirm this from the USDA tomorrow."" The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract fell 0.4 percent to $9.65-1/2 a bushel by 0312 GMT, lowest since Oct. 17. Soybeans closed down 0.3 percent on Wednesday. Crush margins for imported soybeans in China's Shandong province slid to negative 166 yuan, the lowest since August. Negative processing margins could impact China's booming soybean demand. Corn slid 0.1 percent to $3.58 a bushel and wheat gave up 0.1 percent to $4.25 a bushel.

When companies are set up in the region, the paddy fields around there will be filled up. This will lead to the drying up of ground water sources and destruction of trees,"" said Rajesh T, the local resident who raised the issue.Currently, a plywood company is functioning at the three acres near the area and the remaining region, which was a paddy field, is being filled with rice husk ash in order to drain water from the land.When an area is declared as industrial area, corporates will get permission to set up companies in the area. It will have a long term impact on the ecosystem of the Kavu, he added.The plywood company was closed for a few days due to the protest raised by the local residents.Iringole Kavu is a thick forest spread over 60 acres and is home to numerous birds, fauna and flora, with some endemic species unique to the region."

However, the family is susceptible to oftchanging power matrix; till Jayalalithaa 's demise, all family members were united, but turf war has broken out among prominent members of late.Sasikala's husband M Natarajan is perhaps the only one in the family who has to operate through other members, because the relationship between the couple remains strained. Still, he is a power to reckon with and it is evident from the stream of visitors, mostly officials, to his Besant Nagar residence seeking favours like plum postings. Some have made it a practice to show up every morning and run errands.Sasikala's brother Divakaran, sister-in-law Ilavarasi, her son Vivek, nephews T T V Dinakaran, Venkatesh and Jai Anand  the list of power centres is long. Every member of the family has some clout in the present dispensation.Of late, Dinakaran and Venkatesh are seen as the most influential as they virtually stay at Poes Garden with their aunt. The two played a major role in packing off former adviser to government Sheela Balakrishnan and secretaries to the CM K N Venkataramanan and A Ramalingam. Except Ramalingam, the two were serving extended tenures after superannuation and were accused of pursuing their personal agenda in the administration.The extended family is into a range of businesses from film making to media, distillery, rice mill and plantations. They own real estates across the state. Sasikala will have a tough time managing the turf war within the family. Sources close to the family said there are already signs of skirmishes over who should Sasikala listen to.With each one of them pursuing chief ministerial ambitions, it will never be a smooth sail for her. What could put the brakes on some are the pending cases against them.Even when Sasikala had been staying with Jayalalithaa, the latter had unleashed the state police against many of Sasikala's family members, including Natarajan and Divakaran, in 2012 based on intelligence reports against them. Once Sasikala assumes office as CM, she would revamp the entire intelligence wing, said the source."

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method was used.Ever since the land-return order, concerns had remained whether the concrete mesh setup in the now dismantled Tata Nano factory has permanently damaged the multicrop land character in these parts. Mamata Banerjee on October 30 last year kicked off the process of cultivation in a symbolic gesture by sowing mustard seed, which is faster and easier to grow in winter.On Wednesday, when Bijon Bihari Ghosh was the first to plant the Boro seedlings in his 12 decimal plot in Gopalnagar, he was elated. ""I was sent to prison for refusing to part with my land. I had insisted our land is very fertile and we often end up growing three crops round-the-year in the same plot. Today, I stand vindicated. The factory had turned this land into a concrete mass.Yet the land beneath remained fertile,"" Ghosh said.But the state agriculture department remains cautious. The SRI method which they are advocating here is different from the conventional rice cultivation methods. Experts say this involves planting single, young seedlings at optimal wide spaces, keeping the soil moist but well-drained and aerated and adding compost or other organic materials to the soil."

58f5c5f87be9e01a17ca0646,Back to the cradle of tribal civilization,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/back-to-the-cradle-of-tribal-civilization/articleshow/56709454.cms,2017-01-22,"GOA: The huge contradictions within India are most conspicuous among the lives of dalits and the adivasis. Movements to bring them back to the mainstream have been gathering force more than ever in the country.The movement by the Quepem Christian tribal community, though local, could also be read along with it. Looking back at their primitive and original history and culture as inherited from their ancestors, the movement is trying to revive it from near-extinction by rehashing the much-overhauled version they are living now. The Christian tribals, whose ancestors were converted by Portuguese missionaries, have been following a new costume, cuisine and lifestyle, disregarding their age-old traditions and customs, deeply ingrained in their psyche and soil, and followed by their forefathers.The Gawda, Kunbi and Velip communities have been included in the list of scheduled tribes. During the Portuguese regime, they were converted to the Roman Catholic fold of Christianity. Today, these Christian tribals are given certificates as Christian Gawdas, but they consider themselves as Kunbis.Before the slash-and-burn farming practice called kumeri gained in prominence, they were mostly living on a wide range of seasonal wild berries, fruits and vegetables, which were naturally available. Their food was predominantly organic and free from harmful chemicals. Once they got involved in agriculture, they started growing horsegram, blackgram, finger millets and traditional rice varieties along with tuber crops.When they turned agriculturists, they made use of different kinds of grass available in the wild and used them for a variety of livelihood activities. Food grains were stored in mudis, skilfully wove out of paddy stalks. Mats for sleeping were made of lavo, a wild grass available in marshy areas or from the coconut fronds, chudta.Despite the fallout that these tools for subsistence turn into exhibition items or artefacts, tribal festivals, like the one organized at Shelde this year, display the cultural ethos and values of the tribals. President of Adivasi Sangathana of Quepem, Caetano Carvalho says, ""Since 2008, we have been organizing the tribal festival every year for reviving links with our traditional culture. We organize competitions of traditional games and also encourage members of our tribal community to put up food stalls displaying our cuisine.""These festivals also make a pitch for different tribal arts and skills, which have been revived by the efforts of the Adivasi Sangathana of Quepem. The traditional form of folk art, the Intrumez, not only provides a stage to the artists from Ambaulim, but also helps non-tribals get glimpses of dance and drama of the Kunbis. The Kunbi sari, which inspired Wendell Rodricks and in turn revived the weaving of the traditional Kunbi sari, worn by the aged women of the community along with traditional jewellery and garlands of local flowers decorating their hair, classically portrays the look of the tribeswomen. The women command respect in the family and their hard work sustains them, besides instilling cultural and social values in their children.Researcher of Goan history and culture, Rohit Phalgaonkar said, ""Through this festival we get an opportunity to relish a variety of food items like saana, taikalyachi chav (a green leafy vegetable), ukadyatandalache ladu (ladu made of brown rice), shirvalyo (rice noodles) in done (bowls fashioned out of leaves), and medicinal and nutritional slices of wild tubers. Folk dance performances with tribal costumes present varied facets of the tribal culture, giving us thought-provoking experiences."" Joao Fernandes , a folk researcher, who belongs to the Christian Gawda community, said that the community was confined to the practice of shifting agriculture and cultivating different types of food grains for hundreds of years. ""The new generation has a feeling that our culture is that of backward people and that we have inferior complexes. In reality, our culture has roots in the soil and has evolved traditions, cuisine and arts as per the need of the environment, since our ancestors possessed foresight,"" he added.Goa has a tribal population of 1,49,275 as per the 2011 census. Among these, 1,06,659 is the Gawda population. There is no reference to the Christian Gawda population. But as per Christian Gawda leaders, their community is approximately 50,000-strong.Father Victor Ferrao said, ""Tribals who are living in tune with nature and environment have helped in protecting the Goan culture. The tribal festival has shown the varied facets of Goa's sociocultural heritage.""The life of the Christian tribals has changed a lot, but, under the banner of Adivasi Sangathana, they are making efforts to restore their original identity."

The CLP welcomed the proposal and appealed to U.T. Khader, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, to implement it at the earliest. The proposal would be placed before the Cabinet and effected soon, sources said.Under it, a single-member family will get 8 kg of rice, while an eight-member family will get 64 kg a month. In the unit system, the larger the size of family, the larger the quota, a source said.It was also decided to supply milk to schoolchildren for five days a week under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme. Both schemes are likely to figure in the State Budget, sources said.Issues related to drought and the drinking water crisis were also discussed at the meeting, with legislators alleging that officials were not responding to the grievances of villagers."

About 30 students had fallen ill after having dinner on Wednesday. All students are safe and have been discharged from the institute's hospital after receiving treatment for two nights. The doctors at the hospital said the students are safe.Reacting to Wednesday's incident of alleged food poisoning of the students, the institute's authorities said that it could be a case of specific food allergy and that there was nothing wrong with the food served to the students.According to reports, 28 students of post-graduate and PhD (research) programmes, who lived in Cautley Bhawan (hostel) of the institute, had dinner in the hostel mess on January 25 but soon started complaining of stomach ache and dehydration. They were rushed to the hospital for treatment.Some students had eaten rice and a sweet corn dish specially prepared on their demand in the mess. Only 28 students had fallen ill after eating that dish. Doctors told us that it could be a case of specific food allergy. Food served to the students was fine. We will probe the matter, said dean (students welfare) D K Nauriyal.Taking cognizance of the incident, which was reported on social media, the food safety department inspected the mess and lifted two food samples and issued a notice to the institute under different sub-clauses of section 31 of the Food Safety & Standard Act 2006.The hostel mess is being run without food safety licence. We have given one month's time to the institute to respond to the notice. We have sent the food samples for testing at a Rudrapur-based lab, Santosh Kumar Singh, food safety officer, told TOI.This was the second incident of food poisoning at the institute in the past three years when the food safety department issued notice to the management. In August 2013, over 250 students of Rajendra Bhawan (hostel) complained of food poisoning after having breakfast from the hostel canteen.The food safety department had also imposed a fine on the institute for not following food safety norms, said Santosh Kumar Singh."

The scientists used the introgressive hybridisation technique to move the saltwater tolerant gene, Saltol QTL, from Pokkali rice to the gene pool of Jyothi.Results of large area trials have shown that the Saltol introgressed variety is as good as Jyothi in terms of yield. The tests have confirmed the possibility of cultivating the introgressed Jyothi lines in saline areas, says K.S.Shylaraj, Professor and Head, RRS, Vyttila.The KAU launched the intensive molecular breeding programme in 2008 for the development of stress-tolerant rice varieties for less favourable environments.The programme involves the introgressive hybridisation of three paddy varieties, namely Jyothi, Uma and Jaya, to make them tolerant to both salinity and submergence. For submergence tolerance, the researchers introgressed the Sub 1 gene, characteristic of the FR-13A rice in Odisha, to build resilience to flash floods up to two weeks.KAU Vice Chancellor P.Rajendran said the new rice varieties would help boost productivity and arrest crop loss due to salinity intrusion and floods. Farmers in Kaipad, Kuttanad and Kole tracts will be benefited, he said.Introgressive hybridisation is the technique of transferring a gene from one species into the gene pool of another by the repeated backcrossing of a hybrid with one of its parent species."

The price of the popular brand, which was Rs. 32 a kg last month, has touched Rs. 42 a kg in the retail markets.Crop failure of this paddy variety has been blamed for the shortage and the next crop is due for harvest only in April.The commodity mainly arrives from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana though Tamil Nadu and Karnataka partly meet the demand.The crop has failed in the latter two states too following drought. This could compel merchants in the southern districts to depend on rice varieties from Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, which are not popular among consumers.Varieties from Uttar Pradesh sell around Rs. 32 a kg and that from Punjab Rs. 33 a kg in the retail markets. Andhra rice, which was earlier used only in Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram and parts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts, is now gaining popularity in Ernakulam and Thrissur too.Rice merchants here said on average three trains carrying 30,000 sacks of Andhra Pradesh rice used to reach Kollam a week. Now, only two trains have come in the past two weeks.Retail merchants, who source rice from wholesalers, said since the past two or three days they were unable to get the required quantity. Wholesalers said they had to meet the demand of their clients and there was a shortage of stock.There is also uncertainty over the stock position of the Jaya variety rice in Andhra Pradesh. There are concerns that the rice variety may go out of stock in the wholesale market if a train carrying the commodity fails to arrive this week.Dealers said the situation was critical. Such a shortage of Andhra rice in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram was witnessed last in April 2008, the wholesalers said."

The answer is none.The latest data on nutritional composition of Indian foods published by the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) shows that the `humble' safflower oil has the highest percentage of good fat and the second lowest content of bad fat. This makes safflower oil the best bet in Indian kitchens.The `Indian Food Composition Tables', which was released in Hyderabad on Friday by NIN director T Longvah , lists as many as 13 edible oils with their fatty acid profiles. The NIN has profiled 526 Indian foods including oils with minute details like vitamin D content. The latest work is an update of a similar but limited exercise carried out in 1989. The oils analysed by the NIN are coconut oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, gingelly oil, mustard oil, palm oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, safflower oil (blended), soya bean oil, sunflower oil, ghee and Vanaspati.Though the NIN did not give ranking for oils, safflower oil emerges as the best cooking medium if the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (TPFA), total mono-saturated fatty acids (TMFA) and total saturated fatty acids (TSFA) are taken into account. Ex perts have classified TPFA and TMFA as good fats and TSFA as bad fat. Safflower oil contains the highest TMFA content (76.78%) among all oils analysed. It has a TMFA content of 14.04 per cent and a very low level (9.19 per cent) of TSFA. The higher the content of TPFA and TMFA, the better the quality of the oil from the health perspective. The lower the content of saturated fat, the healthier the oil. Safflower oil passes all these parameters. The second best oil is the sunflower oil, followed by mustard oil and soya bean oil. The popular rice bran oil stands at the eighth position while the all-time favourite ghee at the 11th position. Vanaspati and coconut oil occupy the lowest 12th and 13th slots based on their good and bad fat content.The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that the ""risk of developing non-communicable diseases can be lowered by reducing saturated fats to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake."

Also, with families increasingly eating out, the advantages of a balanced diet that is inherent in Bengal's traditional recipes may soon not reflect on the people, warn nutritionists and dieticians.Data logged by mobile health and fitness firm HealthifyMe, which analyses self-reported information on what and how much people consume to work out the protein-fat-carbohydrate (PFC) ratio, shows a slightly higher protien and fat intake and a reduction in carbohydrate can make the average Kolkatan's diet perfect. Other cities, however, require substantial changes to their food habit to make it healthy.The National Institute of Nutrition under the Indian Council of Medical Research pegs the average Indian adult's ideal PFC ratio at 20%:30%:50%. From the 5.5 lakh food logs reported by 10,000-plus Kolkatans in 2016, the average PFC ratio of food intake is 16.9%: 28.6%: 54.5%, the closest to the ideal, says Tushar Vashisht , co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe.Compared to the rest of the country, the percentage contribution of protein to energy is higher while fat and carbohydrate to energy is lower in Kolkata. ""The high protein intake from the regular intake of fish, meat and lentils put people in the city at a lower risk for conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and obesity,"" remarked Mitali Palodhi, nutritianist-dietician and vice-president of Indian Dietetic Association.Consumption of vegetables is also higher in Kolkata than most other cities. Masoor dal, mixed vegetables and machher jhol are among the most popular meal items while muri or puffed rice is a very popular snack item.In contrast, consumption of fat is highest in Delhi that thrives on paratha, milk/butter and samosa. Such food habit puts them at greater risk of heart disease and hypertension. Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, on the other hand, consume more carbohydrate through their diet of rice, idli and dosa makes them susceptible to diabetes.While the survey shows that Bengal's traditional food is balanced as they contain all nutrients, dieticians are worried that habits are fast changing. ""Increasingly, people are opting to eat out or order in. When one does that, one doesn't know the fat content. It is also disturbing to hear some parents brag that their children don't like rice or roti. One has to get children addicted to home food,"" said Ipsita Chakravarti, chief dietician of CMRI.The lack of balance diet is leading to micronutrient deficiencies like Vitamin D and iron and folic acid. ""These problems would earlier occur mostly among the impoverished people who could not afford a proper meal. But that is not the case now. High consumption of fast food is resulting in these problem across socio-economic groups,"" said Palodhi.Another major problem, says Chakravarti, is sendantary lifestyle. Analysis of HealthifyMe data shows the average Kolkatan burns minimum calories. While a Kolkatan burns 209 kCal a day, it is 232 kCal in Bangalore, 229 kCal in Delhi and 227 kCal in Mumbai."

Officials visit these places once in five years, and that too by helicopters, for conducting elections. The candidates refrain from visiting the hamlets for canvassing votes in the absence of a motorable road.A road to these remote places had long been a mirage as the tribals inhabit with wild animals, including the big cats, in the forests forming part of the Nagarjunasagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve, a notified sanctuary.Thanks to the enactment of Recognition of Forest Rights Act, the Sugali and Chenchu tribals are now able to earn some decent income from their land in recent years. With the savings generated, the tribals decided to collect about Rs. 2,000 per household for laying a road. They used to carry the sick on a dolly in difficult terrain to Yerragondapalem for treatment.With more than Rs. 3 lakh pooled, we have developed a the seven-km kutcha road between Ponnalabailu and Naritdakala this year, say a group of tribals in a conversation with a correspondent of The Hindu who visited their habitations.We planned to develop another stretch of road later this year or early next year by surviving on just the ration rice provided by the State Government, they add.Our worry is that the road will get washed away during the rainy season, forcing us to relay it once again next year, says Chandu Naik, who lost his pregnant daughter as she could not be moved to a hospital in Yerragondapalem in time.Cant move outThe Forest Department wants the tribals to move out of the forests to rehabilitation colonies set up near Yerragondapalem, says Ganjivaripalli Forest Range Officer G. Venkateswarlu. However, those living in the Chenchugudems in Polutla and its surroundings have ruled out moving out of their habitations.We can earn a decent living from the land given under the ROFR Act only in the forests. We will not be able to live with dignity if we move out of our habitations, they maintain."

But rice was distributed among 19 lakh beneficiaries,he claimed, adding how could this happen? I demand that an enquiry by a retired judge or CBI be conducted in this matte.Accepting the demand inprinciple, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said he will discuss the issue with the Chief Minister and will inform the House accordingly.On this, Assam Assembly Speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami said: This is a very serious matter. I request the Minister to do something. I reserve my ruling today and will announce it later.Earlier, Mr. Das informed the House that subsidised rice, meant for APL categories, was diverted to the owners of the tea gardens for distribution among the workers for an amount of Rs 0.50 per kg.After the National Food Security Act was implemented, this APL rice was stopped by the Central government. It was not done by the BJP, but was done during the Congress tenure.However, propaganda is being carried out that BJP has stopped the rice distribution to poor labourers, he added.Mr. Das alleged the owners of the tea gardens are trying to create a law and order situation and if anything like this takes place, strict action should be initiated against them.Tea gardens are violating various provisions of the Plantation Labour Act. It is very sad that not a single tea garden is giving the minimum wage to the workers. Also, the wages in Brahmaputra and Barak valleys are different. There are many such anomalies, the Minister said.He informed the House that the government will take action against the errant tea gardens if they do not provide basic amenities as per the Act. - PTI"

Feeders of the Bharathapuzha, their sorry state of affairs has been worsening the drinking water scene. We have prepared the master plan after more than two years of intense data collection and directly identifying the threats involved. Except for the few patches of reserve forests on Kalladikodan hill ranges where the river originates, the green cover that protected the river ecosystem now remains completely lost, said KSLUBs agricultural officer V. Bindu, who led the study.Rubber plantations have mushroomed in the downstream regions, causing severe change in land-use pattern. Sixty per cent of the rice fields has been reclaimed for construction purposes. Agricultural activities in 16,450 acres are now under threat, she said.The board has suggested massive afforestation initiatives, apart from clearing encroachments on the river basin. Rainwater harvesting and participatory river protection initiatives have also been mooted.According to officials, the mini-hydel project at Meenvallom too has contributed to the adverse water situation. The master plan also involves a database with details of the hills, hillocks, wells, canals, reservoirs, tanks, streams, and biodiversity available in the river basin. It would help detect encroachments and plundering of the resources by real estate and sand-mining mafia."

PHOTO: S.S. KUMARS_S_KUMARThe High Court order restraining the District Registrar from registering unauthorised layouts will go a long way in preventing rampant conversion of agriculture land for real estate business.In the last several years, a large chunk of agriculture land in rural areas of the union territory has gone into the hands of realtors leaving a huge question mark on the long-term livelihood means of farmers.Statistics reveal that in the late 1950s, paddy had been cultivated on around 52,000 hectares of land in the union territory. The area had shrunk to 25,200 hectares in 2016. Similarly, sugar cane had been cultivated on an area of 10,000 hectares during the early 1960s as against the present 3,000 hectares.Leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) V. Perumal, who had been fighting for long against conversion of agriculture land for real estate purpose, said the High Court decision would prevent large-scale conversion of agriculture land.We used to export excess paddy to neighbouring States. Bahour was once known as the rice bowl of UT and now the paddy fields have been converted into plots. The farmers have not benefited from the sale, he said.The High Court, acting on a petition filed by advocate Elephant G. Rajendran, on Tuesday directed the District Registrar not to register unauthorised layouts.Sources in the Revenue Department said more than 90% of the plots registered did not have the approval of the Department of Town and Country Planning.The court order, notwithstanding the social side, would create a dent in revenue collection. The order comes at a time when the Revenue Department was staring a revenue shortfall after the government reduced guideline register (GLR) value of property by 25%. The revenue from registration of property had been on the decline because of fall in registration of property. The revenue collection came down to Rs. 124 crore in 2014-15 and further to Rs. 117 crore in 2015-16.The cut in GLR value coupled with demonetisation has caused a huge revenue loss. It could be difficult to cross the Rs. 50-crore mark, he said.Review petitionOfficial sources told The Hindu that the government might file a review petition to exempt the union territory from the order."

""It was one of the most productive time of my life, when I worked for five years in PPP and finally merged it in the Congress after six years. At the time of merger, we presented an 11-point charter to the Congress on why we had formed PPP -to finish VVIP culture, end policeneta nexus, and take Punjab out of debt. I am thankful to the Congress for letting me accomodate in the manifesto what we were trying to articulate in PPP. Entire mani festo of PPP has been incoroprated in toto,"" says Manpreet.""Manifesto also brought me closer to Congress leaders like former Punjab CM Rajinder Kaur Bhattal. We toured to meet roadside vendors, knitwear-manufacturers, fur nace-owners, used car-owners, jewellers, stock market traders, dry fruit traders and rice millers for days and days,"" he adds.After having two dilligent yet failed starts -one when his debutant People's Party of Punjab (PPP) failed to win a seat in 2012 and second when he lost by a small margin of 19,000 votes against his sister-in-law Harsimrat Kaur from Bathinda Lok Sabha seat in 2014, Manpreet doesn't hide his emotions. ""The way Harsimrat and CM are making frequent visits to Bathinda comes from the fact that they have staggering hatred for me. That's because I dared to rebel. I dared to contest against the CM's daughter-in-law. They will try every trick up their sleeve to beat me again. It (my victory) is up to the people,"" he insists.But he doesnt harbour malice when it comes to PPP rebels.

(Clockwise from top): Karuppu, a prized bull in the jallikattu circuit, takes on two young men; a memorial for a temple bull; M. Muniyandi, an agricultural labourer, with his Pulikulam.Photos: Shaju JohnThe setting sun and fading natural light probably hurried P. Karthikeyan; while trying to get Karuppu to pose for photographs, he found himself too close to the bull with no one to hold the nose rope. For once, Karuppu did not grunt a warning. His left foreleg bent, aiming horns at Karthikeyans belly. As he thrust himself at his owner, Karuppus horns came up in a clockwise arc. Karthikeyan ignored all his what-to-dos about avoiding being gored: he did not hit the dirt back-first and roll away. All he managed was a yelp, a quicker response than Karuppus that left the unsuccessful bull yanking at the taut rope tied to a stump, and a nervous laugh. Three years of no jallikattu and it seems I have forgotten how to control him, he says.It is a startling admission of memory erosion made by a man whose family has always had bulls, less than 15 km from the bull-taming sports most famous venue. Ever since the Supreme Court-imposed ban on jallikattu in 2014, Karthikeyan  a resident of Pudhupatti, which lies in between Alanganallur and his farm in Chellana Goundanpatti  has hired someone to take over the supervision of his four bulls, all indigenous breeds.Even as he doubted his abilities ahead of a delayed jallikattu season, Karthikeyan will not hear of questions about the bulls memory: He will remember once I apply the pottu (vermillion mark) and sandalwood paste on his forehead on the morning of the jallikattu. He refuses to eat after that.As jallikattu returns to Alanganallur shortly, the story of the bull  that commands respect, even devotion, from the fear it evokes  is also the story of humans who spend years loving it.Dry runs before D-DayKaruppu, a pulikulam breed, snorts when anyone except his handler approaches. He lets his body jerk violently with each snort, his tail hangs away from the body and he goes broadside. Raja hangs even further back from his 15-odd friends. He got me once about a month back, he says, raising his shirt to show a scar on his left lower abdomen. I was drunk. He was tied anyway and I thought I could hug him, he smiles sheepishly.It is daybreak on January 24, a day after police lathi charge and stone-pelting in Alanganallur. Fearing arrest, these boys from Pudhupatti had stayed overnight at Karthikeyans fields. Since the police were after them, no one gave surnames. Once morning tea was done, they decided to warm up for jallikattu.The boys fan into a semi-circle, eyeing the seemai karuvelam sapling to which Karuppu was tied. Ravi approaches the bull. Karuppu begins a brisk walk and breaks into a run. The boy, aged 18, retreats and Karuppu finds himself yanking at the rope. He then goes anticlockwise towards the others, sending them scampering. At this point, Karuppu stops, considers the boys and runs away as far as the rope would let him, to the other side. Karthikeyan sports a frown immediately. Karuppu has never been one to let go the opportunity to flip a human. In jallikattu parlance, he is a suttru maadu  instead of galloping to the finishing (collection) point like the pokku maadu , he dares his suitors to come at him.The more the boys try to approach, the more Karuppu tries to flee. At the end of one such dash, the seemai karuvelam sapling comes off, roots and all. Karuppu does not turn around. He stops about a hundred metres away and begins horning the ground, covering himself with dirt. Bulls that can do this make it difficult for us to escape by rolling on the ground. Some owners train them with a straw dummy. Some bulls get so good, they can target even a lemon kept on the ground, says a breathless boy. I think it is because of the nose rope. It is probably chafing at a wound he sustained recently, says Karthikeyan, now concerned. He asks the boys to back off and secures the animal, constantly conversing with it through grunts. Later, he feeds him a guava from the hand; one way to get reacquainted.From an embrace to chaseWe are very strict with rules these days. The bulls as well as the tamers have to undergo testing on the day before as well as the morning of the event, says Dr. Meril Raj, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Government Veterinary Dispensary, Alanganallur. Among other things, both are checked for alcohol consumption, injuries and age; bulls should be between three and seven years old, tamers should at least be 18 years. I was once rejected at Alanganallur for being only 47 kg. They said I had to be at least 50 kg, says Sekar, a resident of the same village.There are some things that do not get rejected, though. Sometimes, owners spread ground glass on the bulls body and we wipe it off. We also make sure that sharpened horns are blunted, says a government official who has been part of four jallikattu preparations at Alanganallur for four years. Decorations  even vermillion and sandalwood paste  on the bull are not allowed anymore; tamers are required to wear organising committee-supplied uniforms.Bull owners and tamers are unequivocal in declaring that they do not harm the animals. The government official is sympathetic: You should see the care they show these animals. They are always wiping their face with a towel ahead of releasing them, as if the bulls are being readied for a ramp walk. According to him, pre-event injuries to the bull take place within the vaadivaasal (arena). Owners are given only 90 seconds to release the bull. Sometimes, when the bull sees so many people at once, it panics and refuses to leave. The owner gets desperate  his pride is at stake  and he prods it violently to get it to run.It may not merely be pride alone anymore. From a piece of cloth tied to the bull, prizes have grown to include consumer durables, gold coins, and now, cash. When they believe their bull is invincible, owners announce cash prizes of up to Rs. 10,000 on their own for those who tame their animal.The sport has changed along with the world it inhabits. From eru thazhvuthal , meaning embracing the bull, it became manju virattu , which means chasing an agitated bull. Jallikattu derives its name from the prize: a bundle of coins that would be tied to the bulls horns.Return of the indigenousLegislating jallikattu freezes it in time and risks subsuming the village-level variations of the game. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 allows for manju virattu, vadamadu and eruthu vidum vizha . There used to be 200 jallikattu events during the best years for the sport. It came down to less than 25 before the [2014] ban. Right now, we dont mind the new rules as long as jallikattu returns, says Siva of Alanganallur. Why do you think we did not protest when ram-fighting, cock-fighting and rekla races were banned in the State? he adds, pausing for effect. This. Breeding. Jallikattu is the only way to save our indigenous breeds.With the government aggressively promoting the Jersey breed in these parts, farmers see breeding and jallikattu as the only reasons to have an uncastrated bull in a village. It has not helped farmers that the jallikattu ban coincided with five poor years for agriculture, with the current season being the worst in 20 years. Seemai karuvelams are invading lands left unploughed.I am unable to cultivate six of my 11 acres this year due to drought. I have managed only 12 bundles of harvested paddy from 1.5 acres; I should have got 40 from just one acre, says Karthikeyan. He has cut back on the area in which he has planted sugar cane and has instead pinned his hope on guava trees, which are ripe for harvesting for the first time.Karuppu stays and grazes in the open field, except for when it rains. Twice each day, he is given rice husk powder in water. A month ahead of jallikattu, Karthikeyan starts feeding him cotton seed in water in the evenings  some owners add chopped coconut. A flour of rice, ragi, green lentils, husk and sorghum, mixed in water, is sometimes given ahead of the cotton seed feed. Karuppus swimming  to help with his leap  also increases in frequency as jallikattu approaches; the ongoing drought means there is no water enough for a swim now.As far as farmers are concerned, the trouble with indigenous breeds is that they produce much less milk than Jersey cows. So, if the former gives you six litres a day, the latter manages 15 litres, says Dr. Raj. Thanks to higher fat content, milk from the indigenous breeds is paid Rs. 10 more per litre by procuring agencies and stands at Rs. 32. Farmers say the dung from indigenous breeds makes for good fertilizer. One animal can give me enough dung to take care of two acres. The Jerseys dung is unusable, says Karthikeyan.During the years in which jallikattu was not held, many farmers sold their bulls and villages donated theirs to goshalas (cow shelters). Ahead of jallikattu, bulls are making a return. I was in Tiruchi today to buy a bull for a friend. They wanted one lakh rupees for a five-year-old bull that would have otherwise cost Rs. 30,000. We didnt buy, says Karthikeyan. He attributes it to a demand-supply mismatch.A sacred bond, a spectacleSome soldiered on during the ban years. Karthikeyans uncle M. Muniyandi is an agricultural labourer now, having sold all his land to marry off two of his three daughters. Yet, Muniyandi has a Pulikulam, tied to the side of the road in front of his house. The bull, eight months old when bought, is six years old now. The 65-year-old owner emerges from his house with the trophy the bull won at Palamedu  he walked away with a milk cooker that day. At a jallikattu in Dindigul once, Muniyandis bull won a tiffin box and a packet of 10 jallikattu T-shirts.There is resolve in his answer when Muniyandi is asked how difficult it is to maintain a jallikattu bull: He is my son. He is brother to my three daughters. I talk to him like I would talk to a young boy and he responds.Jallikattu arenas are no places for bull whisperers, though. It is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off, says R. Kannan of Palamedu, who participates in jallikattu regularly. Winners are required to hold on to the bull for less than 20 metres.Like good guard dogs, bulls like Karuppu live in isolation. So does the bull tamer, a good fortnight ahead of jallikattu. Groups of boys go to the village temple and tie a yellow cloth, with a piece of turmeric wrapped within, on their right wrists. From then on, its like putting on the maala (garland) for [the] Sabarimala [pilgrimage], says P. Balasubramanian of Managiri village who used to participate in jallikattu.Like Karthikeyan, who too was a tamer, Balasubramanian stopped putting himself in harms way after getting married. In some cases, the whole point of participation is marriage itself. Pointing to a woman in Palamedu, Kannan says, When her husband was courting her, she said she would marry him only if he won at jallikattu.It turns out in the minds of the bull tamers, jallikattu is a team game. I always warm up and participate with my team members. There is a designated tamer for each bull. The idea is for the others to distract it enough so that one person can hold it, says Karthi, who lives in Alanganallur. Teams are also useful for their sheer numbers. Sometimes, a humiliated owner will try to pick a fight. Then, there are boys who go ahead and break the unwritten rule about not taming a bull from ones own village, just to spite the owner, with whom he may have a long-standing grievance, says Balasubramanian.Denied a bicycle last time jallikattu was held there because the bull he caught had ran out later than the allotted 90 seconds, Karthi was headed for an unapproved jallikattu, held at an undisclosed location, on January 24.

58f5d6d6a3d24b0b70c25404,Brothers in Bollywood’s arms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Brothers-in-Bollywood%E2%80%99s-arms/article17192168.ece,2017-02-04,"Despite an age difference of only four years, Ronit and I have never been on backslapping terms, says actor Rohit Roy as he waits for his brother to wrap up a shoot. Lounging on the couch of his vanity van, Rohit says, I was 14 when our father passed away, and Ronit took on the role. It is only recently that we have become friendly. The brothers recently shared the screen in the Hrithik Roshan-starrer Kaabil , their first film together, although they collaborated on television a few years back.Real to reelIn Kaabil, the Roy siblings reprise their off-screen equation as Rohit plays a spoilt brat brother to Ronits corrupt local corporator, a role he had refused when Sanjay Gupta first approached him as it was too negative. Until this film, Rohit had never played a baddie and wasnt sure if the audience would accept him in such a role. Rakesh Roshan and Sanjay Gupta were surprised when I conveyed my decision, he says. They couldnt understand my reservations.A friend intervened and convinced him to take it up, as it would help him explore his acting range. In fact, I called up my brother and asked him to refuse his role too, laughs Rohit.This is when Ronit walks into the vanity van, dressed as a police officer. Coincidentally, the actor was supposed to play the role of the senior cop in Kaabil when Gupta first narrated the script to him. I was over the moon when the director gave me Madhavrao Shelars role instead, as it was a better fleshed-out role, says Ronit.While the Roys share a mutual love for cinema, their personalities are as distinctive as chalk and cheese. Ronit was never into academics, while his younger brother was a bookworm. Rohit would refer to Ayn Rand while I read Archie comics, says Ronit, adding that his initiation into world cinema came only after he joined the film industry. When I became an actor, I used to feel very incompetent. At film parties, people would throw around names like Scorsese and Brando and I was clueless [about] who they were, he says. I didnt even know who Robert De Niro was.At that time, Ronit was also coming out of a failed marriage. Suddenly, there was little work and I had nothing to do. It was the early 90s and India was on the brink of the satellite television explosion. Ronit used this forced sabbatical to educate himself. I made a list of pathbreaking films and made sure I watched two-three every night.Bollywood callingEver since their formative years, Ronit was determined to make a career in Hindi cinema, while Rohit was keen to pursue an MBA in the U.S. The younger Roy remembers visiting Mumbai for his visa interview, and this is when he first dropped in on his brothers film sets. Ronit was shooting a song sequence for his debut, Jaan Tere Naam, with co-star Farheen. The shot required him to jump into the pool in his trunks. When I saw him giving that shot, I burst out laughing, much to his embarrassment. When I returned home, I told my mother that her elder son is a lafanga and is working in objectionable films, grins Rohit, whose U.S. dreams were squashed when his visa wasnt processed in time.Soon enough, Rohit was in Mumbai to try his luck in films too, despite his brothers firm disapproval to the career choice.All of us wanted him to take up a more secure job. I have struggled a lot. Ive stayed hungry, washed dishes in hotels and run miscellaneous errands to survive. I didnt want him to go through the same ordeal, says Ronit.But his brother didnt pay any heed to the advice. In 1993, we had gone to a college in Guwahati for a show. Ronits first film was declared a hit at the time, while I had just begun shooting for a film with Shilpa Shetty. The auditorium boomed with applause when Ronit danced to his hit numbers from Jaan Tere Naam, but when Rohit went on stage, the audience reaction was comparatively underwhelming. Ronit was more disturbed than me about the disappointing response I received. While we were waiting at the airport, he quietly warned me to reconsider my career choice. At that time, I wasnt mature enough to understand that he was dissuading me out of concern, Rohit says.Success storiesAfter a few odd jobs in various films, Rohit landed the lead role of Rishabh Malhotra in Swabhimaan, one of the most popular Indian television shows of all time. The producers had approached his then-girlfriend (now wife) Mansi Joshi for a role, but she wasnt keen to work on a daily show. I heard her naming Mahesh Bhatt and Shobhaa De on a call and decided to ask for a role. My audition didnt go well and I was rejected by the panel of directors. I was told that Shobhaa wanted someone more mature and intense.By chance, Bhatt came across Rohits audition reel and asked the team to call him for another audition. While fastforwarding the tape, my red jacket caught his attention. They gave me a soliloquy scene, where I was standing in front of my fathers dead body. I had lost my own father a few years ago, so it wasnt a difficult scene to relate to, says Rohit whose portrayal of a righteous attorney in Swabhimaan made him a household name .It was Rohits first brush with stardom and expectedly, film offers followed. Bhatt saab signed me for a film which also had Saif (Ali Khan) and Twinkle (Khanna), but it never got made. I did another with Raj Sippy, which didnt work at the box office. A spate of such films followed and for eight to 10 years, I had no work, says Rohit.At the same time, Ronits career trajectory in Bollywood went through a similar slump. Following the success of Jaan Tere Naam (1992), the actor played insignificant roles in Hindi films such as Sainik (1993) and Army (1996) and featured in TV shows such as Baat Ban Jaye , before landing his career-altering TV break in Ekta Kapoors Kasautii Zindagi Kay . As the respectable Rishabh Bajaj, Ronit became a household name, and his popularity skyrocketed when he stepped in to essay Mihir Virani in Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi , when he replaced Amar Upadhyay on the show.The role also fuelled his return to films. Even though my performance in Udaan (2010) was appreciated , I wasnt flooded with offers. As a result, declining a role or a script that carries a fat paycheck with it becomes a struggle, especially if you dont have anything else in hand, says Ronit.His brother, who has also experienced the grind, remembers the pitfalls of the profession. Television has also been through a massive churn since I started out. I remember, once the crew of a TV show Ronit starred in came to shoot a close-up shot when he was hospitalised and was on a drip. It is abysmal.While the brothers recent outing in Sanjay Guptas Kaabil is their third collaboration, Rohits association with the filmmaker began when a chance meeting led to him being cast in Plan (2004) . A publicist asked me to host a press conference for Sanjay Gupta, who had just made Kaante (2002). So I had created an entire show flow for the press conference, which was attended by the likes of Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjay Dutt. Sanjay (Gupta) was impressed and offered me the film. After Plan , he also cast me in Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007), says Rohit.Sanjay never ever stopped me from doing a scene the way I wanted to. Ronit usually quizzes his directors a lot about his character and while filming Kaabil, Sanjay and I would pull his leg, saying,  Kitne sawaal poochta hai . On the contrary, I didnt have any questions about my character, says Rohit, who is now working towards making a film with his brother in the lead. He had directed the short film Rice Plate as part of Dus Kahaniyaan (2007), and is still scripting a middle-aged love story. But for now, he would like to concentrate on acting."

There 10 holes and sea water has entered the deck. The ship was almost in a situation of sinking as the anchor broke because of sea swell and high wind speeds Reacting swiftly to the ship in distress, two other ships of Indian sailors went to their rescue and ensured that it drifted to the shore where it has been grounded.Captain of the ship Pratap Ananya cannot start the ship engine as the generator room has been filled with water. All their food provisions, including rice bags and flour bags have come under water. For the last 12 hours, the nine crew members have barely eaten except for being able to make some tea.Around midnight, the achor of the ship got cut off due to the swell in the sea. As the situation was turning to be critical, two ships went to their rescue and helped them to the shore. ""It was rough weather and we saw that they needed help,"" said captain Anoop Pathak of MV Salem said. The wind speed was 55 km/hour and the sea swell was 2.2 metre. As a result, the anchor rope of MV Rock broke.When contacted, Captain Pratap Ananya of MV Rock told TOI from his ship at Ajman that the ship was not being allowed to come into the port. That will need the owner's permission. If the crew members make any attempt to get to the port they will be arrested, is what they have been told by the owner.MV Rock has been 'grounded' in the sense that it's bottom has touched the ground in the sea. The anchor has got cut off. And it is not even being pulled back to the shore. The owner Dr Ahmed ostensibly does not want the crew to come back to land. He has informed the captain that he will send the required provisions, provide anchor and get the ship pushed back into the sea.The ship used to transport oil for the owner but there is nothing in it right now. The ship, along with three other ships, have simply been anchored. There are 41 Indian sailors in four ships.""None of the crew members want to get back into the sea. We want to be taken to the port and we want to leave for India. We are asking the owner to settle our salary dues. We are in dangerous situation,"" Captain Ananya Pratap.Since early on Sunday morning, Captain Anoop Pathak, the captain of another ship been sending SOS messages in twitter. Informing about the conditions of Captain Ananya Pratap's ship MV Rock, he said in a series of tweets: ""Can't start generator because of water on deck. Please contact Ananya on +971568219303.They need help immediately. Please send someone to help Pratap Ananya and his crew and check ship conditions. They need help. Please rescue them. Please do something for Rock and its crew. Rock can't start generator because of water on deck. This is an emergency please someone help to get them to port. They are grounded and ship has full of water on deck and engine room. Owner says if they come on land police will arrest them. Please don't let them die. Take them to port and let them stay there until our case is solved."""

58f5d7a6a3d24b0b70c25453,Nilambur teak set to enter elite club of products with GI tag,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/Nilambur-teak-set-to-enter-elite-club-of-products-with-GI-tag/article17280500.ece,2017-02-10,"Nilambur teak, internationally known for its superior quality and elegant appearance, will soon be added to the list of Kerala produces with the Geographical Indication (GI) tag.The effort to obtain the GI status for this unique timber variety, pioneered by the IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Cell of the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) with the support of the Nilambur Teak Heritage Society, the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) and the Department of Forests, is set to bear fruit within a month. It was the Britishers who identified the superior quality of teak from Nilambur plantations and forests. Later, the region became the major supplier of quality teak in the world.Global appealAs its fame crossed the seven seas, Nilambur was christened the Mecca of Teak. Tonnes of timber, blessed with superior mechanical and physical properties as well as incomparable aesthetic appearance, were taken to London and other parts of the world. The Nilambur-Shoranur Railway line was laid for transporting the teak logs. However, fake products with false tags started flooding the wood/ furniture markets as the fame of Nilambur teak increased. Understanding the potential risk, the IPR Cell and the College of Forestry of Kerala Agricultural University motivated the people of Nilambur to protect their rights legally, by registering the unique product as a Geographical Indication under the GI Act.The Nilambur Teak Heritage Society joined hands with the Kerala Agricultural University to register Nilambur teak as a GI product of India. The IPR Cell of KAU coordinated the legal procedures. Scientific studies to validate the unique qualities of Nilambur teak were done at KAU's College of Forestry. The KFRI Centres at Peechi and Nilambur and the Kerala Forest Department also supported the venture.The preparations for registering Nilambur teak were initiated with a workshop of stakeholders organised by KAU in 2013. The application for GI registration was submitted to the GI Registry, Chennai, in December 2015. The modalities completed, the formality of bestowing the GI tag on Nilambur teak is expected at the next sitting of the Registry, according to KAU sources. Members of Nilambur Teak Heritage Society, Coordinator of KAUs IPR Cell and experts from the College of Forestry have been asked to attend the sitting at the GI Registry, scheduled for the end of February.GI registration of Pokkali rice, one of the first Kerala produces to get the GI tag, meanwhile, has been renewed. The registration is normally valid for 10 years. Other Kerala products with GI registration include Vazhakulam Pineapple, Wayanadan rice varieties Jeerakasala and Gandhakasala, Tirur Betel vine, Central Travancore Jaggery and Chengalikodan Nendran, a banana variety."

As Pusa Institute is situated in Delhi, there has been continuous development of agriculture in the adjoining States like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. Two more agricultural research institutes, in Assam and Jharkhand, have been opened for the holistic development of agriculture nationwide, he said.Because of the adoption of crop varieties developed by Pusa Institute, meaningful and multiple changes had come about, he said. Earlier, we depended on other countries for grain, but now we are helping other countries by providing [them] food security. With the cultivation on 10 million hectares of wheat varieties developed by the IARI, 50 million tonnes of wheat was being produced. Basmati rice accounts for Rs. 22,000 crore in the agricultural exports totalling Rs. 1 lakh crore, and of this, the Basmati varieties developed by Pusa Institute account for 90%, he said.A state-of-the-art automated phenomics facility, established by the IARI, would be useful in studying the environmental stress. This facility will be used for developing plants that yield more by consuming less water and fertilizer, he said.Mr. Singh said the ICAR-IARI had developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective technology for making waste water pollution-free and useful for irrigation."

VINAYA KUMARHundreds of women took part in the Kalamkanippu mahotsavam at the Plalakkunnu Bhagavathi temple, near Udma, on Friday. The women carried raw food items in earthen pots on their heads as an offering to propitiate the deity.The women, hailing from the dominant Ezhava community, visit the temple, situated adjacent to the Kanhangad-Kasaragod State highway at Plalakkunnu, after observing fast for a number of days. They carry raw food articles along with betel leaf and areca nuts and tender coconut leaves.Other communitiesWomen from other communities in and around the region, too, could make the offering to the deity by entrusting the food items to their acquaintances from the Ezhava community.The devotees were served raw rice porridge along with pickles in the shrine, also unique for its tastefully engraved architectural dome akin those in Tamil Nadu.Although the temple is widely known for the Bharani mahotsavam held in the Malayalam month of Kumbham, in the last week of February, the kalamkanippu ritual is similar to Attukaal Pongala in south Kerala.Though women are considered an integral part of the annual ritual, the temple authorities do not prevent men also from taking part in the event.After segregating the raw food produce, the temple authorities take painstaking efforts to prepare the delicacies strictly abiding by the set conventions and distribute the prasadam to the participant devotees the following day."
