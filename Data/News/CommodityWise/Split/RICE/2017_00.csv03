All vegetables at Re 1 a kg. These are the rates at which Gautam Budh Nagar farmers are selling their harvest to middlemen and retailers at the sabzi mandi (weekly farmer's market) in Jewar. The middlemen truck the produce to faraway mandis, while the small vendors cart their daily buy to local markets. Like the rest of India, here in Jewar, , despite a good harvest, there are no takers for the produce.Distraught farmers blame the market meltdown on demonetisation . There's a glut, but procurement prices have crashed over the last two months. With cash flow still disrupted, farmers are selling at throw-away rates.Local vendors on carts and at roadside stalls are selling vegetables at Rs 5-8 per kg. ""What we are picking up from farmers is selling very slowly. People are not buying much. Most farmers are selling produce at Rs 1-2 per kg,"" said Baleshwar, a middleman. Jewar farmers are selling produce in Palwal in Haryana or Bulandshahr, with few bringing their produce to the wholesale market at the SEZ II, Noida, he added.Vendor Md Salim said he has bought 50kg of potatoes at Rs 250 from a middleman. He has tomatoes, potatoes, carrots and seasonal fruits on his cart. Over a week, he expected to sell the potatoes at Rs 7/kg and carrots at Rs 10/kg, giving him an average profit of Rs 2/kg of vegetables sold, and an overall profit of Rs 300-500.Some farmers claimed the crash will continue affecting them for several months, as winter is when they make a clean profit, which helps them tide over the year's uncertainties.""We're ruined. Some farmers are so frustrated, they're dumping truckloads of cabbages or tomatoes by the roadside, or selling at rock-bottom prices. Urad and arhar dal growers haven't even recovered their investment,"" said Mahender Singh, vice-president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and a resident of Jewar.""In 2015, we sold urad dal at Rs 10,000 per quintal. This year, we sold at Rs 4,800. From Rs 9,000 per quintal last year, arhar dal is down to Rs 3,500. Sugarcane growers haven't received payments for four months. A quintal of rice is going for Rs 2,100. Yesterday, a tractor of tomatoes went for Rs 20. This morning, cabbage went for Rs 10 for 10 kg,"" Singh added.TOI caught Singh and other farmers discussing current affairs in Charauli, a five-minute-drive from Neemka, the model village adopted by BJP MP and Union minister Mahesh Sharma. Charauli is one of the many villages which falls under Jewar's shelved airport project.At Mahesh's house in Charauli, where the farmers had gathered, tons of unpolished rice can be seen rotting. Jewar doesn't have a rice mill. ""We've not been able to sell the kharif crop for four months,"" said Rakesh Nambardar, former district BJP president.In desperation, farmers are pinning their hopes on the upcoming assembly polls. ""Either we get a good price for the produce, or facilities for food processing and cold storage. Even our money is locked in banks. How are we going to survive?"" said BKU's Singh."

As Jharkhand's administrative machinery observed World TB Day on Friday at a city hotel, Rai said the nutrition cell should be formed under the monitoring of the state health, health education and family welfare department.""Many TB patients are poor and cannot afford a nutritious diet. My department can only supply wheat, rice and sugar, and that only to the ration card holders,"" Rai said. ""There must be a cell that looks after their nutrition,"" Rai said.Rai's comment came after the annual TB status report of Jharkhand, compiled and unveiled by the state wing of the revised national tuberculosis program (RNTCP), showed a rise in the number of fresh TB cases in 2016. The RNTCP report said more than 36,000 new TB cases were recorded at government and private hospitals last year  roughly 3,000 more than 2015.The report, which pointed out the lack of nutritious diet among TB patients, also stated that the state's TB burden at this time is a little over 4.6 lakh with rising numbers of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases. While 16,000 MDR-TB-suspected patients have been screened, more than 1000 MDR-TB cases have been recorded.Dr. Pravin Chandra, director-in-chief of the state health services, on Friday stressed on the need to deploy more cartridge based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) machines in every hospitals (block, sub-divisional, district and medical colleges) for quick diagnosis of MDR-TB machines. ""The machines have been provided with help from the Union health ministry. This will reduce the time taken to properly diagnose a MDR-TB patient and put him in the correct line of treatment,"" Chandra said."

KRS dam is reaching the dead storage mark during summer which is not even sufficient for supplying water for drinking purposes. The monsoon has also become unpredictable. There is severe drought situation in more than 15 districts in the state.The release of water from dams to agricultural lands through canals is also failing, as 30 % of the water evaporates while around 30 % percolates into the ground. Only 30 % will reach the agriculture land. This is not benefiting farmers. Farmers have to adopt technologies to yield more crops using less water,"" he said.Centre not developedShivanna said that the research center in Naganahalli, which is celebrating its centenary, has not developed as expected. ""It is in a 45 acre land and we need at least 150 acres for taking up various research activities. Even though the center is promoting organic farming through training and workshops for farmers, the lack of water facilities and inadequate land at the center is hindering its progress,"" he said.Shivanna said that the university will submit a proposal to CM Siddaramaiah for the development of the center.Talking about food production, Shivanna said that by 2030 the population of the country will reach 160 crore which is expected to overtake China. ""Only through integrated farming, the country can meet the demand for the overgrowing population of the country,"" he said.Agriculture department commissioner G Satish released the centenary booklet.

We tell you all about this interesting tale of compassion...The policemen have recently put up several birdhouses on the trees in the vicinity. One of the cops, Ramesh Rokde , says, ""Over the past few days, some birds have made their homes in these shelters. When we see them carrying twigs or grass, we are as excited as them and share this information with one another. We also share our rice and rotis with these beautiful friends."" Sonegaon Police station is located amidst a green and serene arena and it is in close proximity to the Sonegaon Lake, where a lot of birds, including the migratory ones, find shelter during the winter season. To protect them from harsh weather, the cops have put up many bird houses at the trees. In-charge of the police station, Sanjay Pande , shares, ""It is so satisfying to see at least some of the birds find a cozy home in this chilling weather. There are so many colourful birds who are making nests in these birdhouses now and it gives us immense pleasure to be around them.""""To begin with, we have kept 10 bird houses. And seeing the way, birds are responding to these warm and inviting shelters, we will add 10 more by January 26. Later, we may extend this endeavour to outside the police station too,"" says Pande. He goes on to add, ""We plan to turn these shelters into permanent homes for the neighbourhood birds. Even though some of the migratory birds may leave Nagpur, there will be a lot of resident birds who would need these shelters in the severe summer months in the city.""The man, who has started this movement to protect the birds by donating birdhouses to various institutions, Rajesh Tijare , reveals rather shyly, ""I make these bird houses and give them to various institutions and individuals so that I can give something back to this world. Till now I have donated more than 500 birdhouses in the city. Birds can't express their agony. They are an integral part of our eco-system, so this is my way of doing my bit for the nature."""

Vakula Devi, headmistress of Government Primary School in Nagula Malyala village, said that she was suspended for no fault of hers. I tasted the food as per norms and ensured that all the 67 students ate the midday meal. However, in the evening five students complained of vomiting. Later 21 others also had the same complaint. We immediately shifted them to hospital for treatment and all have recovered, she stated.A government school headmaster said that the supervision of midday meal scheme was taking away their entire half day of school hours. The headmaster suggested that the government should distribute rice to the students instead of serving midday meals at the schools. Simply put an end to the complaints of teachers eating the midday meals denying the same to the students by distributing rice of equal quantity to students, he opined.Karimnagar Gazetted Headmasters Association president C. Pradhyunma Kumar said that the teachers are meant for teaching. Our services should not be utilised for supervision of midday meals. If the government was very serious of serving midday meals, then it should appoint a private agency or NGO for the distribution of food in the school, he said and appealed to the government to relieve the headmasters of the job of supervising midday meals.Lok Satta district president N. Srinivas said the headmistress of Nagula Malyala village school was not directly involved in the preparation of midday meals. As institutional head, the administration should have issued showcause notice or memo instead of suspension, he said and added that the suspension of headmistress for no fault of hers would affect her career. He urged the authorities concerned to revoke the suspension as it would affect the morale of all the headmasters of government schools."

The traditional barter system has returned to the valley across the Assam-Meghalaya border and has brought food, fun and festivity with it. Khasi women have been coming down from the hills of the neighbouring state to exchange their products - especially farm-fresh vegetables - with the residents of villages on the outskirts of the city. In return, they take home with them paddy and pithaguri (pound rice). For the hill-dwellers of Jirang in Ri-bhoi district, paddy is worth its weight in gold. And since demonetisation was announced on November 8, the barter system, too, is no longer just an archaic practice.Sirin Mawthoh can testify to the benefits of the barter system. She walked down 20km to reach Loharghat to trade her pumpkins and leafy vegetables and found the response on this side of the border to be as heartening as it was 30 years ago.""A bond of love and affection has kept alive the centuries-old barter system here. I used to come to this area as a young girl in the 1980s. Even after three decades, the enthusiasm among the people remains the same. Locals here eagerly wait for us during the festive season that starts with Magh Bihu,"" said the Khasi woman.""The harvesting season has come to an end. We have plenty of rice in our granaries but buying vegetables is a costly affair for us. Apart from being a tradition, the barter system of this festive season helps us stick to our food budget. Their pumpkins and squashes are really tasty,"" said Junil Rabha, a youth of the Loharghat area.Apart from trading goods, the guests from Meghalaya are also treated to laroos and pithas by the Loharghat residents. ""We never calculate profit or loss while exchanging our goods. Hopefully, this tradition will remain forever,"" Junil said."

James, Member, Central Wetland Regulatory Authority, has said.Mr. James was addressing a workshop on Vembanad-kol wetland and climate change: Strategies for adaptation, by the Institute for Climate change Studies here on Tuesday.According to him, rising sea level would have an adverse effect on coastal wetlands. Storm surges might erode the sand bars due to which the wetlands were formed. Salinity levels might change drastically, thereby changing the ecosystem and biodiversity. Drinking water schemes at the lower end of the rivers draining to the wetland would get affected.Most importantly, rice cultivation in Kuttanad in its present form would not exist.He said the sea level might rise by 0.5 metre to 1 metre by 2100. To adapt to the situation, the water quality changes would have to be closely monitored. Climate prediction and forecasting techniques would have to be improved, socio-economic impact of climate change on water resources need to be investigated, and policies should be framed to accommodate impact of climate change.K.

Chhoti jaat ke logon ke liye karma Mahabrahmin he karte hain (only a Mahabrahmin performs the rituals for the Dalits), says Das.For upper caste Hindus, a purohit  a superior Brahmin  can perform the rituals. But for the Dalits, only a Mahabrahmin can perform the rites.Mr. Sharma, a Mahabrahmin, points to a set of miniature temple-like structures, or pitra sthana (a place for ancestors). ""This is where the Dalits build their pitra sthanas, says the priest.Farther away, there is another set of pitra sthanas. ""Those belong to the upper caste Hindus,"" he says.Status of priestsSuch is the extent of marginalisation of the Dalits that the association of the Mahabrahmins with the Dalits has earned the priests a lower status in their own Brahmin community. The Mahabrahmins function at the temple with the permission of the head priest.Ashok Nath Bhardwaj, an office-bearer at the Ganga Ram Samaj  an association of Mahabrahmins in Haridwar  said: ""The taboo associated with the Dalits is so intense that it affects us too. We perform rituals for the Dalits, so we too are treated as Dalits by other Brahmins They [other Brahmins] perform prayers for the upper caste Hindus, so they are superior, but we perform rituals for the Dalits, so we are inferior.Question of equalityThe segregation, however, goes challenged. Rajendra Ghagat, a Dalit from Haridwars Valmiki community, said: ""The practice [within the temple] is so old it has gained acceptance in the name of tradition... but, there should be equality within the temple.""For now, it seems that a person's caste will follow them into their afterlife."

But a debate on crop selection and cropping pattern also ought to happen, he said. Telangana produces more rice than it requires and it is time to discuss whether paddy should continue to be one of the primary crops in the state. Growing one kilo of rice requires 4,000 litres water. ""We need to think about our reliance on water intensive crops and consider other crops that need less water but bring better returns to farmers,"" he said.The minister also hinted at the need to review some of the laws regulating river water sharing between states. Long drawn procedural formalities in getting agreements from the riparian states only result in delays and increased project costs, he said. He said that the state has plans to store water from River Godavari and save a portion of it that goes into the sea in order to improve agriculture, fisheries and ecological health of the land.The first two phases of Mission Kakatiya, which was launched on March 12, 2015, resulted in irrigation of 15.80 lakh acres in the state over two crop seasons. This was possible with the increased storage capacity of village tanks and lakes after desilting of the water bodies. This also played a crucial role in recharging the ground water table, he said.To mark two years of Mission Kakatiya, a 'walk for water' will be held on March 22 as part of Jala Jatara , a celebration of water conservation ."

Beating the scorching heat, lakhs of devotees from different parts of the country prepared the prasadam  a mix of rice, jaggery and coconut cooked in new earthen pots and offered it to Amma. Dressed in traditional kasavu saris and set mundu, the festival witnessed several lakh of women, being part of the festival. The ceremony started off as the temple's chief priest, Brahmasree Thekkedath Parameswaran Vasudevan Bhattathiripad lighted the holy hearth inside the temple at 10.45 am.While some dedicated the sweet offering as a thanksgiving to the goddess to continue her blessings, some wished for the prosperity and health of their family. The devotees said they felt blessed when their pots with rice pudding boiled and overflew, which they consider symbolic of the acceptance of their offering by mother goddess. While some were seen praying with closed eyes and folded hands, others put korava to invoke the blessings of the goddess.Sreekumari P, a home maker from Kottarakara who offered pongala near Thampanoor says, ""This is my 10th year of offering pongala. Every year I used to come one day prior to the event and find a space near the KSRTC Central bus stand so that after the ritual I could board the bus easily. I am a mother of two daughters and they are now well settled. This time I prayed to Attukal Amma that may there be an end to hooliganism and other antisocial activities which are making the society a scary place to live in.""Meanwhile, the event also saw celebrities offering pongala. Yesteryear actress Jalaja shared her joy, saying, ""I have been offering pongala for the past seven years. I am grateful to Amma for her blessings. I haven't prayed for anything special this year. As the saying goes lokah samastah sukhino bhavantu, I prayed for happiness and well being to everyone in the world.""Though at the event we spotted regulars such as actress Sona Nair, Chippy, Chithra Shaji Kailas and singer Rajalakshmi, unlike previous years,we could not see many celebrities this time."

The next one is expected to be a vote-on-account.He announced the setting up of Saviruchi mobile canteens in all 30 districts through the Stree Shakti self help groups, a mid-day meal scheme for 12 lakh pregnant women, milk supply to the over a crore school and anganwadi children five days a week and eggs to the malnutrition-hit anganwadi children twice a week.""Darkness will not cast on the future of the land where women and children are the focus of development.This is a simple truth which I have found out by experience,"" he said. There was much thumping among the treasury benches for the proposed laptops for 1.5 lakh students entering government and aided medical, engineering and degree colleges, but the loudest cheers were reserved for the announcement of 49 new taluk, welcomed with celebrations across the state.Siddaramaiah, however, did not announce the much-anticipated loan waiver for the drought-hit farmers, though he gave in to the demand to increase free rice under the flagship Anna Bhagya scheme from 5 to 7 kgs.""Let Yeddyurappa (state BJP chief) and Jagadish Shettar (opposition leader) fight for the state's rights at the Centre. I asked the PM (Narendra Modi) to waive 50% of commercial bank loans and said I would match it in cooperative loans.If they can waive farmers loans in Uttar Pradesh, why can't they do it here?"" he asked, in a combative post-budget press conference.He came down harshly on the PM's demonetisation drive. ""Any public policy, apart from the purpose of achieving the intended target, should also be very efficient in its execution.Demonetisation caused huge amount of distress to the public but the Union Government is yet to disclose what outcome has been achieved by it.""Siddaramaiah, who had earlier stated that black money constituted hardly 0.002% of the country's economy, said: ""While the need for demonetisation itself is debatable, I think that the Union Government and the Reserve Bank of India could have at least foreseen the exigencies and could have put in practical and robust systems in place to insulate the common man from these hardships.""He announced policies in line with the Centre's decision to implement the GST and do away with the distinction between plan and non-plan expenditure."

The report also said apart from paddy, pulses acreage has also declined to 8.7 lakh acres as against 9.85 lakh acres last year. Even coarse cereals coverage was lower at 8.88 lakh acres from 10.58 lakh acres, while oilseeds coverage fell to 95,000 acres from 2.23 lakh last year. Total rabi crop coverage was 37.7 lakh acres, down by 30% from 53.55 lakh acres in the last period.Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that the report should goad the Union government to announce TN as a drought-hit state. ""This has happened not only because of failure of monsoon but also due to water not flowing in the Cauvery,"" Vimalnathan stressed. Only a combination of ground water, Cauv ery water and monsoon can ensure a good harvest. But this year all the three failed in Tamil Nadu, said general secretary of Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers' Welfare Association Mannargudi S Ranganathan.""The report has clearly said that the failure of monsoon has impacted our neighbouring states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh but not to the extent of Tamil Nadu. So if the Union government will announce Tamil Nadu as drought-hit based on the reality and ICAR report, we will be happy,"" he added.Ministers who visited and assessed crop damage and water condition in delta districts had promised relief to farmers.

People believe that eating guava during cough and cold worsens it. However, the fruit is rich in vitamin C which builds immunity.""Kumar also highlighted the ill effects of consuming junk food which is unhealthy and leads to a number of lifestyle diseases.Another dietitian Sanjay Kumar Mishra, who works with a private city hospital, said there was only a 4% difference between the amount of carbohydrates found in rice and chapati. ""Both food items have similar carbohydrate levels, but different nutritional value. It is the quantity one consumes that affects one's health,"" he added.A dietitian assesses the nutritional status of a patient in a clinical setting and develops diet plans accordingly. Dietetic association secretary Sudhakar Mishra said, ""At a time when diseases like obesity and diabetes have become so common, more dietitians need to be appointed across the state. Other than some government hospitals in Bihar, most health institutions have not realized how important the role of a dietitian is.""Over 100 PMCH nurses and dietitians from different hospital of the city participated in the workshop."

The prices are marginally higher in comparison to those at Amma Canteens in Tamil Nadu, where an idli costs Rs 1, curd rice Rs 3 and rice with sambhar Rs 5. However, the success of Jayalalithaa's populist initiative (launched when she was CM) had as much to do with the standards of hygiene that were maintained there, as they did with the prices. From villagers to corporates to the underprivileged, the canteens drew people from all sections of the society.However, there was no clarity on whether only the urban poor could avail of the subsidized food at the canteens. However, considering the record of the city's civic agencies in maintaining roads, schools, primary health centres and public lavatories, there are apprehensions over the levels of hygiene that will be maintained at these canteens. They will be called Saviruchi Sanchari canteens."

The government is trying to push such products through government schemes to counter problems like stunting, overweight and anaemia, which are the major causes of maternal and child deaths. The FSSAI standards detail specific measurements for fortification.For instance, any manufacturer that fortifies food would have ensure that the level of micronutrients does not fall below the minimum specified by the central food regulator.The standards also make it mandatory for the manufacturers to follow certain fortification procedures.Fortified food items would also have to carry a logo approved by the FSSAI and mention the nutrient content on their pack.According to the standards, fortified atta (flour) should contain added iron, folic acid and Vitamin B12. Apart from this, it may also be fortified with zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin B1, Vitamin B2, and Vitamin B6.A separate set of rules dictates how 'maida' should be fortified -with iron, folic acid and Vitamin B12. Likewise, fortified rice should contain added iron, folic acid and Vitamin B12. The level of fortification has been specified as well.The FSSAI standards would ensure that essential nutrients are appropriately added to foods for preventing or reducing the risk of, or correcting, a demonstrated deficiency of one or more essential nutrients in the population or a specific population group.The regulator has also asked the manufacturers and packers of fortified food to give an undertaking on quality assurance, and submit evidence on steps taken in regard to fortification.All fortified food, whether voluntarily fortified or mandatorily, should be manufactured, packed, labelled, handled, distributed and sold, whether for profit or under a government-funded programme, only in compliance with the standards specified under the provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, and the regulations made thereunder."

U.S. soybeans pushed further away from a near three-month low hit earlier in the week, while corn prices gained for a third day in a row. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract had climbed 0.3 percent to $4.37-1/2 a bushel by 0322 GMT, having closed up 1.3 percent on Wednesday. Soybeans added 0.4 percent to $10.02-1/4 a bushel and corn advanced 0.5 percent to $3.65-1/4 a bushel. ""There is dry and cold weather in the U.S. which could reduce yields. If wheat prices remain low, then there are strong chances of U.S. farmers reducing acreage,"" said Rajesh Singla, head of agriculture research at Societe Generale. ""For soybeans, the market's focus is on U.S. planting intentions."" The dollar was at a one-month low early on Thursday after the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, as expected, but signalled no pick-up in the pace of tightening. A weaker dollar makes greenback-priced commodities cheaper for importers holding other currencies. Gains in the wheat market were capped as Egypt's state grain buyer said it would purchase Russian, French and Ukrainian wheat, again shunning U.S. supplies. Favourable weather ahead of spring sowing in Black Sea grain producers Russia and Ukraine is boosting hopes of a large harvest, analysts, officials and traders said, although it will likely fall short of last year's record. The soybean market came under pressure on Wednesday on signs of slower U.S. demand. The National Oilseed Processors Association in the United States said its members crushed a smaller-than-expected 142.792 million bushels of soybeans in February, the smallest monthly total since September. Analysts said the plentiful global soybean supply outlook would continue to drag on prices, with a record crop expected in Brazil and new indications U.S. farmers will raise soybean production for next season.

The bill is in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's mission for housing for all by 2022, and will be presented in the assembly during the second phase of the Budget session beginning March 20. With 18 months to go for the assembly polls, it could have a significant impact on the ground.Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, water resources minister and government spokesman Narottam Mishra said, ""It is a great day for this government. A historic bill has been ratified by the Cabinet for the benefit of the deprived and homeless, the landless poor of the state. Through the new law, the government will give guarantee to all such persons born in Madhya Pradesh to have a home of their own. The land to make a roof over their head will be given by the government as a guarantee.""Lakhs of homeless and landless citizens will benefit from the new law, which is likely to be enacted by the end of this month, said the minister. He could not give any details on the exact number of beneficiaries and acquisition of land for distribution. ""The BJP government has provided a wholesome 'thali' meal at Rs 5 for the poor. People living below poverty line get wheat, rice and salt at Re 1 per kg. And now the poor will get a plot of land for a home from the government,"" he said.Asked how much land will be required and how much the scheme will cost, Mishra said, ""The finer points of the bill are being worked out. But the state government has a land bank. If we fall short of land for distribution, the government will purchase it.""Contrary to claims of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, this is not the first time a state government has taken the initiative to distribute land to the poor in MP. In 2002, as part of then Congress chief minister Digvijaya Singh's Dalit Agenda, the government decided to distribute its 'charnoi' (grazing land) to Dalits and tribals. Huge tracts of government-owned land were distributed a year-and-half before the November 2003 assembly polls. The calculation was to consolidate the 15% Dalit and 21% tribal vote bank for Congress.When ballot boxes opened, Digvijaya's caste arithmetic had backfired. Congress lost nearly all 82 tribal and SC reserved assembly seats, and the party shrunk to just 38 MLAs in a House of 230."

Makar Sankranti is when the sun moves towards the north, signalling an auspicious period. Yesterday, Punjabis in the city observed Lohri with fervour, while today Maharashtrians and south Indians will celebrate sankranti adhering to ritualistic norms. While traditions may differ for each family, several rituals observed by people are similar.The day is commemorated with preparation of sweet dishes at homes. Sujata Kothari, a Tamil, says that a preparation of Sakkara pongal, a sweet rice preparation made of jaggery, is common among Tamils to mark the beginning of calendar. ""The first food should be good for stomach and should give heat in the winter. Dal and jiggery used in pongal does that,"" she said, adding that bhogi is the first batch of agricultural produce offered to God.For Telugu, it's the Bhogi festival today, where Burelu, dumplings made of chana dal and jaggery is a traditional Andhra dish prepared for the occasion, apart from pongal. Vipin Sood, a Punjabi, says kheer chawal is a must at his household every Lohri. ""Sarson Ka saag is also a dish we have each year this time. This is the season where heavy food items are easily digested, and such food items help generate heat in the body,"" he says. Similarly, til gud chikki, a preparation of sesame seeds and jaggery, has become synonymous to Makar Sankranti not just for Maharashtrians, but all communities.When it comes to customs, these aren't very different either. ""We make rangolis of chariot,"" says Pushpa Anand, a Tamil. CV Ramakrishna, an Andhraite, shares that his family also makes rangolis, and sit around a bonfire. Bonfire is a big part of Lohri too. 'Revdi', 'makhaana', peanuts and popcorn are offered to the fire. ""For Punjabis, a newly married couple moves around the bonfire, followed by others. 'Sundar Mundariye' is a traditional Lohri song we sing every year, and we sing and dance around the bonfire,"" says Stuti Pincha, a Punjabi. For Telugus, the bonfire resembles a pyre where they attempt to burn all unwanted things and desires,"" says Anand.Tamils and Maharashtrians celebrate Haldi Kumkum on similar lines. ""For Tamils, it is of prime importance for a mother to send money to her daughter during this time. We also give betel nut, kanjeevaram sari, betel leaves, turmeric, mirror, comb, kajal, and other things of use to a married woman. For pregnant ladies, we give black saris,"" adds Anand. Meenakshi Deopujari, a Maharashtrian, says, ""We observe 'sugdyachi vaan' where several items like bindi, bangles and other things are exchanged among married women in earthen pots. For Keralites, sankranti is the culmination of eeklong celebrations of lord Ayyapa's special day, informs Kartika nair, a Keralite, adding, ""we wear traditional saris, organize a feast, and have lamps lit all around the temple, along with taking part in traditional pujas."""

However, the Right to Education Act found no mention in the speech.The upcoming academic year will include techniques to impart effective learning of English language from Class 1 onwards.

Nearly 1.5 lakh students studying in medical, engineering, polytechnic and first-grade colleges will receive free laptops. In 2014, the government had proposed to distribute free laptops to students of I and II PUC and close to 10.5 lakh students were supposed to benefit from the scheme. However, then minister for primary and secondary education, Kimmane Ratnakar had said that the government decided to drop the scheme as it would have cost the state exchequer a whopping Rs 300 crore.Raichur University will become a reality soon and hugely benefit students from across colleges in the Karnatak-Hyderabad region. All colleges in Raichur and Yadgir districts will be brought under this university.Despite the lower allocation, the higher education department is setting up 23 girls hostel in polytechnic college at a cost of Rs 2 crore each in an attempt to improve the Gross Enrolment Ratio.

Though agriculture and allied sectors recorded a growth rate of 1.43% in 2012-13 of the 12th plan period, it witnessed a negative growth rate during the following three years ending at a -2.9% decline in 2015-16,"" the review said.The price variability , it said, has increased with sharp swings in both product and input prices. ""Markets have been affected by macroeconomic factors and adverse weather conditions. Extreme weather conditions like drought and other climate variabilities have had a major impact on the agricultural sector,"" the review pointed out.Citing Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) report which put the rainfall deficiency in Kerala at 34% and 61% during south-west and north-east monsoon season respectively , the review said the state needed to improve its irrigation network to equip itself for adverse weather conditions.The water storage in drams has also registered a signifiant drop.""The state has taken measures for rejuvenating agriculture, and among those on the anvil are increased public investment in agriculture, promotion of self-sufficiency in production of vegetables, protection of paddy fields and improving research and extension services,"" it said.Elaborating on various crops, the review said the rice production has not re sponded positively to interventions through state plan and RKVY, calling for more proactive steps. Among the major initiatives for promotion of rice during 2016-17 were upland rice cultivation in 2,520 hectares, amendment in paddy landwetland conservation act, cultivation in fallow lands and special projects in Aranmula punja.In case of coconut, there has been a decline in production from 5,947 million nuts to 5,873 million nuts between 2014-15 and 2015-16. The major reasons were prevalence of root wilt disease, poor crop management and existence of senile and unproductive palms. Pepper production also affected by low productivity and various diseases, while declining price of rubber was a cause of concern, which calls for `strengthening and reorientation of price stabilisation fund'.The stress, the review said, should also be on collective farming through Kudumbashree and promotion of organic farming for which strengthening of participatory guarantee system, good agriculture practices, quality control laboratories and other certification and incentive system were to be worked out."
58f5febc7be9e031f13acaf0,Lack of digital avenues compounds farmers’ woes in cashless times,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/lack-of-digital-avenues-compounds-farmers-woes-in-cashless-times/articleshow/56408148.cms,2017-01-09,"Although it has been two months since the Centre's sudden and dramatic decision to withdraw the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from circulation, there appears to be no end to the troubles of the agrarian community in the state. Cash deficit, coupled with lack of adequate infrastructure to conduct cashless transactions, threw life of farmers in Karnataka into disarray; more than 60 days after demonetization was announced, the farming community is still struggling to come to grips with the altered circumstances.Eshwaraiah Toragalmath, 48, owns four acres in Devanagav village in Sindagi taluk, Vijayapura district. Two weeks ago, he sold 25 quintals of red gram (thogaribele) at the Afzalpur market in Kalaburagi, and received an advance for his produce, in cheque. However, he has not been able to encash his cheque.This is because Toragalmath has his account in a cooperative bank that is also facing a problem of cash shortage. Restrictions imposed on district cooperative banks  they are not allowed to exchange or accept the scrapped notes  by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has affected farmers the most, since most of them have their accounts in these banks, and also take out loans from the same.Kenchappa, a farmer in Nagamangala in Mandya, opined that the RBI should focus on printing more Rs 500 notes. ""It is very hard to transact with the new Rs 2,000 note,"" he added.Besides adversely impacting transactions at wholesale markets, shortage of cash has made it hard for farmers to pay wages to labourers. ""It's become very difficult to maintain workers on the farm,"" said Revanna, a farmer from Hebya village in Nanjangud taluk, Mysuru.On the other hand, those farmers, who succeeded in reaping a good harvest despite the failure of the monsoon, have also been left in the lurch. ""Despite the drought, I was able to grow 800 quintals of onion. But, the prices crashed after demonetization was announced. I took a huge risk, but I did not get my due,""said Nagaraj, a farmerfrom Jagalur taluk in Davanagere district.The script is not dissimilar in the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada, where farmers focus largely on horticultural crops such as cashew, rubber and coconut.The Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Limited (Campco), which boasts 1.26 lakh arecanut growers among its members, has imposed a cap on daily purchase. ""Since we are not receiving money from the point of sale, we have restricted purchase of arecanut to one quintal per day. As a result, in December, the procurement was 30% to 38% lesser in comparison to what was purchased in the same period in 2015,"" said Suresh Bhandary, managing director, Campco.Demonetization only compounded the woes of the coffee cultivators, who were already reeling under the consequences of a second consecutive drought in 2016. Besides, demonetization coincided with the coffee picking season. The crippling cash shortage has made it really hard for cultivators in Kodagu, Chikkamagaluru and Hassan to hire labourers for harvesting the crop.Agents and merchants, however, are capitalising on the farmers' distress. Farmers alleged that merchants refused to lift their harvested crops, which consequently forced the ryots to sell their produce at throwaway prices. ""They complain that the cap on daily withdrawal hampers their activities,"" the farmers added.However, the e-mandi facility available at the APMC yards has helped some of the farmers cope with demonetization. Joint director of APMC, Mysuru, Mahesh said, ""We have seen more business this year. During November and December 2015, we saw transactions worth Rs 15 crore, while the figure for the same period in 2016 was Rs 22 crore.""Money In Account, Not In handKariyappa, 48, is a paddy farmer at Genekehal village in Kurugod, Ballari district. ""I sold one portion of my harvest to pay the labourers, and to make some purchases, such as buying pesticide. Although the local grameena bank gave me a cheque, I have not been able to encash it for the past 60 days,"" said Kariyappa.Thippeswamy, 32, who is involved in the cultivation of chillies in Kolur, Ballari district said, ""At the market, I sold three quintals of my crop. But I had to furnish my Aadhar Card, voter ID and bank account details before the money was transferred to my account. But, owing to cash shortage at my bank, I was not able to draw money. I cannot stand in a long queue the entire day waiting to get cash. I was forced to take out a loan to celebrate the village festival, which is commemorated once every four years.""Double jeopardy for the ryotsPrime Minister Narendra Modi's sudden decision to scrap two high denomination notes couldn't have come at a worse time for farmers. The timing of his move coincided with the harvest of the kharif crops, and the sowing period of the rabi crops. Moreover, after two successive droughts, agriculture was showing signs of recovery, following intermittent showers in December - a consequence of the cyclone, Vardah.Sowing for the rabi crop starts in the last week of October, and lasts till December. The target set by the state agriculture department for sowing during this rabi season was 2.4 lakh hectares. However, data provided by the department shows that sowing has taken place in just 34,000 hectares.Inadequate processing and storage facilities has only added to the problems of fruit and vegetable cultivators. Those involved in the cultivation and sale of these perishable commodities have been hit the hardest as a result of demonetization.Although there has been a drastic drop in the wholesale price of vegetables, the retail prices have skyrocketed, largely because farmers appear to have stopped cultivating them in the past one month. ""We expect vegetable prices to go up further in the next two months, particularly in Bengaluru,"" said Ravikanth, a wholesale vegetable trader.Fish industry in M'luru hitThe price of fish has nosedived in the aftermath of demonetization. Mohan Bengre, president of Mangaluru Purse-Siener Boat Owners Association, said, ""Demonetization, coupled with the hike in diesel prices, has really affected our business. The price of fish, which is sourced by meal companies, has gone down from Rs 20/kg to Rs 9/kg. Nearly 90% of the trawlers have not ventured into the sea lately.""Old habits die hardFarmers are largely accustomed to cash transactions, and they do not readily accept cheques, even if they may have bank accounts.

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

UBS declined to comment.Smart meter makers have seen a wave of M&A activity, with three major manufacturers up for sale in Germany alone, highlighting their significance as the energy industry goes digital and depends on live consumption data to a much greater extent.Landis+Gyr, in which Toshiba owns a 60 percent stake, employs more than 5,700 staff and is active in over 30 countries. It said last week that sales would grow by nearly 5 percent to $1.64 billion in the fiscal year ending this month, adding it was ""unaffected by Toshiba's challenges"".Toshiba announced a $6.3 billion writedown on its U.S. nuclear business last month, wiping out its shareholder equity and causing it to seek divestments to create a buffer for any fresh financial problems.It is expected to approach buyout groups including CVC, Cinven, Advent, KKR, Blackstone, Onex and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice as potential buyers of Landis+Gyr, one of the sources said, adding that industrial conglomerates were not expected to enter the fray.Toshiba bought Landis+Gyr in 2011 for $2.3 billion jointly with state-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ), which holds the remaining 40 percent in the company.The deal would value Landis+Gyr at 10-11 times its annual core earnings (EBITDA), two of the people said, in line with the 10.7 times that U.S. water technology company Xylem paid for Sensus USA Inc last year.Toshiba will try to position Landis+Gyr as a Swiss industrial group, hoping to reach EBITDA multiples similar to those of Geberit, Sulzer or Belimo, which trade at between 12-19 times.($1 = 0.9506 euros)(Editing by Susan Fenton)"

However, in Vaizawado of Shristhal, this ritual is observed on the occasion of Dinya zatra , while at the Mallikarjun temples of Goa's southernmost taluka, it is a part of the Shigmo festival.""Vaizawado's Dinya zatra is unique. The celebration involves the welcoming of the new year with folk dances and rituals in the most traditional etiquettes and behavioural patterns,"" says Devidas Gaonkar, a tribal researcher from Cotigao.The Vaizawado Velips along with the Mhala, Asalkar and Gulekar Velips are predominantly a tribal community that follow the agrarian way of life. They are devotees of the Mallikarjun temple of Shristhal.Prior to the festivities, the doors of every house in the hamlet are thrown open in welcome and guests are served a traditional vegetarian fare.For the celebration, young bachelors of the community worship a decorated stick of the Leea indica shrub, which is locally referred to as 'dinya' or 'jinea', thus explaining the etymology of the name 'Dinya zatra'. The stick is adorned with the 'husgi' (Calycopteris floribunda) flowers and tender leaves of the 'kosamb' (Schleichera oleosa) tree. The leaves and flowers are secured in place with the fibres of 'kevan' (Helicteres isora). Later the youth performs a dance in from of the shrine of Gharvai puris holding this stick in their hands. The music is played on the traditional instruments of 'dhol', 'taso' and 'zanghat'.After this, the group proceeds in procession to traditionally predesignated places to perform the dance. A type of local-martial-arts-cum-dance performance is also put up to the tune of folk music. In this, three people brandish wooden swords around their body as a symbolic depiction of their bravery. After repeating the act several times, the entire group moves to the site where the Shisharanni ritual is held.In the entire celebration, female participation is focused on pre-pubescent girls, who are supposed to light a 'divja' (lamp) made from cow dung and decorated with clam shells.At the site, which is a field, all the decorated sticks are driven into the ground and the Shisharanni ritual then follows.""Three men lie on the ground with their heads touching each other. An earthen pot with rice and water is balanced between their heads and a fire is lit beneath the pot. Once the rice is cooked, it is sprinkled in different directions by the villagers,"" says Milind Velip of Vaizawado.Folk researcher Pandurang Phaldesai explains that the ritualistic festival of Shisharanni is to recall the genocide of a Brahmin agriculture community, the Habbus, hundreds of years ago. ""The tradition may have been started in order to appease the spirits of those killed,"" he says."

The reservoir was situated in the middle of an expansive valley, nestled amid two hills and tiny rivulets of the Pamba. On a cloudless day, the temple mast of Aranmula Parthasarathy temple, exactly a kilometre away from the runway, would be visible on the northern horizon overlooking the puncha (paddy fields).The proponents of the Rs 2,000-crore project, KGS group, had maimed the lush green Karimaran hills to reclaim the 1.5km-long Aranmula reservoir and construct the runway. In one shot, KGS destroyed an ancient ecosystem, which sustained 600 acres of paddy land (the size of over 3,000 football fields) and enriched a perennial groundwater table across 30 sq km in Pathanamthitta. Residents said that restoring the reservoir is the key to revive agriculture here.Now, farmers of Aranmula and Mallappuzhassery have joined hands with state government in what could be termed as the biggest environmental initiatives in the recent past; a plan to revive a reservoir buried 15 feet deep in the airport construction debris. The long-term plan is to harvest paddy and patent it as Aranmula rice. Aranmula has become a symbol of green struggle, post the Silent Valley agitation in the early 70s.The restoration is being done in the wake of a high court order to bring back the reservoir to its original state.""It is easier said than done.The reservoir itself had shrunk over the years into a small thodu. The project proponents had also reclaimed arterial rivulets like Karimaran thodu and Kannangatu thodu which flows to Valiya thodu and then to the Pamba. When the water level of Pamba rises, the entire valley used to get irrigated,"" said J Sajeev, special officer in charge of Aranmula paddy restoration project.The valley is a thicket of weeds and wild vegetation, a large tract has been flattened with the debris from the hillock. Around 22 landless and impoverished families have pitched tents at the southern end. ""We won't ask them to move out as they are occupying a miniscule area,"" said Sajeev.Officials had attempted to dig up small water channels to restore the flow into the puncha, but they soon real ized that the reservoir is the key to rejuvenate paddy fields. A rapid impact assessment study by the Salim Ali Foundation had found that the loss of paddy fields and wetlands here would translate to a loss of Rs 335-Rs 444 crore annually if the airport had become a reality. It would result in loss of rice and fish production, 800 tonnes of paddy and 320 tonnes of fish.The report found that there were 212 species of plants, 27 of which are endemic to the Western Ghats and 110 plants that were mainly used for their medicinal properties. There were 60 species of fishes reported here, of which 42% were endemic to the Western Ghats.The farmers have now sown paddy in 20 acres at the southern end of the valley.""We have started now. The plan is to expand the paddy cultivation in the entire area by the end of this season,"" said P A Thomas, president of Thechikavu Pada Shekara Samiti.Residents too are supporting the move. ""We don't want an airport. We are happy for the first time that a state minister has shown interest in this project,"" said Sajini Mathew in whose compound fertilizers are mixed. Paddy land owners, facing a huge shortage of labour, have recruited farmhands from Kavalam in Kuttanad. ""We pay them Rs 700 a day and provide lodging facilities,"" said Thomas.Farmers will also get a percentage of Aranmula paddy after the harvest. Since most areas were acquired by the government from KGS group, paddy reaped will be sold in the open market as Aranmula rice, a novel way of not only conserving wetlands, but also improving the food security of the state.""That is how farmers used to work. They had an organic relationship with their land, getting a part of what they sowed,"" said PP Chandrashekharan, a samiti member."

Corn edged higher, rebounding from a 9-day low. Wheat gained a little ground. The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade fell 0.17 percent to $10.20 a bushel, near the session low of 10.16-3/4 a bushel - the lowest since Feb. 23. Soybeans closed down 0.34 percent on Wednesday. Analysts said forecasts of ample South American production continued to weigh on prices, though losses were checked somewhat by signs of an uptick in international demand. ""While we don't see soybeans sustaining higher prices, any downside will probably be limited by growing demand,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""China's February soybean imports, while a little lower than what the analysts had expected, were still at the highest level for the month in seven years,"" he said. The most active corn futures rose 0.3 percent to $3.73-1/4, having closed down 1 percent in the previous session, when prices hit a low of $3.71-3/4 a bushel - the lowest since Feb. 28. While edging higher, analysts said corn also continues to be pressured by production outlooks from South America. Argentina's Rosario Exchange raised its forecasts for the 2016/17 soy and corn crops on Wednesday, citing better than expected yields and improving weather in late February. The soybean crop is now seen at 56 million tonnes, up from 54.5 million tonnes previously. The Exchange's report also raised the corn crop outlook to 38 million tonnes from 36.5 million tonnes previously. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will issue its latest outlook for South American crops in a monthly report on supply and demand. Analysts on average were expecting the report to peg Brazil soy production at 105.95 million tonnes and corn output at 87.78 million tonnes. The most active wheat futures rose 0.3 percent to $4.48-1/4 a bushel, having closed down 2.1 percent on Wednesday. Farming agency FranceAgriMer increased its forecast for French soft wheat stocks this season for the second month in a row, with increased imports and reduced export prospects within the European Union outweighing improving exports elsewhere.

Corn was little changed, but the market was on track for its biggest weekly gain since October on expectations of higher ethanol production in the United States, while wheat dipped for a second session. At least 11 ships are facing delays in loading soybeans at Brazil's northern ports after rains washed out roads and disrupted the progress of trucks carrying beans from the centre-west region, Brazilian officials said on Thursday. ""The export flow may pick up again next week, provided weather conditions have allowed enough road repairs to take place,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract was on track to finish the week with a gain of 1.3 percent after two weeks of losses. Corn has risen 4.2 percent this week, its biggest weekly gain since October, while wheat was up 0.7 percent on week, rising for a second week in a row. Soybeans faced pressure on Thursday as estimates of Brazil's soy harvest continued to rise. Private analytics firm Informa Economics raised its forecast of Brazil's crop to a record-high 108 million tonnes, trade sources said, up nearly 2 million tonnes from its previous estimate. The figure is above the last monthly estimate from Brazil's government agency Conab, which put the crop at 105.6 million tonnes, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's figure of 104 million tonnes. Growing conditions in Argentina's main soy belt were helped over the previous seven days by showers in areas that had suffered from a lack of ground moisture, the Buenos Aires Grains exchange said on Thursday in its weekly crop report. Corn and soyoil futures rose earlier this week, supported in part by reports of potential changes to U.S. biofuel policy to boost production. Corn is the primary U.S. feedstock for ethanol and soyoil is used in biodiesel. A coalition of trade groups representing oil, biofuels and other interests pressed the U.S. government on Thursday to deny requests to tweak the country's biofuels program.

Corn and soybeans drew support on Tuesday on reports U.S. President Trump was preparing an executive order on ethanol, a claim denied by the White House. The head of the Renewable Fuels Association said that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration would shift the onus on combining biofuels with gasoline away from refiners, who had long requested this change to the nation's biofuel programme. ""The corn market took particular interest in that because, if realised, it could boost corn ethanol demand significantly,"" said Madeleine Donlan, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""Confusion abounded though as conflicting responses to the claims emerged."" Changes to the programme could include a waiver to allow greater volumes of ethanol to be blended into gasoline in the summer, and support for a congressional tax credit for domestic producers of soy-based biodiesel, a source said. But the White House denied that President Trump planned to issue an executive order to change the national biofuels programme. An all-time high Brazilian soybean production is also limiting gains.

One day, Ramanuja noticed that Ranganatha looked unwell. He wondered if some dietary variation was the cause for this. Learning that Ranganatha had been offered curd rice together with jamun fruits, Ramanuja said, That combination must have given him a cold. He then offered a herbal decoction to the Lord. This incident shows Ramanujas concern for the Lord, said Aravindalochanan, in a discourse.In Tirumala, there was a woman named Tudiyur Kombai. She was a supplier of dairy products. Ramanujas disciple Mudaliandan asked her how she wanted to be paid. She replied that she wanted Ramanujas signature! She explained the reason for her strange request. She had approached Lord Srinivasa for moksha and He had told her that if she had Ramanujas signature, then she would automatically enter Sri Vaikuntha. This shows the high position the Lord had accorded to Ramanuja. In Kanchipuram, there was a boy who could not speak. Suddenly he disappeared. He was around seven years of age at the time of his disappearance. Four years later, he came back. But now he was able to speak! He said he had slipped into a river, and had been carried to the ocean. From there he had been to the milky ocean. There he learnt that Adisesha had come to earth as Ramanuja. This jnana was the guarantee of moksha to the boy, for it is important to know of the Acharyas greatness to attain moksha. Ramanujas greatness is also evident from his illustrious disciples. The Acharya took Kooratazhvan and Mudaliandan with him when he went to Goshtipura for instruction. He said that an ascetic is never parted from his staff and pavitra, and these two disciples were to him like the staff and pavitra."

The Trade Mark Rules, 2017, which were notified recently, have revised the procedures and made it easier for companies to file applications for registration of sound marks, by appending an MP3 file in the application.Over the years, there have been only a handful of registrations of sound marks in Indiathe first being the 'Yahoo Yodel' of Yahoo Inc, which applied in 2004 for registration of the sound of a human voice yodelling the word 'Yahoo'. For a sound mark to be registered, the applicant needs to prove factual distinctiveness of the soundin other words, there must be a recall of the sound with the product or service.Sounds can be a corporate jingle (ICICI Bank) or the sound heard on logging into a device (Nokia).""In today's world, where people have access to various technologies, sound plays an important role in the marketing process. People associate goods or services with the sound which represents it,"" points out Vikrant Rana, managing partner, SS Rana & Co, an IP law firm.Shwetasree Majumder, co-founder, Fidus Law Chambers, agrees: ""It takes brand recognition to another level. It paves the way for asserting a trademark even when you can't use a word or a logo in a setting. In businesses that are largely intangible, registration of sound marks is certainly of value"".Traditionally, companies registered words, names, labels, acronyms, signatures with the trademark registry. Procedural challenges deterred many companies from registering sound marks. ""Prior to notification of the revised rules on March 6, an application for registration of a sound mark required the applicant to submit its graphical representation, viz: musical notations and written description. As not many people can read music, this itself was an obstacle at all stages involved in the registration processbe it examination by the trade mark registrar or opposition to its registration,"" points out Rana.The sound mark was published in the trademark journal as a graphical representation which not many people would understand and the registration certificate also consisted of the sound mark as a graphical representation, he adds.""The new rules permit applicants to attach an MP3 sound track, together with graphical representation of the musical notation, this will be helpful and will encourage companies to come forward and protect their sound marks,"" says Raja Selvam, managing attorney at law firm, Selvam and Selvam.This small but crucial change in the application procedures could see a renewed interest in registration of sound marks.- National Stock Exchange - (Theme song)- ICICI Bank - (Corporate jingle - Dhin Chik Dhin Chik)- Britannia Industries (Four note bell sound)- Cisco - (Tune heard on logging in to the conferencing service Web Ex)- Edgar Rice Burroughs - (Tarzan Yell by its toy action figure)- Nokia - (Guitar notes on switching on the device)- Yahoo -(Human voice yodelling Yahoo)"

The remaining voters belong to other communities including the Naga tribes. Nemcha got a BJP ticket after she quit Congress, as well as the state assembly, in January.Notably Kharga Tamang, who had been given a ticket by Congress, withdrew his candidature and decided to contest as an Independent from the same seat. An NPF nominee has also joined the fray, making Kangpokpi the site of a triangular contest.Taking a dig at Ibobi, Shah said 1.51 tons of rice given by the Centre had not reached beneficiaries and that there was lack of transparency in around 100 centrally sponsored schemes in the state. ""We ask him (Ibobi) to account for all the development programmes sanctioned by the Centre,"" Shah said, accusing the government of promoting corruption while hiring people in various departments.""We take this menace very seriously and will grill all corrupt persons and punish them accordingly,"" he said.Praising the natural beauty of the state, he said tourism would be boosted to generate income and fight unemployment. The BJP chief also promised to transform Manipur into an IT hub to ensure talented youths of the state did not have to go beyond the state for jobs.Stating that hill areas of the state lacked development owing to less allocation of development funds, Shah said the hills would be developed on a par with the valley within five years.Tezpur MP RP Sharma and Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who also campaigned here, urged residents of Kangpokpi to defeat Congress and bring BJP to power for all-round development in the state."
58f6c35f7be9e031f13bb5bd,Kerala budget 2017: Budget revolves around KIIFB,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/kerala-budget-2017-budget-revolves-around-kiifb/articleshow/57459340.cms,2017-03-04,"The state budget, which satisfies expectations of the majority of the population, revolves around KIIFB though it has other sources of revenue. It predicts a revenue deficit of 2.41% and a fiscal deficit of 3.44%. These are within the expected range and doesn't signal any fiscal danger in the near future.When we go into the details of the budget, we can see that KIIFB is a dream which has to become a reality. Last year, in the budget, KIIFB was projected as a special purpose vehicle. It is an SPV that is expected to mobilize resources through funding from NRIs by forming chit funds of KSFE.Through this chit funds, the finance minister wants to mobilize Rs 12,000 crore this year for various projects and ensure Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years for several infrastructural projects. The aim is to ensure a world class infrastructure sector here.But, what about the 'crushing problem' faced by the people of Kerala? The LDF had promised in its manifesto that they will arrest price hike for five years.Unfortunately, LDF failed to keep its promise.The government was unable to check the price of essential commodities, especially rice and sugar. While the retail price index in India is 3.67%, it is much above the national average in Kerala.This is against the expectations given in the budget and the LDF manifesto. LDF is trying to strengthen food security by allocating Rs 900 crore for ration subsidy and Rs 700 crore for paddy procurement. Additionally, Rs 117 crore has been sanctioned for the new rationing system.A total of Rs 1,917 crore has been set apart for food security and Haritha Keralam Mission has also been given top priority. But, we will have to wait and see whether this mission mode will resolve the price rise of essential commodities.Though Thomas Isaac has announced a gender budget, the priority given is not sufficient. He has mentioned that 11.5% of the budget allocation is for projects from which women will benefit. But this allocation is spread across various lines of expenditure and the fructification of anyone will be very minimal. If gender has to get equity and equality, there should be more capital investment. It is seen that more capital is invested in the field of health education for boys than the girls.If you take the enrolment rate of girls in professional courses, you can see that only 30% of the girls are getting admitted. At the same time, in arts and science colleges 70% of the seats are occupied by girls. This shows that there is a gender disparity in the capital infusion in the field of health and education.The work force participation rate for women and men are 17.1% and 57.1% respectively. Even though there is no disparity in the literary standards of men and women, there is a gender disparity in the work participation force. This has to be rectified and only then women empowerment and gender budgeting will have any meaning."

For rice Kuttanad, Kole, Onattukara, Pokkali, Palakkad, Kaippad and Wayanad have been chosen. For vegetables the identified zones are Devikulam, Kanjikuzhi, Pazhayannur, Chittur and Kollankode. While bananas will be the focus in Thrissur, flowers and coconut cultivation will receive attention respectively in Wayanad and Kozhikode. An amount of Rs 10 crore has been earmarked for initiating integrated activities in these special agro-zones.The finance minister said a detailed project report for making value added products in 14 agro parks approved by KIIFB last year is under preparation. An amount of Rs 100 crore to 150 crore will be made available for this from KIIFB. More producer companies will be started for manufacturing value added products from coconut.The total outlay in agriculture sector, which was Rs 1,822 crore in 2016-2017, has been raised to Rs 2,106 crore. Out of the Rs 160 crore earmarked for food production, Rs 70 crore is meant for paddy and Rs 85 crore for vegetables. For the reclamation of wasteland for rice cultivation, a comprehensive assistance programme has been formulated. An amount of Rs 12 crore has been provided for promoting cultivation in fallow land and for conversion of 'Oruppoo' into 'Iruppoo'. A sum of Rs 27 crore has been earmarked for providing Rs 1,500 per hectare to 'padasekhara samithies'. An allocation of Rs 3 crore has been made for setting up of mini-rice mills in selected co-operative societies. The non-plan outlay for paddy procurement is Rs 700 crore. The budget document says suitable projects will be prepared for the special agricultural regions of Kuttanad, Onattukara, Pokkali, Kol, Palakkad, Wayanad and Kaippad. An amount of Rs 12 crore would be provided for giving block-level assistance in these areas.For the promotion of agriculture and agricultural crops having regional specialties, an amount of Rs.3.3 crore has been provided. To promote crops like Ragi and Millet in tribal areas, the government would initi ate measures for their procurement and distribution through ration shops. ""What farmers expected from the budget was a confidence-building announcement and measures like crop insurance or revolving fund to compensate farmers for crop failure. But this was missing,"" said Fr Thomas Peelianickal, executive director, Kuttanadu Vikasana Samithy, Alappuzha.Vegetable farming will be expanded using the prevailing cluster system under the agriculture department. An allocation of Rs 18 crore has been made for providing assistance to the clusters. In addition to this, Rs.3 crore is provided for block-level federations. Crop health management has a corpus of Rs 54 crore and will be of benefit to vegetable farmers from this year. Isaac has also set apart Rs 10 crore for promoting organic farming. A new component in the vegetable farming is the emphasis given to processing and marketing. An amount of Rs 5 crore has been set apart for the vegetable producer companies.Even though there has been a temporary upswing in the price of rubber, the price stabilization scheme to ensure a price of Rs 150 per kg to the small scale farmers will continue, the minister said. He set aside Rs 500 crore for the purpose. But rubber farmers say that such small measures won't help their cause unless the government ensures a market for their produce.""Instead of these temporary measures, the government should come out with a rule that all roads would be rubberised. This one decision can ensure that our produce has a market. Across the country, especially in states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra or Karnataka which have big roads, the concept of rubberised roads would benefit us farmers as well as the road users. Vehicles or the tyres don't get damaged easily on rubberised roads,"" said Joy Thengumkudi, national treasurer, INFARM."

The PB commission had quoted Achuthanandan saying that he had brought these violations to the notice of the then general secretary Prakash Karat, but to no avail.The state committee also discussed the protest measures to be taken up by the party in the issues of rationing through PDS, demonetisation and agrarian crisis.The LDF will organise evening dharnas in all panchayats, municipalities and corporation centres demanding a judicious public distribution system.The protest with a demand to reintroduce statutory rationing system will also seek to reinstate the quota of rice the state was eligible before the food security act came into force.Though the CC asked the state committee to probe allegations of nepotism against E P Jayarajan and P K Sreemathy, there were no hints about the state committee assigning a committee for the purpose.It is more likely that the state secretary himself will conduct the probe and submit the report to the CC before its next meeting."

The experiment, however, needs to be tried at a bigger level and in multi-location trials to confirm the findings further.CICR director Keshav Kranthi told TOI that the results appear quite promising but the experiment needs to be extended to more areas and different locations to derive conclusive evidence. ""The experiment was conducted at CICR in replicated trials in three fields of 30 sq m each. Human hair amino-acids were used in combination with cow urine ,"" said Kranthi.Head of crop production division Blaize DeSouza, who headed the experiment, explained that the human hair extract along with cow urine was used as a spray. A control was also kept along with a combination of NPK (nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium) and NPK plus water combination. The experiment was conducted by Blaize on Ajit 155 Bt cotton hybrid along with CICR colleague G Ramakrishna.""Though we didn't find visible effect or any change in the fibre quality there was an average increase of 10-20% per hectare with a yield increase of 2-4 quintals per hectare. The spray is needed twice during the flowering season. It causes better retention of bolls in the plant. We tried three variations of the spray and obtained best results with 9ml and 12ml/litre of water of the amino-acid-cow urine mixture given to us by MGIRI,"" said DeSouza.MGIRI director PB Kale said the institute had tried the experiment in other crops too with farmers, but those trials were not as scientific. ""Hence, we gave the hair amino-acid-cow urine mixture to CICR for scientific trials. We have also filed for a patent on the mixture. There are a few devoted entrepreneurs too who have tried the human hair amino acid spray on tur, soyabean etc,"" he said.KR Yadav, deputy director MGIRI, who actually developed the hair amino acid first, told TOI that hair contains various amino acids including cysteine (sulphur rich) and is rich in nitrogen. He has been working on the project for over five years in MGIRI.Yadav said that human hair amino acid was also found to show an increase in chlorophyll content of plants by 300 times. ""We wish that the formulation is tried at large scale in other agro-climatic zones and other crops like rice and wheat.

Venkatasubramanya, popular as B V Pundit, got the idea of making the tooth powder during a 'homa' at a relative's place, and started manufacturing it using rice husk. He named it after the town where it was made -Nanjangud. An instant hit, he sold over 10 lakh tooth powder packets every month.The tooth powder sale has plummeted with changing lifestyle over the years but still has a loyal clientele. "" We have retained the old packagi n g g ive n its popularity,"" explains B V Pundit's grandson N B Ramagopal, Sadvaidyasala's director (operations). ""Thousands of people go down the memory lane remembering the tooth powder,"" he said.Seat to the ancient Sri Srikanteshwara temple and regarded as Kashi of South India, Nanjangud, 23km from Mysuru, is split into 27 wards, and has a population of about 60,000. The civic body was recently upgraded to a municipality.The Hindu pilgrimage town has a rich history. Mythology has it that the presiding deity Nanjundeshwara drank poison to save the earth. Nanjanagud literally means the place where Nanjundeshwara (Lord Shiva), resides. Located on the banks of Kapila river, the town has transformed over the years but religiosity remains to be its core. While thousands of devotees annually visit the Sri Srikanteshwara temple, an Archeology Survey of India-protected complex, the annual car festival in summer attracts more than 2 lakh visitors.But unlike earlier, the Nanjangud banana isn't easily available in the temple town. The Nanjangud rasabale, a variety of banana which has secured Geographical Indica tion (GI) tag, has become rare in the place if its origin. A Mysuru CII survey found it's on the brink of extinction. Except for a small chunk of land near Devarasanahalli , the banana is not cultivated across the town like earlier. Among the major problems is pest, said farmers.""Cultivation of this special variety of banana needs extra care. Though it is profitable, you have to make additional efforts to cultivate it."" A kilogram of Nanjangud banana costs Rs 70,"" said Srikantharaj Urs from Kalale, who had cultivated it two years ago."

Wheat hovered around its lowest since early February, pressured by favourable weather across the U.S. Plains. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract has lost more than 7 percent in four consecutive weeks of decline. Earlier in the session, the market hit its lowest since Oct. 14, 2016 at $9.60-3/4 a bushel. On a quarterly basis, soybeans have dropped 4 percent, losing much of the gains made in the last quarter of 2016. Wheat has also given up almost 7 percent in the last four weeks, although prices are up 3.4 percent for the quarter, the biggest three-month gain since June 2015. The market is getting ready for the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual prospective plantings and quarterly grain stocks reports later in the day - data releases that typically result in increased volume and volatility. The reports could increase supply pressure by showing a jump in the U.S. soybean planted area and a rise in soybean, corn and wheat inventories. The USDA data released on Thursday showed weekly U.S. corn export sales of 716,000 tonnes for shipment during the current marketing season, below estimates for 900,000 to 1.2 million tonnes. Weekly sales of soybeans and wheat were above estimates. ""The U.S. reported a better-than-expected week of soybean export sales. The price falls have clearly made the U.S. a more attractive origin,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""Nevertheless, competition from Brazil is expected to intensify over the next few months."" Brazil's 2016-17 soybean crop forecast was raised to a record 113.3 million tonnes on Thursday compared to 111 million tonnes seen earlier in March, after independent consultancy Agroconsult finished a crop tour through main producing areas. There was also concern about Chinese demand for soybeans as processing margins for imported soybeans in Shandong province hover around the lowest since August.

58f6cc857be9e031f13bc04e,Warnul's clay pots quench summer thirst,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/warnuls-clay-pots-quench-summer-thirst/articleshow/58060312.cms,2017-04-07,"KOLHAPUR: Ever wondered where the decorative earthen pots piled up at markets in Pune, Satara, Sangli come from? Warnul village , about 35 km from here, has been catering to the coolant demands from western Maharashtra for decades . With the rising temperature this summer, the demand for its special clay pots has almost doubled already.The 50 families living in the village in Panhala taluka sculpt at least one lakh pots every year and register a turnover of around Rs 50 lakh from the business. The orders for the pots are placed as early as December.Bhimrao Kumbhar, who is in his sixties, is busy is giving shape to the raw clay mixture used for making pots. ""I inherited the pot-making art from my parents and grand parents. Our water coolants are popular due to the unique process involved in making them,"" he said.Clay, which is thick and has some oily elements, is found in abundance along the river in the village. This is carefully collected and mixed with dried horse dung and soil. A thick paste is prepared by grinding the mixture with feet.""Lumps of the thick paste are then put in a machine to mould them as pots. Then, the mould is given its final rounded shape by hand. When the pot is put in a natural oven, the dried horse dung automatically gets burnt and creates pores on the surface. The pores allow air to pass through and keep the water cool,"" he explained.Bhimrao notes that the demand for the clay pots has been increasing over the past few years as citizens look for eco-friendly and traditional ways to keep water cool. ""We have to process one pot at least 50 times before it gets ready for sale,"" he said.Navnath Kumbhar, who was busy shaping the pots outside his house, said the clay pots have gained popularity in past many years due to their natural cooling ability.""Our parents used to sell them only in nearby villages and Kolhapur. Now, the picture has changed. Traders from Satara, Sangli, Pune, Pandharpur, Solapur, Ratnagiri, Chiplun, Mahad, Panvel and Mumbi come here to buy clay pots. Clay pot making is good business in our village and provides work to around 300 people in 50 families,"" he said.The potters sell the coolants at the rate of around Rs 30 to Rs 40 each to traders. In the retail markets in cities, the same earthen ware is sold at Rs 100.Vinayak Kumbhar, a trader from Baramati, said the Warnul clay pots have great demand from Pimpri Chinchwad, Urali Kanchan and Jejuri in Pune district. ""The consumers particularly demand for the Warnul Math (pots). These pots have an impeccable quality of keeping water cool in any environment. They are considered better than the pots from Khanapur (Sangli) and Belgavi (Karnataka),"" he said.Interestingly, the potters still follow centuries-old barter system in their trade with villagers from adjoining areas. Villagers offer rice and other agriculture produce in exchange of the pots in summer and Ganesh idols during the ten-day Ganapati festival.Krushnat Kumbhar said, ""We still follow the barter system. We have long been connected with these villages. We exchange our vessels with their produce. People in villages have kept the system alive since ages.""Despite the thriving business, the younger generation is not likely to keep the trade and art alive. Octogenarian Tai Kumhar does not want her grandson in their traditional business. ""The situation has changed. They should find jobs and settled down with stable jobs rather than this seasonal business,"" she said.She explained that in her youth, she would travel to Kolhapur, Satara and Sangli in a bullock cart carrying clay pots every summer. ""People from our community have been suffering from spinal cord problems due to this work. There is constant work, but no guarantee of fixed income. This makes the business a huge risk as well. I don't want my grandchildren to dump their life in clay,"" she said.There are some though, who are looking toward the state government to offer some financial aid to help the trade survive. Arjun Kumbhar compares their situation with their counterparts in Karnataka district.""The Karnataka government has provided subsidy on the clay machine and helped build shelters for potters to work in any season. We don't have such facility. The government should provide subsidy for creation of such permanent shelters, offer us government land in village for clay and subsidise power bills. It wound big push for the stability of this traditional business,"" he said."

They are also looking at links between Russia and Trump. Russia denies such allegations.Trump and his allies have mounted an aggressive defense. Most recently, they have focused on unsubstantiated reports that Susan Rice, former President Barack Obama's national security adviser, disclosed the names of Trump aides swept up by surveillance of foreign targets.Rice dismissed the reports as ""absolutely false"" in an interview with MSNBC.The day after FBI Director James Comey confirmed the FBI investigation of potential ties between Russia and the Trump campaign last month, Nunes announced to reporters that the communications of members of Trump's transition team were caught up in the surveillance.He said the information came from documents obtained from a source he would not identify.Nunes, a close Trump political ally, discussed the matter with the Republican president before consulting committee Democrats.After reports Nunes got the documents from White House aides, Schiff called for him to recuse himself from the inquiry, saying his actions compromised the panel's ability to complete a credible, bipartisan investigation.Republican Senator Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whose leaders have insisted they can conduct a bipartisan investigation, said on Tuesday he was open to looking into the Rice allegations, if they proved true.Democrats underscored the gravity of the investigation.""I wouldn't be surprised after all of this is said and done that some people end up in jail,"" Representative Joaquin Castro, a House Intelligence member, told CNN.

Also, people in the border district of Pithoragarh are regularly crossing the relatively porous border to Nepal to get their quota of alcohol. The surge in demand has resulted in many shops on the Nepal side of the border - from tea-sellers to grocers - increasing their stock of booze. ""The Nepal border is just across the Kali river at Dharchula. Liquor on the Nepal side is cheaper due to higher value of the Indian rupee in Nepal. Also, since shops are closed here, there has been increased movement of locals crossing the Kali river bridge into Nepal to get alcohol since the past few days, "" said BS Almiya, forest range officer, Dharchula.Deepak Gurung, a shopowner at Darchula (in Nepal), told TOI over phone that many establishments have increased their liquor supplies following raised demand. ""In Nepal, we can sell liquor bottles in any shop or outlet which does not necessarily have to be a liquor shop. The permit is easy to get from the local administrative office. Many shops have trebled the liquor stock kept with them, as a lot of Indians are coming for bulk liquor purchase,"" he said.Concurrently, the demand for country liquor has also shot up -- in particular the brew made by the Bhotia hill tribe which sources said is selling at Rs 150 (for a 700 ml bottle). Lokesh Singh Rautela, district social mobilisation officer in Dharchula told TOI, ""Bhotias have been brewing liquor from grains such as wheat and rice since a long time in their homes. But now, because so many liquor shops in the district are closed, their brew is finding favour with locals.""Gautam Singh Brijwal, a youth from the Bhotia tribe claimed that many men from his community - who work as daily wagers - have taken leave from work to brew liquor. ""People of our tribe generally brewed liquor at home for our personal consumption or to cater to guests during festivals. But now, since we are getting regular orders from outsiders, many people from our community have left their regular work and are engaged in brewing liquor."""

It had also acquired three acre of benami land in the village. According to the relevant Government Orders (GOs), the village was under the ambit of Hill Area Conservation Authority (HACA).However, Isha Foundation constructed foot Shiva without getting approval from various departments.In its application to the town and country planning department, the foundation failed to provide a plan explaining details like parking area, administrative blocks, eateries, road access and sewerage plan. As the foundation was constructing a public building for worship, rules mandated approval from town and country planning department, hill area conservation authority and district collector.The construction also violated the provisions of Tamil Nadu Protection of Tax and Eviction of Encroachment Act, 2007. Using ""muscle and money"" the foundation was constructing the illegal structure, said the PIL The land acquired for construction was fertile farm with standing rice crops. Despite the presence of a major irrigation channel, 'Raja Vaikkal' or 'Raja Canal', the district collector had provided certification for the area being bereft of irrigation facilities, or dependent solely on groundwater. The catchment area of the Noyyal river, the lifeline for Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts, was being obstructed by the illegal construction.The court has posted the matter for further hearing on Friday."

In an interview with TOI, he claimed that the way Congress and Shiromani Akali dal (SAD) had been training their guns on his party, it was a sign of their desperation over AAP's rise as a political entity.It is party to a political conspiracy to vitiate peace in the state. I have demanded that there should be action against SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, as there could be more trouble. Political rallies are usually safe. The reports we are getting about sophisticated explosives being used points to a conspiracy.It has to be understood what is happening. Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh have become desperate due to AAP's popularity. Captain has declared that the 35,000 NRIs coming down to Punjab for campaigning are terrorists. They (NRIs) are sons of the soil. When we bump into a Punjabi boy or girl at a showroom in Canada or Amsterdam, we feel proud of them. Have they become terrorists for supporting AAP? At the same time, Badal's business interests and the conflict of interest with governance is at the root of most problems in the state.That's rubbish. In Delhi, we had said that we will take action against any state leader or minister if found guilty of financial misappropriation. In case of Chhotepur, we adopted the same policy of zero tolerance. He was our own-state level leader and we ourselves took action on realizing that he accepted money. The party leadership cannot ignore such things.Badal's own people are going to constituencies and saying if you don't want to vote for SAD, vote for Congress and not AAP. They don't want to let people think independently. It is a clear sign of their being hand in glove. Captain has foreign bank accounts and everyone knows Badal cannot take action against him.In my opinion, it will be a repeat of Delhi. AAP will win with an overwhelming majority. I can feel a positive energy when I meet people in markets and suburbs. I was in Jagraon today as the local candidate revived her campaigning. Before that in Ludhiana, I went for a morning walk and a person rushed home to gift me a ""Gita"" and said we need to get rid of evil forces in the state.We have changed the course of political discussion. The industry in the state has been deliberately killed so that Badal family's own businesses prosper. The policies for the common traders are such that they can never comply and no one can dare to question those in power. AAP will bring in industry-friendly policies for Punjab. Badals should have focused on running the government, not their businesses. It can be done when out of government. The family that decides transport policy also has its own fleet of private buses. Meeting traders from the state has been a very overwhelming experience for me. They told me: ""Bahar taale, andar jaale (locks on the outside, cobwebs inside)."" That sums up the state of industry here. Rice millers from Abohar were equally disillusioned.My statement was misinterpreted. The party works on an agenda and feels that the reforms in education and healthcare that have been implemented in Delhi will be replicated in Punjab if AAP forms the government."

The programmes and policies announced in the budget are aimed at improving the lives of the economically oppressed sections of the society. My budget truly reflects the sentiment of 'Sabka saath, sabka vikas'.""Refuting claims of the budget being flawed, Siddaramaiah said, ""We're not embarrassed to say we are for Ahinda. But that doesn't mean we have forgotten the other communities. We have launched several programmes that will benefit the impoverished members of all communities."" He pointed out that the rise in the monthly rice installment (from 5 to 7kg) under the Anna Bhagya scheme was benefitting 1.8 crore people cutting across caste and religion.However, he refused to yield to the BJP's demand for a loan waiver. ""Let the Centre waive loans given by commercial banks, and we'll follow suit by waiving the ones given by cooperative banks,"" he said, adding that the then BJP CM BS Yeddyurappa too had refused to waive loans. ""He cited shortage of funds and did not announce a loan waiver,"" the CM said.However, the BJP members did not back down. While CT Ravi charged the CM with delivering a 'market speech', opposition leader in the assembly Jagadish Shettar alleged that Siddaramaiah was distorting facts. With the BJP members walking out of the house before the Karnataka Appropriation (vote on account) Bill 2017 was passed, Siddaramaiah said, ""The BJP is anti-poor, anti-farmer, anti-dalit, anti-minorities and anti-women.""The CM said that the state was ready for the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout. ""It was the brainchild of the UPA government. We are ready to implement the policy. GST will definitely benefit the state,"" he said."

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade fell 0.1 percent to $9.70-3/4 a bushel, having closed little changed in the previous session. * Soybeans hit a low of $9.68-1/4 on Monday, the lowest since October, 2016. * The most active corn futures were unchanged at $3.57-3/4, having gained 0.6 percent in the previous session. * The most active wheat futures was little changed at $4.24-3/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.9 percent on Tuesday. * Soybeans were weighed down by ample global supplies, further stoked by U.S. plantings for next season, analysts expect. * Analysts expect a 5.7 percent jump in U.S. soybean sowings from a year ago, but have forecast a reduction in corn planting of 3.2 percent and an 8 percent cut in wheat sowings. * Wheat was pressured by forecasts for rains in the Plains over most of the last week. The showers should bolster yield prospects for the developing winter wheat crop. * The outlook for rains across the Plains, the southern Midwest and the Mississippi River Delta over the next week also supported corn futures by threatening to delay seeding in those areas. * However, planting is still a few weeks away in core Corn Belt states like Iowa and Illinois. MARKET NEWS * The dollar rose on Tuesday, bouncing from 4-month lows, as a top Federal Reserve official reinforced expectations of more U.S. rate hikes to come while political uncertainties surrounding Britain's exit from the EU pressured European currencies. * Oil prices rose as much as 2 percent on Tuesday after a severe disruption to Libyan oil supplies and as officials suggested OPEC and other producing countries could extend an output-cuts deal to the end of the year. * U.S. stocks ended sharply higher on Tuesday, with financial and energy shares surging as data showed U.S. consumer confidence soaring to a more than 16-year high.

It is only when a bell rings and children stream out on the open ground that one realises that it is actually a school.The old structure with tarpaulin sheets acting as window panes, missing doors and fans, an open switch board with loose wires hanging and no toilet facilities is in reality the residential school for 155 students  99 boys and 56 girls studying from standard I to standard X.The state-run ashramshala, or residential school for children from tribal areas, has been operating since 1972 without much change in the facilities. The students, especially in the boys hostel, do not have facility to heat water, the vegetables and grains are stored without cold storage for two weeks.""The meal is half cooked and the chapatis and rice are not edible. The warden always gives us excuses that they have not received funds and provisions from the government,"" said one of the students in the residential school.Another student said the rooms in the boys hostels are not provided with proper electricity or lights. They do not have soaps, detergents, toothpaste or even a toilet. The boys are compelled to relieve themselves in the open in the absence of toilet facility. The girls hostel, in comparison, is better equipped with toilets and proper lights.""There are no doors or windows for many rooms. There is an open electricity switch board inside hostel. Anything can happen if it is not fixed, there are children as young as six-year-old living here.

FUNDAMENTALS * The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract slid to its lowest since Sept. 27 at $9.36-1/2 a bushel on Tuesday. Corn dropped 1.3 percent in the last session, its biggest daily decline since March 9. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture last week forecast record-sized U.S. soy plantings near 89.5 million acres, topping analyst expectations.

The bacteria isolated from the campus of Osmania University is also useful in a number of biotechnological applications ranging from food industry to agriculture, and biofuels to nanotechnology.Streptomyces osmaniensis was discovered during 2010 from the soil collected from Osmania University campus. It is one of the two organisms named after Osmania University, the other being Melampsora osmaniensis in 1984. Seven years after its discovery, scientists from Khon Kaen University , Thailand, studied the agricultural and industrial benefits of Streptomyces osmaniensis. The study published in the recent issue of the Malaysian Journal of Microbiology reveals that S. osmaniensis shows ""antagonistic activity"" against rice blast, caused by the fungus Pyricularia oryzae. It will also help in the production of bio-ethanol and antibiotics.Rice blast is a major concern for farmers and agricultural scientists alike as it affects paddy yields by about 30 per cent. Thousands of acres of agricultural fields in Telugu states are hit by rice blast. Farmers at present use chemical pesticides to tide over the problem. Now the bacteria found in the gardens of Osmania University can fight the menace the natural way, without leaving any harmful chemical residues behind. Interestingly, researchers in Thailand about 2500 km away have discovered the benefits of the Osmania bacteria, while their counterparts back home in Hyderabad are unaware of it.Osmania University is the only institution in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana that has lent its name to at least two creatures. Financial constraints notwithstanding the department of botany in OU has thus far successfully established a new genus (Manoharachariella) and discovered over a dozen species. The herbarium of the university boasts of 35,000 specimens of trees spread over 180 families. It also has a collection of about 1000 fungal specimens. It has also contributed to 60 news species of fungi spread over 18 new genera.Besides Osmania University, Hyderabad has also etched itself in the world botanical and zoological records with a few dozen plant and animal species named after the historic city. Now that the university is celebrating the 100th year of its birth it is high time authorities focussed more on the research and applied aspect of physical, chemical, botanical and zoological sciences for the benefit of the masses."

With seeds of various plants embedded in each of its sheets, the handmade calendar has been made solely of recyclable materials. Once a month is over, all you need to do is tear off the sheet and throw into the soil, where it would germinate various indigenous vegetables and flowers, such as sunflower, tomato, and red amaranthus! Not surprisingly, the people are lauding the unique calendar. Kochi Times lists out similar innovative 'seed-bearers' that had won hearts in the recent past:A pen that would sprout leaves, branches and fruits once its role as a 'writer' is over. The dream of environment lovers to use pens in a smart and eco-friendly manner was materialised by a Kerala-based group of environment lovers called Akriti, with the launch of the 'With Love' pens. 'With' in Malayalam means seed and true to its name, the pen can be sown after use. Made of upcycled, recycled and economised paper and other materials, it has the seed of an Agasthya (Sesbania grandiflora) tree at its bottom end. On World Environment Day 2016, the pens were handed out to a group of school children in the State who have also been using the pen.The Ganesh Chathurthi festival is always a nightmare for environmental activists owing to its aftermath - large numbers of paper mache 'Ganeshas' in the waterbodies.Last year, however, several groups across the country made news, for giving a twist to the popular Ganapathy idols. Instead of using environmentally hazardous materials for the idols which in turn pollute the water bodies they are immersed into, the new Ganapathy was way cooler and 'pregnant' with something useful and helpful for the environment. Termed Tree Ganesha or Green Ganesha, the idols were eco-friendly, made of red soil and organic fertilisers, with seeds as its base. Even when you aren't planning to immerse the idol, you can use water to disintegrate the Ganesha, which would turn into soil that nurtures the seeds.Pencils made of wood or plastic might soon be a thing of the past, if these ec-friendly pencils win more of hearts. Made from used newspapers, the pencils, called Eco-Me was launched last year in Coimbatore by an environment enthusiast. They are made of old newspapers and chemical-free, waterproof glue and are thus safe for kids, who use it like any normal pencil.No, we aren't talking about the commonly used rudraksha chain, but a variety of pretty neck pieces and bangles made by a group in Trichy. The necklaces, anklets and earrings are made by stringing together rice kernels, various medicinal plants, coral tree seeds and canna seeds. The seeds used are not poisonous or perishable, and belong to the widely available category of seeds, consciously avoiding the endangered varieties."

Aadhaar card holders will have to record their thumbprints at biometric machines set up in ration shops to access subsidized grain available under the Food Security Act.""The thumbprint recorded under Aadhaar will be linked to the public distribution system (PDS) database,"" said state food and civil supplies secretary Mahesh Pathak. ""Once the person places his thumb on the biometric reader, it will give information on his entitlement. Once he buys ration, the amount of grain purchased will be deducted from his quota,"" he said.Several states made Aadhaar-linked PDS compulsory last year, in a bid to plug leakages and corruption. Maharashtra will be among the first few states to digitize it after Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat. The state is in the process of setting up and testing biometric machines at 51,363 fair price shops across its districts through system integrators. The first machine was set up in Pune on January 7. The machines will also be able to seed the Aadhaar card to the PDS network and modify Aadhaar card details. Maharashtra has as many as 7 crore ration card holders under the Food Security Act. They are entitled to 5 kg of ration grain per person per month. This is to be provided at the subsidized rate of Rs 3 per kg of rice and Rs 2 per kg of wheat.The Ration Kruti Samiti has raised concerns about the exclusion of non-Aadhaar holders. ""Those who do not have Aadhaar cards will not have access to benefits under the Food Security Act,"" said Taruna Kumbhar from the Rationing Kruti Samiti . However, officials said Maharashtra's Aadhaar coverage was among the best in the country. Also, 87% of the card holders under the Food Security Act have got Aadhaar cards seeded to the public distribution network.Yet, many feel the government's focus is on addressing technicalities and not on improving the availability and quality of grain on the public distribution system. ""The question is how many people are getting their full quota under the Food Security Act. Even if there is Aadhaar linkage, is there adequate grain in ration shops?"" asks Kiran Moghe from the Janwadi Mahila Sanghatana which has been agitating on issues related to the ration distribution system. ""Grain is not reaching and the number of fair price shops have reduced,"" she added."

The population of the Passer Domesticus aka house sparrows has been alarmingly declining across the globe and in Kerala too, the numbers are sadly dwindling. Where are the little birds flying to, abandoning us? And what needs to be done to bring them back? On World Sparrow Day today, Kochi Times finds out more about them.A group of bird watchers in Kerala have been doing a project for the past few months - The Kerala Bird Atlas project , which studies the population and distribution of birds in the State. Their research shows that the number of house sparrows is drastically declining in Kerala, especially in the cities!Ornithologist Vishnu Das C K, who is part of the project, says, ""We just finished the study and so we can't quote numbers yet. However, we can say that in highly urbanised cities like Kochi, Trivandrum, Calicut and Thrissur, there is a decrease in the number of sparrows. It's in the rural areas of Palakad and Wayanad that house sparrows can be mostly seen today."" Roshnath Ramesh, a wildlife biologist says, ""There has been no proper study on the population of sparrows. So we cannot compare the present population to a figure from the past. However, birdwatchers and nature enthusiast report decreased sighting of the birds now and currently, studies are being conducted based on this observation.""Yes, humans are to blame for them being homeless. According to birdwatchers, the consumerist culture has played a big part in driving sparrows away. ""Sparrows are 'grani-vores', their food is mainly grains. In the past, we could see spot sparrows around grocery shops, as grains would spill out from the sacks and offer them enough food. Now, grain is packaged well and goes straight into supermarkets,"" says Arun Raj, a bird watcher.Wildlife biologist Roshnath Ramesh agrees. ""Grain is stored in plastic bags now to minimise spilling and spoiling. Also, use of pesticides and chemicals in grains, and a decrease in the number of ration and grocery shops have all resulted in scarcity of food for the birds.""Vishnu Das says that as per certain studies, the radiation from telecommunication towers has also played a big role in the dwindling of the sparrow population. ""However, the findings have not been proven yet,"" he says.The changes in our architecture, which leave them fewer nesting places, is another reason cited by experts. Ornithologist Sasikumar C says, ""In the past, our houses had roof tiles and there were nooks and crannies in which the birds could nest. Ledges under wooden beams of houses also used to provide them with enough places to nest. But today, roofs are made of concrete and the sparrows are left with no suitable habitat."" He also terms the reducing vegetation cover in our cities as another reason for the phenomena.There are a few simple steps we can take to ensure that we accommodate sparrows too, in metros. ""Placing a spread of grains in elevated platforms can help them find food. Of course, other animals and birds too might feed on them, but sparrows too would get a share,"" Vishnu says. He also says that placing nesting boxes - which can even be a cardboard box with a hole  can provide shelter for them. ""Place these boxes at a height of about eight to nine feet from the ground, in houses and buildings,"" Vishnu adds.Planting shrubs or short trees  less than five metres high  which the birds can roost in will also host a good number of sparrows in the area, says Roshnath. ""Maintaining an eco-friendly environment, minimising pollution, keeping the surroundings clean, providing provisions for nesting during construction of new buildings, minimising construction of new mobile towers, providing water baths and decreased use of pesticides in rice and other grains are the means with which we can bring the sparrow population back,"" he says.Sparrows are not just for chirping, they are important for a variety of other reasons. Vishnu says, ""House sparrows as a species in the ecosystem maintain the ecological balance. For many other birds belonging to the raptors (bird of prey) category, sparrows are a main source of food. Their absence can result in a break in the food chain and affect the population of other birds too."" The birds also play a role in the food grain distribution. When a sparrow gets four grains, for instance, they might end up eating two and distributing the rest, which means seed distribution.Roshnath says, ""Sparrows catch insects, pests and worms which feed on grains and vegetables. They also peck at food materials on the ground, thereby cleaning the surroundings. They are also a pleasure to the eye and ear, spreading cheer with their chirping and tweeting. Some people believe it to be good omen when sparrows make a nest in their shops."""

He worked tirelessly in China for four years, before he passed away at the young age of 32.Touched by Kotnis's work in China, Mao, a master calligraphist himself, penned a moving tribute and condolence message to his family in Solapur.The letter was written on traditional rice paper using charcoal black ink and a prized possession of the Kotnis family. A few years ago, the letter was handed to the Kotnis museum operated by the Solapur Municipal Corporation The message had undergone wear and tear over the years and plans to restore it began in 2014 when the then Chinese consul general in Mumbai heard about this gem. ""We also came to know about its condition. The chief of relics from China visited Solapur and discussed ways to restore the letter. It was decided to send two experts from China to Solapur for the work,"" Guo Taojie, chief of political section, consulate general of the People's Republic of China in Mumbai, said.The Chinese consulate got in touch with Pinfang from Shanghai museum and Li from Gansu museum in August 2016 and requested them to travel to Solapur to restore the three-feet long letter.When Pinfang and Li first saw the frayed letter with its fading ink and moth-damaged fragile paper, both knew they had a huge task on hand. They combined their collective experience of nearly 80 years, used specialized tools from China, followed traditional and new scientific methods to restore the letter.""We carried all the tools and instruments, restoration material and ink from China.We had to peel the three layers that make the rice paper and fix the wear and tear one small step at a time,"" Pinfang said.She has worked in China and other countries to restore Chinese calligraphy works for more than 40 years.Both used the best rice paper in China and silk sheets, but the task wasn't easy . The dusty museum, where the letter had been kept, offered limited resources and made their task tough, but officials agreed to move the letter to a safer, cleaner place.""We have never been to India before and did not know what to expect. The food here was nowhere close to our food.Instant noodles were the closest and we turned to it for our meals,"" Pinfang said. Li said the working conditions in Solapur were not as good as in China, but the people were extremely helpful.""They went out of their way to ensure that we got all that we needed for the restoration work. We are proud to have completed this task we were entrusted with,"" she added."

The needles that sewed ethereal designs on dhaddas (wooden frames) have stopped; about 90% of the 4-lakh work force is starving. Across Uluberia, Bauria, Panchla, Bagnan, Amta, Sankrail and Shyampur blocks, a once-booming selfsufficient business is in a shambles.History has it that zari karigars of these villages were commissioned by the Mug hal court to make makhmali dresses for the royalty. With time, the embroiderers started getting orders from across the globe, especially Muslim-majority countries.Most ostagars -the commissioning businessmen under whom embroiderers work -stop taking orders beyond Diwali, such is the November-February peak season rush because of marriages. And 2016 was no different; orders had come in from across the country and from Dubai, the UAE, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Work was onin full swing till Novem ber 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the note ban that brought everything to a shocking halt. Cancellations started the very next day . Calculating since then, the All India Zari Union has in a letter to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, quantified the total loss from cancelled orders at Rs 100 crore.As orders vanished, ostagars were forced to retrench embroiderers. Kazi Nawab Ali, who employs 200 workers in his Kazi Zari Works, said, "" All my orders got cancelled. While I can still sustain, imagine the condition of my workers dependent on daily wages.""At Kazipara in Chengail, men and women in almost every household are zari embroiderers. ""Our family of five, including two children, is starving. I am even willing to work at construction sites,"" said She ikh Taiyyabur, who is a khaga master -designer who copies designs to proportion on dresses and saris.During peak season, each embroiderer earns between Rs 350-500 a day , depending on his seniority and expertise. ""Now we are going from one ostagar to another begging for work. We are available for less than Rs 100 a day now,"" said Sheikh Masiha, a senior embroiderer. Cheap dried sea fish that sell for Rs 50 per kilogram is what workers have been surviving on. ""Fish curry with rice once a day is our diet,"" rued Amina Bibi, an embroiderer. Amina, a mother of two, recently pawned her gold earrings.Though the cash flow and ATM limits have eased in the city , the All India Zari Union said ostagars are still unable to withdraw beyond Rs 2,000 from banks and ATMs once every alternate day. The wage mostly is being given in Rs 10 coins. ""We have started visiting big brands like DM, Karim Dress, Gazi and Pari for fresh orders. But if we don't get to withdraw enough cash how will our business start? An average ostagar would require Rs 5 lakh a week to buy materials,"" said Kazi Nawab Ali, president of the union.The state government had formed a zari hub near Sankrail five years ago to help zari workers and ostagars with direct sales, circumventing the mahajans. But the hub is yet to take off, and post-notebandi, weaving these dreams will be a tall ask."

This is because the calorific value of various foods consumed in India have been revised, and there is a considerable gap between the new Indian values and those fixed by researchers in the West.Take the raw white rice for instance. While Western nutritional charts show about 260 calories per 100 grams of raw rice, the revised Indian data has fixed the calorific value of rice at 354. In the case of egg, the calorie difference is about 70 per 100 grams. The calorific value of 100 grams of whole milk is 65 (Western), while it is 107 in the revised Indian charts. Even in case of mutton (shoulder), it is 260 in the West and 188 in India. Ripe banana (100 grams) containS 111 calories in India as against 89 in the West. Due to this wide variation, one has to revise his or her daily dietary chart for optimum results, particularly those on a weight-reduction mission.According to nutritionists, a person with a sedentary lifestyle maintaining a daily calorie intake of about 2,000 should reduce rice consumption from 300 grams to 200-250 grams to maintain a healthy life and avoid weight gain. The number of chapattis should also be brought down. The variation in Western and Indian values ranges from a minimum of 10 calories to a maximum of 150 per 100 gm. Health planners, fitness experts and nutritionists in India have so far been following the nutrition composition tables prepared by the USA, the UK or other developed nations. For the first time, a comprehensive data on over 500 commonly consumed foods in India is also available, thanks to the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN).Since the NIN data (Indian Food Composition Tables - 2017) released last week is based on fruits, vegetables, cereals, oils, meat, fish, egg, poultry produced in India, the values are appropriate to the Indian population. Now, there is no need to depend on the Western data, which is best suited for Westerners.""The new nutrition tables have far reaching implications to the common man in today's health conscious society. It will be an apt and handy source for making healthy food choices,"" said NIN director T Longvah."

On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party, facing an anti-demonetization sentiments among voters, would be banking on a split in minority votes as a consolidation may spell trouble for it in this phase.Rohilkhand has always been dominated by Muslims and a number of constituencies out of 67 foing to the polls in Phase 2 have more than 50^% population of the community. In districts like Rampur (50.6%), Moradabad (50.8%), Bijnor (43%) and Amroha (40.8%), the share of the community almost reaches the halfway mark. In 2012, when the Muslims voted en mass for SP, it won 35 out of 67 seats while BJP could win just 10. The BSP had 11 seats in this region and now if it has to return to power in Lucknow, it will have to consolidate its position among Muslims to form a winning caste chemistry of the Dalits and the Muslims.Both BSP and SP have started claiming support from Muslim clerics and ulema to send a message among the community voters that they are the best placed to defeat BJP. While Ulama Council, shia cleric Kalbe Jawad and Delhi Jama Masjid's Imam Maulana Bukhari pronounced their support for BSP, a large number of clerics and ulema, led by the principal of prominent seminary Nadwa-ul-Islam, Maulana Saeed-ur-Rahman Azami Nadwi and imam of Aisbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali met CM Akhilesh Yadav and extended their support to him.For BJP, this region is most difficult to win as it faces the distraught workers of small-scale and unorganised trades and Muslims united against the party. With thousands of poor working in the zari , wooden furniture and flute-making industries in dark and dingy lanes and bylanes to make two ends meet on one side and farmers prospering from paddy, sugar cane wheat and milk production on the other, Rohilkhand region, going to polls in the second phase of voting for the 2017 assembly elections presents a picture of contrast.Demonetisation has, however, hit the haves as well as have-nots of the region. If a large part of the manpower is sitting idle in the unorganised sector and the furniture and zari cottage industries, lakhs of farmers are hit hard too as they are finding no buyers for their farm produce. ""We have no orders though the marriage season is at its peak,"" lamented Suresh Agarwal, owner of a cane furniture shop, recalling how he had to hire additional workers to deliver the orders of furniture in the previous season.Badaun district in this region is a spot of prosperity for the white revolution being largest producer of milk in the region, while in Bareilly , Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Lakhimpur and Shahjahanpur, the impact of green revolution has over the decades changed the socio-economic condition. A good number of Sikh families of Lakhimpur and parts of Shahjahanpur have siblings in the US and Canada. The farm houses and resorts in this terai belt of the state have best of electronic gadgets and cars in their possession. More than two-third of 120 sugar mills are in this part and with highest production of sugar cane and paddy it is also called the rice bowl and sugar belt.But delving deeper, the economic condition of those making a livelihood out of zari work and kajal (kohl) manufacture has not improved in the past 40-50 years and they are still dependent on daily wages. This is the reason petty workers in the unorganised sector of Rohilkhand are worst hit by the demonetisation.For the ruling Samajwadi Party too, the challenge is to protect its citadel. The party has now allied with the Congress which won just three seats. The prestige of Dharmendra Yadav, Samajwadi Party MP from Badaun and cousin of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is at stake in the region. Like in many places, the ruling party is facing stiff resistance from rebels.Captain Arjun Singh , who was well placed in US and a professional pilot was roped in by Akhilesh Yadav to join his party and contest election. But he was denied ticket because his father Narendra Yadav is a Mulayam loyalist. Now, Arjun Singh is contesting from the Dataganj assembly constituency independently and challenging the SP-Congress alliance.After Badaun, the party's prestige is at stake in Rampur a district represented by powerful minister Mohammed Azam Khan who is contesting this time along with his son, while Azam's wife is already a Rajya Sabha member. Azam is so tied up in his home district for his and his son's elections that even so close to the third phase of polls he has not yet stepped out of his home to campaign for other candidates of the party.Across Rohilkhand, the Congress hopes hinge on its firebrand leader Imran Masood of Saharanpur. Masood has worked hard in the district and adjoining constituencies and Congress had gave him free hand in ticket distribution. Former Union minister Jitin Prasada is also contesting from Tilhar assembly while the sitting MLA of the party Sanjay Kapoor is seeking his re-election."

He was addressing the students of St. Marys College here on Tuesday at an awareness programme about online trade organised by Food Safety and Consumer Protection Wing in association with Federation of Consumer Organisations in Tamil Nadu (FEDCOT), Tamil Nadu and Puduchery.He said youngsters had been accustomed to buying commodities of their choice online. On the positive side, the consumers had been adapting themselves to cashless transactions as the concept of digital buying was being encouraged by government, but on the other side genuineness of the products needs to be checked, he said.Further, the Collector said youth in India constitute about 35 percent and the future society lies in the hands of the younger generation. Several years ago, countries like Japan and China had considerable youth population, but now India has emerged top in terms of youth population. The awareness about online trade could well reach the entire family, if women were sensitised to the concept, he added.He said it was only in Tamil Nadu that the consumers were being provided with free rice through public distribution system through their family cards.Now, even without carrying such family cards, essential commodities could be bought just by providing the mobile phone numbers of consumers.Many consumer products were available online at cheaper price and after checking its quality these products could be purchased, he said.District Revenue Officer Veerappan, Thoothukudi Sub Collector Deepak Jacob, District Supply Officer R.

The Telugu Desam Partys poll promise of providing unemployment allowance found place in the budget with the government earmarking Rs. 500 crore. It has also proposed to spend Rs. 695 crore, for the first time, to support the Economically Backward Classes.Gender budgetApparently heeding the growing demand for gender budget, the Finance Minister said a comprehensive set of actions would be taken during the current fiscal and beyond to improve lives of women across all human development indicators. The government also came up with a new concept, outcome budget, to ensure clarity on goals, strategies as well as physical and financial targets. The outcome budget is aimed at synchronisation between allocation performance and outcome.Doing away with usual practice of plan and non-plan expenditure classification, the government switched to system of expenditure as revenue and capital, which is in line with the Central governments move. This is a lasting structural reform needed to make our economy fit for the future and to protect future generations. It will ensure that the government lives within its means, balances the budget and reduces the burden of long-term debt, the Finance Minister said.Revenue expenditureThe revenue expenditure is estimated to be Rs. 1,25,912 crore; while the capital expenditure is estimated at Rs. 31,087 crore, including Rs. 8,009 crore towards principal repayment of public debt.Of the total revenue expenditure, Rs. 51,076 crore goes towards salaries and pensions. Subsidies and grants-in-aid, including debt relief to farmers, power subsidy and rice subsidy, is Rs. 52,206 crore. The revenue deficit is Rs. 416 crore and the fiscal deficit is estimated to be Rs. 23,054 crore. The fiscal deficit will be around 3% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), while the revenue deficit would be around 0.05% of the GSDP.GST implementationStating that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) would be introduced from July 1, he said that migration to the GST regime was expected to negatively impact the growth of State resources in the short term.Mr. Ramakrishnudu said the government would set up MSME Authority to focus on and improve the performance of MSMEs, revive, sick industries and support their credit needs. The Andhra Pradesh Industrial Corridor Development Authority; promoting Petroleum Economic Zone; replacing Adhikara Bhasha Sangham with Telugu Bhasha Pradhikara Samstha were some of the other new initiatives.Municipal Administration Minister P. narayana tabled the budget in the Legislative Council."

But migrant workers are cooking their way into peoples hearts even beyond hotels and restaurants.Many a roadside eatery has the migrants lending their touch to give dishes from the north their innate flavour.Chaat stalls on push carts, nearly all of them flaunting the same name board, whether at Karamana, Fort, Vazhuthacaud, or Technopark, are run by men from Chittor in Rajasthan. Raju sells chaat on the Poojappura-Karamana road, and Fateh Lal, aka Devraj, near a private hospital in the Fort area. They have been in the city for varying lengths of time. They had heard about Kerala from family and friends who had been here, and decided to head south in search of a better life. Though unmarried, they have families back home that are engaged in farming, an occupation with poor prospects, they say, owing to the lack of water.Life here is better, they say, because they can earn more, though working seven days a week does not leave much time for anything else. Their day starts early around 5 a.m., to make the puris for pani puri, a time-consuming process. By the time everything is done, it is well past noon. A short break later, it is time to open up shop. Vegetables are chopped once the stall opens, depending on the demand. Not that there is much left to take back home once it is closing time. Most days, whatever sev, puris, or puffed rice they bring is exhausted, letting them pocket a decent profit.From Tamil NaduR. Selvathurai, a Thenkasi native, sells nongu from his two-wheeler parked in front of the Police Training College at Thycaud. With a decade-and-half here behind him, Selvathurai greets many with easy familiarity. While the rest of his family resides back home, the few months he is here, Selvathurai lives at Kollengode. Once the rains hit the State, he packs off to Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu for some time, before heading home to Thenkasi to work as a labourer before returning to the city to coincide with the Sabarimala season.The sugar cane juice business also has a good number of migrant workers. Amit, who hails from a village around an hour from Guwahati in Assam, sells sugar cane juice on the Poojapppura-Karamana road. Not too far away, at the mouth of the Jagathy-Poojappura road, is Sherif, from Kolkata. Amit lives at Kaniyapuram with 16 others, all of them from Assam. He earns around Rs. 500 day, though the sugar cane press is not owned by him. Having been here six years, Sherif speaks Malayalam fluently.Unlike Amit though, he owns his sugar cane press, and saves enough for his family, which includes a pregnant wife, and to send money home. Here, I can save some money. Back home, the salary is less, and it just gets spent.Amit, who has studied till Class 3, says it is not impossible to make ends meet in Assam, but there is more money to be made here. I send Rs. 10,000-12,000 home each month."

Srinivas Prasad who, affronted on being dropped from the Cabinet, resigned, which necessitated the byelections.We are forced to field a candidate to contest the bypolls ahead of the general elections next year. The results of this elections will have no bearing on the government, said Mr. Siddaramaiah. He set off from Nanjangud and was given a rousing welcome at Goluru village on the outskirts of the town where he was ushered to the local Marammana Gudi after which he addressed the gathering and sought votes for Congress candidate Kalale Keshavmurthy.The main focus of his address at Goluru, Chinnadagudihundi and Badanvalu was on development. He eschewed all criticism of Mr. Prasad  who has a sizeable following in the region and in his home turf  though he alluded to the BJP and described their policies as anti-poor, anti-women and anti-minorities.He listed out a slew of new welfare programmes that were announced in the State Budget and said they would come into effect from Saturday (April 1). This government has spent over Rs. 4000 crore in the last four years to ensure that nearly 4 crore people of the State receive rice at a subsidized rate. The objective was to ensure a hunger-free Karnataka. No government has ever spent such an amount on social welfare, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.Reiterating the Congress commitment to the welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes, the CM said Rs. 27,704 crore had been allocated in the budget for 2017-18 for this. This was the highest ever allocation for a community and it was fourfold the funds allocated by the BJP during its regime.Mr. Siddaramaiah highlighted specific programmes meant for the development of SC/STs, OBCs, minorities, women and farmers, to appeal to the broad spectrum of voters in his address at each of the stops during his campaign that covered 18 villages. Unlike promises made during the campaign to shore up infrastructure and seek votes, the focus of his address was to recall the work done in the last four years.Mr. Siddaramaiah was accompanied by H.C. Mahadevappa, PWD Minister, R. Dhruvanarayan, Chamarajanagar MP, and others. Given the stakes involved, the CM is camping in the region till April 7, with intermittent visits to Bengaluru if required, but will focus on canvassing in Nanjangud and Gundlupet on alternate days."

She once even slept for five days at a stretch.It was impossible to wake her up even after an hour or two, when one would assume she had got enough sleep.Parents of the child, Liya, who was four years old, were left dazed by what they learnt. She was having sleep attacks that left her in deep sleep for hours, with some bouts lasting between 10-12 hours and even five days.In a desperate moment we tried shining a torch into her eyes, said Linu Denny, her mother. Nothing would wake her up; it was frightening, she said.The trips to hospitals started with the sleep attacks that began in October last year.What I found was that she was tremendously hungry before the attacks, said Linu. Hungry, irritable and crying.The doctors found high blood pressure and even high blood sugar in the child, but the heart rate was low, the mother said.Liyas developmental parameters did not follow a normal timeline. She had delayed speech and showed certain autistic features. Linu and her husband Denny Anthikkadan, a rice mill worker in Kanjoor, Kalady, had sought help earlier. She started speaking only when she turned three.Eight attacks so farThe girl has had eight sleep attacks since October. She was treated also for non-convulsive epileptic attacks earlier, and it was during one such episode that she was found to be bleeding from nose and mouth. The ESI hospital that was sending them to referral centres then sent her to Aster Medcity.Dr. Akbar Mohammed Chettali, paediatric neurologist treating the child, said it was a rare case of a sleeping disorder called Kleine-Levin syndrome or Sleeping Beauty syndrome. It is a rare neurological disorder with only around one or two cases per million, he said.A neuropsychiatric disorder, it had earlier been found in a few cases in small children who had autistic features. But no studies have linked it with autism, he added.A study was done using Polysomnography: recording brain waves, the oxygen level in blood, heart rate and breathing as well as eye and leg movements to diagnose sleep disorders. Consultations with other specialities followed, indicating prolonged REM (rapid eye movement, deep) sleep. Investigations through clinical criteria and diagnosis through exclusion pointed to Kleine-Levin syndrome, said Dr. Chettali. The child has responded to treatment.The sleep attacks are expected to come down with age, the doctor said."

They reached Chennai by an Emirates flight from Dubai.Detailing their ordeal in Iran, one of the fishermen, Kennedy from Kanyakumari, said that they had suffered without proper food and water, and were kept on an island after a few days in jail. Social media and the press in India took up our matter with the two governments to resolve our crisis, he said.Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said that 35 fishermen from Tamil Nadu were detained by the Iranian Navy for entering the countrys waters. The Chief Minister wrote to the Prime Minister on this issue, which expedited the release of the fishermen.Another five fishermen will reach Chennai in the next few days and efforts are on to release the remaining 15, he said.The fishermen were detained with their three boats in Bahrain. The fishermen were reportedly working for some Bahrainis.

Thirugnanam, a resident of VGP Colony in Velachery, rued the shortage of pulses items in ration shop located at Ram Nagar. He said that customers visiting ration shops after the 15th of every month were told that only sugar and boiled rice were available.I usually get 1 kg of toor dhall at Rs. 30 a kg and urad dhall at the same price every month. I have been purchasing dhall through the public distribution system since 2006-07. However, when I went to the shop last month I was shocked to be informed that they did not have any stock of pulses, he said.Mary Theresa, a resident of Virugambakkam, said palm oil and kerosene too were not available in her shop.Last year, those who went to the shop before 10th of every month, did not get even rice. Senior citizens found it very difficult to stand in long queues at that time. Perhaps, separate time slots could be allotted for senior citizens, she said.A ration shopkeeper said they had not received stock of any pulses in February. He also said every month there was a shortage in supply of rice and pulses.Dhalls and palm oil come under the special public distribution system category. Though the scheme was introduced after 2006, it has been continuously implemented from 2011.The government used to extend the scheme by issuing a G.O. every year. But in the last two years, this extension has been done once in three months. Since the G.O. is yet to be issued, orders for the dhalls have not been placed, said a source.Eye on pollsPolitical commentators said that the government, perhaps, had ensured supply of dhalls till December with an eye on the local body elections.The uneconomical pricing of dhalls has been hurting the government financially. There was also a talk that the prices would be increased, but it was not done."
58f94b78a3d24b0b70c3ea8e,Cornering the Asian eatery,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/cornering-the-asian-eatery/article17670600.ece,2017-03-27,"Over a long lunch at Jia, which opened last month in Colaba, Neville Vazifdar and his wife, Michelle, spoke to us with passion and insight about the city's food scene and its evolving tastes.Vazifdar, who started Royal China in 2004, back when the only other alternative was China Garden, has seen to it that the restaurant grows in three locations  one each in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi (a fourth in Bandra is currently shuttered, though Vazifdar would like to reopen it as soon as we can). The restaurateurs new venture, Jia - The Oriental Kitchen, opened in Colaba last month. On the day we lunched there with Vazifdar, it was fast filling up with a mix of dating couples, regulars (yes, they already have people who have dined there three to four times), and curious families, on the first truly hot Saturday afternoon of 2017. The ever-expanding entrepreneur has just launched Kuai Kitchen, a quick service Asian eatery in the space formerly occupied by Sufra, the Middle Eastern restaurant by Moshe, on Colaba Causeway.Expanding the repertoireThe menu at Jia offers a mix of cuisines, from Japanese sushi  Its something that people want, theres no doubt about it in Bombay, asserts Vazifdar  to Chinese dim sum and more. Whats on offer reflects the changing tastes of diners, who want more than just Kung Pao potatoes and chicken in black bean sauce, its now Chilean sea bass dim sum and mushroom truffle rice.Its no surprise that the menu at Jia features both, the aforementioned dishes, along with a selection of large plates, a special vegetarian menu, and zingy cocktails for the citys perpetual summer. For Vazifdar, Jia is a chance to grow with the city, while also nudging diners to expand their horizons when it comes to ordering and eating Asian food. I dont think it would have been the right decision to continue to expand the Royal China brand but [rather we wanted to] experiment with new [dishes]. Because when youre already established in something. I think you got to just continue doing that, He says, adding, Then came the idea  okay, Royal China is established, its got its set clientele, but theres so much more that we can do, in terms of food, presentation and adding new dishes, that people want.As plates (sourced from Thailand), came piled with a crunchy prawn tempura sushi, light yet punchy salmon carpaccio, mock meat puffs and more, Vazifdar spoke at length about Mumbais restaurant culture  where diners want value, and consistency over all else. So, even while hes sourcing ingredients from abroad, like Berkshire pork from the U.K., sushi-quality fish from Japan, and chillies from Thailand, just to name three for Jia, the menu prices are comparable to other restaurants in the city. While talking about how he placed a special order for the crockery from Thailand, we learned that everything at Jia has been put together by both him and his wife, from crockery to supplier sourcing, tastings and more.Eccentric titbitsVazifdar, who clearly enjoys the food at his own restaurant, lets us in on a culinary quirk of his  he needs to eat egg fried rice with his Oriental meal, from the first bite itself. And while were tucking into edamame and truffle dumplings (made with a truffle paste, and not oil), we see Vazifdar helping himself to a moundful of rice to go with his food. He explains that earlier, when on sourcing trips to China, hed politely wait for the rice to come at the end of every meal. But as the visits got more frequent, hed explain to his partners in the Middle Kingdom that hed like the rice ordered at the same time as the dim sum and small plates.Expounding on the thinking behind Jia, Vazifdar said, Chinese food has a huge variety of things and we can incorporate so many new items, which are different to what we are doing. Even dim sum uses more specialised ingredients, more imported meat  for which there is a niche in the market. So that is how we made this menu. Citing the example of Chilean sea bass, he said, You couldnt get it, it wasnt there [in the market], in the days when Royal China started, now its readily available.Edible overlapsA canny businessman, Vazifdar also addressed the fact that Jia and Royal China are both located quite close to each other. Is he worried that one will cannibalise sales of the other? He said, There are two answers to that. One is that no, I am not competing, because the food here [at Jia] is very different to what were giving there [at Royal China]. The second thing is, even if I were to give the same food for that matter, either I do it or someone else will come and do it. Then that guy will be taking the money home, here Im taking the money home. We listened intently while using chopsticks to guide pieces of forest honey marinated sea bass onto our plate, with prawns in a sweet and sour sauce, which we gladly ate with earthy mushroom fried rice with truffle oil that included shimeji and enoki mushrooms.Over the years, Vazifdar has learned that restaurants are, the ideal place for social experiments, as he has used vouchers and other inducements to test out everything, from pricing to loyalty and more. Giving an example, he cites the large home-delivery business of Royal China, and said that on a whim, he sent off Rs. 500 coupons on a particular night, that have to be redeemed within a set amount of time. As the expiry neared, sales shot up, as customers didnt want to lose out on the deal.For the rest of the year, without giving specifics, Vazifdar said, Weve got a lot of things happening; we just basically want to think of continuously opening things now. Bombay is a good market, and [by] having different brands under our wing, we can choose which brand [to open] in which [part of the city]. His expansion plans are limited to Mumbai for the moment.Even with his team in place, he still likes to be able to walk into his restaurants and check on them. Vazifdar believes that it takes constant personal supervision and interest to maintain and build the level of consistency that keeps people coming back.Jia - The Oriental Kitchen, Colaba; 6156 2222Kuai Kitchen, Colaba; 33126018"

A festive atmosphere prevailed outside the Assembly and Council complex with the farmers in a jubilant mood coming to Velagapudi to express their gratitude to the Chief Minister for completion of the lift irrigation project in a record time. Some farmers brought payasam, pongal, and food items prepared with the rice grown in their fields and offered it to Mr. Naidu.These were also distributed to all the staff and security personnel outside the Assembly complex. They also offered unthreshed paddy arranged like a bouquet to Mr. Naidu, and said they would forever be indebted to him. The Chief Minister said that the State would soon become drought-free."

The 7th edition of Tamirabharani Waterbird Count (TWC) will be held on February 4 despite the drought-like condition prevailing in the southern districts.Interested persons can take part in the survey and compilation of information about the winged visitors they could see during the count.ATREEs Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre (ACCC), in association with Pearl City Nature Society (PCNS), Thoothukudi, and Nellai Nature Club (NNC), Tirunelveli, conduct the TWC this year. The Tamirabharani, its tributaries and the old irrigation system associated with it have made Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts as Southern Tamil Nadus major rice producer and an important bird area.The forests in the hills that capture the monsoon rain and release the water into the streams and rivers feed a larger network of irrigation tanks in both the districts. Tamirabharani wetlands support over 90 species of waterbirds, most of which are migratory species.There are important bird habitats such as Koonthankulam, Tiruppudaimaruthur and Vagaikulam in Tirunelveli district and tanks in Srivaikundam region of Thoothukudi district that attract a large number of birds. These birds play a very important role in the ecosystem and humans receive enormous benefits from the birds.Unfortunately, many of the wetlands are threatened by encroachment, pollution and urbanisation, and there is no concern for local biodiversity found in these places. With increasing demand for water for both developmental needs and human use these wetlands are further threatened. The local communities around the wetlands should guard their precious natural resources... The TWC is an effort to bring the attention of the local citizens to these wetlands, says M. Mathivanan, coordinator, ACCC.This year, all rain-fed and systemised tanks in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts are dry due to poor precipitation during the South-west and North-east monsoons. Forty large tanks with little water have been selected in both districts for this census.Around 23,000 birds of 62 species were recorded during Tamirabharani Waterbird Count 2016. Bird experts and volunteers are invited to participate in the TWC 2017. Interested people may contact the coordinator, ACCC, via email: mathi@atree.org or mobile phone: 94880 63750, Mr. Mathivanan said."

Kamaraj on Thursday claimed there was no shortage of supplies of food items in ration shops and blamed rumour mongers for creating a situation where people were led to believe there was a shortage.At a press conference at the Secretariat, the Minister, however, refused to present the actual stock position of ration products.Contradicting his own statement, Mr. Kamaraj, said there was a delay in procuring items to be distributed under the special PDS scheme. Where there is an extension of the special scheme, there might be a slight delayabout 10 days of processing time. That delay might be there, he said.As far as stock is concerned, there is no problem. Everything has been set right, he said. When asked about the stock position, he said There is no issue at all.You cannot point out (to shortage at) one particular place and claim there is a shortage across the State. If you point out the location, we will take action, Mr. Kamaraj said. Rice was being given to ration cardholders without any problems.Wheat is being given as per requirement, if people want, in lieu of rice. But shopkeepers cannot force people to get some wheat instead of rice. If cardholders want 20kg of rice, it has to be given, he said.According to him, wheat and palm oil were being procured every month, and dhall too was available. Smart cards for all ration cardholders would be issued from April 1 and thereafter the PDS distribution would become seamless and without issues.Meanwhile, Minister for Cooperation Sellur K. Raju, said 4,640 tonnes of rice, 789 tonnes of sugar, and 262 tonnes of wheat were distributed under the PDS as on March 1.Every month roughly 2.95 lakh metric tonnes of rice, 31,868 tonnes of sugar, 13,602 metric tonnes of wheat, 23,638 tonnes of palm oil is distributed under the PDS, he said.PDS cardholders who face shortage of supplies can call 044-28592828 and raise complaints. They can call the helpline number 1967 if they have any queries or complaints."

It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly.The State, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people. The BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs. 1 lakh, while the BJP, the Congress, the SP and the RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.In a bid to woo farmers, parties including the BJP and the SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while the Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan karza maaf, bijli half (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).The BJP, in its manifesto called Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra , has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto.The SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs. 7.5 lakh from present Rs. 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the State, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents.The BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while the RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks time.Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale.Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs. 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.The BJP said that on lines of the central governments decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power.Quota to be extendedThe BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.Ms. Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression.Even as its ally SP stressed on social justice while boasting of all-round development during last five years, Congress has vowed to provide free legal aid to all members of the SC, ST, OBC communities and appoint Suraksha Mitra to assist in filing of cases committed against Dalits.Uttar Pradesh, which has time and again drawn flak for its law and order issues, notably has a 50 per cent shortage of police staff.According to a recent Union Home Ministry report, the UP Police has been working with 1.80 lakh personnel as against a sanctioned strength of 3.64 lakh.While Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav has promised three promotions to police personnel on meet basis during the service tenure, the BJP manifesto states recruitment of 1.5 lakh personnel on vacant slots.The RLD has made a general pitch for early recruitments on all vacant positions under the State government.To ensure the safety of college girls, innovative antiRomeo squads will be set up near colleges to check eve-teasing, said BJP.While BJP once again raked up the issues of Triple Talaq and Ram temple, promising its construction through constitutional measures, Congress promised bringing in law against hate crimes.On exodus of people due to communal tension, BJP said a special team would be formed to check it at district level and the District will be held responsible in such matters.The Ajit Singh-led RLD has notably made a pitch for setting up four new benches of the Allahabad High Court, a demand that has been echoing in far-off parts of the State.Interesting overlapAn interesting overlap in promises has been seen in BJP and SP manifesto, both of which promised expanding the metro rail network, upgrading 100 police service, 108 ambulance service, among a few others.Framing of policies to ensure ease of doing business, job creations, promotion of local handicrafts, skill development of youth, establishing cold storages among others have found place in manifestos of all political parties.Invariably all parties manifestos promise improvement in healthcare services with BJP and SP assuring establishment of more AIIMS-like institutes, even as the first two AIIMS in Rae Bareli and Gorakhpur which were approved for UP in 2009 and 2012 respectively are yet to go operational. - PTI"

The hostel was being run without statutory approval.The students were not given enough care. No proper accommodation was provided and the room had poor ventilation. Cleanliness and hygiene in the hostel and kitchen were missing. The kitchen was not attached to the dining hall, and was full of rodents and pests with poor lighting and less ventilation.

Narayanasamy has asked officials of the Department of Agriculture to interact with farmers regularly and make field visits to ascertain the situation.Interacting with farmers at the Government Botanical Garden here on Tuesday, Mr. Narayanasamy said there was no point in officers staying put in their offices and ascertaining the predicament of farmers.There were several advanced technologies in farm operations.But the facilities were not reaching the farmers as the officers were virtually failing in their duty to acquaint the farmers with the latest technologies.Mr. Narayanasamy said that Puducherry had been procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh and vegetables from Bengaluru and Coimbatore, although there was good scope to produce them locally.He said that his frequent visits to New Delhi had been criticised. But it was because of his trips that Puducherrys interests were protected in the Goods and Services Tax regime, he said.Agriculture Minister R. Kamalakannan was present."

No prizes for guessing it is idli and dosa, the all-time south Indian favourites.Their popularity is evident from the number of times technologies pertaining to them were downloaded from among the 11 developed by the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), and made available free of cost to entrepreneurs.Traditional foods are driving the food industry and their market is expanding. Idli and dosa will remain much-loved among them, says CFTRIs Director Ram Rajashekaran.""Our ready-to-use idli (1,800 downloads) and dosa (1,900 downloads) technologies saw the maximum number of downloads for adoption by entrepreneurs, which shows a promising future for traditional foods despite the onslaught of junk foods, Mr. Rajashekaran felt. Other technologies made available for free by CFTRI include amla candy, composite ragi bread, fruit spreads, protein-enriched buns, cereal rice flakes, and the refining of millets. Whereas the tech for protein enriched buns has crossed 1,400 downloads, the technology for cereal flakes rice has been downloaded about 500 times, and that for refining millets about 400 times.Thus far, 4,539 aspiring entrepreneurs from across the country have registered with CFTRI for availing their free technologies.Dr. Jeesa Krishna from Kerala is one of them. She is hoping to make it big with her food start-up on fresh idli and dosa batter, which is all set for a launch. Several enterprises, like hers, are either launching or have commenced production with free technologies from CFTRI. I appeal to entrepreneurs and start-ups who adopt this technology to blend the batter with fibre. Fibrous foods are good for diabetics. Also, keep you products safe and free from preservatives, since they delay fermentation. Since everybody likes these foods, I would like entrepreneurs to look beyond the product and incorporate nutritional benefits, the CFTRI director suggested."

CFTRI had released 11 proven and successful technologies for free by publishing the Detailed Technology Dossiers on its website three years ago.Many entrepreneurs who attended the Thursdays event have adopted the technologies and are in the process of launching the products commercially.CFTRI Director Ram Rajashekaran explained the unique equitable model for empowering the first generation entrepreneurs by commercialising the free technologies. He spoke on the factors that drive the food industry. If you are willing to adopt the technology, we at the CFTRI are ready to give, he said.According to CFTRI, rice mix milk is a convenience food with long shelf life of six months. About 20-24 gm of rice milk granules can be mixed with 180 gm of boiling water followed by mixing and boiling for another one minute. If needed, 5 gm of sugar can be added to improve the taste. It contains 15.2% protein and 74.2% carbohydrate. The developed process is meant for addressing malnutrition in children aged between 6 months and 6 years.The CFTRI has developed the product at a cost of Rs. 57 lakh and revenue of Rs. 2.4 crore can be generated per annum by its commercialisation. Around 500 kg of rice mix milk can be prepared in a day at a production cost of Rs. 132 a kg.Using the foot-operated papad press, 400 papads can be made in a hour. Four papads can be pressed between two plastic sheets at a time and thickness can be varied. The technology can also be used to make gol gappas and chapatis. The unit is independent of the recipe. It can prepare papads from even horse gram, which is considered difficult using conventional methods, according to CFTRI."

Volunteers associated with it are also educating people nearby on the need to conserve water.Mr. Yash, along with his wife Radhika, a popular Kannda actor, launched the dredging programme on February 28.Tallur tank is one of the few tanks selected by YMF for rejuvenation and is spending an approximate sum of Rs. 4 crore, according to Mr. Yash. There is a need to improve and rejuvenate all tanks in the State ... through rejuvenation of Tallur tank I have made a small beginning, says Mr. Yash.Last August, YMF supplied drinking water to 50 villages in Kalaburagi and Vijayapura districts.People make us actors and stars. We owe something to them beyond our roles on screen, says actor Ninasam Satish of Lucia fame, who is helping the families of farmers who have committed suicide owing to agrarian crisis.Mr. Satish has decided to dedicate 10% of the profit from his future projects to this cause.Mr. Satish says his decision was quite natural given that he hails from a farming family in Yeladahalli of Mandya district, where his family grows rice and sugarcane on two acres of land."
