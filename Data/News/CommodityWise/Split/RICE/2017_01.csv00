The festival is organised by Sanjeevani, supported by Agriculture Technology Management Agency, Visakhpatnam, and the Comprehensive Millet Revival Programme of the Department of Agriculture of Andhra Pradesh with evaluation and characterisation by ICAR-National Bureau of Plant Genetics Research, Hyderabad, Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University and Wassan Foundation. ITDA Project Officer Ravi Pattanshetti, who visited the festival, said that the potential for scaling up the area under cultivation of millets, the marketing potential, price and its sustainability had to be assessed. In the meanwhile, millets can be used as nutritional supplement in ICDS centres and hostels to increase consumption in the first place, he said.State consultant for the Department of Agriculture N.D.R.K. Sarma said after preliminary evaluation and short-listing of the seeds brought to the festival field trials would be taken up in the next Kharif paving the way for exchange of seed all over the state in 2018 Kharif.Molecular breedingAfter selection of seeds, in every season pure line selection is done by taking one seed from one plant and observe characteristics like yield and resistance to disease etc. In molecular breeding, we try to identify at DNA level genes responsible, slice them and introduce into seeds to improve them, elaborates Principal Scientist of NBPGR B. Sarath Babu.Sanjeevani, an NGO that works on sustainable agriculture, has been celebrating the seed festival for 11 years now.In the 12th festival this year, the festival is organised with the government agencies coming together and supporting it, said its secretary P. Devullu.In earlier efforts, millet seed was brought from Malkangiri and distributed to famers in Hukumpeta mandal. Two varieties of rice from Tirupati were said to have been cultivated in the Agency in the past. Once a tribal farmer recognises that the seed was suitable or once grown here, he will take it up contributing to the biodiversity, he asserts."

Since then, his lab has been working to identify how these micro-RNAs are helping salt-tolerant Pokkali rice compared to the high-yielding salt-sensitive IR29 genotypes.These comparisons had identified several leads that necessitated further investigation, a press note quoting Dr. Sunkar said.We have tried to comparatively analyse two varieties of rice  a salt- tolerant variety like Pokkali and salt-susceptible varieties such as IR29 and Basmati  to identify specific molecules that make Pokkali productive even under salinity. We are still at the very early stages of our research, but the results are positive and has given us a lot of confidence, said Ms. Neeti.GI tagThe uniqueness of Pokkali rice, which was awarded the GI (Geographical Indication) tag in 2008, and grown in the waterlogged coastal areas of south and central Kerala, is its high tolerance to salinity, a major threat worldwide to agriculture.Unearthing the secret of tolerance to salt in Pokkali, say scientists, is critical in engineering varieties of other crops that can withstand salinity and thus lead to higher yields.Salinity a major threatAmong the most serious environmental problems today is salinity. There is demand to grow more food for a growing population and among the many challenges faced by science and technology is how to increase crop yield in the face of issues such as depleting water resources and cultivable land, said Radhakrishnan Pillai, director, RGCB.Noted plant physiologist Sudhir Sopory, former Vice Chancellor of Jawaharlal Nehru University, has also used Pokkali to understand how it reacts to and tolerates external stress factors such as salinity, temperature, and changes in nutrient input."

Tender coconut water is a source of electrolytes and minerals and is considered a healthy beverage in summer.Citrus fruit such as orange and sweet lemon, and bananas and grapes are also being fed to the animals. Water is showered on the giraffes through jets installed in their enclosure at least twice a day.With the mercury rising, the zoo management is keeping a close watch on the health of the animals and birds even as it has taken a number of measures to keep their stress levels in check. Almost all the animal enclosures have a natural cover protecting them from the harsh sun. At the same time, continuous spraying from water jets is keeping the enclosures cool.The temperature inside the zoo is usually lower by two or three degrees because of the greenery. In summer, animals and birds will be under stress. We address this keeping the surroundings fresh and breezy and by introducing cooling food in the daily diet, said K. Kamala, the zoos executive director.Chimps are most fond of tender coconut water, which is good to keep the body hydrated. The animal keepers give them tender coconuts thrice a day in addition to seasonal fruits, which are fed to all the herbivores too, she said.Frozen fruit ice cubes, mostly apples, were fed to Himalayan bears, Ms. Kamala said.Summer specialBesides the regular food, elephants at the zoo are being fed curds and their pools are kept brimming with water through the day. Usually, we feed curd rice to jumbos once a day as a summer special. The elephants are given a bath almost daily, Ms. Kamala said.Drinking water is mixed with electrolytes to top up body salts.

According to M. Mathivanan, coordinator, Tamirabarani Wetland Rejuvenation Programme, the plains of Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi that lie in a semi-arid landscape are shadowed by Agasthyamalai mountains of the Western Ghats and the area receives between 700 mm and 1,000 mm of annual rainfall, most of which is during north-east monsoon between October and December.He said the mountain range, with its dense forests, captured rain during south-west and north-east monsoons, and drained it through several rivers such as Ramanadhi, Gadananadhi, Tamirabarani, Manimuthar, Pachchaiyar, Nambiyar and Chittar. These rivers and their tributaries fed a network of canals and tanks that made the region the rice bowl of south Tamil Nadu.There were 2,518 tanks in Tamirabarani basin, and 1,221 of them were systemised and 1,297 non-systemised. Nearly 1.30 lakh acres of land was getting irrigated through these tanks, he noted.These wetlands played an important role in improving water quality, recharging groundwater, protecting human habitations from floods and erosion and providing water. These tanks were also rich with plants, fish and other animals for human consumption and offered opportunities for recreation like fishing, boating and photography.The wetlands in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts faced serious threats such as sewage from human habitations, fertilizer and pesticide run-off from agricultural fields and pollution from industries.These threats also led to spread of invasive plants like water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) and bush morning glory (Ipomea fistulosa) in the wetlands, reducing habitat suitability for aquatic fauna.To mark World Water Day (March 22), the wetland rejuvenation programme will be organised at Nainarkulam in Tirunelveli on Wednesday. Around 200 NSS volunteers from M.D.T. Hindu College, St. Johns College, Sadakathullah Appa College and A.K.Y. Polytechnic College will be involved in the cleaning activity. It is jointly organised by the ACCC, Nellai Nature Club and Rotary Club, with the guidance of Public Works Department, said Mr. Mathivanan."

Hari, a migrant from Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh, works as a captain on a fishing boat in Veraval, Gujarat.(Below) Mylipalli Satyamma, from Etcherla mandal of Srikakulam district, speaks to her husband Lakshmaiah and sons who are now in Gujarat.Prashant Nakwe; K.R. DeepakShaik Navab Jani, 32, is busy cooking rice and fish on a 15-metre mid-sized mechanised fishing trawler anchored at the harbour in Veraval. The coastal town in Gujarat is considered to be one of the biggest fishing and seafood hubs in western India with more than 8,000 registered fishing boats and dozens of processing factories exporting frozen fish. Jani, even as he cooks, is also arguing on his mobile phone with his seth (employer) for the full salary which was committed to him and his other mates. The seth, he claims, has cut Rs. 8,000 from his consolidated salary for eight months. You cannot cut my salary as you had promised the full amount, he wails in broken Hindi, immediately switching to Telugu to translate for his fellow travellers huddled near the boat on a jetty. The seth and the tandel (captain) promised Rs. 80,000 for the season, he tells his mates, who also appear angry and dejected. The negotiations go back and forth, in a curious mix of Hindi, Gujarati and Telugu.Jani is one of several thousand single migrants, addressed as Madrasis here, who have journeyed from Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam on the east coast to Veraval 2,000 km away to work on mechanised fishing trawlers from August to March every year. Away from their families for eight months of the year, the rough seas are their home, a home they revere and fear.Our problem is with payment. They promise Rs. 10,000 per month when we come and then reduce it when its time for us to leave. Its unfair, says Jani, quickly adding, Our seth is god for us. We have no other problem here. They give us free food, good basmati rice and fresh fish. They even let us take 10-15 kg dried fish back home when we leave. But the payment is a problem as at the end of season, the seth tries to cut the salary under the pretext of low catch.Life in a boatNo official figures are available but roughly 15,000 fishermen from Andhra Pradesh are hired by the Gujarati seafaring Kharva community in Veraval each season. Locals prefer day-long fishing, venturing out before dawn and returning as dusk settles in, in small boats. The fishermen from Andhra come in handy for the long haul, for deep-sea trips that sometimes last a week. The migrants have been mainstays of the fishing industry here for more than two decades now.Each boat carries 8-10 persons. The tandel gets paid Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000 a month while khalasis (sailors) are paid Rs. 7,000-Rs. 10,000 a month plus free food. Typically, in a month they are 20-25 days out at sea. After each week-long trip in which they venture as far as Goa, Karnataka and even Kerala, they unload tonnes of catch at the jetty and prepare the boat  loading it with ice, diesel and ration  the very next day for the next trip. Theres no home to go to for recuperation; they live on boats even when the boats are anchored at the harbour. For eight months, the boat is our home, as we do everything in it, says 35-year-old tandel Rayithi Erraiah from Srikakulam district, who has worked in Veraval for two decades.Locally built traditional fishing trawlers are around 15-20 metres long, powered by engines of 75-100 horsepower, and fitted with a radio transmitter and navigational instruments like GPS and echo-location fish finders. On every boat, cabins are constructed at the back of the deck. These cabins, just about 8x6 ft big, house eight men at a time, along with the navigation equipment and the fishers luggage, safety kits and even small TVs and DVD players.Erraiah says the low income from fishing in traditional boats in his home State forced him and thousands of others to migrate to Gujarat. As tandel, he is the literally the man in the middle between the seth and the khalasis, who are hired through word of mouth or, as is often the case with the likes of Erraiah, from the vicinity of the native village. As per the informal system, the seth pays a lump sum of Rs. 7-8 lakh to the tandel, who then pays the khalasis for the entire season in advance. At the end of the season, there is a final stocktaking  if the catch is good and the seth is pleased, there are bonuses to be had, but theres no guaranteeing them.The push and pull factorsSeveral migrants in Veraval complain about the low wages but at the same time, they insist that back home they dont even get one-third of what they earn in Gujarat. Jangaya, 44, from Kunjurvanipeta near Arasavilli in Srikakulam, has been coming to Veraval for 15 years. A tandel, he gets around Rs. 18,000 per month. Theres no income from fishing on the Andhra coast, he says. The shortage of skilled manpower for fishing in Veraval is perennial, and the Andhra fishermen plug the gap.According to the International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF), poverty remains a major factor driving migration. Last year, the ICSF carried out a detailed study, Migrant Fishers from Andhra Pradesh in the Gujarat Marine Fishing Industry, which found that of the 1,60,000 fisher families in Andhra Pradesh, 97% are below the official poverty line.Chikati Polisamma, 50, a resident of D. Machilesam in Etcherla mandal of Srikakulam district on the Andhra-Odisha border, has had her husband Korlayya leave every year for Veraval for a decade now; most of the 3,000-odd men of this village work there. Last August, their eldest son Hariappadu also headed for the Gujarat town after the graduates year-long search went in vain. I have not given up hope and am ensuring that my two other sons are also well educated. They are in school, she says.Left to fend for herself, Polisamma soldiers on with her growing-up sons in their two-room tenement. Every morning, she goes to the shore to buy fish from the local fishers and travels around in shared autos selling them in the streets of Etcherla and its adjoining areas  public transport to the village was withdrawn a couple of years ago. Her earnings at the end of a long day are a meagre Rs. 100.While they are goneThere are many Polisammas in this backward district, selling fresh or dried fish to make their daily ends meet and staying connected with their men on the other coast through occasional mobile-phone calls. There are often scares. My husband Pakkala Lakshmi accidentally crossed the border area in Pakistan two years ago and was detained by the authorities. The fishing community in Gujarat finally managed to secure his release, says Ramulamma of D. Machilesam village. The falling health of their men due to continuous exposure to sunlight and the elements at sea remains a matter of concern, but theres wry humour too. We are happy that they are deprived of booze during their stay in Gujarat, points out Kondapalli Gavaramma from Srikurmam in Gara mandal, whose husband and two sons work there.Of late, insurance has been made compulsory for all the fishermen but Pandodus family wasnt so lucky. My husband died of ill-health but we didnt get any ex gratia or compensation as he had no insurance. My son Ramu is now in Veravel. I look after my grandson and earn a few bucks by selling dried fish, says Guramma of Badiwadipeta village.Andhra fishermen whove opted to venture out to Gujarat since the early 1990s say their own coast is a long-running saga of depleting catch. Though the Visakhapatnam fishing harbour is 100-200 km away, they are treated as outsiders there. With fishing at home no longer sustainable, there are some who still do not want to take the Gujarat route. But jobs are difficult to come by. After finishing my intermediate in commerce, I went to Chennai to undergo a seamens course for six months by spending Rs. 1 lakh but have been looking for a job for the past two years. Consultants who act as placement agents for various merchant vessels are insisting on a payment of Rs. 50,000 towards service charges, a sum Ive been unable to arrange, says Barri Hari, 21, from Etcherla. Another youth, Gangala Laxman, from the same area, is making do as a tailor. Our demand for ST status hasnt been granted. I completed my BA and BEd in 2011-12 but havent been to get a job, says the aspiring teacher who has attempted the District Selection Committee Test twice.Then there are some like Chikati Appa Rao who turned their back on Veraval after a stint. He saw two of his crew members  fellow villagers  die in a freak mishap while jumping from one boat to another in 2002. Now I am happy whenever I get some work and manage the family with meagre earnings at my native place, he says.Giving them their dueVeraval produced 2.8 lakh tonnes of marine fish in 2014-15, out of which 24,073 tonnes was exported, fetching Rs. 361 crore in export earnings. Asked why they hand out a raw deal to the Andhra migrants, boat and fish processing unit owners deny any exploitation and take pains to explain how food and medicines are never in short supply. We pay them handsome salaries and provide them ration, claims Tulsi Gohel, president of the Veraval Boat Owners Association, who operates a fleet of around a dozen boats and employs over 30 migrant fishers. I agree that its hard work but they are paid accordingly. Its unlike Myanmarese bonded labourers on Thai fishing vessels, says Kenny Thomas, who owns the Jinny Marine processing units, drawing an eerie parallel. Thomas also claims that there has never been any complaint of labour abuse in Veraval.Veravals fortunes in recent years have largely been built on the blood, sweat and tears of the Andhra migrants, and while they would feel short-changed every once in a while, the sobering reality is that this is their only escape from deprivation at home. This fishing season is at its end, and many are preparing for the journey home and relishing the prospect of being reunited with their families. But chances are that come August, most of them  and newer recruits from their villages  would be retracing the rehearsed route from one coast to the other for another season in the deep seas."

High School, Kodimial returning home during lunch time.When the officials asked workers implementing Mid Day Meal scheme about the students absence, they were told that the food prepared for students was being consumed mostly by teachers, sources said.Govt. instructionsThough, the State Government had given clear instructions that only one teacher or headmaster of the school should only taste the food to check the quality, many of the teachers do not carry their lunch boxes and consume food prepared for students.Ironically, the mid-day meal workers are asked to first serve food in dishes at the teachers/staff room even before it is served to students.Some of the government school teachers in rural areas even warn the workers of dire consequences if they do not prepare special dishes on special occasions.In some schools, the teachers even instruct the implementing agencies to prepare sweets to be distributed to students during national holidays like Independence Day and Republic Day.The headmasters say that the teachers threaten them if they do not allow them to eat the food prepared for students.The teachers suggest to them to increase the number of students in the list by adding the names of even absentees, they added.Unethical practiceThe TRTF district president M. Prathap Reddy said that it was unfair and unethical on the part of teachers to eat the food prepared for poor students when they were getting good salaries.Lok Satta district president N. Srinivas said that it was a criminal offence and urged the government to register criminal cases against the teachers for violating the norms of the mid-day meal scheme.Many teachers do not carry their lunch boxes and consume food prepared for students."

For the last 45 days, the farmers have sold over 350 quintals of rice at much cheaper rates than the market price. Laxmipur rice brand is gaining popularity in the district and there are many takers for the fine variety. They also secured orders for supply of another 300 quintals. The Jai Sriram variety of rice is sold at Rs. 3,600 per quintal, HMT variety at Rs. 3,400 per quintal and BPT at Rs. 3,000 per quintal.

KUMARS_S_KUMARThe forest department has come to the conclusion that the 20 peacocks that were found dead on an agriculture land at Kondalangkuppam near Vanur in Villupuram district were poisoned by local farmers for straying into their farmlands in search of fodder.An official with Tindivanam Range Office told The Hindu that they have found samples of pesticide mixed rice from a groundnut field. We are almost certain that the birds died after consuming pesticide mixed rice. We found the samples from a field where groundnut was being cultivated.It is a deliberate act and the birds have not taken the rice accidentally, the official said.Investigators have identified four persons who could be behind planting the pesticide mixed rice on the agriculture land.The owner of the land was reported to be absconding after the incident came to light, said an official. We will make the arrest after getting the lab report, the official said. Peacock is protected under Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and killing of the bird could invite three to seven years of imprisonment.Killed to protect cropAnother official said that the birds were killed not for meat or extraction of oil but to prevent them from destroying the crops.A large number of peacocks are found in the Vanur area and they feed on the agriculture land.The people of the village said that there had been sharp increase in the number of peacocks in the area.Bhagyam of Kaniyakutta near Kondalangkuppam said the birds strayed into the fields to feast on groundnut, paddy and red beans. The people said it was considered a holy bird. We dont harm the birds. We were shocked to see the carcasses and I am sure it is the handiwork of farmers from outside. A large number of outsiders have bought land in the area for cultivation, she said.Veeraraghavan, a Congress leader in Puducherry, said the number of birds had increased manifold in the last two years in villages bordering Puducherry and Tamil Nadu.

Planning for the visit has been under way since Omans ruler Sultan Qaboos on March 2 nominated his cousin Sayyid Asad Bin Tariq Al Said as the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of international affairs, sources told The Hindu on Monday.The sources said the nomination of Sayyid Asad had given a clear signal that he was the most likely successor of Sultan Qaboos, who has been the ruler of the strategically located Gulf country since taking over power in a coup in 1970. Sultan Qaboos has been ailing for some years. A source familiar with the governments policy on Oman said the visit was necessary to boost bilateral ties, especially since Oman had been a steady partner of India in the region.It is true that we have moved slowly in Oman. India had set up the first bilateral infrastructure fund with Oman, but the project has not moved as fast as expected. That apart, they had asked to give them food security by signing an MoU with India for assured supplies of wheat, rice and sugar and they expressed willingness to invest in an Indian cooperative anywhere of our choosing. These options need to be pursued, said the source explaining that the agenda for the visit should take these pending issues into consideration.Strong partnershipIndia and Oman has a strong strategic partnership and Oman was one of the first Gulf countries to warm to the Modi government in the summer of 2014. Both countries formed a joint front against terrorism in October 2014. However, Mr. Modi has not visited the country, though he has been to the UAE and Saudi Arabia and has hosted the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. India had tried to host Sultan Qaboos, who was partially educated in India, as the chief guest of the Republic Day parade in 2012 but the visit could not take place. But recent trends showed a warming up in ties as Oman hosted the India-Oman Partnership Conference in Muscat on December 14, 2016, which was attended by Minister of State for External Affairs M. J.

Supplyco, which procures paddy through millers, had not made any intervention in the matter, with the result that the paddy remained stacked in the fields. The farmers were under stress as any unseasonal rain could harm the entire lot of stacked paddy. The farms had faced drought, salt water incursion, pest attack, and other problems arising out of climate change. The government which had proclaimed a pro-farmer stand should bear the extra cost, Mr. Peelianikkal said.Exploitation by agentsThe millers were collecting paddy through agents who were bent on exploiting the farmers, he said. The issue should be dealt with urgently. The farmers demand that government introduce post-harvest insurance, he said."

Then, with a click, a microchip is injected in the employees hand. Another cyborg is created.What could pass for a dystopian vision of the workplace is almost routine at the Swedish start-up hub Epicenter. The company offers to implant its workers and start-up members with microchips the size of grains of rice that function as swipe cards  to open doors, operate printers, or buy smoothies with a wave of the hand.The injections have become so popular that workers at Epicenter hold parties for those willing to get implanted.The biggest benefit I think is convenience, said Patrick Mesterton, co-founder and CEO of Epicenter. As a demonstration, he unlocks a door by merely waving near it. It basically replaces a lot of things you have, other communication devices, whether it be credit cards or keys.The technology in itself is not new. Such chips are used as virtual collar plates for pets. Companies use them to track deliveries. Its just never been used to tag employees on a broad scale before. Epicenter and a handful of other companies are the first to make chip implants broadly available.However, it raises security and privacy issues. While biologically safe, the data generated by the chips can show how often an employee comes to work or what they buy.Quite a big stepOf course, putting things into your body is quite a big step to do and it was even for me at first, said Mr. Mesterton. But then on the other hand, I mean, people have been implanting things into their body, like pacemakers and stuff to control your heart, he said.Epicenter, which is home to more than 100 companies and some 2,000 workers, began implanting workers in January 2015. Now, about 150 workers have them. A company based in Belgium also offers its employees such implants, and there are isolated cases around the world where tech enthusiasts have tried this out in recent years.The small implants use Near Field Communication technology, the same as in contactless credit cards or mobile payments.When activated by a reader a few centimeters away, a small amount of data flows between the two devices via electromagnetic waves. The implants are passive, meaning they contain information that other devices can read, but cannot read information themselves."

His appetite was for alcohol, which he had almost round-the-clock. This forced him to plunge into depression and more alcohol. After treatment at a Madurai facility, he feels he is born again and longs to unite with his wife and son, who left after realising that alcohol gained precedence over everything else in life for him.Depression, which is stalking many families, has become a serious health issue and the World Health Organisation estimates that people living with depression increased by more than 18% between 2005-15. It is feared that depression would occupy the second position, next only to heart disease, as disease burden on society. This mental illness is prevalent more among women than men. According to the National Mental Health Survey of India 2015-16, 4.5% of Tamil Nadu population is affected by depression. The theme of this years World Health Day, which falls on April 7, is depression. WHO has launched a year-long campaign, Depression, lets talk, with the objective of enabling more people with depression to seek help.The magnitude of depression is still to be understood by society, says C. Ramasubramanian, State Nodal Officer, Mental Health Programme. Factors loaded against treatment of depression include inadequate skilled manpower and infrastructure, high cost, lack of awareness and stigma. Among psychiatric disorders, mental illness is preventable, treatable and curable, if identified early. Otherwise, it will become untreatable and incurable, leading to suicide in some cases, warns Dr. Ramasubramanian. The peculiar nature of depression, he explains, is that it impacts the entire family, especially when it affects a person in the most productive phase of life. A worrying mind is prone to depression. When the mind worries, organs weep, he says.People feel sad over a failed romance, failure in examination, death in the family, problematic relationship or serious illness. Sadness transforms into depression when they are not able to come out of it over a short period of time. Alarm bells should ring when the blues refuse to get away, says K. S. P. Janardhan Babu of M. S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation. According to him, people have a tendency to seek refuge in alcohol to overcome depression, mistaking it to be a mood enhancer. Depression and alcoholism are inter-related variables. Actually, alcohol is not a stimulant but depressant, says Mr. Babu.The State government, according to Dr. Ramasubramanian, has provided trained personnel for all district headquarters hospitals, where a 10-bedded psychiatric ward has started to function.The government cannot tackle this problem alone. Educated people and corporate houses should lend a helping hand, especially in removing the stigma surrounding mental illness, he says. Dr. Ramasubramanian is confident that there will be significant reduction in number of suicides if depression is treated at the level of PHC.A worrying mind is prone to depression.

Subrahmanyan who is also the founder Director of the Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysuru. After his retirement, Dr. Subrahmanyan pioneered the establishment of a research and development facility in the premises of the modern rice mill of the Thanjavur Cooperative Marketing Federation in Tiruvarur in 1967. The need for preserving the high moisture paddy harvested during the monsoon period was the reason for the emergence of the facility in the delta region.In 1972, the institution was upgraded as a national laboratory and was called the Paddy Processing Research Centre (PPRC). In 1984, PPRC was shifted to its present location on the outskirts of Thanjavur town.Following several successful research outcomes, the Union Ministry for Food Processing Industries upgraded the PPRC as a national institute rechristening it as the Indian Institute of Crop Processing Technology in February 2008.The institute boasts of state of the art laboratories for pursuing real time research and development of food grain processing, value addition, by product utilisation through bio processing, process and product development while the NABL- accredited Food Safety and Quality Testing Laboratory of the institute is a premier national referral centre for food product analysis. The laboratories in the facility include the food product development lab oratory, food engineering laboratory, food microbiology laboratory and the food quality testing laboratory.The incubation-cum-training centre of the institute offers technology transfer and training besides providing complete industrial establishment for entrepreneurs to overcome teething troubles when they set up the food processing ventures through the rental route.As the IIFPT, the institution could align all its activities in accordance with the mission statement of the Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries offering a diverse platform for intensive research and development activities in the fields of fish, meat, poultry and dairy products processing, observes Director C. Anandaramakrishnan.The IIFPT is also poised to take up research on food packaging and testing services, nano technology, cold chain logistics, fusion foods, novel foods and consultancy services for entrepreneurs.The formal announcement on renaming the institute is set to happen shortly with the Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaul Badal showing keen interest to expand the frontiers of the institute."

She recalls being called gud , chakka and mamu, and feeling highly uncomfortable with her identity. Today, Urmi is the transgender/ hijra spokesperson for Humsafar Trust. She speaks eloquently with police, doctors, lawyers, politicians and transgender rights advocates all over India about being trans and being a woman. Humsafar Trust, she says, is my maika , my maternal home where I found myself.I have been working at Humsafar Trust for almost a year now, and we work hard to advocate for the LGBTQ community. This International Womens Day, when celebrating the stereotype of the woman has been most common, we decided to gather at the office to hear from all those who identified as women. It was a day when I got the chance to look back at the colourful world I've been privileged to be a part of for the past year.Like Ms. Jadhav, Sowmya Gupta, a trans woman and the deputy manager of Humsafar Trusts Delhi office, spoke on the value of working in a space that understood her issues and was sensitive to her needs. This has been key to her successful career, she said.Humsafar Trust has been working for the health and human rights of sexual minorities in India since 1994, and has been deeply engaged in gender and identities. You can find every kind of woman here: straight, lesbian, queer, bisexual, trans and cisgendered.Alpana Dange, a researcher, mother, wife and friend, has been a consultant research director with the trust for the past 17 years. As a heterosexual woman, she might not have had an issue with acceptance and feeling welcome, but the trust has helped her grow into a more empathetic person. Being in a queer space has made me mature, accepting and sensitive, she says.In a world where workplaces are increasingly harmful for women with reports of harassment, sexual assault and demands for sexual favours becoming more frequent, research interventionist Richa Vashishta finds Humsafar to be a safe space. Here she isn't worried about being ogled at or groped. It is completely my space, more than the rest of the world, she says.My colleagues experiences made me reflect on womanhood and celebrate anyone and everyone who identifies as a woman. I remember the moment I truly appreciated this: last May, Humsafar Trust had just concluded a donation drive for a runaway lesbian couple. Among packets of dal and rice lay two packs of Super Absorbent Stayfree All Night sanitary pads, unabashedly staring up at us. The office was silent for a while. We then had a loud, unapologetic and lengthy discussion on whether or not we should keep sanitary pads at the office, and if yes, where. Being a clumsy woman and infamously bad at marking my menstrual calendar, I felt elated. At my office, we are used to brandishing our pads, examining tampons and discussing their eroticism (there is none, they just hurt).Like pads and tampons, an enriched understanding of womanhood needs more visibility. If you dont conform to the stereotype of womanhood, you are still a woman and you are still valid. Whether you are a salwar-kameez-wearing, lipstick lesbian or a butch woman who likes to lift or a trans woman who finds it difficult to get access to a bathroom (I mean, its just a piss, why does it need a gender?), today Im celebrating all types of womanhood because they are all valid and they are all beautiful."

Lakshminarayanan and Government whip R.K.R. Anantharaman, at a press conference on Thursday, levelled a series of charges against the Lieutenant Governor.Mr. Lakshminarayanan said Ms. Bedi, after assuming charge, had sought from the government a salary of Rs. 3 lakh a month for her Officer on Special Duty (OSD) which was higher than the salary drawn by the Chief Secretary.The government granted only Rs. 1 lakh a month, he said and added that while Ms. Bedi was against Ministers and MLAs appointing retired employees as their staff, she brought an outsider for OSD post and sought a hefty pay package. She could have appointed a serving officer.Mr. Lakshminarayanan said the government had approved Rs. 4 crore for expenditure pertaining to Raj Nivas in the last financial year. However, Raj Nivas had given a revised estimate of Rs. 4.39 crore. Apart from the existing 55 staff, Raj Nivas had appointed 25 employees from various departments. These are not steps that suggest financial prudence, he said.Loan waiverMr. Lakshminarayanan criticised the Lieutenant Governor for not giving her assent to the Cabinet decision to write off loans taken by farmers from cooperative societies. She wanted the government to write off farm loans taken from the nationalised banks. These loans could be written off only if the Centre allowed it and it was not within the powers of the territorial administration. However, the Lieutenant Governor returned the file. Because of this, government could not waive farm loans taken from cooperative societies.The party accused Ms. Bedi of standing in the way of disbursing pension to people with disabilities through banking correspondents. The government wanted to pay the banking correspondents so that the money could be disbursed at their home, Mr. Lakshminarayanan added.The Parliamentary Secretary said the Lieutenant Governors insistence on restricting free rice to red cardholders delayed the distribution. She gave only permission for distributing rice for three months, he added.Probe soughtMs. Bedi took to twitter to voice her support for having a commission on the lines of Shunglu panel to probe the functioning of the Puduchery government.Puducherry also needs a Shunglu Committee to look into the way UT is administered, she said on twitter.She accused the government of not depositing employee share in Provident Fund. Not depositing PF of employees is a criminal offence. Puducherry PSU and societies have defaulted Rs. 36. 23 crore. I have asked for an action taken report from the Secretariat, she said."

Sadagopan, president of the Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumers Centre, says that if and when rice is available, FPS officials would ordinarily give greater quantity of boiled rice than raw rice. A beneficiary, attached to FPS in Ram Nagar, Velachery, says even though his card has four members, he is being given only 15 kg rice against his quota of 20 kg as per the law. Besides, out of the 15 kg, the quantity of raw rice is five kg. There are also complaints that those who have not obtained any commodity have received messages on their mobile phones that billing has been done against their cards.The government, early this month, issued an order allowing the rice cardholders to get certain amount of wheat free of cost in lieu of rice. This has been done as the allocation of wheat for the State is 1.62 lakh tonnes out of the total annual allocation of 36.78 lakh tonnes, according to the government order. A senior official in the Food Department says the give it up drive has been prepared mainly to address the problem of bogus billing. On receiving the complaints of bogus billing, the officials of the shops have been strictly warned. Several punishment measures are being contemplated, he says, adding that people can send complaints of bogus billing to 9980904040 by typing PDS (space) 107.Another official says the concept of no commodity cards has been in vogue for many years. As for the complaints on non-availability of rice or irregular supply of rice, a system is in place to monitor the movement of rice. Wherever rice is required, we are moving the stock, the official says."

In fact, authentic sushi is hard to find.Its origin was functional. Salted fish stored in vinegar rice could last for months and supply adequate amount of protein. The contemporary versions of the dish do not resemble its predecessor Nare-Zushi.Today in India we find tandoori sushi, palak paneer sushi and many other Indian varieties of it, laughs the specialty chef, Boonlurah Panchai, of Leela Palace Bengaluru.He has curated a sushi festival in Zen Leela Palace, which will commence on March 6, and serve traditional sushi rolls and sashimi platter. City Express catches up with the chef to trace sushis evolution and his journey with it.Where are you from and how is the dish like in your country?I am from Thailand and sushi is well-loved there. When I went to Thailand five years ago and there were about 9,700 sushi restaurants. I am sure now it must have crossed 10,000 now.Few little known facts about sushi?Sushi originated in Japan but the style of it was popularized in Korea. Sushi is actually meant to be served with raw fish but the stigma of eating raw is deep in some countries. That is why we have different inventions and people opt for cooked or boiled ingredients.The traditional sushi has rice, vinegar, salt, sugar, cucumber, Japanese radish and raw fish. Sushi travelled to America and it is now called California Roll. There is also something called a Crazy Roll, sushi that people thought had a crazy taste.When and how did you come to India? What have you learnt here?I started my career in the year 1999 in Thailand and I was sent to India on work. I worked in Delhi Leela Palace and moved to Bengaluru about three years ago. I think I sharpened my chef skills more in India because Indians like ordering dishes that are off the menu.Also, in India people do not order much variety. When a friend recommends a dish to a friend or a relative, they try that out.What is different about sushi in India?Authentic sushi is actually bland in flavour but because India loves spices, we serve spicy sushi here and it does really well with the Indian customers.What is something that is new in the second edition of your sushi festival?There is something I have experimented with. It is a sushi dessert called Frushi that is made with sushi and fruits. It took me three days to get the dish right.What do you recommend to people who are tasting sushi for the first time?There are three stages of sushi. First is Maki that is the roll, then there is Nigiri which is semi-cooked and Sashimi which is fully raw. I recommend people start with Maki."

The results will be announced on March 11.In the 2012 Assembly poll, the TMC had bagged seven seats, but later all of its MLAs switched sides joining either the Congress or the BJP.The TMC, which holds power in Bengal and a major force in Parliament with 34 MLAs in the Lok Sabha, had been working hard for the last two years with a new team of leaders in Manipur hoping to play a big role in case of a hung Assembly.""We are in a very good position to win at least 7-8 seats in Manipur. Our understanding and the ground report says that it will be a hung Assembly as neither the Congress nor the BJP will be able to gain a majority,"" TMC vice-president Mukul Roy told PTI.According to the party leadership, Manipur is very important to them in order to emerge as a potent force in the east and the Northeast.""In Tripura, the TMC is the main opposition party and in Manipur if we attain the same status as the last time, it will strengthen our party,"" a senior TMC leader said.""Keeping 2019 Lok Sabha election in view, if we are able to win four/five seats in the Northeast, then that will be a big boost for our party,"" he observed.Though it won seven seats in the 2012 Assembly election in Manipur and emerged as the second largest party, subsequently it failed to keep its flock together.While a by-election, necessitated by the death of a TMC member, was won by the Congress, two other Trinamul MLAs - Thongam Biswajit Singh and Khundrakpam Joykishan Singh - were disqualified under the Tenth Schedule. The two contested the by-elections on BJP tickets and retained their seats. Party MLA and president Th. Shyamkumar Singh, MLAs Irengbam Ibohalbi Singh, Konthoujam Sarat Singh and Oinam Lukhoi Singh joined the Congress last year.TMC vice-president Mukul Roy, under instruction from party supremo Mamata Banerjee, reconstituted the entire state unit.In order to reach out to the masses fed up with the politics of economic blockade, the TMC embarked on publicising various welfare schemes, it intended to launch if it has the leverage in governemnt formation, which had handed the party rich dividends in the last Bengal Assembly poll.The party put up posters informing people about the Kanyashree scheme, which offers monthly scholarship of Rs 750 to girl students from financially weak families, Sabuj Sathi scheme under which cycles are given away among students and Khadya Sathi scheme which offers rice and wheat at Rs 2 per kg to around seven crore people.""The people of Manipur have seen Congress government for the last 15 years, but have hardly heard of such schemes. If TMC gets decisive power in government formation we will push for these schemes,"" TMC leader Samrat Tapadar, who looks after poll arrangement for the party, said."

The district, which reported 32 farmer deaths in 2015-2016 kharif season, registered its first death of the year on Tuesday.One Khainu Bagarti (55) alias Hadu, who consumed pesticide in Kendpali village under Bargarh Sadar police limits on Monday night, succumbed at VIMSAR Medical on Tuesday.Irate villagers of Kendpali blocked National Highway-6 at Munigad with the body demanding compensation for kin of the deceased.The blockade, that began at 3 pm, continued till late in the evening with hundreds of heavy commercial vehicles stranded on the NH connecting Kolkata and Mumbai.Ananta Bagarti, son of Khainu, said irregular power supply and resultant failure of lift irrigation system had damaged their paddy crop cultivated over three acres of land. Although they owned a deep bore-well, they could not irrigate the crop due to frequent power failure.Water scarcity damaged their crop and having availed private loan of `40,000 for cultivation, Khainu was under severe mental stress over repayment. Finding no alternative to overcome debt burden, Khainu consumed poison, claimed Ananta.Peeved over the failure of WESCO to provide uninterrupted power supply to the village, the villagers blocked the highway demanding Rs 5 lakh compensation to kin of the deceased.Bargarh Additional Tehsildar Manas Ranjan Swain and DSP Sk Mujibur Rehman rushed to the spot and tried to end the stalemate, but the villagers refused to budge from their stand. The impasse was resolved after Bargarh Sub- Collector Bhimsen Puinam Kant Ekka handed over financial assistance of Rs 10,000 to Khainus family and assured them to provide proper power supply to the village by March 5.Debt and drought have in the past forced farmers of the State, particularly Bargarh, to commit suicide. The Human Rights Commission too had taken note of the suicides and agrarian crisis that has been on the rise in the last few years.The anger of the farmers and neglect meted out to them had drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had addressed a mega convention of farmers in the district while Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik too took a massive rally and announced sops for the farmers.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi too had walked 7 km from Debahal to Attabira in the district and visited the bereaved family of a farmer. But nothing much has changed ever since. With yet another gruelling summer and subsequent drought knocking at the doors of farmers this year, the situation of the farmers is all set to worsen further."

The Rice Memorial Church, built in 1917, will celebrate its centenary next week.HistoryJ M Richard, member of the church says, There was no Kannada church in the pete area in the 18th century. In 1834, Rev William Campbell built a Canarese (Kannada) Chapel on Avenue Road. In 1849, the building was demolished to construct a bigger chapel. The new chapel was built in 1851. On weekdays, there were English vernacular classes organised. A small house was also constructed next to the chapel for the teachers to stay.According to the book, by the church to mark its cenetary, this chapel also served as a school and venue for religious discussions with the locals.In 1835, Rev Campbell left for England, leaving the Canarese Chapel in the hands of the native Canarese converts and Rev Colin Campbell.The semicircular windows, a significantfeature of European architectureRev Benjamin Holt RiceBenjamin Rice was born on May 28, 1814 to Simon Peter Rice, a wholesale woollen drapers businessman. Benjamin was studious and had great interest in scriptures, religious magazines and poetry. He was appointed as a missionary to South India by the London Missionary Society (a missionary society in England by evangelical Anglicans and several nonconformists). In 1836, he set sail to India along with his wife. They boarded the vessel Mary Ann and sailed for 120 days to reach India.Rev MM George, Chairman of Pastorate Committee and Pastor-in- charge, says, Rev Benjamin started learning Kannada while he was sailing. Within six months of his stay in Bengaluru, he learned Kannada and a few months later, he started preaching in Kannada. The book further states that since then, he preached and taught in the Canarese language, till his last breath in 1887.The opening of the new chapel in 1851 was reported by Rev Collin Campbell, Rev Benjamin Rice and Rev Sewell. It was published in the Missionary magazine (a magazine by London Missionary) and Chronicle of April 1852 (a publication in Bengaluru), along with a sketch of the chapel. The chapel stood as an impressive European hall in the midst of native mud houses. There was a verandah outside, where the natives were addressed during the week days, and a vestry was also built.The opening services of this new chapel was delivered by Rev Benjamin Rice and Rev Colin Campbell.Rev Benjamin Rice gave his principal attention to public preaching. His usual practice was to preach in the Petah (or Pete) or in the neighbouring villages two or three times in the week. His pulpit ministrations on the Sabbath also were largely adapted to a non-Christian audience. A considerable number of Hindu passers-by were attracted to the singing and used to enter the church.The chapel will celebrate its cenetary next weekIn 1840, he was appointed as the member of the Committee for the Revision of the Canarese Bible, which took 19 years to complete. It was agreed that instead of a revision of the existing version, a translation from the original languages was desirable and various principles of translation and orthography, and so on, were agreed upon by the committee. Finally, in 1849, after several meetings in Mysuru and Ooty, the New Testament was completed and a few further corrections of the New Testament was done at a session held in Ooty in 1851.Rev Benjamin Rice, during his life time, has translated and composed many Canarese hymns which are still being used today in Kannada churches.In 1879, the congregation of the Canarese Chapel recognised his service and presented him a gold watch. Also, the Youth Fellowship of the Chapel presented him a gold pen.As a member of the local Famine Committee, Benjamin also played a vital role during the Great Famine of 1876-78.Rice Memorial ChurchAfter the death of Benjamin Holt Rice, the service in the chapel continued.In 1907, the Canarese Chapel was deemed as structurally unsafe and was vacated by the municipal authorities. In 1912, the building plan for a new church was prepared but the funding got delayed. Finally, the foundation for the new church was laid in the same year by the daughter of Benjamin Holt Rice, E P Rice, and Dr Horton.According to the book, shortly after the laying of foundation stone, the Bangalore Petah Municipality wanted to widen the Petah (now Avenue Road) and offered an alternative site for the church. It was rejected by E P Rice and after persistent negotiations for over two years, helped acquire the adjoining site, giving space for a larger church building.The structure was built with a sum of `3,500, contributed by the native Indians.The church finally was completed with the engineering assistance of Harold Douglas Rice, grandson of Rev Benjamin Rice. It was named after Rev Benjamin Holt Rice, who has served in the chapel for 50 years from 1837 to 1887, hence the name Rice Memorial Church.The church was formally opened by Eliza Blake, daughter of Rev Benjamin Rice, on January 27, 1917. A silver key was presented to Eliza Blake on that occasion. The inaugural function went on for three days till January 29, 1917 and the first Holy Communion was held on February 4, 1917.Present ScenarioHeritage conservationists have been asking for the inclusion of the Rice Memorial Church into the important landmarks on the heritage list. It is said that there have been proposals to widen the Avenue Road which may lead to the damage or loss of this monument.The conservationists have added the church as a part of the proposal Palace-to-Palace Heritage Corridor or Golden Corridor, linking Tipu Sultans Summer Palace to the Bangalore Palace, passing through K R Road, Avenue Road and Palace Road. But the proposal has not yet been accepted by the Government of Karnataka.Architect Naresh Narasimhan says, It is part of Bengalurus history. It is a historical building and probably the second oldest church in the city. Hence, it should be preserved.At present, the church is managed by Karnataka Central Diocese, Church of South India.For the coming centenary, Retd Bishop Rev Balmi from Dharwad and Bishop B K Nayak from Odisha, Rev Dr Rathnakar Sadananda, Rev M M George and Rev S Sujeeth Kumar will be present."

The godown managers are yet to keep them in the storage room.According to sources, as per the rice delivery programme of the civil supply corporation, some millers had sent as many as 30 trucks of rice meant for PDS to private godown at Dumuriput in Koraput sub-division two weeks back from milling points of different parts of Koraput district and the rice should have been unloaded immediately after arrival of the trucks within 24 hours as per the norms.However, the private godown owner held up the trucks without any reason and the rice-laden trucks were halted outside storage points for days together. The millers complained about it to the State Civil Supply Department and Koraput district civil supply office and alleged that the rice has been drying up outside the godown due to unloading issues. This will only lead to damage of the rice stock. However, the godown owner informed that there was no space in the godown for stocking the rice.Meanwhile, at a meeting here, the district rice millers association have alleged that they have been facing harassment by both civil supply officials and private godown owners and threatened to stop delivery of PDS rice to private godowns if this continues. They also sent an SOS to State civil supply and consumer welfare secretary PK Mohaptra to look into the issue."

Cooking is more than just putting together a few ingredients in a pan and stirring. Cooking is about taking whatever ingredients are available at that moment and create something totally new and inspirational.I was 19 years old when I began my culinary journey. I started my career with European Cuisine and continued to follow that passion for 3 years before switching to Indian cuisine. India is a culturally diverse country where you can find many traditions and many distinctive ingredients are available at every region of the country, yet exclusive to the rest of the world.Over a year ago, I went on a fishing expedition along the shores of Alibaug, Mumbai. Initially, it didnt go as well as I thought it would and I was a little upset that I couldnt catch any fish.So there I was, walking along the shore pondering over my inability to get a good catch when I noticed a local tribe group burning wood, or at least thats what I thought.. Upon nearing them I was astonished to find out that they were cooking POPTI in an enclosed Matka!Popti is essentially a smoked chicken dish that epitomizes bold and strong flavours. It is slow-cooked for a long period of time and then enriched with flavourful of spices and juices thereby giving the dish a unique rustic taste and feel.The meal was cooked for around 4 hours and served with a flourish as the matka was broken before the food was consumed. What you decide to eat this smoked chicken dish with depends on the taste of the individual and sometimes, the local tribes add rice along with the chicken in the matka and cook the meal.In this particular incident, the Popti, was prepared in an earthenware pot or the mud-pot (matka). The pot was first layered with leaves and then filled with marinated chicken before it was sealed and placed on the fire. This simplistic method of cooking the dish is what I found most interesting as it was very minimalistic and showcased a nutritious way of preparing food.I was inspired by this traditional way of cooking and was anxiously waiting to prepare the delicacy myself. After returning from the expedition, I shared my thoughts with my colleagues and started to re-create the delicacy using international herbs.I used the same earthenware and the same method but with a twist. I spiced-it up with many international herbs such as thyme, rosemary, basil and parsley to enhance the texture, fragrance and flavour of the chicken as well as the juices along with it. Authentically, the technique used to prepare Popti was slow-cooking method as it increases the vitality of the dish being prepared.This delicacy was then served to our guests and it was an instant hit! They were ecstatic to be served a dish that is so innately traditional and quintessentially Indian that they devoured it and was left licking their fingers.Anurudh Khanna, Executive Chef at Shangri-La Hotel"

Often they are reduced to a mere statistic.But they only wish for a better life and want nothing more than a chance to earn a living.Express met some of these migrant workers and found out what keeps them going in a state far away from home and where people speak an unfamiliar tongue. Everyone acknowledged that language was a big barrier, but that with time, they figure out how to work around it. As many of them work with others who speak Hindi, it fosters a sense of family and belonging.The people in Chennai are very nice but not knowing Tamil is a huge problem, said Rabi Marandi (24) from a village in Jharkhand. There are about two-three others from my village who work with me here and the rest of the people too speak Hindi. But who doesnt miss family?Many of these workers have to live in rooms built of tin or asbestos sheets. During the summer, this can be like a microwave oven as six-seven people share a room.Chennai is extremely hot during summers, said Mohammad Isa of West Bengal who has been coming to the city the last seven years. I dread to come here during this period but what can I do? The work seems to be here. It isnt that there is no work in West Bengal, but it is not regular work.If I had the ability to work in my home town and provide for my family, why would I leave to come here? said 39-year-old Jitendra from Gorakhpur. I have been coming to Chennai for the last 10-12 years. I miss my wife and children terribly and I have to speak to them at least four-five times a day.For 33-year-old Rintu Sheikh from Kolkata, being separated from his three-year-old daughter for months is heart-breaking. I am missing out on watching my daughter grow, Sheikh rues. I just keep pacifying myself that I am doing this so she has a better future. I have four more months to go before I go home and I cant wait to see how much she has grown.Food too is major barrier for migrants from up north. For people used to a staple diet of rotis, rice is a big change. While many of the workers said they made their own food, some confessed they did not have the time or facilities to cook. For those from West Bengal, sweets were what they missed the most.Chennai just doesnt match up in sweets, declared Isa. In my village, my neighbour used to make sweets every day out of fresh milk. I think about it and start drooling!Up close and personalRam SinghAge 23He has been working as a painter here for the last eight years. He is from Gorakhpur, and has a thick Bhojpuri accent. While in Chennai, he relies on some Tamil words he has picked up over the years, and sign language to communicate with non-Hindi speaking workers. I stay with others from UP in a room in Neelankarai. so language isnt a problem, he quips. Its almost like living with family. But if there was work in UP, I wouldve preferred to stay there. He watches movies on his phone in his free time. He cannot stop gushing about popular Bhojpuri actor Dinesh Lal Yadav. I watch at least three films a day, he beamed. I just watched Andaz Apna Apna for the nth time! I dont like Hindi films these days though, and watch Bhojpuri films because they have everything  action, drama, romance, songs.Sumitra Maity Age 37She seems demure at first. Her petite frame could fool anyone, but the 37-year-old woman from a small village in West Bengal works in the scorching heat all day, helping men with construction work. Earlier, she used to make mats but when her husband, Srikantho Maity, met with an accident, a lot of money was spent on his operation. Making mats could not generate enough income for the family. This is the first time Ive left home, she rues as her husband translates from Bengali to Hindi. It has been an experience. While I am happy that I am with my husband, I really miss my daughters. One of her girls is 16 and is married, while the other is 12 and stays with her in-laws in her village. She missed being around women as there is only one other woman at her construction site.Bablu KumarAge 24It isnt just construction workers who flock to Chennai for work. There are those who engage in other work, like Bablu Kumar. A vegetable seller in UP, Kumar (24) becomes a kulfi and ice-cream seller in Chennai every year from Pongal till June. He has been doing this for over 10 years. I would have sold vegetables here also but I dont know Tamil so that is a problem, he said. Selling kulfis in the summer makes sense. I generally go from Neelankarai beach till Thiruvanmiyur beach as most people who buy from me are beach-goers. He does however make a special stop everyday around 11:00 am at a construction site where there are others from UP. I come to this site every morning, he said. I have friends who I can speak to in my language and that feels very good."

What Sajitha R Shankar explores is the infinite expressiveness of human anatomy, a concept well chronicled in Alterbodies, her latest series of work. My art is an organic progression that maps the personal and political influences of time and space, says the artist who recently won the Pollock-Krasner Foundation award, a prestigious international honour.Sajithas creative world is deeply rooted in Indian philosophy with a definite and pronounced mystic edge. She calls art a paranormal activity of body and mind and indulges in colours with a strong sense of confidence. During my early formative years I was quite influenced by western art. But later I developed my own style that draws its essence and energy from Indian ethos, she says.Her frames are intimate, heartfelt and endlessly compelling. There is not much space for vulnerability and she says when a woman approaches her art honestly, it will have a strong feminist bias. You dont need any conscious effort for that. It just flows into your work naturally and spontaneously. And as a person who has gone through all kinds of extremes, you will also see slivers of self in my works.Alterbodies is a series that follows two vast thematic areas - Women Archetypes and Mother Archetypes, each taking over five years to complete. We always define body in terms of sexuality, but here I am trying to go beyond that aspect of physicality. I am looking into alternative possibilities of body in a very intimate and spiritual way. Tantric yoni, her much-noted triangular installation, is a well-crafted symbol of themes and analogies. It was made at the request of Eve Ensler, the author of Vagina Monologues. The huge installation was made with pure organic colours.Sacks of kumkum were brought in with turmeric and burnt rice husk for the work, she says. She believes its very important for artists to come together and interact. Gowri Art Institute, her studio at Kallar, was born out of this thought. While I was living in various foreign countries I had been part of such art communes. So I wanted to create a space where people with creative spark can gather and engage in a dialogue. I was very close to Kamala Das and dancer Chandralekha. The idea of Gowri Art Institute came up during one of our casual conversions, she says.An alumni of College of Fine Arts, Trivandrum, Sajitha says she grew as an artist at Cholamandalam Artists Village where she stayed for 19 years. Now with a string of laurels to her credit, she says it was not easy breaking onto the scene and getting established. As a woman artist I had to brave many personal and professional storms. She says that Kerala is the worst possible place for an artist to grow. We hardly get any acknowledgment or encouragement here. There are many hidden talents, but they are noted only when they venture out. I think government and the art fraternity should come forward to promote them, she adds."

I can only say where the EU stands on this,"" Mogherini added.British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson stressed there could be no easing of sanctions on Russia until peace was restored in Ukraine.""The UK will be insisting that there is no case for relaxation of the sanctions, there is every case for keeping up pressure on Russia,"" Johnson said as he went into the meeting.He said everyone was concerned by the recent upsurge in fighting between government troops and pro-Moscow rebels in the east.Russia annexed Crimea after pro-EU protestors ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych, sparking a conflict which has cost nearly 10,000 lives and plunged EU ties with Moscow into a deep freeze.Trump meanwhile has repeatedly said he wants to improve relations with Putin, appearing to downplay events in Ukraine to the dismay of historic US allies in Europe."

Turn to Ayurveda,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/04/want-beautiful-skin-turn-to-ayurveda-1566673.html,2017-02-04,"HYDERABAD: Beauty isnt skin deep, it goes much deeper. Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked. Strain it and season the juice with pure ghee and salt to taste.Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush"

On the other hand, the BJP and the Congress are raking up issues such as faulty implementation of different welfare schemes by the BJD Government.This apart, the alleged involvement of BJD ministers in chit fund frauds has become a poll plank for the Opposition.The ruling party is banking on populist schemes like Rs 1 per kg rice and Aahaar meals.Sarpanch candidate missingA candidate contesting for the Sarpanch post in Ambapua gram panchayat under Belaguntha block in Ganjam district, Pramod Pradhan, has been missing since Friday.

Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesn't mean I'm going to get along with them,"" Trump said in an excerpt of an interview with Fox News's Bill O'Reilly that aired before the Super Bowl on Sunday.When pressed in relation to Putin's alleged links to the extrajudicial killing of journalists and dissidents, Trump said, ""we've got a lot of killers. You think our country's so innocent?""""Take a look at what we've done too. We've made a lot of mistakes.""Trump's fellow Republicans, including Senate leader Mitch McConnell, were quick to criticize the president's remarks.""I don't think there is any equivalency with the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does,"" McConnell said.""He is a former KGB agent, a thug, not elected in a way that most people consider a credible election,"" he told CNN.That criticism was echoed by Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia and advisor to president Barack Obama, who described Trump's comments as ""disgusting.""""This moral equivalency that Trumps continues to draw between the USA and Russia is disgusting (and inaccurate),"" he said on Twitter.'Major fight' against ISMainstream Republicans have repeatedly called on Trump to distance himself from Putin, with little impact.Throughout the election campaign, Trump refused to criticize the Russian leader, saying better relations with the Kremlin would be in the US national interest.The new president has advocated working with Russia to combat the Islamic State group in Syria.""If Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all around the world, major fight. That's a good thing,"" Trump told Fox.Moscow has deployed aircraft, naval assets and troops to Syria, but has so far trained its fire on rebels with the aim of propping up President Bashar al-Assad's regime.In December, US intelligence agencies went public with their view that Russia conducted a hack-and-release campaign aimed at swinging the US election in Trump's favor.Trump's repeated criticism of NATO -- a common target for Putin -- has only fueled suspicions that Trump is ready to side with Moscow over allies in Europe.Across Europe, there are growing concerns that the continent might be wedged between a hostile Russia and a hostile United States.Trump's stance on Ukraine has also raised eyebrows. After a call with Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko on Saturday, the White House said the pair addressed ""Ukraine's long-running conflict with Russia.""Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March 2014 and has supported separatists in the east of the country.Former national security advisor Susan Rice publicly criticized Trump's framing of the situation.""This distortion of even recent history is deeply troubling,"" she tweeted.'We're watching'Trump's Vice President Mike Pence tried to explain the administration's approach to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had flared after Trump and Putin spoke by telephone a week ago.""We're watching, and (we're) very troubled by the increased hostilities over the past week in eastern Ukraine,"" Pence told ABC's ""This Week"" news program.The Kremlin said that during the Trump-Putin call the two men had discussed improving economic relations, a potential signal of Trump's willingness to lift sanctions on Russia.Asked whether the administration would be willing to ease sanctions while Russia is violating ceasefire agreements, Pence demurred.""I think that's a question that will be answered in the months ahead. And it just simply all depends,"" he said.""If we have opportunities to work together, I think the president is looking for an opportunity to begin that relationship anew.""But make no mistake about it -- those decisions will await action. And they'll be very dependent on how the Russians respond in the days ahead."""

The Government should create opportunities for people to earn and invest more on infrastructural development, education and provide institutional support for their economic development instead of offering them freebies,"" he said.BJP national secretary Suresh Pujari also came down heavily on Odisha Government for using welfare schemes to garner votes. ""Starting from the formation of foetus to the death and even reaching graveyard, welfare schemes have been formulated for everyone. But do the schemes help in developing the economic condition of the beneficiaries? No, because the schemes are made to gain political benefits,"" he pointed out.Leader of Opposition and veteran Congress leader Narasingh Mishra, however, favoured the welfare schemes to ensure basic rights of the people. ""Schemes meant to provide basic rights to people are essential, but that should not be used for political gain. New schemes, which can focus on economic development of the poor, need to be launched and people should condemn the Government which is using welfare schemes for its vote bank,"" he added.Going above the party line, Minister for Excise and Cooperation Damodar Rout too admitted that the aim of launching most of the welfare schemes in the country was to gain voters' support and not for their real development. The schemes which are not implemented with a pragmatic approach do not yield desired results,"" he said and claimed that the designers lack experience for which the schemes fail to achieve the objectives.At the valedictory session, eminent author Chetan Bhagat said after emergence of social media, mainstream media has been adversely affected. Stating that credibility is very important and profit and popularity will follow, he said media houses will taste long-term success if they retain credibility. ""Media has somehow lost track of its objective,"" he opined.The convention was inaugurated by Medanta Group CMD Dr Naresh Trehan. Among others, OTV MD Jagi Mangat Panda and MD of In-DNA Life Science Pvt Ltd Dr Biren Banerjee also spoke."

He is known for his close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which came up during his confirmation hearings.He has no experience in the public sector, a first in modern history for a Secretary of State.Tillerson joined ExxonMobil in 1975, after receiving a civil engineering degree from the University of Texas. He worked his way up through the ranks, beginning as a production engineer and becoming Chairman and Chief Executive in 2006.The lifelong Exxon employee beat a long list of seasoned candidates in the running for the post, including former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, Senator Bob Corker, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and former CIA chief David Petraeus.To counter concerns over his lack of experience, former Secretary of Defence Robert Gates hailed Tillerson as ""a global champion of the best values of our country"" while former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice shared similar sentiment.President Donald Trump said the former Exxon CEO will bring ""a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs"" as was confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 56 to 43, with all Republicans in support and most Democrats voting against him.Tillerson was No. 20 on Forbes' most powerful people list in 2015.Tillerson has close links to the Kremlin, and his relationship with Russia was a focal point in his confirmation hearings with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December.Tillerson was widely known for opposing sanctions against Russia in his ExxonMobil corporate life. He refused to label Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal as he had known him since the 1990s and was awarded Order of Friendship in 2013 by Putin.During his time at Exxon, Tillerson reportedly forged multibillion-dollar deals with Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, including an agreement to explore underground resources in Siberia that could be worth billions of dollars.He is also known to be a friend of Igor Sechin, Rosneft's Executive Chairman who was formerly Putin's Deputy Prime Minister. Sechin has been called Russia's second most powerful man.Tillerson had also publicly spoken out against international sanctions placed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea.Republican Senators Marco Rubio and John McCain expressed serious concerns about Tillerson's Russian connections but came round.At the confirmation hearing, Tillerson called Russia a ""danger"" to the US and said he favoured maintaining US sanctions against Moscow.He also recommended a ""full review"" of the nuclear deal with Iran, but he did not call for an outright rejection of the accord.Tillerson also takes responsibility for US policy in one of the world's biggest flashpoints: the South China Sea.Tillerson said China should be blocked from accessing the artificial islands it has built, setting the stage for a potential showdown. He said that China should stop island building in the South China Sea and be denied access to these islands, which China regards as an integral part of its territory.""Building islands and then putting military assets on those islands is akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. It's taking of territory that others lay claim to,"" Tillerson said in his confirmation hearing.""We're going to have to send China a clear signal that first, the island-building stops, and second, your access to those islands also not going to be allowed.""Although Tillerson has acknowledged climate change is a problem, ExxonMobil was the subject of controversy at its shareholders meeting last year for rejecting resolutions that would have pushed the company's resources towards renewable energy. The company has been accused of trying to cover up the risks of climate change and lying to the public.His confirmation has already drawn the ire of environmental groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace.Tillerson is a lifelong Boy Scout. He was an Eagle Scout in his youth and became president of the national organisation. It was under his leadership the organisation embraced the membership of young men who identified as gay.Tillerson originally supported Jeb Bush for President. He gave Bush the maximum allowable contribution in September 2015."

I was born in Madurai and grew up watching pictures of my father, also a chef, cooking at different kitchens. He is my inspiration and my role model. I am a chef because of him. Though I started cooking professionally when I joined a formal course, I had the passion for learning the art from a young age.My father cooks the best biryani. He does not compromise on ingredients and I think that makes him a great cook. You get the authentic taste when you do not compromise on ingredients, even while cooking at home.Having worked in the industry for 14 years and travelled to many places, I have noticed that water and spices from different places leads to different taste in food. When I was working in Saudi Arabia, I learned to cook Arabic Kabsa. It is quite similar to mutton pulao but the only difference is, in kabsa we cook the whole 10 kg mutton in one big container. Once the mutton is roasted, it is boiled and cooked with steamed rice of equal proportion and then is served in a big platter which is shared by 15-20 people.The same can be prepared using smoked vegetables and fish as well.I love experimenting with food and thats what keeps me going. Paneer butter masala with spaghetti pasta, mutton rogan josh with baked pasta and so on. At first, I started fusion with Indian food when I prepared Awadhi gosht ka halwa. It is halwa made using meat but when cooked you can never make out the taste of meat. Thats the essence of this dish. We add a little rosewater and sweet guava to take away the flavour of mutton.In the beginning of my career, I started with bulk cooking and the most important thing that I learnt was that the proportion is very important. The ratio is, for 1 kg biryani we use 200 gm onion. So when you are cooking for 1,000 people you have to keep the ratio in mind. Otherwise, it affectsthe taste.A few years ago for a TV show, I prepared Bazhellai meen pulliellai varuval. Its a fish curry that my grandmother used to make. We use tamarind leaf that gives it a tangy flavour which is the specialty of the dish. The masala is prepared with jeera, garlic, green chili and mixed with tamarind leaf. The fish is wrapped in a banana leaf with the masala so when it is cooked the masala gets soaked in it. I want to promote these recipes from villages because nowadays people are health conscious. This is the most organic dish I have ever prepared."

The first was a product of apocalyptic imagery where extremists blew up Borussia Dortmund team bus, injuring a player and creating panic. Close on the heels of that grim incident unfolded a heartwarming gesture that reassured the faith in humanity. Borussia fans opened up their houses for the visiting Monaco supporters who were left stranded in the city.KOCHI: This is the beauty of sports. The good samaritan acts in sports have a cosmopolitan presence. North Paravur, thousands of kilometres away from Dortmund, replicated a similar act albeit lesser in intensity.When the volleyball officials and fans in North Paravur harried the Kerala State Volleyball Association to ask the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI) to allot them the National Junior Championship, little did they know they were entering troubled waters.(1) Kerala team sharing a light moment ahead of the championship. (2) Gujarat players filling registration forms.(3) Organisers of the championship taking rest at the house of a local resident K ShijithTo conduct or not to conductJust after they were given permission to conduct the event, trouble began to brew in the VFI. With factionalism putting spanner in the daily activities, the International body placed VFI under suspension. The feud in the national scenario had a ripple effect in the state association that finally led to formation of an ad hoc committee. With the VFI under suspension and state body crippled by infighting, the funds proved to be hard to come by. The volleyball fraternity in Paravur had two options. Either to drop the event or conduct it on their own.It was a painful moment. If we cancel the event, it would dash the hopes of volleyball enthusiasts in the area. If we go ahead with it, we have to find funds on our own. Finally, we took the call and decided to host the event, Bijoy Babu T, Kerala junior boys team coach and chief coordinator of the event, told Express.The decisionWhen the decision was taken to conduct the event, the next thought was how to arrange funds. The first step in this direction came through the formation of Paravur Sports Association which brought the current and yesteryear sportspersons from the locality under one roof. It may be a rarity that an association was formed to support a national event. Former India player and Customs and Excise assistant commissioner V A Moideen Naina, who also hailed from Paravur, was appointed as the convenor. The funds started trickling, mostly from Paravur residents. The current imbroglio in the federation dissuaded sponsors from investing in the event. The journey so far has been tough. Now, we have pooled money from some local people, said an office-bearer of the Paravur Sports Association.The pangsThe office-bearers have pegged the budget at around Rs 30-35 lakh. They expect the participation of around 500 players and 100 officials .We have to take care of the lodging and boarding of the participants from the eve of the competition to a day after the final. Its a big task, said K P Pramod Kumar, a member of the Paravur Sports association.Kerala, being the host team, we had to start their preparatory camps 10 days ahead of the event. Boarding and lodging for both boys and girls teams required a good amount and the cash-strapped state volleyball association was in a quandary. Then two families came up with an offer.Saviour AngelsSureshbabu, a businessman from Vavakkad and member of Paravur Sports Association, came to know about the plight of the Kerala team from his friends. An ardent volleyball fan, his son Saneeb had played the game before his untimely death at the tender age of 22. Six kilometres away from North Paravur town, Vavakkad has been an epicentre of the game and a tournament was organised in memory of Saneeb by his family under the aegis of an association named Nanma. For Sureshbabu and his wife Omana, the game always evoked the memory of his son. Sureshbabu didnt think twice and opened the top portion of his two-storied house for Kerala girls team.My mother was very fond of the girls and she looked after them the way she cared for me and my brother, said Sanitha Lesil, daughter of Sureshbabu and manager of Kerala girls team. Another family in Vavakkad took the boys team under their wings.Pramod Kumar said organisations and individuals in North Paravur also chipped in, doling out rice and other essential goods to the organisers. To bridge the communication gap, ex-service men from North Paravur, who know Hindi, have volunteered to accompany the teams."

It is always a good idea to bring the tropical countrys cuisine to the city that is passionate about food. Okra at Marriott Hyderabad is all set to bring in a tempting Thai experience with its 11-day food fest beginning April 20. This will feature a myriad of Thai dishes bursting with exotic Thai flavours.Chef Ninja, who brings with her the experience of 17 years in the culinary art, has been roped in for this. She wants to ensure that the fusion of Thai herbs surprises foodies. While the food fest will cater a bountiful options for vegetarians, homemade Thai recipes will have a lions share this time.Speaking on the multicultural history of the country, Chef Ninja points out the clever combination of Eastern and Western influences that the cuisine incorporates.Although traditional Thai cooking involves stewing, baking or grilling, over the years with Chinese migrating to Southeast Asia, techniques including stir-frying and deep-frying have been introduced, giving diverse flavours to the cuisine. Moreover, it draws culinary influence from Portugese, Dutch, French and Japanese, Chef Ninja elaborates.Meanwhile, the samplers came in the form of Satay Gai (Grilled chicken marinated with turmeric paste and herb), Som Tum (Raw papaya salad), Tom kha het (Mild coconut soup with mushrooms), Gai phad met mamuang (Stir fried chicken with cashewnuts), Thalay phad cha (Stir-fried prawn with peppercorn).An array of Thai delicacies rolled in one after the other. Chef Ninja explained how she doesnt have to Indianise the Thai dishes.Hyderabadis prefer spicy food much like Thais. So, understanding the taste and cooking here has never been a stumbling block to showcase my culinary skills, the chef says with a glee.Her signature dish, Phad Thai, where wok fried flat noodles are assorted with tofu and bean sprouts. But what makes it lip-smacking is the tangy flavour that comes with tamarind sauce. Imagine spicy noodles tossed with tamarind.Isnt it worth trying? Moreover, succulent chicken sticks marinated in herbs served with red curry paste and chicken minced with coconut milk are a must-have. Alternatively, there are mushroom and babycorn, which form an integral part of vegetarian starters.Vegetarians no more have to cry over the limited options the cuisine offers. The appetising aroma of Khao hom ma li, steamed rice punched with jasmine and Kaeng kiew wan jea, a thai green curry jazzed with Thai herbs, make up for a sumptuous meal.The star of the fest, however, is the dessert platter. Lemon grass mousse with pseudo pandan ice-cream breaks the thought that herbs can be well infused into a dessert.The mousse, a mix of custard, pandan and lemon grass, melts in the mouth to give you a sweet buzz. On the other hand, tender coconut mousse with mango and jasmine pudding makes the experience mesmerising."

This collaboration will drive the development of technology parks to the next level through an integrated approach in bridging technology, market, funding and talent, said MIGHT Technology Nurturing (MTN) managing director Datuk Nik A Faizul Abd Malek.APEDB chief executive officer J Krishna Kishore said that Andhra Pradesh has a huge opportunity to strengthen bilateral relationships exponentially. The State has been forging partnerships, building strong foundations and engaging with various countries and this MoU with MIGHT will provide an impetus for clean technology and industry, he observed.This park is expected to attract investments to the tune of Rs 650 crore in the first phase involving as many as 75 SMEs. The Phase 1 Cluster will commence with a Biodegradable Industry Cluster which will cover an area of 100 acres, to produce biodegradable packaging for food and electronics industries. The technology for this cluster will be provided by a Malaysian company - Free The Seed Sdn Bhd - which sources the raw materials from rice straw biomass to produce biodegradable packaging products through a cellulosic fibre delignification and biotechnology enzymatic treatment processes."

Niti Aayogs contract farming law might just serve the farmers their wishes on a platter.When the law sets rolling, the ailing agri sector in the state is expected to undergo an unprecedented shift: From cooperatives-driven to corporate-powered. Sounds far-fetched? Thats what the law implies!For the uninitiated, the Central Governments premier think-tank is drawing up a model law to connect farmers with the food processing industry and thereby insulate them against price volatility. An expert committee appointed by the Niti Aayog is expected to submit its report on the Model Contract Farming Law by May-end or early June.If everything goes as planned, it will usher in corporate houses into contract farming, helping to unlock vast swathes of unused agricultural land in the state for the cultivation of a range of crops. In Kerala, there are large expanses of cultivable land lying idle, says V K Vijayakumar, investment strategic at Geojit. Land owners who used to cultivate the land are no longer utilising it as the new generation moved away seeking greener pastures in the cities. On the other hand, a new crop of youngsters have taken a shine to farming but they dont have the land.The proposed law will be an interface to bring the land owners and the prospective farmers under one umbrella to engage in contract farming, Vijayakumar says. Kochi-based Harinath D Bharatiyan, who has been cultivating traditional rice varieties on around 2 acres of land in Wayanad, will be among the beneficiaries of the new law.Right now, we undertake cultivation on leased land, renewed every year. Farming on leased land works on the principle of trust. The land owner gives the land only to those he trusts, he says. But scions in the corporate world are not enthused about the prospects of the law in Kerala. Viju Jacob, managing director of Synthite Group, the worlds largest producer of value-added spices, says he has been sourcing chilly, marigold, cardamom etc from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Coimbatore for the past 20 years. In Kerala, Im sceptical.When the prices shoot up, we cant trust the people to honour their commitment to supply us the produce. We dont want to get into a tussle with them, he says. Giby Mathew, director of Commodities Online, however, reckons contract farming law to do wonders to the Kerala agri sector. This year, for instance, there is a glut in turmeric and elephant yam, and the prices have nosedived. I have decided to distribute my organic turmeric produce this year to friends and relatives for free due to rockbottom prices, he says. This is not practical unless farmers enter a tie-up with corporates for the supply of the produce at a pre-fixed prices. But, under contract farming, farmers should not also expect bumper profits, Giby says."

Years? Or may be decades. But Edwin Joseph hears them every day. While you may believe sparrows have gone missing in the city, a visit to Edwins house will make one change that view. For, there are over 200 sparrows chirping away here and, mind you, none of them is caged!Joseph, 67, a resident of Lingarajapuram, is a retired BEML employee. He and his wife Sarah have been nurturing the birds for almost a decade now. Fenced with all amenities to take care of sparrows, his residence can easily be called a sparrow sanctuary. Around 12 years ago, we had a vacant site behind our residence where my wife used to dispose of rice granules. We saw sparrows feeding on them and from then on made sure that we fed them every day. As we started putting more grains, the number gradually went up, recalled Joseph.When I started constructing a house in the vacant space, I realised that these birds cannot live without trees. So I created a mini garden in front of my residence, he said.They have also put up an artificial nest where sparrows can lay eggs. They have feeders where the birds can feed their little ones. Edwin has also created a shelter at the premises where the birds can rest during heavy rain.Tiff with corporatorFighting against odds to retain the 'sanctuary' wasnt an easy task for Joseph. I had to ensure that mobile towers werent installed around, which is a threat to these creatures. I even fought with the area corporator to make sure that the mobile tower didnt come up anywhere near my residence. I'm glad that many people in my neighbourhood supported me, he said. One can also spot many people coming down to his place to feed the sparrows.Not just mobile towers, drying up of lakes, changes in the construction pattern of buildings are to blame for sparrows going missing from Bengaluru, he said. When asked how much he spends on them every month, he said, Parents dont calculate how much they spend on their kids, right?Joseph said he has open invitation for the public to visit his house and see the sparrows.

58fce3cd7be9e06c937109d2,NREGS fails to reach women with disabilities,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/feb/26/nregs-fails-to-reach-women-with-disabilities-1574918.html,2017-02-26,"BHUBANESWAR: Bharati Pradhan (name changed), a 46-year-old orthopaedically-challenged woman of Kanas block in Puri district, gets a monthly pension of Rs 300 under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and a few kgs of rice from the State Government. The money just meets her medicine requirements. The youngest among five siblings, she was born with disability and could manage to study till Class V. Her parents, daily wagers by profession, could neither afford her treatment nor education. Though wheel-chair bound and unskilled, she is keen on being self-reliant but that is a dream.Securing livelihood has never been an easy task for women with disabilities like Bharati who live in rural areas of Odisha despite implementation of several government schemes including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). They continue to have limited access to livelihood opportunities, be it direct employment or self-employment.The MGNREGS was implemented to ensure 100 days of wage employment in unskilled manual work for people in rural pockets. According to the Panchayati Raj Department sources, only 5,362 different-abled persons worked under MGNREGS in 2016-17 financial year. Less than five per cent of this labour force constituted women with disabilities. Similarly, the total number of disabled people working under MGNREGS stood at 5,586 in 2015-16, 3,352 in 2014-15 and 3,587 in 2013-14. Although there are no reports on the number of women with disabilities employed in these three financial years, Project Directors of all the 30 District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in the State, who are responsible for implementation of the scheme, admitted to low participation from this vulnerable group due to lack of awareness and a disabled-friendly environment.As per the 2011 Census, the total population of persons with disabilities in Odisha is 12,44,402 out of which, 6,74,775 are males and 5,69,627 are females. Sources said at least over two lakh women with disabilities, majority of them illiterate and residing in rural areas, are living below poverty line (BPL) and are in need of gainful employment. The Census points out that a majority of women with disabilities in Odisha suffer from movement-related disability, blindness and hearing impairment. Although their empowerment is only possible by economic independence, that has not been the case so far.Disability activist, Asha Hans said so many women with disabilities still living below the poverty line points to the fact that there is problem with implementation of employment schemes including the MGNREGS. Providing employment to these women becomes more necessary as almost 90 per cent of them are dependent on their family members for finances. Studies have shown that disabled women are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in securing livelihood as they face gender discrimination, she said, adding that women with disabilities are still considered unfit to don the role of wage earner.Apparently, the MGNREG Act operational guidelines have a dedicated chapter on jobs outlined for differently-abled women. These include less stressful works like making drinking water arrangements at the work site, plantation, looking after children of workers, land levelling and sprinkling water on newly built walls. However, not many differently-abled women are coming forward to even take up these works, officials admit. The primary reason for this is lack of awareness and facilities. MGNREGS is considered labour intensive and no efforts are being made to bring them under the scheme or make them aware that they can do less strenuous work and earn the same wage that an abled person does, said former Odisha State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, Kasturi Mohapatra.She added that the entire approach towards women with disabilities in MGNREGS is a faulty one. While not many women are aware about the nature of work meant for them under MGNREGS, getting to the work site and security remain the other concern areas. Their family members cannot always accompany them to the work site, she added. The meagre number of women with disabilities, who are coming forward to work under MGNREGS, are mostly employed in plantation work during monsoon.Visibility of women with disabilities in the employment guarantee schemes is negligent in districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and some Western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Balangir and Nuapada.However, Joint Secretary in the Panchayati Raj Department, Bhumesh Behera said since MGNREGS is a demand driven programme, the department provides work to any differently-abled person including women who seek work. It always depends on their nature of disability. We have to also take into consideration that they cannot do all kinds of works, he said.Apparently, the Odisha Government does not yet have clear data on the number of women with disabilities getting 100 days' employment under the MGNREGS. The MIS (Management Information System) developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to keep a record of the workers does not include data on the number of such women taking part in the scheme, the Project Directors pointed out. Hence, it is difficult to find out if MGNREGS is actually helping women with disabilities or not, said an officer requesting anonymity.In fact, every livelihood programme being run by both Centre and State including the skill development and vocational training programmes, has no clarity or data on involvement of women with disabilities. Disability activists feel it is high time the government thinks of gender and disability audit in such schemes.In the absence of employment, women mostly depend on social security coverage. The State Government provides Rs 300 as pension to disabled people under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana but the amount is too meagre in todays time. To avail the pension, they have to produce disability certificates. Ironically, no differently-abled woman has been provided a disability certificate since 2014. According to reports of Department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, of 5.6 lakh differently-abled women in the State, only 41,929 women have received disability certificates so far, thereby denying the rest facilities like education, employment, pension, concession and other benefits. Unlike States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Odisha Government does not provide unemployment assistance to people with disabilities.Sanyas Behera, president of Odisha Association of Blind and a visually-challenged activist who has been demanding consideration of a differently-abled person as one separate family unit when job cards are issued under MGNREGS, said there is no clear notification yet by the Odisha Government on the nature of work that can be done by differently-abled men and women even as the Union Government had circulated an order in 2008 regarding work that can be allotted to this category of the labour force. When jobs are being issued to a household, a differently-abled person is overlooked and an abled person in the family is provided the work. Due to gender discrimination, differently-abled women are entirely left out from this scheme,"" he said.Under the Odisha Livelihood Mission, some district administrations have taken the initiative of bringing together women with disabilities and form self-help groups that can churn out things like phenyl, agarbati, jute bags and eatables. However, Sanyas alleged that the number of such SHGs is too less and funds sanctioned by the Centre for vocational training of such women are returned unutilised every year. ""Sometimes, the authorities give equipment to these SHGs to produce articles without training them properly in a bid to complete their official reports. As a result, such SHGs do not survive for a long time,"" Sanyas added."

The meeting that took place at the residence of the Prime Minister lasted 45 minutes.The key demands included immediate disbursal of Rs 39,565 crore for drought relief, Rs 22.573 crore for reconstruction works in the coastal districts affected by cyclone Vardah, on account release of Rs 2,500 crore for immediate drought relief works, presidential assent for the two Bills passed by Tamil Nadu Assembly on exempting the State from NEET examination, formation of Cauvery Management Board and Cauvery Water Regulation Committee, interlinking of peninsular rivers and allocation of entire power of 2,000 MW to be generated in units three and four of Koodankulam atomic power plant.Detailing the drought condition prevailing in the State, the memorandum said the State Government was evolving various projects to mitigate the impact of drought in 2017-2018 and urged the Centre to consider allocation of at least Rs 750 crore under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and release the funds without any restrictions.A revised Detailed Project Report (DPR) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,523 crore for the Athikadavu-Avinashi Irrigation, Ground Water Recharge and Drinking Water Supply Scheme had been sent to the Central Water Commission on December 18, for approval and sanction under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana.The Athikadavu-Avinashi scheme is to be implemented only based on flood surplus flows, without affecting the rights on river water. Hence, the Ministry of Water Resources should be instructed to grant speedy approval for the project, it said.Reiterating a host of demands for fisheries sector and for the welfare of fishermen, the Chief Minister said the Comprehensive Special Package for Diversification of Fisheries which totals up to Rs 1,650 crore with a recurring component of `10 crore should be approved at the earliest. He also underscored the need for including fishermen in the list of Scheduled Tribes.Urging the Prime Minister to release the funds for compensating Tamil Nadu for the adverse treatment by Fourteenth Finance Commission, he said the State would be eligible to get around Rs 4,500 crore as the shortfall in share of central taxes devolved by the Centre for the period from 1996-97 to 2014-15.To mitigate the effects of cyclone Vardah, a number of transmission overheads and other equipment had to be established in Chennai Metropolitan city, he said the cost estimate for carrying out the above works was Rs 17,000 crore. The Ministry of Power could be requested to release this amount either as grant or as a soft loan through Rural Electrification Corporation or Power Finance Corporation.He requested the Prime Minister to allocate an additional quantity of 85,000 MTs of rice per month under the National Food Security Act at Rs 8.30 per kg instead of Rs 22.54 per kg (MSP rate)."

He said the Civil Supplies Corporation had taken steps to rein in the price hike, and to ensure uninterrupted supply of essential items.Last month, there was a sharp increase in the prices of popular rice varieties like Jaya and Matta - Rs 48 and Rs 46 respectively.According to Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman, the price of Jaya increased due to draught in Andhra and Telangana, from where it is procured.Supplyco has been selling Kuruva rice at Rs 25 and raw rice at Rs 23. The corporation said it had invited four tenders for Jaya and Matta since January, and procured 5.6 and 5.4 quintals, respectively.The shortage is compensated by procuring Jaya from Gujarat and Jharkhand, and boiled rice from the FCI. Moreover, Oil Palm India is providing Kuttanadan Matta at Rs 33.The increase in sugar price is the result of the recent slump in sugarcane production, due to draught. Supplyco, which procured around 4,000 quintals of sugar in recent months, supplies sugar at the subsidised price of Rs 22/kg, after procuring it for more than Rs 40."

Representatives of a consortium of 26 primary cooperatives formed by Consumerfed are currently holding negotiations with Food Corporation of India officers and rice mills in West Bengal, Surendran informed the Assembly on Tuesday.The negotiations are expected to conclude by Thursday. The consignments will arrive by March 10, he said. Consumerfed had difficulties in procuring rice from Andhra Pradesh as mill owners were reluctant to supply rice due to delay in payment in the past. The agency had run up massive dues, forcing mill owners and middlemen in Andhra Pradesh to cut off supply.The LDF Government has paid Rs 52 crore to 241 suppliers after assuming office. The ar rears now stand at Rs 157 crore and steps are being taken to clear the arrears, Surendran said. Also, the shortage in supply of Jaya and Surekha, the popular varieties in Kerala, prompted Consumerfed to knock at West Bengals doors.Even as rice prices were climbing past Rs 45 per kg, the minister informed the Assembly the hike in rice prices was a national phenomenon. In Andhra Pradesh, the prices ranged between Rs 46 and Rs 49 per kg, while in Gujarat it stood at Rs 30-34. The prices ranged between Rs 29 and Rs 32 in Uttar Pradesh. The price of Kuruva variety stood at Rs 29 to Rs 32 in Tamil Nadu and Rs 32 to Rs 36 in Andhra Pradesh, Surendran said.The price of Matta variety was between Rs 28 and Rs 33 in Karnataka, he said."

The railways can now transport freight containers from Vizag to any part of the country.Commissioning the Multi Model Logistic Park (MMLP) here on Saturday, divisional railway manager Chandralekha Mukherjee flagged off the first train carrying containers to Vedanta Alumina plant at Brundamal, Odisha. The `500-crore MMLP, spread over 108 acres opposite to the Visakhapatnam airport, claimed to be the first of its kind in Andhra Pradesh.Speaking to newsmen during commissioning of the MMLP, Chandralekha Mukherjee said that the permission for the project had been granted in May 2014.Attributing the success to authorities of CONCOR, Chandralekha Mukherjee said that the present place was completely a low-lying area with waste waters in the past and with the efforts of the CONCOR, the project had become a reality within a short time.Under various stages, around `500 crore was spent on the project. Whether it is group operational services or any other, all facilities will come under one roof. We appeal to the industries to make use of the facility to transport their bulk materials from Vizag to any part of the world, bring profits for themselves as well as the CONCOR and the railways, said the DRM.Explaining the benefits, CONCOR general manager Yelvendra Yadav said that compared to road transport, the railway container transport reduces pollution almost by one sixth. Railways can transport around 2,500 tonnes of material in a single shift, while for the same a road transport needs around 100 trucks, he said. Economically, this is around three to four times cheaper than road transport, Yelvender said.We do have special refrigerator containers for goods which do need refrigerators. We are expecting industries of steel, aluminium, fishes, rice and a few others will utilise this facility, he said.For the project, there was a need of a 8.2-km track and the authorities have laid around 6.2 km in the first stage.The park has an exclusive warehouse at present and three more warehouses will come up. The MMLP also has state-of-the-art handling facilities for the cargo. Nine major bridges have been constructed by the CONCOR for the facility."

Done on charcoal on paper, its a stack of bristly hay tied up coarsely. But if one holds the gaze for a minute longer, the idea of a forgotten agricultural revolution finds its way back to the mind; of the sweat of the farmer, the vast land being readied for irrigation and the sickle-bearing harvesters who are responsible for the sustainability of a culture.One is quick to realise that a picture so simple can also be quite evocative. But would Akhil have imagined a national award for the picture? Maybe not, but thats the tag on the image today. The work is my 24th in the Rice series, says Akhil.Why rice? I grew up in a family of agriculturalists and speak that language the best. So, it was but natural for me to translate the discussions around me onto the canvas, says Akhil, who predominantly uses charcoal.The artists (L)Sajeesh P A and Akhil MohanIncidentally, theres not just one national award from Kerala this year for painting, but two, after a gap of 14 years. Sajeesh P A also grabbed attention with his charcoal painting, Journey.Sajeeshs work is done on tea-washed paper, and, from a distance, it appears to be a difficult conundrum. But as one nears the image, the sheer effort behind the behemoth work becomes clear, where the finesse of the detailing is awe-inspiring. Sajeesh has conjured a world of memories. They come from the past, present, religions, mythologies, histories and socio-political scenarios. The familiar faces of B R Ambedkar, Adolf Hitler, Hanuman and even Jisha, the murdered Dalit girl from Kerala peer out of the canvas.Our memories are made up of things weve seen, heard, and thought up. You will see an angel carrying all of the memories through a rope-way. Shes carried by two other people because shes tired. And shes trying hard to keep all the memories alive by taking them to a safe destination. And somewhere between the memories and the destination, falls life, says Sajeesh, adding that the angel represents himself. The work is part of the artists Journey series.The artists studied in the RLV college of Fine Arts, at Kochi. While Akhil, from Ramamangalam, is a freelance artist, Sajeesh, from Pallikkara, teaches art at the MG B.Ed college, Tripunithura. They were picked from over 7,000 entries and sent to the jury.

The meat is chewy and the creamy coleslaw retains a bite. This heavy is topped with a sunny-side-up egg, which has soft edges. On the side, you get lightly toasted, crisp slices of bread, (too sweet) baked beans, herbed and grilled potatoes, (indifferently) grilled tomato and a cup of tea or coffee or juice. If you can have this and still manage a dessert, you should audition for Man v/s Food.The Ham Basket, despite its few weak links, makes for a great breakfast.If you like something lighter, stick to the pancakes. They are fluffy and mildly sweetened and the chef makes them with soyamilk on request (if you are intolerant to dairy). I suggest the pancakes with maple syrup (a common favourite) and pancakes with caramelised bananas. If you have a sweet tooth, you can order these with whipped cream and any of the fruity crushes.I havent tried their coffee but their teas are worth going back for. I have gone back to have their ginger tea, it is watery and generous with the ginger. Their pot of masala tea, with the same consistency and the strong flavour, is also a good order. These cups are for mornings before a brisk walk in the sun or, for evenings, to wake you up for polite conversations.The Srilankan Curry with Steamed Rice and Salad is thick with coconut milk. Therefore, it is mostly bland but the salad goes perfectly with it. The salad has purple and green cabbage, mixed with shredded coconut and crushed peanuts. You may bite an occasional slice of chilli in it.The salad comes with the Malaysian Chicken Massaman Curry with Steamed Rice too. This one, blander than the Srilankan dish, has lightly cooked potatoes and soft pieces of chicken in it.Spicy Prawn Curry with Mint Rice and Peanut Salad is more tomato based and tastes like sambar as a friend said. This does not take away from its goodness and the mint in the rice is more a nudge, than a push.In the desserts, we try the waffle with vanilla ice cream. This smells of a warm kitchen with fresh loaves of bread and the ice cream is whisked to the right smoothness. That said, if you do not like eggs or the smell of eggs, dont have this.Price for two: Rs 1,000 (mains and tea)"

Sekmai also means the most famous local brew of Manipur.As the battle of ballots between ruling Congress and resurgent BJP gathers momentum, there is a free flow of the local brew not only to different pockets of the constituency but also to poll agents to carry it to the rest of the State to quench sekmai-thirsty voters.Kh. Tomba Singh has never made better business in the last five years. These days, he is busy with orders from impatient and eager poll agents cutting across party lines and from across the State.I am doing brisk business. You can say my business has risen three times. The agents of the political parties have been milling around here for the past few days to place their orders and carry home the drink, he said.Compare the scene with what Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi said last week in Imphal. He said, Dry Manipur should remain dry in letter and spirit.As the French town Cognac derived its name from the local drink by the same name, this scheduled caste-reserved constituency of Manipur got its name from sekmai. Previously, the village was known as Sengmai. Japanese engineers and officials, who had briefly stayed in Imphal in the 1990s to launch the Manipur governments sericulture project, which was funded by Japan, compared sekmai with the countrys most famous local brew sake.There is no ban on the sale and consumption of sekmai but its carriage to other parts in large quantities is prohibited. It is popular not just in Manipur but across the Northeast.Sekmai is prepared with local rice and the stems of a creeper plant called yangli. The yangli stems are kept in water for a few days and later, the water is mixed with ground rice to prepare hamei, which is usually given the shape of a chapatti. Subsequently, boiled rice and hameis are mixed and fermented for five to six days. The whole process ends in about 10 days with distillation. The distilled water is called sekmai, explained retired engineer Kh.

There is no chemical used in its preparation. This is a pure drink, said A Robin, a local.According to locals, sekmai is used in all events - during the birth of a child, death of a person, marriages, festivals and the performance of rituals.The constituency has around 20,000 voters, out of which some 5,000 are settled in Sekmai village. According to Robin, nearly 3,000 of them, mostly women, eke out a living by engaging themselves in the preparation of sekmai and selling it. The locals are believed to have migrated here from Thailand centuries ago.Meanwhile, the constituency is all poised for a straight fight between sitting MLA Khwairakpam Devendro Singh of the Congress and Heikham Dingo Singh of the BJP. Others have not fielded candidates here."

The price has already decreased by over Rs 20 among all dal varieties. Were expecting the price to drop even further as the market is also getting weaker, said Rama Murugan, a wholesale dealer.At retail outlets, one kg of toor dal that was sold at around Rs 120 now sells for Rs 90-100, green dal faces a similar drop. Urad and dal and Bengal which sold at around Rs 140 has come down to Rs 120.Rice price, on the other hand, has seen an overall increase as the availability within the state is receding. The rice that is circulated within the state is the one that comes from Kancheepuram as the farmers had a failed crop. This has particularly increased the price of idly rice that grows there, said the owner of a rice mandy in Red Hills. The availability of rice is so low that we are bringing rice from Kolkotta, he added.Ponni rice that was sold between Rs 48 and Rs 50 now sells between Rs 54 and 56. Sona rice that was sold at around Rs 48 is being sold at around Rs 52. Idly rice which was sold at Rs 30 on average has now shot up to Rs 36 and Rs 38.

Later, her son Aditya, now all of 17, displayed a great deal of affection for both dogs and cats and that is how they slowly made their way into the Raos ground floor apartment in the city.The family now has a family of four adorable fluffy and plump Persian cats of various ages, one perky little Shistsu, one mild and child-friendly Golden Retriever, one chirpy and garrulous, talking African grey parrot, and four fish tanks which have been reduced to three over time.The pets are all named after Star Wars characters and they share an amazing bond, considering they are natural enemies. The oldest cat is a red Persian and is called Obi wan Kenobi, Obi in short, the next is a Calico which is a rare one as they mostly die at birth, Princess Leia or Leia, the next is Queen Amidala or Ami and the last kitty is Master Yoda or Yoda.The Shitsu is Mara Jade Sky walker or Mara, the English golden retriever is Juno Eclipse or Juno, the parrot was given by a family who couldnt keep her anymore and was called Sassy by them. Whew, now that was quite a mouthful.My father in law is terrified of dogs, so we had to look for a dog that looks and behaves like a cat and that is how our Shitsu came in to our home, says Kanchana Rao who is now almost a pet scientist and an expert on their behaviour. The Shistsu purrs like a cat and uses her paws to keep the Persians away instead of barking at them! Purrfect feline behaviour.There was a time when we had four fish tanks perched on the bar counter, now there are three, says Kanchana. The tanks need to be cleaned once a week, the oxygen cylinders checked, the plants in it trimmed, and what not. A professional comes to do this.The fish are fed a Japanese brand of pellets called AVA. When a fish jumps out of the tank, none of the cats harm it, instead they go up to the lady of the house and lead her on to the little fish on the floor. I have saved quite a few fish this way, says Kanchana Rao.Earlier, dead fish were bid a tearful goodbye and buried in the garden, these days they are placed in the garbage bin and sent off to the other world. Kanchana even has names for some fish that are friendly and respond to affection.The dogs and cats need to be brushed and groomed every single day. Care is taken to remove hair and fur so that the cats dont gulp them down. They then start throwing up the stuff. A paste which is a vitamin and mineral supplement is fed to them to minimise this problem. This is also a hair ball remedy and the hair gets excreted through the system.The Raos have a small garden for Juno to play in. Juno is given pet food once a day and one regular meal which is a portion of what the family eats, usually chicken, veggies, rice and dal.After doing a lot of research, we zoomed in on a Golden Retriever that is by nature a very mild and friendly dog. So even though Juno is 70 kg, she is harmless and even gets bullied around by the cats. She is a gentle giant and does not retaliate.Juno was trained by a professional in socialisation when she was young. The animals visit a spa once in three months or so for grooming. Each session can last for as long as four hours with baths, haircuts, nail clipping, tooth cleaning and adding embellishments such as bows and ribbons. The females love their bows but the boys do not like their bandanas.The African Grey, Sassy, sleeps at 10 pm when a bed sheet is placed over her cage and the night sets in. She wakes up early and starts whistling and chatting away to glory. Her poop and food tray is cleaned thrice a day and she is fed baby food with a syringe in the morning and then regular bird food, rest of the time. Sassy has a large vocabulary and Kanchana is often confused when she mimics her son Aditya and calls out mamma, come here, mamma come here!The parrot is bathed once a week with a warm water spray followed by a quick blow-drying session which she quite enjoys. Her beak is cleaned with a soft towel. She fluffs her feathers and looks mighty pleased with herself after the bath.The animals are never sent to kennels while the family is away on vacations. They need love and cuddling. They bond so well with us and with each other, says Kanchana Rao. Her husband, ex banker, Raghu Rao, couldnt agree more."

Poothan Thira is traditionally performed by the Mannan community during poorams  the temple festivals of north Trissur, Palakkad and southern Malapuram districts, says the graphic artist and researcher, who has won a grant from the India Foundation for the Arts. Poothan, is said to be the lieutenant of Shiva sent by him to assist Bhagwadi to fight Darika, and Thira, is the Goddess Kali (Bhagawathi) herself. They are said to cleanse the village of evil spirits during the festival season, she says.The Thira headress has a central woodenpiece, adivattappalaka , engraved with Kaliroopam , the form of the goddessAs part of the project, Sarita will delve into the objects associated with the art form. Seemingly ordinary objects would also be looked into, she says, any that spark conversation... from the ubiquitous flower that is used in garlands, to the flag that goes up to mark the beginning of the festival.Excerpts from an interview:Why did you choose Poothan Thira?I am from Valuvanad and as child was never allowed to go see the performances during the festivals  they were noisy spaces where there was no barrier between audiences and performers. But I was always drawn to the almost pagan like rhythm in the music and dance of the rituals and the mysterious symbologies associated with the objects and motifs. Later, I became curious when I saw a shift in the agency that these performances had: from a means to maintain social differences in feudal societies, today these events use culture and art as tools to opposing ends as well  to break free of caste structures. My interest was also sparked because, while they are relatively unknown outside their rural milieu, they have considerable localised patronage.How have changes in venues and audiences influenced the art form?While traditionally these rituals were performed at the local temple grounds, today, they are performed through the year at cultural events and on stage. Earlier they got angeekaranam (acceptance) from the kshetram (temple), now they get it from janangal (people). As P Vasudevan, one of the performers says, Earlier, we barely survived because of it, now we see that it can actually provide livelihood. The Poothan has changed from a bhayanakam, or scary character to a hasyam, or comical one. The Thira performers in turn are now more acrobatic in their performances in order to attract audiences.The Thira performers visit houses to bless the households. Rice and a dhoti is given as an offering to them.Is the Thira dying or seeing a revival?I can definitely see a revival in pockets  not across all family groups, but some. Practitioners like P Vasudevan, the founder of a school in Palghat District trains young members of the community and has been successful in taking performances outside traditional milieus. There is a sense of achievement of crossing caste and class barriers, pride that audiences come to watch because of the virtuosity of the art form.Vasudevan told me: Post 1951, things have changed for us, people of all castes and religions come nowadays to watch the performances. When I was a child, the community was not allowed into the courtyards of higher caste houses and it was only on the days we received offerings of grain from patrons that our family ate well. There may be some small support from governmental agencies  but I believe it is the success that the performers will have in evolving their anushtanam (tradition) as kala (art) within their local spaces, that will ensure their sustainability."

She has filed a police complaint against the errant teacher, Kailash Jena in the local police station.Apparently, the students and cook, Rina Barik had earlier complained to the school headmaster about substandard MDM being served but no action was taken.This is not the first occasion that irregularities in MDM has been reported in the district. At Ayar Majurai Primary School under Raghunathpur block, mid-day meals have not been served for the last four months for reasons best known to the school authorities. Former panchayat samiti member, Snehansu Jena said a majority of students in this school are Dalits and have not even received their school uniforms yet even as the current academic session will end soon.In November last year, 16 students were taken ill after consuming MDM at Satyanaryan Upper Primary School in Kotokana village under Tirtol police limits. A dead lizard was found in the food served in the school. After taking the noon meals, students started vomiting and complained of stomach pain. Later, they were admitted to Manijanga Community Health Centre (CHC) where doctors kept them under observation for some hours and discharged them after treatment.Following the incident, notices were issued to Jagatsinghpur Collector Yamini Sarangi and District Education Officer Krushna Chandra Nayak by the Odisha Food Commission over irregularities in provision of noon meals to students. The officials had appeared before the Commission. Despite all this, the district authorities are taking no steps to streamline things as far as mid-day meals are concerned.Block Education Officer, Bijayalaxmi Dash said the additional block education officer and cluster resource centre coordinator have been asked to conduct an inquiry into supply of rotten eggs under the MDM scheme at Police Colony Primary School. Under the MDM scheme, children are served eggs twice a week on Wednesday and Saturday."

Vegetarians get paneer curry four times a week. Since paneer and chicken are considered slightly heavier on the tummy, they are served only for lunch. For dinner, they get dal, one curry, roti, rice and salad. Dessert is a kheer. Jawans are served tea every morning and parantha and pickle or curds and egg for breakfast. In winter, tea is served four times a day. In summers, it is lime juice.The BSF has internal mechanisms to keep food tasty. At roll-call every evening, jawans assemble before the company commander to discuss various issues, including food, family problems, personal issues, duties, etc., a company commander in BSF told The New Indian Express.The jawans get to select their own mess commander. All jawans are called and an oral voting takes place to select the mess commander and mess 2IC. This exercise takes place every month (around the 24th or 25th of the month). This way, if a mess commander is not up to the mark, he is out the next month, a BSF jawan said.Sources said there are other internal mechanisms. For complaints against their company commander, the commandant can be approached. If there are issues with the commandant or any higher-up, any BSF personnel can bring the issues concerned through the grievances portal of the BSF which can even reach the director general. Besides this, jawans can also write letters to anyone.I am surprised that leaving aside all these options, Tej Bahadur Yadav uploaded the videos online, said a BSF official, posted along the LoC in Jammu region."

With the controversy yet to be settled in the matter, the party took a U-turn in the Kamal issue as another state general secretary M T Ramesh said the remarks were his personal comments and that it had nothing to do with the party stance. According to him, for the BJP the issue that is currently at hand is not Kamal but ration rice.Radhakrishnans comment on Kamal might be a case of personal opinion. The party or its state committee has nothing to do with it. The party is no way undermining their contributions towards the socio-cultural sphere of the state. But we reiterate our stance that those who criticise others are liable to hear the counters also. BJP doesnt want to lose time on trivial issues. The issue that is currently at hand is not Kamal but anomalies with ration rice distribution in the state, said M T Ramesh at a press conference here on Wednesday.While alleging that the cold war between IAS officials and the Chief Minister has resulted in stagnance in governance, the BJP general secretary said that the CM is trying to implement the divide and rule policy. He is categorising bureaucrats and is acting like a shield for Vigilance chief Jacob Thomas. Those who had taken a strong stance against corruption in the past are now mum on the allegations being raised against Minister J Mercykutty Amma, Ramesh said."

He also lamented a lack of contact with the incoming Trump administration.At a conference focused on national security and the presidential transition, Kerry rejected criticism that the Obama administration had failed to lead in dealing with world crises. ""We've been leading,"" he said, pointing to the Iran nuclear deal, the Paris climate change agreement, response to the Ebola virus, strengthening NATO and his own unsuccessful efforts to end Syria's civil war. He said charges that the administration mishandled the Arab Spring revolts against authoritarian leaders were wrong.""People are not separating a remarkable transformation that is taking place globally from things that we are really responsible for,"" Kerry said, blasting what he called ""revisionist commentary"" from critics. ""We didn't start the Arab Spring, we couldn't have stopped the Arab Spring. There is no way the Obama administration doing anything would have changed what was happening in those countries.""Tuesday's event at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington is titled ""Passing the Baton"" and focuses on how the Trump administration will take the reins from President Barack Obama. Obama and Trump's national security advisers, Susan Rice and Michael Flynn, were to appear after Kerry.With only 10 days left in his tenure, Obama's top diplomat called for a new ""Marshall Plan"" to help countries in critical regions around the world educate their exploding youth populations and prevent them from being radicalised.Lack of education and the spread of misinformation, notably online, are serious threats that must be confronted to prevent a rise of ""authoritarian populism"" that threatens the international order, Kerry said. He accused Russia of mounting a ""horrendous invasion of our democratic process"" by interfering in the 2016 presidential election and said such actions must be combatted.""One of the greatest challenges we all face right now, not just America but every country, is that we are living in a factless political environment,"" Kerry said. ""Every country in the world better stop and start worrying about authoritarian populism and the absence of substance in our dialogue.""He did not mention Trump by name but took a thinly veiled shot at the president-elect's propensity to tweet his views on policy issues.""If policy is going to be made in 140 characters on Twitter and every reasonable measure of accountability is being bypassed and people don't care about it, we have a problem,"" Kerry said.He said he worried that the incoming administration's ""America First"" slogan might translate into ""turning away"" from a vast array of challenges the world faces, particularly climate change.On the State Department's transition, Kerry half-jokingly said it was going ""pretty smoothly"" because ""there is not an enormous amount of it.""He said he had yet to meet Trump's choice to replace him as America's top diplomat, Exxon Mobil chief Rex Tillerson. He said he expects to do so ""in the near term"" and still believes there is time for ""an ample debriefing"" before the new administration begins."

When Modi is choking the people with his currency note reforms, Pinarayi has added misery by denying rice and other ration essentials to the people. Team Modi has emerged as the guardian of black money hoarders and launderers. As for the Pinarayi government and the CPM, the concern is not about the starving poor in the state following the breakdown of the public distribution system but holding party jamborees, she alleged.

Since the Supreme Court has banned the popular bull-taming sport of 'Jallikattu', normally conducted on 'Mattu' (cow) Pongal (third day of Pongal festivities), the festival is expected to be a low-key affair in Madurai and its neighbouring districts. For 'Kannum Pongal' festival on Monday, security has been strengthened at several places including Marina beach here, where people throng in large numbers.Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao, Chief Minister O Panneerselvam, AIADMK General Secretary V K Sasikala and DMK working president M K Stalin and other leaders extended their greetings on the occasion of Pongal. The festival falls on the first day of Tamil month 'Thai', considered as the precursor of hope."

Puspuni, known as the second most important agrarian festival of the region after Nuakhai, has special significance for the people of the region as majority of the population depend on agriculture. While Nuakhai is celebrated after flowering of paddy, Puspuni is observed to celebrate the harvest of the crop.It is celebrated on the day of Pausa Purnima (full moon day in Odia month of Pausa) after harvesting of kharif paddy. The festival provides the much-needed break after the tiring agricultural work. It also marks the end of work contract between landowners and agricultural labourers and beginning of a new one. While it is associated with fun and merry making, there is no ritual or worshiping of deities during the festival. Emphasis is given on food, especially traditional and non-vegetarian, for its celebration.This apart, children were seen moving from door-to-door singing the song Chher Chhera and collecting food materials, including rice and vegetable or cash. The entire exercise is aimed at poking fun at the older women of a household, strengthening bond between the two generations and seeking blessings from them. However, the festival is celebrated a day later in Bargarh town to mark killing of demon King Kansa during Dhanu Yatra."

We spend the first few days parading our Gangireddulu (oxen), decked up for the festival from one home to another, said Sailu, who also plays the traditional trumpet. We play the trumpet and stop at every home, he said. They earn around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000 every day along with rice and dal. Some people who believe in the tradition and consider it good luck for the new year lend us food and old clothes, he added. It is considered lucky mainly for newly-married couples and they pray for the good health of their families, he added.Around 25 people, like Sailu and his brother Isak came to the city and set up a make shift settlement and made it their temporary home. We have a place in SR Nagar that we make our home during these 15 days, explained Sailu. There are many others like him who have created similar settlements in Ameerpur, Amberpet, Shahpur and LB Nagar in the city.It is a family setting, with tents allocated for different activities. While some of them are seen cooking in one corner, the men are seen bedecking their oxen. The making up of the oxen is time taking, exhaustive and intricate but not for these farmer. We have been doing it for ages. In our village, whenever there is an event, a death or a wedding, we do the same performance, shared Sailu, while his brother was putting together a colourful ensemble for the Gangireddu -- accessories for the horns, vibrant clothes and jewellery.This used to be coupled with the tradition of narrating age-old stories. That? we dont do it anymore, he said. Most of the people at the makeshift shelter are older than Sailu as very few, like Sailu, are stuck with the choice of parading their oxen and begging for a living. Not many youngsters are opting for this tradition anymore. They are taking up daily wage jobs, or have moved to the city to take up small jobs, shared Sailu, who was the only one willing to talk. He also admitted that this is one lucrative alternative, especially in the last three years where the state was hit by drought."

(File photo by K.K Sundar| EPS)MADURAI: Police on Sunday foiled attempts to conduct Jallikattu in southern districts of Tamil Nadu, detaining several people as 'Mattu Pongal', the third day of the harvest festivities, was celebrated with fervor in the state.Amid protests against the ban on the bull-taming sport, police today warned to take strict action against those violating the Supreme Court order on the sport, associated with Pongal festivities.Madurai Superintendent of Police, Vijayendar S Bidari, denied reports that Jallikattu was conducted in the district. ""Around 2,000 police personnel are keeping a vigil across the district. We have taken steps to provide security in the area,"" he said.Sufficient police force has been deployed in the district to prevent any untoward incidents, he added.""Everyone should follow the order. Everybody should be aware that we will take action as per the law. People should cooperate,"" he said when it was pointed out that the sport is usually held on 'Kaanum Pongal', the fourth and final day of Pongal festivities, at Alanganallur.Some locals claimed that hundreds of people had gathered for ""Manjuvirattu"" (an event involving bulls) at Singampunari in Sivaganga district which, they said, was held for a brief period.Police also said they chased away a crowd which tried to organise Jallikattu at Alangudi in Pudukottai district, and also foiled a bid to conduct it at the Sri Thadikonda Swamy temple.Meanwhile, people offered prayers to bulls and cows on the occasion of ""Mattu Pongal"", third day of Pongal festivities where people offer prayers to farm animals.In Madurai district's Palamedu village, a place famous for Jallikattu events, people performed special poojas to some temple bulls.Jallikattu supporters were seen offering pongal (sweet rice made of jaggery with rice and milk, in a traditional mud pot) to the local deity before giving it to the bulls.Local youth said that 'symbolic' Jallikattu was held in some places but police denied it. At Palamedu, people hoisted black flags to protest the ban on Jallikattu. Shops at several localities remained shut.Police said youth were detained at Mudakathan, Alanganallur, Palamedu and Vilangudi in Madurai district, at Nallampatti in Dindigul district and Pottuchavadi in Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu for trying to hold the sport defying the apex court ban."

That means over 65 per cent of the crop failed.

I am scared to sow rice as there is no water for irrigation, says Perumal Samy, a farmer of Mukoodal region in the district. While one half of his field is empty, the other half is dotted with withered plantain saplings. Rice is water intensive, so we moved to plantain. But even that has failed as plantain too loves water, he rues, adding that he is considering going for cash crop such as cotton, like many others in the village.But the propects of growing cotton too are not bright.About a mile from his field is another with dry and dark cotton stems. We planted cotton, as paddy and plantain failed. If we do not get proper rain in the next couple of weeks, we are in for a heavy loss, laments Mani Maaran, a farmer who owns a small field in the region that has black soil. Our fields are fed by wells like these, he says.The water bodies feeding the wells are not any wetter. There are 441 tanks in Thamirabharani basin and 703 in Chittar basin.

The fields on the plains of Thamirabharani are irrigated by one or more of the five sources: borewells, wells, tanks and ponds, canals and water channels or the river itself. All lands are classified into either river system-fed or rain-fed.The river has seven anaicuts that were built during the pre-colonial times. The eighth one, Srivaikundam was built during the British rule. Along with eight dams, the river branches into 11 canals and several other small channels that carry water to large tanks in different parts of the region. The tanks, ponds and wells that are not fed by the system are fed by rain. The rain-irrigated lands are called Vaanam paatha boomi (lands that directly depend on rain) in Tamil.Highest deficit rainfallThe fields fed by rain are the worst affected. Rainfall data shows a sharp decline in 2016 as it is the year with the lowest rainfall in the last 20 years. The lack of rainfall has translated to a scanty flow of water in the river. The empty water tanks and ponds are speckled with new weeds of invasive species. Vast stretches of land that used to be water bodies are now barren.Arumuga Konar (63) watches on as his herd of goats drinks water from a pond in the eight sq km wide Periyakulam in Vijayanarayanam area which irrigates over 10 villages. This tank used to provide water for villages up to four km from here. Now it does not have enough to supply even the ones on the bund slope, he says.Indiscriminate sand miningSeemai Karuvelam, Naattu Karuvelam, Erukku and other plants line the banks of the river. They grow in odd patches of sand mounds that look like a used-to-be islet, looking neatly cut.They have left behind that part of the sand and have taken the clean white sand around it, says Barathi Murugan, an RTI activist who has been fighting to protect the river for over two decades now.Standing on a bridge near Adhichanallur -- a popular archeological site -- he points to the stretch of Thamirabharani where the volume of water suddenly seems to be , which is why the fields near it are greener. It is this 1.5 km stretch that no sand miner has touched. They have their eyes and ears here all the time. Strangely, the river bed in this stretch is inaccessible for lorries and that is what has saved it so long. Once access route is built, we will have no power to save even this small stretch, he says.Documented evidence showing the brutality the river bed faced stay neatly folded inside a small private library run by Kamarasu M, who has authored 41 books about Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Thamirabharani. In the name of desilting, they take the good sand away, leaving behind the bad in the river... They even broke a bund to facilitate lorry movement, he says, showing one among the innumerable pictures wherein a bright yellow JCB pours white sand into a heap within a square fence..The white sand found in the river bed is the silt that is formed from breaking rocks. While it has higher water retention ability, the clayey soil beneath lets the water run off. Since Thamirabharani is relatively short running and is confined within two districts, the sand deposited has taken millions of years to form. But sand miners have taken 6 to 7 ft of the soil, leaving the river with very low retention, says Prof A G Murugesan, Head of Environmental Studies, Paramakalyani College, adding that most water that is not used for irrigation runs off as surplus due to the presence of clayey soil beneath the sand.White sand also has purifying properties. While it filters impurities, it also hosts bacteria that regulates water quality. With the sand scooped out, the water that used to stay in the river for months, drains into the ocean within hours, he explains.Plight of Papanasam damThe seven dams built across the riverduring pre-colonial times were constructed with sand vents and sluices in a way that facilitates natural desilting during floods, says Nainar Kulasekaran (93), leader of Thamirabharani Pathugappu Peravai. Fondly called Thamirabharani Thaatha by the locals, this former journalist has been fighting against industrialisation of the river for 70 years now.In his little house in Nattathi, the old man stumbles and sits next to a shelf that explodes with files and papers. He runs his fingers over yellow gunny bags with files containing RTI papers that he has filed over the years. He claims that 30 feet of the 40-ft deep Papanasam dam is filled with slush constricting the space available for fresh water. C Chandrasekaran, a former Tirunelveli district joint director for agriculture, who has spent nearly three decades understanding the Thamirabharani basin, agrees with Kulasekarans claim.Need to ration waterTown dwellers, farmers and activists point fingers at the lack of desilting, mindless consumption by industries and rainfall deficit for the scarcity. I will not deny that industries contribute to the deficit. But the problem is also intertwined with lack of regulations in the Combined Water Supply Scheme , reasons Chandrasekaran.The CWSS supplies water not only to Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi, but also to Nagercoil, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar. Urging the government to regularise the use and measure the supply accurately, he says the river water supplied for public and industrial consumptions is put to unsubscribed uses. The public use the river water for washing and cleaning too. To prevent this, water should be rationed to communities in units based on number of members per household. Meters need to be installed in each hamlet. We cannot afford to use potable water indiscriminately, Chandrasekaran adds.The canal system that runs complimentary to the river is designed in such a way that it lies at an altitude higher than the river. Water released at the dams would be supplied through the canals, instead of creating the need to pump water from the low altitude of the river. This altitude gradient has been affected following steps to increase the capacity of the canals. This, in turn, has reduced flow through the canals, he says.Chandrasekaran has engineering solutions to combat the crisis, while Kulasekaran suggests something out of his survival instincts.Paddy has borne the brunt of water scarcity. But millet needs just one spell of rain, Kulasekaran says. Of the 15,400 hectares of targeted millet harvest, over 13,000 hectares yielded success. Gone are the days where smart farming makes a difference. Agriculture needs variety for which consistent supply is essential. We may never see it until there is an active State intervention in restoring the river to its age old glory, he sighs, as he tucks the files and papers back into its place.Lifeline of the southThe Thamirabarani, that originates in Pothigai hills in the Western Ghats, is a perennial river.

The controversy centres around whether Thaksin, who currently lives in self-exile, should have paid taxes on the sale of his telecoms company Shin Corp to Singapore's Temasek Holdings in 2006.The furore over the deal, which netted the Shinawatra family a USD 1.9 billion windfall, was a lightning rod for opposition to his government. Protests culminated in a coup that booted him from office and sparked years of debilitating political infighting between his supporters and opponents. T oday tax officials accompanied by police posted the bill on Thaksin's former home in Bangkok, although he has not set foot there for nearly a decade to avoid jail for a graft conviction that he insists was politically motivated.Denying it was an act of political theatre, Thai junta leader Prayut Chan-O-Cha said tax officials ""posted the summons at his house like they would in every other case."" Prayut is a former army chief who became prime minister after leading a 2014 coup against Thaksin's sister Yingluck. ""This is about a violation of the law and has nothing to do with reconciliation,"" he told reporters, referring to a recent junta-backed push to launch talks between Thailand's political factions.Thaksin's representatives hit back, saying there was no legal requirement at the time for him to pay taxes on the telecoms company sale. ""Thaksin was not supposed to pay taxes from the very beginning and he will file his appeal within three days,"" his legal advisor Noppadon Pattama told reporters on Tuesday. Anti-Shinawatra factions who agitated for the 2014 army takeover have pressed the junta to retrieve the back taxes before the statute of limitations is reached.But it comes at a sensitive time for the military who recently embarked on a much trumpeted ""reconciliation"" drive. Junta critics say the revival of the Shin Corp tax issue is vindictive and a fresh effort to block a political comeback from the Shinawatra clan. They have won every general election since 2001 helped by a fervent following in Thailand's poorer rural north, earning the loathing of the Bangkok-centric elite in the process.Thaksin's sister Yingluck is also under junta pressure to pay USD 1 billion in compensation for a rice subsidy program launched by her government that they claim was soaked in graft. Prayut has pitched himself as a reluctant mediator in Thailand's fraught politics. But many analysts cast doubt on the army's impartiality given its penchant for coups and support for legal moves against the Shinawatra clan."

He said the Government is providing 1.79 lakh tonne rice and wheat to 3.23 crore consumers through 13,529 fair price shops.Automation of all the 1,569 fair price shops in the urban areas have been started in the first phase from March 5, he said and added that automation of 3,414 shops in 87 blocks will be completed by April-end in the second phase. He said 8,546 shops will be completed by June-end in the third phase.The Minister, however, said the Government has opposed the Centres decision not to provide kerosene for beneficiaries who have received cooking gas under the Prime Ministers Ujala Yojana. The Government argued that kerosene is not used for only cooking in Odisha, he added.In a written reply to a question from Ayub Khan (BJD), Dasburma said 54.1 lakh families in Odisha are eligible to be covered under the Ujala scheme. So far, 9,49,526 families have been provided cooking gas under the scheme."

In her partially-constructed house in Balichada village under Junagarh block of Kalahandi district, Chandrabati Khura alias Rukha (70) is yet to come to terms with the loss of her mentally-ill son, Rankanidhi (30), who died of starvation on March 24, as claimed by locals. Her elder son, Dayanidhi (42) is also mentally-challenged and dependent on his mother for even his daily chores. Dayanidhis health, she says, is her priority now.The local administration was, however, quick to dismiss the starvation death claim. Junagarh BDO Parambrahma Joshi said Government aid has been provided to the hapless woman in the shape of widow pension of `300, rice under the gratuitous relief scheme and cooked food from the anganwadi centre.She has also got a pucca house under the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana and work order for the construction was issued before the panchayat election. Help, though, came only last year.Both her sons were working as migrant labourers but returned home a few years back and gradually became mentally ill.The family was landless and Chandrabati had to take care of both of them. The family was not covered under the National Food Security Mission. Despite all odds, she managed to sustain the family with help from Good Samaritans in the village and some NGOs. If she failed to arrange food, the family went to bed on empty stomach.On August 28 last year, a local human rights activist filed a petition before the State Human Rights Commission seeking its intervention to cover Chandrabati under various government welfare schemes. The Commission issued a notice to Collector to conduct an inquiry and the same day, she was provided a bag of rice. In October, she was enrolled under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana for widow pension.On January 17, on the direction of Collector, Sub-Collector of Dharamgarh along with sub-divisional supply officer and Junagarh BDO visited the village and interacted with her.Block Social Security Officer, Jayanta Praharaj also went with a medical team and psychiatrist from the District Headquarters Hospital, Pratap Pattnaik who examined Rankanidhi and Dayanidhi. Subsequently, the district officials provided medicines and enrolled them online for disability certificates and other benefits.BDO said the family is being provided 30 kg of rice under gratuitous relief scheme from the gram panchayat and till date, 1.3 quintals of rice have been given to the family. This apart, cooked food from the village anganwadi centre was provided to the family once in a day for the last seven months."

Gotabaya said that Doval had twice asked him to cancel the China-funded Colombo Port City project and take back the southern container terminal at the Colombo port from the Chinese.Gotabaya said that China has been a bee in the bonnet for Doval since his early days in the intelligence service. While Menon looked at things as a diplomat, Doval looked at them as a intelligence man, the former Sri Lankan Defense Secretary said.In this context he referred to the alleged visit of a Chinese nuclear submarine in November 2014 which created a flutter in India. Gotabaya blamed the Indian media for this.Firstly, it was not a nuclear submarine, and secondly, it is not true that the visits by Chinese submarines were secrets, Gotabaya said. The Indian High Commissioner had been informed about the visits of the vessels, which were en route from East to the West and back. And these visits had taken place with prior permission from the Sri Lankan government. Colombo was aware of New Delhis sensitivities and had expressly stated that it will not allow Sri Lanka to be used against India, Gotabaya said. But still there were reservations in New Delhi.Against this background Gotabaya said that he is intrigued by Indias silence over the present Sri Lankan governments handing over 80% of the shares in Hambantota port to a Chinese state owned company for 99 years. He wondered if India has anything up its sleeve. He described the transaction over Hambantota as dangerous.Asked about the alleged US plan to rescue LTTE leader Prabhakaran along with the evacuation of the trapped civilians in the last two weeks of Eelam War IV, Gotabaya said that he was not sure if there was such a plan. But US Ambassador Robert Blake did tell him that the US would like to help evacuate the civilians but not Prabhakaran and the top LTTE leadership. But this was only a suggestion, Gotabaya added.Asked why the ceasefire cum evacuation plan was not carried out, he said that there were some issues to consider: Would Prabhakaran allow it? Would India agree to it?Further on US policy towards Sri Lanka, Gotabaya said that Ambassador Blake said that the US wanted to be seen to be helping the Sri Lankan war effort and for that he asked Sri Lanka to sign the Acquisition Cross Servicing Agreement (ACSA) to make its ports available for the US Department of Defense. Blake pointed out that many countries including India had signed it. The agreement was signed The US gave intelligence on the LTTEs floating armories which had a huge impact on the militants ability to function.But US policies changed when Barack Obama became President in January 2009 with human rights activists like Samantha Power and Susan Rice holding key posts. The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner came to Colombo ask for an end to the hostilities. This was because of the domestic electoral importance of the Tamil Diaspora, Gotabaya reasoned.Their plea was negatived as President Rajapaksa and he had decided to fight to the finish. There was no going back from the objective of completely finishing the LTTE was to be achieved.On allegations of huge casualties in the war, ranging from 40,000 to 150,000, Gotabaya said that empirical evidence does not support these figures. The government census department had done a survey which revealed a death toll of 7,000 to 8,000. UNICEF had done an independent survey which did not support the allegations. Even the UN has not officially put out the figure of 40,000 killed.Data available with the World Food Program and the District Government Agents had indicated a population of 300,000 in the war zone out of which most crossed over to the government side and were lodged in camps.Asked about forced disappearances, he said that the allegations need to be investigated, and for that, people need to give credible evidence and indentify the perpetrators, things which are lacking now.He dismissed the claim of some people that they had handed over militants to the army but who are not heard of till date. In a chaotic situation which prevailed in the last stages, it is not possible for people to hand over anybody to the army peacefully, Gotabaya said.On the issue of post war justice and accountability mechanisms Gotabaya said that if both sides rake up old wounds, the gap between the Tamils and the Sinhalese will only widen and there will be no reconciliation. If the Tamils talk of army atrocities, the Sinhalese can talk about the many killings and massacres done by the LTTE , and the two communities can never reconcile.On the issue of releasing LTTE prisoners, he said that out of the 13,000 in custody, all except 274 ,who had cases against them, had been released.On Sri Lanka co-sponsoring the resolution on it in the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC), Gotabaya said that the present government has failed to make use of the changed political scenario in the US, with Donald Trump at the helm. Trump would have left Sri Lanka alone as he had pledged to make America to look inward rather than outward."

This, in nutshell, is Kerala budget for 2017-18, presented by Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac in the Assembly on Friday.Political controversies over the leak of the speech apart, the budget also raises a pertinent question: Can the budget use an outside body - KIIFB or Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, in this case, to raise money for almost all its capital expenditure requirements?A glance through the 144-page-long budget speech shows KIIFB is being used as a proxy for building roads, bridges, rail network and port infrastructure. The underlying strategy is easy to fathom. The governments finances have hit the threshold prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), and use of an external body is being used to circumvent the rule.Consider this: RBI has prescribed 3 per cent fiscal deficit and zero revenue deficit of GSDP under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. Keralas respective figures stand at 3.51 pc and 1.96 pc of GSDP respectively as on 2015-16.No attempt is being made to reduce the revenue deficit while there is an excess of populism from internet to subsidised rice and social security pension, said Joseph K V, a former member of the Kerala Public Expenditure Committee.There are others who are more critical. This is a KIIFB-budget. Last year, the government announced it would raise Rs 20,000 crore and spend Rs 2,500 crore through KIIFB in 2016-17, but in reality it could only raise Rs 1,024 crore. This year too, nothing will happen, said V K Vijayakumar, investment strategist, Geojit.The hopes of turning around PSUs too will remain a dream. Lastly, the big plans of using NRI money for construction of coastal highways through KSFE will also not be an easy task.The Gulf sector is facing a slowdown. Further, if Im an investor, Ill look at the finances of the Kerala Government and its not a pretty picture. Ill not invest in these Pravasi Chitti, said Vijayakumar.If wishes were horses, beggars would ride, summed up Joseph."

The para forces in the northeast region are, Border Security Force (BSF), Shasastra Seema Bal (SSB), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel stationed at the Indo-Bangladesh border, Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders and the former Left Wing Extremism affected districts of Jangalmahal in western West Bengal.""We are the first line of defence at the eastern borders of the country, to check illegal immigration and stop cow smuggling. The Army is largely confined to the Eastern Command Headquarters and thebases in Panagarh, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and a few other places. Still, our pay and ration are not at par with Army,"" said a BSF official on the condition of anonymity.As north Indians dominate the three paramilitary forces in the state, rotis are more common than rice that is the staple of the local populace. Non-vegetarian food is generally served once a week and chicken is more preferred than fish, a source said. However, a lot of local Bengali recruits work in the paramilitary forces, more specifically in the BSF and the CRPF. According to their dietary needs, rice and fish are also provided, the source added.However, the central and state paramilitary forces in West Bengal had witnessed a period of intense breakdowns, fratricidal killings and open protests during the peak of Maoist insurgency in Jangalmahal from 2008-11. Psychiatrists feel that may return if the issue is not dealt with care.""CRPF jawans stationed in guerrilla war zone have to deal with a lot of psychological pressure. If that is not assuaged by giving them a sense that they are being taken care of -- by providing good food, healthcare and of course better pay -- we should be ready to witness periodic bouts of outbreak of anger,"" said psychiatrist Manoj Bandopadhyay, who has extensively studied the psychology of soldiers conducting counterinsurgency operations.The Maoist attack on a camp of West Bengal Police's paramilitary force, Eastern Frontier Rifles (EFR) at Silda in Paschim Medinipur district in 2010 that claimed the lives of 24 jawans opened a can of worms.Alleging discrimination in provision and facilities, the families of the jawans refused to allow the bodies to be taken away from the EFR headquarters at Salua in the same district and blocked the road, preventing any West Bengal police official to enter the camp. The then Inspector General (IG) of EFR, Benoy Chakraborty, covering his face with a black cloth in protest, had told the media about the discrimination his soldiers had to face in terms of pay, rations and other benefits. He was given a showcause notice for his 'masked presser' but no action was taken against him.Finally, the then Left Front finance minister Ashim Dasgupta, on behalf of the then Chief Minister and Home Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, had to visit the camp and placate the families after speaking to IG Chakraborty.Since then, a high wall with concertina wires has been erected around the EFRheadquarters, the pay of the soldiers increased and quarters where the families of the soldiers live have been freshly painted. However, not all issues have been resolved.""Besides Centre taking care of BSF, SSB and CRPF, the West Bengal government must make sure that the demands of the anti-insurgency STRACO force based in Jangalmahal are met. The force is made up of local boys who get much lesser facilities than EFR, leave alone WB Police. Though insurgency has waned, these local jawans are the ones who have prevented the reentry of Maoists from Jharkhand and that means a lot of pressure, which may burst if not fizzed out with better perks,"" psychiatrist Ajay Biswas said."
58fcf2247be9e06c93711c36,Employment scheme blind to women with disabilities,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/feb/26/employment-scheme-blind-to-women-with-disabilities-1574918.html,2017-03-01,"BHUBANESWAR: Bharati Pradhan (name changed), a 46-year-old orthopaedically-challenged woman of Kanas block in Puri district, gets a monthly pension of Rs 300 under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana and a few kgs of rice from the State Government. The money just meets her medicine requirements. The youngest among five siblings, she was born with disability and could manage to study till Class V. Her parents, daily wagers by profession, could neither afford her treatment nor education. Though wheel-chair bound and unskilled, she is keen on being self-reliant but that is a dream.Securing livelihood has never been an easy task for women with disabilities like Bharati who live in rural areas of Odisha despite implementation of several government schemes including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). They continue to have limited access to livelihood opportunities, be it direct employment or self-employment.The MGNREGS was implemented to ensure 100 days of wage employment in unskilled manual work for people in rural pockets. According to the Panchayati Raj Department sources, only 5,362 different-abled persons worked under MGNREGS in 2016-17 financial year. Less than five per cent of this labour force constituted women with disabilities. Similarly, the total number of disabled people working under MGNREGS stood at 5,586 in 2015-16, 3,352 in 2014-15 and 3,587 in 2013-14. Although there are no reports on the number of women with disabilities employed in these three financial years, Project Directors of all the 30 District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs) in the State, who are responsible for implementation of the scheme, admitted to low participation from this vulnerable group due to lack of awareness and a disabled-friendly environment.As per the 2011 Census, the total population of persons with disabilities in Odisha is 12,44,402 out of which, 6,74,775 are males and 5,69,627 are females. Sources said at least over two lakh women with disabilities, majority of them illiterate and residing in rural areas, are living below poverty line (BPL) and are in need of gainful employment. The Census points out that a majority of women with disabilities in Odisha suffer from movement-related disability, blindness and hearing impairment. Although their empowerment is only possible by economic independence, that has not been the case so far.Disability activist, Asha Hans said so many women with disabilities still living below the poverty line points to the fact that there is problem with implementation of employment schemes including the MGNREGS. Providing employment to these women becomes more necessary as almost 90 per cent of them are dependent on their family members for finances. Studies have shown that disabled women are more disadvantaged than their male counterparts in securing livelihood as they face gender discrimination, she said, adding that women with disabilities are still considered unfit to don the role of wage earner.Apparently, the MGNREG Act operational guidelines have a dedicated chapter on jobs outlined for differently-abled women. These include less stressful works like making drinking water arrangements at the work site, plantation, looking after children of workers, land levelling and sprinkling water on newly built walls. However, not many differently-abled women are coming forward to even take up these works, officials admit. The primary reason for this is lack of awareness and facilities. MGNREGS is considered labour intensive and no efforts are being made to bring them under the scheme or make them aware that they can do less strenuous work and earn the same wage that an abled person does, said former Odisha State Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, Kasturi Mohapatra.She added that the entire approach towards women with disabilities in MGNREGS is a faulty one. While not many women are aware about the nature of work meant for them under MGNREGS, getting to the work site and security remain the other concern areas. Their family members cannot always accompany them to the work site, she added. The meagre number of women with disabilities, who are coming forward to work under MGNREGS, are mostly employed in plantation work during monsoon.Visibility of women with disabilities in the employment guarantee schemes is negligent in districts like Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and some Western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Balangir and Nuapada.However, Joint Secretary in the Panchayati Raj Department, Bhumesh Behera said since MGNREGS is a demand driven programme, the department provides work to any differently-abled person including women who seek work. It always depends on their nature of disability. We have to also take into consideration that they cannot do all kinds of works, he said.Apparently, the Odisha Government does not yet have clear data on the number of women with disabilities getting 100 days' employment under the MGNREGS. The MIS (Management Information System) developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to keep a record of the workers does not include data on the number of such women taking part in the scheme, the Project Directors pointed out. Hence, it is difficult to find out if MGNREGS is actually helping women with disabilities or not, said an officer requesting anonymity.In fact, every livelihood programme being run by both Centre and State including the skill development and vocational training programmes, has no clarity or data on involvement of women with disabilities. Disability activists feel it is high time the government thinks of gender and disability audit in such schemes.In the absence of employment, women mostly depend on social security coverage. The State Government provides Rs 300 as pension to disabled people under the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana but the amount is too meagre in todays time. To avail the pension, they have to produce disability certificates. Ironically, no differently-abled woman has been provided a disability certificate since 2014. According to reports of Department of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, of 5.6 lakh differently-abled women in the State, only 41,929 women have received disability certificates so far, thereby denying the rest facilities like education, employment, pension, concession and other benefits. Unlike States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, Odisha Government does not provide unemployment assistance to people with disabilities.Sanyas Behera, president of Odisha Association of Blind and a visually-challenged activist who has been demanding consideration of a differently-abled person as one separate family unit when job cards are issued under MGNREGS, said there is no clear notification yet by the Odisha Government on the nature of work that can be done by differently-abled men and women even as the Union Government had circulated an order in 2008 regarding work that can be allotted to this category of the labour force. When jobs are being issued to a household, a differently-abled person is overlooked and an abled person in the family is provided the work. Due to gender discrimination, differently-abled women are entirely left out from this scheme,"" he said.Under the Odisha Livelihood Mission, some district administrations have taken the initiative of bringing together women with disabilities and form self-help groups that can churn out things like phenyl, agarbati, jute bags and eatables. However, Sanyas alleged that the number of such SHGs is too less and funds sanctioned by the Centre for vocational training of such women are returned unutilised every year. ""Sometimes, the authorities give equipment to these SHGs to produce articles without training them properly in a bid to complete their official reports. As a result, such SHGs do not survive for a long time,"" Sanyas added."

The Union labour ministry is planning to draw curtains on the British-era system of cash and kind wages for the plantation workers and make cash payments in their bank accounts mandatory. Under the Plantation Labour Act, 1951, the wages of plantation workers include cash besides ration, healthcare and education services (in kind).The daily wage of a plantation worker in Assam, with effect from January this year, is Rs.137. He or she is also entitled to 35 kgs of rice and wheat every month at subsidized 54 paise per kg. The workers are demanding that they be paid wages in the age-old across the table system. We staged the protests against the Centres anti-people policies, which have affected the tea garden workers in Assam. They have been receiving ration at subsidized rates for decades now but a conspiracy is being hatched to do away with the system, ACMS president and former Union Minister, Pawan Singh Ghatowar, told Express. The workers will not accept this. The government has to spell out if the money, to be transferred to the bank accounts of workers in lieu of ration, will be on a par with market prices, he said.The ACMS said the cashless system of payment of wages would make matters worse for the workers as they were mostly illiterate. Assam has some 850 tea estates with the number of workers (permanent and casual) estimated at around nine lakh. Together with their family members, some 25 lakh-30 lakh people are the beneficiaries of subsidized ration."

Artist Bara Bhaskaran has beautifully brought out the emotions of the subjects through a series of sketches arranged to imitate the look of a museum at the ongoing Kochi Muziris Biennale at Aspinwall House in Fort Kochi.Bhaskaran is a contemporary visual artist and a chronicler of subaltern histories. Born in Bara, a village in Kasaragod, he is now based in Kochi.I dont dwell on the architectural history.The ones represented by the monuments or buildings, but on local history. I am interested in people who have never found a mention in history, says Bhaskaran.He advances his narrative through a series of frames, each one comprising drawings and texts. While the drawings are chosen from his travel sketch-book, the texts are constructed from an assortment of historical sources and ethnographic observations, his own as well as those of others.My works are mostly based on Kerala history. They are mostly done in the form of a travelogue. I began this in 2000, says Bhaskaran.According to him, contemporary history is what matters. The lives, lifestyle and culture of the poor are the ones I try to portray in my landscapes, he says.Bhaskaran calls his installation the Amazing Museum. The installation begins with the portrait of four tribes. I obtained the material from old photographs published in a book brought out in 1911, he explains. The next frame has drawings from his sojourn in Bihar. Bihar is an historically important place. Gaya, the place where Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment, is located here. Magadha, which was ruled by Ashoka is also in Bihar. It is also the rice basket of the country.I have tried to highlight the plight of the those who form the lower strata of the society in the state, he says. The landscape on Bihar describes the constant struggle of those who live and farm along the coast of the Ganga, he says. Bhaskaran has brought out several books, too. My Kerala Chronicles: A visual travelogue, Mother Forest: The unfinished story of C K Janu and Adukala are a some of his works.

Maithilvasi, or Maithils, are the inhabitants of Maithil region in northern Bihar that borders Nepal. Out of the 10 lakh Biharis in Karnataka, two lakh are Maithils and some have been in the city for decades without a concrete committee to preserve their culture, says Rakesh Jha, founding member of the Maithilvasi.Rakesh was born and brought up in Bihar. He came to Bengaluru to work as a software architect ten years ago. I know my cluture, but what about my children? he asks, underlining the objective of the committee.The association had its first event organised on January 15 to mark the festival of Makar Sankranti, a harvest festival. Held at HAL auditorium hall, the first event saw the participation of over 1,000 Maithlis.The community came out in traditional wear comprising dhoti, kurta and Paaj, a traditional cap worn during weddings. These were imported for the occasion.We had imported 100 traditional attire, but little did we know thousands would attend, says Rakesh.Some of the community members were surprised to see the crowd because they were unaware of the Maithil population in the city. This happened because they had been living fragmented and isolated from their own community, he adds.Maithivasi plans to unify the Maithils, especially the younger generations to preserve the culture.The traditional food of the region was also imported for the event. This included, Tilgud sweets, made out of sesame seeds and jaggery. Flattened rice called Chiura, common in Maithil and Nepal region was also served in the festival celebration along with pakoras made of indigenous flowers.The seven-hour celebration saw cultural programmes accompanied by cultural songs and dance performances.Men came wearing Paag and women adorned Benrasi saree at the event that had no chief guest. The focus was on forming a bond in the community.Many Biharis in general and Maithils in particular come to Bengaluru seeking jobs. The community also plans to help the new migrants settle in the city and help them secure a job.The idea for the community was first perceived in November 22 in a general meeting and a sudden realisation that the community had to unite to save the losing culture, was awakened.This is true for all cultures in India and not just Maithils. Local cultures are dying and they need to be preserved, says Rakesh.The objective of the committee is to create a platform where Maithils can showcase their culture as well as preserve it.The next event the committee will host is Holi in February."

Sonny Perdue, his choice to lead the Agriculture Department, will ""deliver big results for all Americans who earn their living off the land.""Agriculture secretary was the final Cabinet post to be announced by Trump, who is set to take office Friday.Perdue, 70, is a farmer's son who built businesses in grain trading and trucking before becoming the first Republican governor of Georgia since Reconstruction.Perdue, from the small city of Bonaire in rural central Georgia, would be the first Southerner in the post in more than two decades. He is not related to or affiliated with the food company Perdue or the poultry producer Perdue Farms.""From growing up on a farm to being governor of a big agriculture state, he has spent his whole life understanding and solving the challenges our farmers face, and he is going to deliver big results for all Americans who earn their living off the land,"" Trump said in a statement.Perdue, in a statement released by Trump's transition team, said he began as ""a simple Georgia farm boy,"" and he pledged to ""champion the concerns of American agriculture and work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families.""Trump said at a pre-inauguration dinner in Washington on Thursday night that Perdue's farming background had elevated him above more ""politically correct"" candidates. Trump's Cabinet picks do not include a single Latino  the first time that's happened in nearly 30 years,Trump said he'd met with ""10 people that everybody liked. Politically correct. And I kept thinking back to Sonny Perdue, a great, great farmer. He loves the farms. Knows everything about farming. Knows everything about agriculture.""Agriculture secretaries are often from the Midwest, where corn and soybeans dominate the markets. U.S. farm policy has long been favorable to those crops, and congressional battles over massive farm bills every five years often divide along regional lines. Southerners have pushed for subsidy programs that are more favorable to rice and cotton, which can be more expensive to grow.The last three agriculture secretaries were from Iowa, North Dakota and Nebraska.Many farm-state lawmakers and agriculture groups grew concerned as Trump approached his inauguration without having named an agriculture secretary candidate. Earlier Thursday, Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley tweeted that he was frustrated with the process.""NEED Ag leader w dirt under finger nails 4farmers,"" he wrote.Perdue began his political career as a Democrat in the Georgia Legislature in the 1990s. After switching his allegiance to the Republican Party, he was elected governor in 2002. The victory over an incumbent Democrat completed Georgia's shift to a solidly Republican state, ending generations of Democratic control of state government.Despite that political change, Perdue showed little interest in pushing big programs or signature legislation during his two terms. Instead he focused on finding ways to save money while improving customer service by state agencies. He often referred to himself as Georgia's CEO.Critics accused Perdue of failing to tackle some of Georgia's biggest problems, such as struggling public schools.Perdue, who was re-elected in 2006, didn't rely only on his business acumen as governor. A devout Southern Baptist, he also found a place for faith in his administration. In 2007, when a withering drought gripped Georgia and neighboring states, he held a prayer rally in front of the Capitol in Atlanta to pray for rain.Perdue brought an end to Georgia's conflicts over a state flag that featured the Confederate battle emblem. The flag was replaced by lawmakers under Perdue's Democratic predecessor, but the new design proved unpopular. Perdue insisted Georgia voters should pick the flag. A referendum was held in 2004, though Southern heritage groups were outraged that the options did not include the old flag with the Confederate symbol.Under Perdue's watch, Georgia adopted tough food-safety regulations after a deadly U.S. salmonella outbreak was traced to Georgia-made peanut butter. He moved the state office that issues water permits for irrigation and other agricultural uses from Atlanta to rural south Georgia, where it would be closer to farmers. Perdue poured millions of state dollars into Go Fish, a program that aimed to lure bass fishing tournaments to the state.The ex-governor, whose full name is George Ervin Perdue III, was born in rural Perry, Georgia. He attended the University of Georgia, where he played football as a walk-on and earned a doctorate in veterinary medicine. Following a stint in the Air Force, he returned to Georgia and settled in Bonaire, a city of about 14,000 people.Perdue already has family serving in Washington. A cousin, former Dollar General CEO David Perdue of Sea Island, Georgia, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014."

Uncontrolled sand mining and waste disposal are the major threats faced by water bodies, he said. Pinarayi was speaking after presenting the Green Humanist Award instituted by Australias multilingual newspaper Indian Times to former Forest Minister Benoy Viswom.The Chief Minister urged the public and NGOs to support the water conservation and the waste management programmes being planned by the government. The government also aims to increase rice and vegetable production, he said. Poet Sugathakumari said Benoy Viswom was quite eligible for the honour.He had a glorious stint as Forest Minister during which 55,000 acres of land was added to reserve forests, the Neelakurinji sanctuary was formed and tree conservation committees were formed for urban areas, she said.In his reply, Viswom opined that all those concerned about future should take a stand on environment conservation before it was too late. Development is futile if it cannot ensure water availability. Capitalist development model brings only temporary gains, he said."

Certain varieties have gone past Rs 50 per kg. Great time to be a paddy farmer? Well, the farmers are getting a meagre Rs 23 a kg!At the other end of the chain, the consumer is feeling the pinch and the government is feeling the heat. But laughing all the way to the bank are private companies, with a killing difference of Rs 27 a kg between the starting point and the finishing point.So why arent the farmers benefiting from the high prices? The Supplyco has to take some of the blame, feel experts. For the government agency is procuring paddy from farmers at Rs 22.50 a kg while astute private players do at Rs 23.Considering the prevailing market situation, A G Abdul Kareem, Principal Agricultural Officer, Alappuzha, told Express paddy can be procured from farmers at Rs 30-32 per kg as there is already a dip in production in the state owing to drought. For now, though, private players seem to be making a windfall as there is no proper mechanism to offer farmers better prices.Kochu Mohammed, Thrissur Kole Karshaka Samithy president said most farmers in the Ponnani kole fields are selling paddy to private players like Nirapara who offer a better price, even if by just 50 paise per kg.Another factor is prompt payment.While farmers have to wait a few months to get payment from Supplyco, private companies do it without much delay, he said.U Jaikumaran, head, Agriculture Research Station, Mannuthy, said the farmers are still leading a hand-to-mouth existence even after producing paddy challenging the odds, including adverse weather and other farm-related issues.The middlemen in the trade circle are reaping huge profits. It is high time the existing paddy farmers producer companies are strengthened. The farmers would then get the benefit of the fluctuating prices. Besides, they can insulate themselves from middlemen by producing and marketing rice and value-added products, he said.The farmers producer company in Adattu, Thrissur has started procuring Jyothi variety of rice at Rs 25 per kg on an experimental basis.Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman informed the Assembly Supplyco has procured - at a price of Rs 22.50 per kg - 1.86 lakh tonnes of paddy from 52,648 farmers from September 29 to December 31, 2016. The figure between January 1 and February 20, 2017, stood at 2.08 lakh tonnes from 61,477 farmers.The government has given a sum of Rs 401.34 crore as the price for procured paddy to farmers, with arrears of Rs 58.13 crore pending, he said. The Supplyco procures an average of 5.5 lakh tonnes of rice in a year from 1.5 lakh paddy farmers."

In September 2016, Express had reported that SayTrees had used the same technique to plant 2,000 saplings near K R Puram Railway station. This is the second time SayTrees has used this technique and also happens to be the highest number of saplings they have planted in a day.The 2,000 saplings planted earlier have recorded a stunning growth rate, according to Durgesh Agrahari, head of partnerships and projects at SayTrees Environmental Trust. He said, We were amazed to see that in five months the saplings had grown from 2-3 feet to 6-8 feet. The trees are being maintained by the trust and only treated sewage water is used to water them. In addition, such forests become self-sustainable in two years, as opposed to the six years it takes for naturally grown forests.Saplings of 48 species of trees were planted, including neem, banyan, peepal, jamun, mango, guava, sandalwood and gooseberry. The soil was tested and a microclimate was created by mixing it with rice husk, coconut powder and manure.SayTrees conducts several tree-planting initiatives during the monsoon across the country. In 2016, they planted a total of 35,000 saplings between June and September, of which 17,304 were in Bengaluru itself. The trust has finalised a plan to plant 50,000 saplings at Chintamani in Kolar district around July. The saplings for this initiative are being raised. A consulting firm, Afforestt, is making the Miyawaki technique popular in the country."

UBS declined to comment.Smart meter makers have seen a wave of M&A activity, with three major manufacturers up for sale in Germany alone, highlighting their significance as the energy industry goes digital and depends on live consumption data to a much greater extent.Landis+Gyr, in which Toshiba owns a 60 percent stake, employs more than 5,700 staff and is active in over 30 countries. It said last week that sales would grow by nearly 5 percent to $1.64 billion in the fiscal year ending this month, adding it was ""unaffected by Toshiba's challenges"".Toshiba announced a $6.3 billion writedown on its U.S. nuclear business last month, wiping out its shareholder equity and causing it to seek divestments to create a buffer for any fresh financial problems.It is expected to approach buyout groups including CVC, Cinven, Advent, KKR, Blackstone, Onex and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice as potential buyers of Landis+Gyr, one of the sources said, adding that industrial conglomerates were not expected to enter the fray.Toshiba bought Landis+Gyr in 2011 for $2.3 billion jointly with state-backed Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ), which holds the remaining 40 percent in the company.The deal would value Landis+Gyr at 10-11 times its annual core earnings (EBITDA), two of the people said, in line with the 10.7 times that U.S. water technology company Xylem paid for Sensus USA Inc last year.Toshiba will try to position Landis+Gyr as a Swiss industrial group, hoping to reach EBITDA multiples similar to those of Geberit, Sulzer or Belimo, which trade at between 12-19 times."

The PACS have been asked to procure rice from Consumerfed depots. The rice being procured from West Bengal will cost Rs 27 for the cooperative societies. But the cooperatives will sell it at Rs 25 to economically weaker sections, he said.The Rs 100 crore-consortium set up by the Consumerfed and cooperative societies has given orders for 2,500 tonnes of Suvarna rice from West Bengal. Of this, 800 tonnes has already reached the state and is ready for distribution. The remaining 1,700 tonnes will be ready for distribution by March 10.The Minister said cooperative societies with prior experience in the sale of rice and essential items have been selected for the market intervention. The focus will be on the coastal belt and hilly regions where the price rise has affected people the most. Five kg of rice will be given to each family in the initial phase and the same will be increased to 10 kg per week. It will continue until the prices come down in the open market, the minister said.Surendran said it was the handiwork of a group of Kollam-based rice agents who consistently work towards unrealistic price rise in the domestic market.The consortium members went to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The unprecedented summer has led to price rise of brands like Jaya. The price of original Jaya rice per kg in Karnataka is Rs 36. It was in this background that the team went to West Bengal and identified Survarna rice, which is almost similar to rice varieties popular in Kerala, he said."

Kiran Bedi did them one better by saying we dont need no politician.During an open and outspoken session at TNIEs ThinkEdu Conclave, the education activist, former top cop and the incumbent Puducherry Lieutenant Governor said that what we really needed was more leaders and not politicians. This country is creating more politicians than community leaders. We need more community leaders at the grassroots. Politicians are not what we really need because all they do is divide and rule, she saidGautami Tadimalla, actor and activist, agreed and added, The strength behind a youngsters voice is incredible, and urged them to bridge the unforgivable gap between rural and urban education.During the last few months in Puducherry, Bedi has been locked in a tussle with Puducherrys Chief Minister V Narayanasamy over clearing files to implement the governments welfare agenda. Perhaps this, combined with the freebie culture that Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have been faulted for, are what prompted Bedi to speak out harshly. We need people who do not create dependence, but push for self-reliance. Thats why people are waiting with a bowl. Giving free rice and free this and free that is fine, but why give it to people who dont need it and make them dependent?Gautami took this opportunity to frame the new definition of education: Education has to be something imparting information and empowering children with intellectual means to process that information to finally make it knowledge by themselves, she said. And in order to do this, the focus needs to be on the curriculum.During the question hour, a student asked Bedi for tips to clear the UPSC exam, Bedi continued in the same vein, telling her point blank, Aspire for a position to serve, not occupy. If thats in your DNA, the country will benefit. If you dont, youre a burden on the taxpayer. So make that choice, she said to applause.She went on to add, Your intention is the key. Always follow the rules. It is not red tape. You need to interpret it correctly and to do that your intention is important. And Gautami, who considers Bedi as the epitome of leadership, reemphasized this by citing Bedis example of how the former IPS officer still refers to her IPS manuals when caught in a conflict."

Alkiya Tanveer, an ayurveda cooking instructor at Fort Kochi, recommends it to all her students who arrive at her cooking class. It is very common in Kerala to use a lot of spices including chilli and coriander leaves. I avoid this in our ayurveda way of cooking. In my classes, chicken is prepared using less oil, turmeric, green cardomam and fennel seeds alone, says Himalaya-born Alkiya.Alkiya hails from a family where it is tradition for mothers to teach ayurveda cooking to their daughters.  In the Himalayas, where I hail from, ayurveda is a way of life. Our food habits and lifestyle are influenced in many ways by this ancient medicine system, says the Ayurveda cooking instructor. So much was her passion, that she decided to start her own cooking class in Kochi. Today, she runs morning and evening session classes at a small classroom in Fort Kochi. According to her, though Kerala is the hotbed of ayurveda, its cooking methods are not given much due. Now, everyone wants to cook variety food and prepare exotic dishes. Based on this demand, there are a large number of cooking classes on offer in Kochi. I am not saying that is a bad trend. On the side, however, we need to retain the rich and healthy traditional methods offered through ayurveda, she says. Alikyas husband who runs a textile store in Kochi also hails from Kashmir.Most of those who arrive for Alkiyas classes are foreigners.  Many of them arrive here since they want to learn how to cook food which is made minimally but very healthy. Most of them are middle-aged and want to cut down on their eating habits such as fast food which they are very accustomed to. The classes are two hours long. They spend one and a half hours learning to cook and the other half, savouring it, Alkiya adds. During the class, Alkiya teaches her students to prepare three to four dishes.  The foreigners insist they need to learn how to make chapathi. They find it very healthy, she adds.Alkiya advocates eating ayurveda food sitting on the floor.  When you prepare food using ayurveda ingredients, it is essential that you sit on the floor and eat. It has a therapeutic effect. Also, dont slouch while you eat. It helps digestion when you sit with you back upright, she adds.One of Alkiyas favourite preparations is the sponge gourd (peechinga), which is a source of several vitamins.  Peel the skin and cut them into little pieces. Saute it in very little oil and add turmeric, cumin seeds, garlic, green chilli and salt. After some time, it becomes very frothy. Add little water, boil it for some time and then switch off the flame. This is very tasty with both rice and chapathi. Apart from taste, this is very useful in healing wounds and also good for the stomach, she says."

The minister speaking further said that the Constitution of India respects the right of women' dignity and triple talaq in that way is unconstitutional.Kambala is a traditional sport, mainly held in rural Karnataka between two pairs of buffaloes controlled by their farmer in wet rice fields filled with slush and mud.The victory of Jallikattu in Tamil Nadu has now brought back with great fervour the demand for the sport, which was banned in November 2014 in Karnataka."

Only problem was he named Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam.Far from doing a Jallikattu on Vijayan, Paswan was actually wanting to help the Kerala CM -- an old acquaintance from UF days. Presumably, the mixup -- an inadvertent mistake -- was the result of theTamil Nadu CM being in news thanks to the fierce bull run and the youth uprising thereof.Well, the meeting was of a serious import, and the Kerala CM took the gaffe like a good sport, with a brush of hand, without any invocation of pride. His focus was more on the allocation of rice andsubsidised sugar for distribution among migrant workers and welfare institutions.In his meeting, Vijayan also asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, under which foodgrains have tobe made available to the poor at a subsidised rate of Rs 1-3 per kg via public distribution system, Kerala is in need of a higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting. Sources said, the Kerala Chief Minister's basic demand was that his state foodgrains supply for PDS supply should, at least, be restored to the level of pre-NFSA days.While under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, it used to get 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.There was a bit of hand wringing on the part of the Union Food Minister, who pointed that the Centre has adopted a uniform for all states while allocating foodgrains.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is beinggiven to protect poor people, a Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. And that's beyond the policy of the Centre.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to the entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for parboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded to up the foodgrains allocation to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from the existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has sought central support tomake extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months."

The term from Hindustani language means traditions. Talk about the colourful traditions of couture and cuisine of India. Talk about much-remembered dishes from Awadh, Dilli, Punjab and Hyderabad. Its at a food festival that you can relish all at the same table. Rivayaat, the food festival, by Trident Hyderabad at its restaurant Kanak is highlighting authentic recipes from different parts of the country.Noteworthy about the food promotion is that none of dishes are overpowered by spices or oil. The taste is balanced much like ghar ka khana that makes you feel asking for that extra helping of Punjabi Matar Pulao. The rice was done with butter and crushed fried onions. It tasted well with Puran Singh Ke Dhabe Wali Chicken Curry. The curries served had neither too thick nor too thin gravy. Mahi Kaliya  a preparation of bekti fish of Bengal was prepared in onion and tamarind gravy along with other spices. The result was a succulent and juicy fish piece.The Lucknowi Dal served along side the rice was roasted and then cooked which gave it a smoky flavour and home-like taste. Baigan Ka Bharta was simple as was Sarson Ka Saag which we enjoyed with Makke ki Roti. In the appetizers you must not miss Kumbh Ki Gilavat as its quite a challenge to find out that its not a mutton kebab, but is made from mushrooms. The taste is as good as the mutton kebab that dissolves in mouth. The festival is on till January 25. Time: 7 pm  11:30 pm. Charges: for the set menu is `2,100+ per head"

The fishing hamlet instantly switched into a mode of frenzy as people on streets run back their home, shoving their children inside and bolting the doors.The residents peep into the streets from the little windows or holes in their house. It takes a while before they breathe easy again, after being certain it was a false alarm.Nadukuppam, a fishing hamlet on Lloyds Road, was a seemingly innocent victim to the clashes between police and the public. The residents who wanted to go fishing on Monday morning were denied access by the police.People alleged that the police harassed even innocent people because of what people asserted was a personal vendetta. They found the chance when protesters from the Marina, who were being chased found refuge in the slum, claim aggrieved residents.Abirami Raji*, an eight-year-old girl slowly steps out of her with a panic-stricken face after the false alarm. Tears roll down her cheeks. Her father was allegedly beaten up and hauled away by the police from the Light House metro station.1) The Nadukuppam fish market which was burnt down; 2) an inconsolable resident of the slum, who was injured in the violence; 3) charred remains of fish in the Nadukuppam market; 4) a resident of the slum sporting neem-and-tamarind paste on his injured legs; 5) another resident showing welts on his back;6) a resident who was attacked during the scuffle; 7) charred remains of vehicles, near the City Centre Mall in the city on Tuesday | ASHWIN PRASATHShe joins the parade of people who hesitantly walk toward the fish market that was burned down on Monday. The police walked off. Theyre not coming to our kuppam, announces an elderly man standing amid the markets charred debris. He sends a wave of relief across the hamlet with that message.I was standing near the ration shop on 8th Street. I was wearing a black shirt. The shirt was torn like paper and I wasnt treated any better, says Srirajan, a resident. He points to swollen legs and shoulders and back that are marked by blood clots.I was beaten, dragged to the streets end and dumped into a white van in which women police were eating. They beat me more, stamped me with their shoes and dumped me near the lighthouse.Nesam K, a 55-year old woman, lifts her saree to show a swollen leg on which she applied turmeric paste.Among them is a 31-year-old woman who cries for a different reason. Neither I, nor my husband was at home. We came back to find our whole house upside-down, she says.Her husband Kirubakaran walks to his house and carries the wooden door thats completely come off its hinges. Inside their little house, the washing machine has toppled with clothes strewn all around the 8x8 living room, the rice pot had spilt on the floor, their table fan stood broken and almost every object was misplaced. Our house was locked. Why would they break into it? she asked.While house-doors and windows were damaged causing severe loss, the major fire that destroyed their market and vehicles has caused immense loss to the fishing community.Behind Maniamma* (81) is a cart filled with about 50 kgs of burnt onions. The women police used powder, and the gents used diesel and tear-gas shell, she says. The woman police sprayed a white-coloured powder on the floor and the circle immediately caught fire.They threw this powder through the market. Thats how my onion cart caught fire, she wails. White phosphorus, on exposure to air, catches fire immediately. It only requires 30 degrees Centigrade to burn. It produces intense smoke which masks the origin of the fire.Sivagami A* adds, Nearly 200 fish vendors sell in this market. The women police used that powder to burn this and then took this fire and lit that auto. Then they used this fire to burn two more autos, one van and a car. She adds that a cloth dipped in diesel was wrapped around a stick to set their vehicles on fire. Others agreed wholeheartedly.Divya, who also used to sell fish in the burnt market pulls out a gunny bag from behind her and produces four objects. One might tell me that we threw this stone, But did we use this broken lathi? Did we burn these tear-gas shells? Did we use these black rubber bullets? she asks as she produces one object after another.*Names changed"

Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy and KPCC president V M Sudheeran led the protests at Ernakulam and Alappuzha, respectively. The surge and ire of teaming activists at other centres turned out to be a notable stir, according to reports. Chandy, Sudheeran and other leaders courted arrest.Inaugurating the picketing in front of the Secretariat, Ramesh Chennithala said time has come for the UDF to take upon both the Modi and LDF Governments in the same vein.People are virtually pushed to the brim after demonetisation and denial of ration supplies. Days are not far away for the Pinarayi Government when the people are going to confront it in the streets for denying rice and remaining unmoved to ensure potable water supplies in the drought spell which is fast gripping the state, he said. A pathetic situation has come to stay through an administrative standstill and denial of benefits to the needy sections of the people, Chennithala said.The country has been pulled back by at least ten years. Every citizen is passing through hell as he cannot withdraw his earnings deposited in banks. Modi seems to have totally forgotten that he had resorted to demonetisation and people are suffering even after his 50 days cut-off. The states cooperative sector has been shattered. People have even stopped sending money from abroad to their homes, he said."

They arent able to supply the rice varieties even at a higher price, said Hari Sharma of Lalitha Mills, a leading rice dealer. He attributed the shortage during the season to the sale of rice by Andhra rice merchants to the Food Corporation of India (FCI).The state consumes about 38-40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum and Jaya and Surekha varieties account for at least 22 lakh tonnes of the total consumption.The reason for the shortage in Andhra Pradesh could be the drought conditions prevailing in the region, or an artificial scarcity created to jack up the prices, reckoned S Leena Kumari, project co-coordinator (Rice), Rice Research Station, Moncompu, Kerala Agriculture University.The prices of the two varieties, which lingered around Rs 26-27/kg range during Onam last year (September), has spiralled, touching Rs 38/kg.While Jaya variety is preferred in the southern parts of the state from Alappuzha to Thiruvananthapuram, Surekha is the most sought after variety in Ernakulam and surrounding areas. Hari Sharma said there was sufficient supply of other grades of rice such as Kuruva, Swarna and Cherumani which are priced lower at Rs 23-24/kg.We can supply as much of Swarna rice as we want, but theres not much demand for the variety, he said. Swarna is sourced from West Bengal. People in north Kerala have cultivated the taste for Kuruva and Kranti rice varieties, he said.C S Saresh of SA Enterprises, a rice dealer, said a major reason for the increase in prices is the increase in transportation costs. The lorry charges have escalated from Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.09 lakh in the last two months as the return trip carrying plywood from Kerala has come to a halt, said another dealer."

REUTERSOrdering a bottle of Corona beer at a bar in the United States is a simple proposition.Getting it there from its brewery in Mexico involves a complex, cross-border supply network that will likely get more complicated if U.S. president Donald Trump follows through on vows to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or tax imports.Trump has not outlined specific plans for revising NAFTA, but he has made repeated calls for a levy to discourage companies from moving jobs outside the United States. On Thursday, the White House floated a plan to impose a 20 percent tax on imports. Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives have included a tax on imports in their blueprint for overhauling corporate taxes.The ideas have met opposition in Congress, even inside Trump's own party. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, a republican from South Carolina, took to Twitter on Thursday, saying ""Simply put, any policy proposal which drives up costs of Corona, tequila, or margaritas is a big-time bad idea. Mucho Sad.""Trump's rhetoric has also heightened uncertainty over the billions in supply chain and infrastructure investment that a diverse array of companies from automakers and railroads to appliance makers and food producers have made on both side of the U.S.-Mexico border during the past two decades.The stakes are high for brands like Corona, which is entirely brewed in Mexico, and the transport companies such as Union Pacific Corp that make money moving the beer's raw ingredients and packaging into Mexico, and bringing the finished brew back to the United States.Victor, New York-based Constellation Brands Inc, which owns the U.S. rights to Corona, plans to spend $2.5 billion to expand an existing brewery in Nava, just south of the border with Texas and $2 billion on a new brewery in Mexicali by 2021.Just days before the November 8 U.S. election, the company said it would buy a Mexican brewery from Grupo Modelo for $600 million and expand its operations in the country.To qualify as a Mexican beer, Constellation's beer brands must be made in Mexico. However, about 40 percent of the cost of the company's Mexican beers are tied to ingredients, supplies and freight services that come from the United States, said David Klein, Constellation's chief financial officer during a conference call earlier this month.The company - which has seen its market valuation triple to nearly $30 billion since 2013 when it obtained rights to sell Corona and other Mexican beer brands - imports hops, barley and other grains from the United States to brew Corona. The company does not disclose the specific origin of ingredients.""The majority of our glass bottle supply comes from the glass plant at the Nava brewery and other Mexico suppliers. We source less than 20 percent of our glass bottles from the United States. Some raw materials, including hops and grains to brew the beer, do come from the United States,"" Constellation said in a statement.Farms in the Midwestern and Northwestern United States are major growers of barley in North America, and in 2015 Mexico was the world's largest importer of U.S. barley. Since 2010, Mexico has been either the world's largest importer of U.S. hops or second just behind the United Kingdom.Unraveling the NAFTA supply chains of companies such as Constellation, or the big automakers, would lead to higher prices for consumer goods, experts and industry executives say.""Everyone would lose, especially the consumer, it's that simple,"" said Brandon Stallard, CEO of Troy, Michigan-based TPS Logistics, which handles tens of thousands of cross-border shipments for customers daily.U.S. companies also benefit from Corona production. Perrysburg, Ohio-based glass maker Owens-Illinois formed a joint venture with Constellation to expand a glass bottle plant next to the Nava brewery and subsequently bought a major Mexican glass bottle producer to meet demand. Owens-Illinois declined to comment on where its raw materials come from.Broomfield, Colorado-based Ball Corp is building a plant in Mexicali to make cans for Constellation's new brewery.Constellation says it imports almost 20 percent of its glass bottles from the United States. The company did not say where those bottles come from, but Lance Fritz, chief executive of No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific often cites the example of glass bottles the company hauls from a plant in Texas to a brewery in Mexico and that those bottles are made from recycled glass Union Pacific hauls from all over America.The railroad has also invested $40 million in cleaning, washing and repair facility for beer-carrying box-cars just north of Constellation's Nava brewery. Union Pacific hauls U.S. barley, malt and rice for brewing.""The job we have at hand is to help our elected officials see the world from our perspective and then pray for them to make the right decision,"" said Fritz."

One such restaurant is Yauatcha, a Chinese dim sum teahouse, located on the top floor of 1 MG Road Mall.The restaurant has two exclusive menus, the Signature menu and the Supreme Selection menu. However, the only new dish on it is the King Crab and Scallop Dumpling, which does not disappoint. It is perhaps the highlight of all the 25 dishes.Minced crab, minced scallop and minced asparagus is delightfully draped in vibrant red dough. The dumpling that feels heavy on the chopstick is fatly filled and topped with veg caviar. The bursting taste of the sea is a sheer delight for a seafood lover like me. The minced meat easily melts in the mouth and the aftertaste lingers for a while.First we were served the Prawn Salad with Raw Mango. The tangy flavor of lemongrass sauce, the salty flavor of fish sauce, the sourness of the raw diced mangoes, the sweetness of the pomegranates and the freshness of the lettuce make for a refreshing starter. This is a dish you can enjoy on a sunny day sitting in the garden or even on a gloomy day when you want some colour on the plate. The crunchy veggies bursting with loud flavours harmoniously blends with meaty prawns. The taste seems a bit like Kimchi with fresh ingredients.The vegetarian dumpling of truffle and edamame is served next. The restaurant that is said to do equal justice to the vegetarian cuisine fails to impress me with the dish. It feels rubbery and the amalgamation of truffle and edamame isnt my favorite either. The musky truffle flavour with minced soybean tastes like health diet, one I wouldnt indulge in for festivals. The veggies minced too finely and the dish has an unfamiliar smell, and unlike crab dumpling this does melt easily in the mouth. However, scrumptious Mushroom Roll with Truffle and Spicy Vegetable Poached Peking Dumpling make up for the let down.The other dumplings such as the purple-colour Chicken Coriander Dumpling is one of the usual signature dishes from the restaurant, which need no occasion to relish. Sesame Prawn Toast is garlic bread topped with prawn and sesame seed and deep fried, and is a crunchy feast. The juicy prawns and crispy bread with toasted sesame seed is an easy bite.The main course brought to the table has Egg Fried Rice garnished with spring onions, Spicy Wild Prawns curry garnished with king chilli, Hofan Noodles that is flat noodles served with duck meat and bean sprouts and Szechuan Mabo Tofu tossed with oyster sauce. The Egg Fried Rice and Hofan Noodles are the usual. Tofu is soft and fragile, with the Manchurian taste dominant and the prawns a burst of curry leaf flavor.The double-shake Black River Martini has whiskey, drambuie, egg white, blackberries, apricot and apple juice. This red-coloured drink keeps my New Year feast festive. The revamped desserts are served last, they are a visual delight. The golden colour Luxe Gateau made of chocolate, red wine, cream and caramel looks like Cinderella ready to go for the ball. The taste is as refined as it looks.The idea of the festival menu is to celebrate the colour red.Approzimate cost for two- ` 2,100"

Chennai and other parts of the coastal districts received reasonable overnight rain in the last 24 hours. It brought down the day time mercury levels.The chief amounts of rainfall recorded at 8.30 am on Friday shows that Neyveli AWS (Cuddalore district) got the maximum rainfall of 10 cm, while Parangipettai and Sethiathope in Cudddalore got 9 cm and 8 cm of rain.Thiruvidaimaruthur and Kumbakonam (Thanjavur district) got 7 cm each.The rainfall was expected to intensify on Saturday. In view of this, agricultural meteorology division issued district-wise advisories for the benefit of farmers. The met officials said all nine agro climatic zones in the State were likely to get heavy to scattered rainfall.The advisory had been issued to farmers in Ariyalur, Karur, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Perambalur, Thiruchirappalli cultivating rice, black gram, sugarcane and cotton stages.Since light to moderate rainfall is expected in the next few days, the harvest of the matured samba paddy can be taken up with care. Provide adequate drainage facilities to drain the excess rainwater present in the paddy and rice fallow pulse fields to improve better aeration in the roots.Treat the pulse seeds with talc formulation of bio control agent Trichoderma viride @ 4g/kg of seed or Pseudomonas flurescens @ 10g/kg seed to control seed borne diseases, the advisory to the farmers read.The poultry farmers were advised to be cautious in raising feed ingredient; and high consumption warranted attention to feed quality. Officials said that as the day and night temperature would be low because of heavy weather, there would be an increase in feed intake by poultry birds. So, farmers were asked to test the feed ingredients before using them as poultry feed."

The honour was for the highest yield under the System of Rice Intensification method. The award carries `5 lakh and a medal.K SankaranarayananTalking to Express, Sankaranarayanan pointed out that at present, farmers were not able to fix prices for their own agricultural produce and after implementation of MGNREGS, scarcity of farm labourers had gone up manifold.As a result, farmers had to give higher wages for labourers. Ultimately, the farmer is the sufferer and this could be overcome by adopting integrated farming where apart from paddy, other crops can also be cultivated. Sankaranarayanan owns six acres.Explaining the methods used to get the highest yield of 19,705 kg of paddy per hectare between October 2015 and March 2016, he said, I maximised use of organic farming while minimising use of chemicals."

Both Ola and Uber were once considered a goldmine by the drivers because of the high incentives they promised. But drivers said their fortunes had now changed completely for the worse.Almost every Ola and Uber cab driver in the protest had a similar story of unpaid loans, which they had taken believing that the initial windfall income from these aggregators would last.M Karthik (48), a disillusioned driver, said, We have gone from eating biriyani at first to rice and then finally porridge (kanji). How did this happen? Karthik, a former driver with a travel agency, said he joined Ola about two years ago after a stint with Fast Track, which incidentally is the homegrown competitor for both Ola and Uber.While now we are struggling to earn Rs 1,000, there was a time when the profit was Rs 2,500 a day after deducting all expenses, Karthik told Express. When calculated, the monthly income for drivers like Karthik was Rs 75,000 a month, which is what gave wings to their dreams. While some were emboldened to buy their own cars, a majority were delighted that supporting their families would not prove to be an issue anymore.S Balaji, who joined Ola in 2015, was one of those who felt brave to buy his own car. After observing a steady rise in his income, at one point earning as much as Rs 20,000 a week, he went to a showroom in Adyar. The upturn made me buy my own car, a Swift Dzire, paying a monthly Rs 18,000 as dues, he said. But today, Balaji claims he had not paid the dues for the last four months and was being hounded by regular calls from the banks.Joining him, B Murali, the sole breadwinner for his family of five, said he had to pawn his wifes thali (wedding chain) to pay last months car due. Having joined Uber about nine months back, Murali said, The first few months were a delight.We made reasonable money without much pressure. But now, we have to slog for close to 18 hours a day to make our ends meet.The problem drivers identified was the frequent drop in incentives and the infeasible fare structure. The public might revel at the cheap rides and the firms might be cornering the market, but they are doing so at the expense of our mental and physical well being. Even autos charge more, Balaji said."

She went on to perform for 13 years as the lead dancer in the Kalakshetra dance company, touring the world under the direction of Rukmini Devi.This show highlights memories with textile, Stella tells me when I ask her for the motivation behind the piece. The motifs on a South Indian sari  the flora and the fauna  are all present in music and dance too. The interconnectedness is obvious. The inside of the mind and the outside of the body are intertwined.Born and raised in Michigan, Justin moved to India 37 years ago. A disciple of renowned Bharathanatyam dancer, Leela Samson, he relinquished his American citizenship to become an Indian. Based in Delhi, Justin performs across the world and also teaches dance and music.This show reminds me of what initially attracted me to India  the fascination that I had for this single piece of cloth that doesnt have to be stitched, that can serve so many purposes.I love the sari and the dhoti. I remember first looking at Rukmini Devis Vasantha Valli sari, a beautiful mustard sari with parrots on it. That was more than 30 years ago, and I still remember its beauty.This is the fourth time that Justin and Stella are working together. We really enjoy collaborating, says Justin. Both Stella and I dont stick to what is happening in the world of mainstream Bharathanatyam  we are always striving to go beyond it. We are fellow anarchists and she is a kindred spirit, he laughs.We dont believe in hierarchy in dance, Stella affirms. We are bound together by our desire to critically engage in our work. We carry colonial history in our mind, body and everything. We need to engage in critical analysis through art. This doesnt mean taking a side, but it means finding connections.Justins and Stellas trajectories, while very similar in terms of their shared love for dance and the importance of critical dialogue within the art form, have taken them to different parts of the world. But collaborations such as these bring them together, and both of them speak at least three to four languages each, creating connections wherever they are.Any move challenges you, Stella tells me. When I moved to the UK, I didnt want to work in a cultural context. For me, dance should be dance and not a source of cultural identity. It should be something I can take anywhere and share with anybody.Yes, we use the text, the tunes and the philosophy that are rooted in cultural history, but that should not overshadow the dance itself.Home for Justin is India, but he does miss his family back in the US. But I see them often, he says, smiling. I know Im Indian because comfort food for me is hot rice and ghee. Though I have to say, he pauses, someone introduced me to hot rice and coconut oil today; it was just delicious."

Both Ola and Uber were once considered a goldmine by the drivers because of the high incentives they promised. But drivers said their fortunes had now changed completely for the worse.Almost every Ola and Uber cab driver in the protest had a similar story of unpaid loans, which they had taken believing that the initial windfall income from these aggregators would last.M Karthik (48), a disillusioned driver, said, We have gone from eating biriyani at first to rice and then finally porridge (kanji). How did this happen? Karthik, a former driver with a travel agency, said he joined Ola about two years ago after a stint with Fast Track, which incidentally is the homegrown competitor for both Ola and Uber.While now we are struggling to earn Rs 1,000, there was a time when the profit was Rs 2,500 a day after deducting all expenses, Karthik told Express. When calculated, the monthly income for drivers like Karthik was Rs 75,000 a month, which is what gave wings to their dreams. While some were emboldened to buy their own cars, a majority were delighted that supporting their families would not prove to be an issue anymore.S Balaji, who joined Ola in 2015, was one of those who felt brave to buy his own car. After observing a steady rise in his income, at one point earning as much as Rs 20,000 a week, he went to a showroom in Adyar. The upturn made me buy my own car, a Swift Dzire, paying a monthly Rs 18,000 as dues, he said. But today, Balaji claims he had not paid the dues for the last four months and was being hounded by regular calls from the banks.Joining him, B Murali, the sole breadwinner for his family of five, said he had to pawn his wifes thali (wedding chain) to pay last months car due. Having joined Uber about nine months back, Murali said, The first few months were a delight.We made reasonable money without much pressure. But now, we have to slog for close to 18 hours a day to make our ends meet.The problem drivers identified was the frequent drop in incentives and the infeasible fare structure. The public might revel at the cheap rides and the firms might be cornering the market, but they are doing so at the expense of our mental and physical well being. Even autos charge more, Balaji said."

Apart from the food poisoning angle, the police are expected to investigate the angle of a feud between former school principal Ravi Arasikere, who was ousted from the school sometime ago and owners K S Kiran Kumar and his wife Kavitha.After eating rice with sambhar around 9 pm on Wednesday, Aakanksha Pallakki (16) and Shanthamurthy of Class 10 and Shreyas (14) of Class 8 complained of uneasiness.Another student Sudarshan, studying in Class 8 and security guard Ramesh also showed similar symptoms and are undergoing treatment at the district general hospital here.There were 30 students in the boarding school and the remaining 26 students had eaten chapathi that night. They did not complain about any problems. So, the curry which the victims consumed was seemingly the culprit and suspicion of it being laced with poison by outsiders has been raised.Superintendent of Police Isha Pant who visited the school and inspected every nook and corner. clarified that the police will also probe the conspiracy angle and CCTV footages of the school have been collected.The trio were brought dead to the hospital around 4 am on Thursday and its clear that so much of time had lapsed by then without treatment, she added."

A Bengaluru youngster, after a personal tragedy, visited the Syrian border to help the refugees and he shares with City Express the tale of seeing god amidst the chaos. It was in their smile, says V Sai Prasad.How it all beganV Sai Prasad near the Syrian Border ata camp located near the city ofMafraq| Express PhotoBorn in Chennai and residing in Jeevan Bima Nagar, the 22-year-old was studying in Bengalurus Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning. Sai Prasad was diagnosed with a heart problem, Atrial Tachycardia, in 2013 and had to drop out from his second year of BCom. He then finished his graduation from home. In 2015, Sai suffered from stroke and had lost his speech and the ability to walk.It was then that he started reading newspapers and magazines and became aware of the Syrian crisis and the plight of refugees. When he got better and was able to walk and talk again, he decided to backpack a solo trip to the Middle East in January 2016. He convinced his parents, who thought he was joking and finally agreed to let him go. In March 2016, he went on a two-week trip to Turkey and he did not intend to visit the Syria border. It was his first time abroad.As soon as he reached the capital, he was greeted with the Ankara bombing that killed 37 people. A few days later there was another Istanbul bombing that killed five. But that did not deter him. It was the sight he saw in front of a mosque in Turkey that prompted him to cross the border. A Syrian mother was nursing a new-born baby on the street side and the baby had an abnormal lump on the head. Prasad could not get that picture out of his head. He decided to come back to India, think it through and plan another visit, but this time to the Syrian border.Journey to the BorderAfter thinking it through, Sai Prasad ventured to the Middle East again in June 2016. He admitted to feeling scared when he was on the way from Amman to the city of Jordan. In doing this, what if I end up doing nothing? Prasad feared. One Skype phone call with his friend was all it took to get his courage back. His friend Sarika, who was constantly guiding him, dismissed his fears and said What nonsense! You have come this far, do not back out. Even if one child smiles then our purpose is fulfilled. Prasad did as told.On nearing the Syrian border, Prasad was jittery. A child was running around the city holding a pamphlet that read Help me! I am from Syria. It was written in English. The child had no idea what was written but because he was told to carry the board, he was just being obliging, says Prasad. The sight made him more determined and he wanted to see more children who were the victims of such circumstances.A 60-km ride from his hotel began. The camp was closed to visitors, open only to journalists. He could not enter the camp but he realised that about 80 per cent of the refugees live outside of the camp, in a desert, where there was little access to food or water. The tents set up by United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees housed around five people to a tent, who irrespective of gender and age huddled to live together. Prasad says, he saw no member of the UN there.As of TodayPrasad has been bed-ridden for two months now. He has lost his ability to walk. He is taking medication to keep his heart beat normal. However, he promises that as soon as he regains his strength, he will visit them one more time. Every day, he prays for five minutes for at least a day when he wont hear of atrocities in Syria. The recent chemical attack made Prasad cry. He hopes it is none of the children he met or any child for that matter. After his visit to Syria, his family and other elders have helped him start an initiative in Karnataka. Today he runs the organisation called Sai Aashraya which, in collaboration with Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital, feeds breakfast to 130 slum children in the city. Not the mid-day meal, because breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Every third Sunday of the month, the organisation goes to the Lepers Colony in Dharampuri to provide meals and medical aid. Every month, they conduct regular health camps and supply 5 kg of rice and wheat, 1 kg of dal and cooking oil to BPL families.They Know BollywoodWearing floaters and an over-sized shirt, Prasad stepped out of the car. The children and the people just stared at him with weary eyes. He then opened his bag, filled with chocolates and cookies and handed them over to the child near him. The child took the ordinary chocolate and licked the wrapper inside out. Though language was a barrier, Prasad was in no time interacting well with the children. He was surprised when they named Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan. You see these kids were well-to-do normal children who had access to TV before the bombs turned their lives upside down, explains Prasad.More than ChocolatesEvery child wanted to be lifted and to play. Prasad spent an entire afternoon and evening playing football with them. On sunset, he returned back but he had plans to surprise them the next day. Little did he know that he was in for a bigger surprise. The second day children recognized the cab and came running to meet him, all cheerful and smiling. Prasad opened the bag of chocolates again and handed it to the boy next to him. The most mystifying thing was that the child was not looking at the chocolate, rather at Prasad. Prasad stretched his hands to pass the chocolate but the child, instead of the chocolate, held Prasads hand. I opened the chocolate for him, he came straight at me and hugged me, shares Prasad, elated and despondent.He spent another evening with them. Where are you from? asked an elderly man, India Prasad replied. Thank you India, the man concluded. That day I understood the saying Love seeks no reward, love is its own reward, Prasad shares. The children looked for nothing besides love. They just wanted someone to lift them up and play... In every smile I saw on them, I felt the presence of god."

The supply of these items is in the nature of emergency assistance to augment relief measures undertaken in the wake of severe drought faced by Sri Lanka, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament in a written reply.The lorry-mounted water bowsers were given to the Government of Sri Lanka on March 21. India has always been among the first to respond to requests from the neighbouring countries in times of crisis. The current gifting of the water bowsers and rice is part of that policy, Swaraj added.Sri Lanka is suffering from the worst drought in 40 years with over a million people facing acute water shortages. The Island country has experienced prolonged dry season with some districts having 60-70 percent less rainfall. The local wells and reservoirs are running dry.The harvest of rice is going to be hit due to water shortage and the prospect of rice shortage later this year is looming large. The Sri Lankan government has also taken slew of measures to contain the fallout of the rice shortage. It has already waived off taxes on rice imports and is expected to increase rice imports to meet the demand at home.Water shortage has also compounded problems for the energy sector of the country that depends on hydro-power."
