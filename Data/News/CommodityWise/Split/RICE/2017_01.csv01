He said the state could manage due to additional allocation. If the additional allocation is also taken into account, the state used to get 16 lakh tonnes of foodgrain, the Chief Minister said. Pinarayi pointed out that Keralas allocation further diminished when Food Security Act was mechanically implemented.As per estimates, 75 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population should have come under the priority category as laid down in Right to Food Act. However, only 48 per cent of the population in Kerala comes under its ambit, he said.A situation will arise where the allocation of 16 lakh tonnes would get reduced to 14.25 lakh tonnes. This will wreck the states public distribution system, Pinarayi said.Stating that Kerala was a foodgrain deficit state, the Chief Minister said the rice produced in the state would not meet even 10 per cent of its requirement. Usually, the states allocation is decided on the basis of the last three years utilisation of the share provided by the Centre. However, the additional allocation is not taken into account. This puts the state at a disadvantage, Pinarayi pointed out.The Chief Minister also said the Centre has not taken into account the 35 lakh migrant workers in the state who are also entitled to foodgrain.Pinaryi urged the Union Minister to ensure that states additional allocation should continue till a fair share for the state is finally arrived at. He also demanded allocation of rice at subsidised prices for Above Poverty Line (APL) category."

Officials from Canadian embassy reached Raipur on Thursday and took him to Delhi from where he is scheduled to fly back to Canada.In his late twenties, the Canadian cyclist was not aware that he was crossing the Maoist heartland of south Sukma district on March 26 when he was intercepted by the Sangham members (village-level supporters who constitute lower cadres of outlawed CPI-Maoist).I did not know I was passing through insurgency-hit areas. Language was an issue when I failed to make the local villagers, who stopped me, understand about my trip and passion. They perhaps got suspicious and took me to their armed cadres who further interrogated and searched my belongings, he narrated to the police after his release. He landed at Mumbai from Canada in February this year.Some senior leader of Maoists might have conversed with him in English. After getting convinced that he was no threat for them, the Canadian citizen was allowed to go. He was not ill-treated and his stay with them was comfortable, Bastar DIG P Sunderraj told the New Indian Express.The Canadian citizen turn anxious after sensing he was in a dangerous situation a day after being taken into custody by Maoists in the remote Singamadugu village of Sukma, and pressed the GPS emergency button to send an alert, which consequently put the foreigner on the radar of Bastar police.Szlazak shared with the police that he was ""not badly"" treated by the Maoists. He was shifted from one place to another while in captivity. They also blindfolded him. Throughout, he remained under their close surveillance. He was served fish, boiled rice and vegetables to eat, police sources told the New Indian Express."

Also, if you are lucky like me, you might even witness a flash mob by the staff on Bollywood chartbusters.Despite the menu sporting dhaaba food, the lip smacking dishes and cocktails are anything but street side and is definitely up in style and Punjabi flavours. Chef Shivam Bose introduced us to the menu that included Paneer Tikka, Veg Galouti and Tandoori Bhune Aloo as starters for vegetarians. For mains, you can pick from Dal Dhaba, Paneer Makhani and Amritsari Chole along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan.For non vegetarian starters, choose from Highway Chicken Tikka, Tawa Mutton and Tawa Chicken. For the mains, pick from Butter Chicken, Rarra Ghost, Kadhai Chicken and Dal Dhaba along with choice of two breads from the menu between Roti, Butter Naan, Lachha Paratha and Naan. For sweet endings, go for some rabri, gulab jamun and phirni.For the Chaat FlavourIf you love chaat flavours, I would recommend you to order Tandoori Bhune Aloo and Paneer Tikka. The paneer cuts through smoothly and is tempered very well with spices. The Bhune Aloo are roasted baby potatoes, tossed in spices and served beautifully with onions and tomatoes. Two of my favourite things  potatoes and tomatoes  put together with roasted flavours and tempered with chaat. Was I a happy woman? Damn, right.While I have heard of Galouti Kebab, I had always perceived as a non vegetarian dish. But here, thanks to chef Shivam, I got a taste of its vegetarian version, where just like the meat one, the vegetable is minced to smoothness through slow cooking, flavoured with cinnamon and black cardamom and placed over a maida crispy base. The galouti is buttery smooth and the base adds the crunch to this dish.The non-vegetarian version of the galouti had lamb minced and cooked to buttery smoothness. The chef definitely earned respect on the dinner table having cooked the meat so well. The effort of the kitchen and its use of technique shows beautiful with this starter.Be it the medium rare Mutton Seekh, the Amritsari Machli or vegetarian starters, the kitchen at Dhaba by Claridges has got its flavours and cooking technique right on the money.The Chitta Butter Chicken is served with white sauce. Flavoured in kasoori methi, this dish is cooked in tandoor with the marination of hung curd and spices. The meat is well cooked and bursts of zesty flavours.The Balti Meat is the houses signature dish, which steals inspiration from the famous mutton curry of dhaba. The curry has all the flavours of a Punjabi house kitchen. Although the gravy looks spicy, at no point do any of the favours overpower the centre-piece sticking out of the bucket serving bowl  the mutton.The Tawa Mutton Pulao has flaky Basmati rice that is tossed in spices and tempered with spices that you will find in any Punjabi kitchen. The dish is light on the stomach and has a fresh mint garnish with well cooked meat pieces. If you are a rice fanatic, do give this one a try.Gujju Dreams Come TrueBeing a Gujarati, I had to ask for the Kadi Pakora, and boy, was I impressed. The thick curd-flour consistency, flavoured well with turmeric and spices, served with pakoras drenched in the gravy won my heart. I definitely missed home a little less with this preparation that is famous across North India.While theres so much to talk about the food, one place where Dhaba by Claridges proves its versatility is the cocktails. They are all flavoured with chaat spices and my God, are the one of the most impressive mixes I have had so far."

Each centre has food grain storage capacity of 25,000 quintals with a cost of Rs 8.20 per month per quintal and the facilities will be jointly run by the corporation and private players.Rice mills located in Sundargarh, Subdega, Lefripara, Tangarpali and Bargaon blocks and Sundargarh Municipality would be badly hit. The millers said two free of cost departmental storage centres and three private godowns at a nominal rent located at viable points are catering to the needs of seven blocks. But instruction was issued to close them. Moreover, most of the rice mills are located in Sundargarh, Bargaon and Rajgangpur blocks which are 40 to 100 km from Balishankara and Hemgir.Under the present circumstances, the rice mills would dispatch rice stocks to the RRCs-cum-DSCs for storage under the public distribution system (PDS). Now, the lifting agents or transport contractors for these affected blocks and the municipality area would have to procure PDS stocks from these RRCs-cum-DSCs and return to the respective block offices before going for distribution to about 110 fair price shops located in remote areas.Both the rice mill owners and transport contractors are peeved at the decision while the civil supplies authorities admitted that the decision would enhance transport cost manifold. Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Pradhan refused to comment.Sundargarh District Congress Committee president Dushmanta Naik said the decision would bleed the State exchequer heavily and it is a fit case for Vigilance probe. Naik said the private players involved in the RRCs-cum-DSCs ignored viable locations and settled for distant areas for procuring cheap land."

The student, Sagarika Das had complained that she suffered stomach infection after consuming low quality food, which included half boiled rice and potato. After her complaint, all the other students refused to eat the MDM in protest.To suppress the incident, cook Elina Mohanty and teacher thrashed Sagarika and asked her to keep silent on the issue.Later, girls mother Gitanjali Das lodged an FIR in Paradip Lock station against the accused cook and teacher for beating and using filthy language for Sagarika.

Being in this industry, you really need to stay fit. Our job involves long hours, lot of food, interacting with people and the need to look fresh through it all. Looking back at a near three-decade career, the only thing I would have done differently would probably be taking up international opportunities earlier on in my career for better exposure.I think what the city needs to change about its culinary scene is keeping the food warm from the first bite to the last. Take a naan for instance. Some hotels serve huge pieces that become rubber by the time you get to the middle. So portions are something Chennai needs to really consider. Also, there are curry leaves in almost everything. Why?As a chef, You need to know the source. If youre near the sea, why should you accept frozen fish? Its crucial to eat your local produce!What is special about each cuisine is the technique. Down south, we find such refined spices and processes of cooking while Bengal has a milder palette with a lot of mustard. Same way, you see variations in Italian and Mediterranean cuisines. Cooking processes are a lot more complex in south than north  lot of minute nuances to keep in mind. Coming here, I learnt that curd rice is best served when it never touches the fridge. The beauty of food is that irrespective of cuisine, the basics are the same; its all a matter of improvisation.I am fond of Italian and eastern Mediterranean food. The grills of Syria  their kebabs and Lebanese maizes are my favourite. I prefer a lighter palette rather than something too spice heavy. I want the essence of the base  be it vegetables or meat  to come through first. Our spices should enhance and not mask the base.I have made a few mistakes as a chef; there was a guest who ordered paneer tikka butter masala. I sent him a chicken tikka butter masala instead. He was quite exasperated and never came back to our hotel for a year. When he returned, I made the same mistake. What are the odds, of the same mistake happening to the same person!My advice to aspiring chefs out there would just be  do not follow TV shows blindly. While popular culture does do justice in its representation, the culinary world goes much beyond that and is as exciting as its challenging. The youth have an aggression about them thats commendable. It just needs good channeling."

Earlier known as London Mission Girls School, it was the first Kannada school for girls in Bengaluru.Mitralaya, housed in a brick and mortar structure, means Abode of Friends and has its moto Love fruitful in Service taken from one of the Tagores prayers, Song 36 from Gitanjali.HistoryThe entrance on Mission RoadAs early as 1800s, the Christian missionaries began their activities in the city with a primary objective of imparting high quality education, says Arun Prasad, an independent researcher and historian. Along with schools, they also began a press for printing materials such as textbooks and literature materials. They also played an important role in not just imparting English education but also modernising indigenous vernacular education. They were also the pioneers in spreading womens education.On December 29, 1836, a batch of Christian missionaries of London Mission Society from England with Rev Benjamin Rice and his wife Jane Rice arrived in Madras. On the night of January 6, 1837, they left for Bangalore. It is said that they and their fellow missionaries travelled in five palanquins accompanied by 70 bearers. The journey took a weeks time.Interestingly, the wives of the Christian missionaries, took the task and responsibility of womens education in the state. Jane Rice started studying Kannada to help in her husbands work. She finally decided to start A Kannada girls boarding school.According to a report presented by Sujana Jaganadhan, who served as principal of the school from 1979, as there werent too many boarders, Rice decided to focus on day scholars to provide education to girls from and others who were willing to send their daughters.The schools were dependent on what missionaries would collect from friends in England and Bangalore. Some churches and Sunday schools in London have contributed towards the support of girls in the boarding school.The 175-year-old Mitralaya Girls High SchoolFirst School for GirlsIn 1840, Mrs Sewell, wife of Rev James Sewell of London Mission, opened the first Kannada girls school at the Bangalore Petah, says Arun Prasad.It was the first time native girls were able to attend the school in the region. Rev Benjamin Rice prepared the text books in Canarese. They were taught to write and read Kannada and English with a stress on learning geography and arithmetic.J M Richard, former treasurer of Karnataka Central Diocese Church of South India, says, In 1840, Mitralaya school was functioning in a building in the Mission Compound, near the present Unity Building. It was started by Mrs Sewell along with Jane Rice. It had a strength of only three children. There were 25 non-resident children. As the strength grew, the small building could not cater to the needs and hence, it was moved to the present location on Mission Road in 1842. The land for the school was given by Mysore Maharaja. The old premises now houses Mitralaya Boarding Home.But Arun Prasad says, The land where the present school building stands, belonged to Thomas Hodson from Wesley Mission. It was a 20-acre land where he started Wesleyan school in 1834. It was an English school. Later in 1920, the Wesleyan Mission and London Mission merged to form United Mission.Richard differs, They merged but Wesleyan Mission has no associations with Mitralaya.The school was supervised by Jane Rice until her death in 1864 due to illness. The school had about 400 students then.After her death, Benjamin Rice married Catherine Muller, a widow of the German missionary. Catherine Rice along with her daughter Harriet Muller took up charge of the boarding school. Although Harriet was actively involved in the workings of the boarding house, she did not take official charge until the death of her mother in 1887.Fashionable CrochetThe girls also learned crochet work and were trained in cooking and other domestic work. According Sujanas report, crochet was very fashionable during that period and four students from the school had won first prize at the exhibition Native female needle-work open to all India.In 1897, a small school hall was built for the teachers and staff to carry on with their studies. The hall came out to be of great use during the outbreak of plague. The church services were held in this hall.The outbreak of plague in 1898 led to the extension of the school services to several Hindu girls from different castes. In 1902, a further advance was made by opening of fourth form, the beginning of the high-school department. The extra responsibilities took a toll on the health of Muller and she broke down completely, unable to do any active work, in 1903. L H Bragg, a MA graduate took over the charge in1904.The high school classes developed to forth and sixth forms, the present tenth standard.Meanwhile, the numbers of boarders kept increasing and the Hindu Brahmin parents were allowing their daughters to continue their studies even after their marriage at the age of 13 or 14.After Muller retired in 1911, the problem of accommodating Hindu boarders cropped up. In 1912, a new two-storey boarding block with kitchen and out-houses was erected. Though it was meant for Hindus to use separately, it sufficiently accommodated six to eight more boarders who were prepared to pay for the expenses.The school got its present name Mitralaya after independence.Present StrengthS R Prema, the present in-charge Headmistress, says, There is a strength of about 1,200 students from nursery to Composite Junior College. We collect annual fees but, for those who are from poor background, we provide free boarding facilities, education and uniform. There are about 50 to 60 students in the boarding home now. We also provide mid-day meals. The building has been maintained as a historic structure without much modifications to date."

The chefs special biriyani arrives with a heap of golden onion ringlets on top of it and a tempting aroma starts wafting in the air.Its prepared with an extra hint of nutmeg and special masalas. Hence the unique scent, says chef Micheal of Hotel Keys, Housing Board Junction, where they are having a biriyani promotion till March end.We have introduced a mix of totally authentic biriyanis along with a couple of innovative ones. We use our own recipe for the house specials, he adds.Its one dish that has undergone umpteen makeovers, tasting different from place to place. Chef says its the quality of rice and the perfection in dum that basically defines the biriyani.In Kerala we like kaima rice, but there are people who insist on using basmati. Authentic Malabari biriyani is made with kaima only, but when it comes to North Indian biriyanis we go for the long and slender basmati. In our menu we have tried to focus more on South varieties using fried meat, he says.If you want to experiment with something other than the regular yellow biriyani, opt for the Nilgiri version. This one comes with a green tint, the result of a mint, coriander and palak blend. Its one biriyani totally different from what you have tasted so far. Each leaf used has its own unique flavour and the meat and rice gets covered in that green masala, explains the chef.If you are a seafood lover, give fish a miss this time. No, we are not referring to the yummy prawn biriyani but another signature dish - the spicy squid biriyani.Malayalis like hot and spicy food. Normally, the spice level in biriyani is moderate. But in squid biriyani its on the higher side. You can see how hot and flavourful it is by just looking at it, says the chef pointing to the slightly red dish.The menu has all the regular chicken, beef and veg variants as well and each biriyani is accompanied by a sweet mango-and-pineapple chutney, onion raita and pappad. Sometimes we serve slightly customised biriyanis taking into account what the customer likes, adds the chef.

The rice sold through ration shops stinks, she alleged.Kanimozhi said the government is adopting technology to update the availability liquor brands in TASMAC outlets but not doing so for the PDS network.Claiming that the government is procuring commodities, including rice and dal, she said they however do not land in the ration shops as the trucks ferrying them go elsewhere.She predicted snap polls to the Tamil Nadu Assembly.Later, Kanimozhi and several party cadre were detained by the police for holding the protest without permission.Similar demonstrations were held in several other parts in Chennai.O Panneerselvam slams TN Govt of lethargy in ration supplyFormer chief minister and leader of AIADMK rebel faction O Panneerselvam on Monday criticised the State government of being lethargic and trying to weaken the public distribution system (PDS) causing inconvenience to the poor people.The benami Tamil Nadu government has delayed procurement of essential goods to PDS shops leading to severe shortage. People have to return empty-handed without getting essential goods, including dal and palm oil, he said in a statement here.Pointing out that there were no shortage of goods at ration shops during the regimes of late chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa, he said the present government is trying to weaken the PDS network without bothering about the welfare of the poor.The State government must act on a war footing by shedding its lethargic attitude and procuring the required quantity of goods to address the requirement of the poor, he urged."

However, people of Karnataka could expect a feel good budget from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday as he is leading a daunting challenge of stopping the BJP juggernaut.As the going gets tough for Congress in Nanjangud and Gundlupet by-poll to be held on April 9 and the party high command is determined to retain power in the only major state in the country where Congress is in power, Siddarmaiahs record 12th budget is expected to carry the goodies beyond its traditional AHINDA (Kannada acronym for minorities, backwards and minorities) constituency.Farmers, who are in dire straits due to successive droughts can expect some succour as the Chief Minister is said to be keen to announce a limited farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.The Chief Minister sees it as the most effective move to counter BJP in the poll battle as the Modi government failed to provide any relief for the drought hit farmers in its recent budget.Though the demonetisation hit resource mobilisation in Commercial Taxes, Stamps and Registration and Motor Vehicles Tax, Siddaramaiah is unlikely to impose any additional tax burden on the common man as this is the last full fledged budget before entering the poll battle.Tobacco products, high end liquor and luxury goods and services would be the only targets to raise additional resources.According to sources close to the Chief Minister, it would be a Please all budget with some welfare programmes for non-AHINDA students and unemployed youth too. Major initiatives to improve the health services in government hospitals too are in the offing.The Chief Minister has already announced the decision to increase rice quota per head under the Anna Bhagya scheme from the present 5kg to 8kg from April 1 to further consolidate the Below Poverty Line (BPL) voter base of the party.As for the industrial sector, hopes are high on abolition of Trade License for Medium and Small Scale Industries all over the state.Credit Flow to SMEs - For technology upgradation and modernisation, Seed capital, margin money bridge loan and many more at 4 per cent interest without collateral security, is another demand which could get some positive response, said, President of Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries(FKCCI) M C Dinesh."

Reason-- Unable to eat excess thick rice, many Below Poverty Line (BPL) families are selling it in the local market.Even while the rice is not being utilised, Chief Minister Siddaramiah is all set to announce additional 2-3 kg of rice per person in the budget that will be presented on Wednesday.Soon after Siddaramiah became the CM in 2013, he announced Anna Bhagya scheme, where the state government would give 5kg rice per person at `1 per kg for BPL families. But from 2016, it is given free of cost. There are 109 lakh beneficiaries who are eligible to get rice and other grains under this scheme from nearly 21,000 fair price shops.Sources from the department said they procure 2.17 metric tones of rice every month from the Government of India for `3 per kg.We give 5kg of rice per person for BPL families. But many are not using it as the rice is thick and not ideal for cooking. They use it to make dosas or idlis. Since they do not need the rice in large quantity, they either sell it to shops or strike a deal with fair shop owners.In a few cases, the fair shop owners who will have excess stock will sell the rice to other shops for extra price. Grains given by the state government, especially rice are being misused. Cases have also been registered against some individuals, fair price shop owners, rice mill owners and truck owners for transporting the rice illegally, sources said.Bhagyamma (name changed), resident of Gangondanahalli said they make ragi mudde, twice a day. As we are a family of six members, we get 30 kg of rice per month. We hardly eat rice, so we sell it to a nearby shop, she said.How many days can we eat dosas and idlis. We get rice for cheaper price, so we buy it, she added.As per the data available with Express, since 2013-14, 33,995.47 quintal of rice (close to 34 lakh kg of rice) and 9,202.57 qunital (close to 92,000kg of wheat) has been seized by the department officials. They also seized some quantity of ragi, sugar, oil and other products.However, when compared to rice, the supply of other products is less in terms of quantity. We supply rice per person. Whereas, other products like sugar, ragi and oil are given based on number of family members, said sources.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said more number of cases are detected due to sincerity of officials.According to World Health Organisation, the intake of carbohydrates by an individual should be more so we are increasing the quantity of rice per person in our budget, he said.Over thick rice being supplied, Minister said they get rice from Punjab and Haryana which might be little thick. People who are illegally selling it will anyway find an excuse, but the thickness is not the sole reason to sell rice, he said."

Consumer price index-based inflation too rose to a four-month high of 3.65 per cent, as remonetisation pace picked up pace and spurred consumption demand, after touching a multi-year low of 3.17 per cent in January However, the sharp correction in crude oil prices witnessed over the past week would douse minerals inflation in March 2017, restraining headline wholesale price index-based (WPI) inflation at around six per cent in that month, says Aditi Nayar, principal economist, ICRA.WPI is an index that measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level. WPI shows the average price change of goods included in the index and is often expressed as a ratio or percentage, and the change is one indicator of a countrys level of inflation. The WPI inflation reflected that the annual rate of price rise was at 5.25 percent in January. This was primarily because of a sharp rise in the rates of cereals, rice and fruits. The fuel basket also surged by 21.02 per cent from 18.14 per cent in January.We had expected an adverse base effect to push up WPI inflation in February 2017 to 5.9 per cent. The lagged revision in the minerals sub-index, particularly for crude oil, contributed to the sharper-than-anticipated spike in WPI inflation to 6.5 per cent in February 2017, as well as the upward revision in the December 2016 print to 3.7 per cent, said Nayar.Food prices indicated a sharp rise by 2.69 per cent in February compared to a deceleration by 0.56 per cent in the previous month, according to the official data released on Tuesday. Everything on the agriculture front is not good as some of the southern states have declared drought, said Rupa Rege Nitsure, L&T Financial Services.The report gives an impression that food inflation in the months of October, November, December-2016 and January 2017 had crashed and that food inflation has bottomed out. The government also revised December inflation rate to 3.68 per cent from the previous provisional reporting of 3.39 per cent."

This could also blunt the attack from BJP and JD(S). The Narendra Modi-led Union government failed to offer any special relief for drought-hit farmers in its recent budget.The below poverty line (BPL) families, cutting across caste lines, will have reason to celebrate as the quota of rice per person being distributed free of cost is being raised from the present 5kg to 8kg per month. A novel scheme to provide free admission to students of BPL families in higher education is also likely to be announced.Though Siddaramaiah is said to be keen to see his budget touch the `2 lakh crore mark, the tight resource mobilisation conditions could make it tough. The poll-oriented budget will be a soft one without additional tax burden, except targeting tobacco products, premium liquor and luxury goods and services."

A team of doctors, led by district health officer Dr Rangaswamy, had collected pellets of the pesticide from Huliyaru.Dr Rangaswamy said people keep the pellets, which have a pungent odour, in bags of grains. Though the presence of the pesticide in the food cannot be ruled out, Dr Rangaswamy said, Until we get the biological and chemical reports from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) in Bengaluru, we cannot come to any conclusion.

Modern-day, indulgent diet is often blamed for causing a range of illnesses including diabetes, gout, acidity and heart ailments. Bengaluru is embarking on its journey to become the countrys millet capital and it has a small army of fitness experts and doctors to chefs and government employees to help it along.Indias first millet marathon was organised on April 16 by the Department of Agriculture, Government of Karnataka, at Cubbon Park and 2,000 people showed up. Krishna Byre Gowda, Minister for Agriculture, tells City Express that Karnataka is on its way to becoming the millet and organic capital of the country.We are trying our best to promote millets and organic food as a form of sustainable agriculture, he says. Our target is to reach out to anybody who is concerned about their health and want to even out dietary imbalances. We suggest that millet should be used as a substitute.Krishna Byre Gowda adds that he is a traditional millet eater. The Minister adds, The food that costs higher and is associated with higher social status (like rice and sugar) can cause a range of health problems.Answer for Weight LossWanitha Ashok, fitness expert and innovator, is a champion of millets and shares millet recipes on her social media pages.People look for supplements to keep fit but millets are equally effective, she says. Wanithasays that on the days she eats millets, she has no extra food cravings and that actually helps herkeep fit.Added to it all, millet is such a versatile food. I make raagi balls... it is delicious. When cooking millets, we have to soak it well in water and dry it before we cook it, she says.Dietitian Shalini Arvind from Fortis Hospital says that she has been advising her patients to geton a millet diet from when she started in her profession in 2004. People are taking notice now, she says. Millet has always been an integral part of diet in this state. And it has always worked wonders for losing weight. Her daily meal includes millets particularly ragi and navane.Strides into RestaurantsChef Manu Chandra, who runs a restaurant chain Olive, says that his restaurant has been promoting millets for over a year. Millet is a great source of protein and carbohydrates, he says. We serve millets in various forms such as breads, sausages, desserts and chicken stuffing.Chef Selvaraju Ramasamy, an executive chef at Vivanta by Taj, says that his customers have been asking for millet dishes.There is more awareness now and people have been opting for varieties of millets rather than refined flour, he says.Millet was introduced in his menu about six months ago and Ramasamy is delighted by the variety of dishes you can come up with.Diners love the bajra roti and millet Kabuli salad, he says. Selvaraju has also been conducting workshop on millets.What Studies SayUsha Ravindra, an associate professor of food science and nutrition at the University of Agricultural Sciences, has been giving talks on the benefits of millets. Millets have a lot of anti-oxidants that help regulate cardiovascular diseases. Theyre high in fibre, calcium, magnesium and potassium. As Bengaluru has sedentary lifestyle, we do need a millet diet.Hit with the Babus TooNandini Kumari, additional director in the department of agriculture, had struggled with acidity. In the first week of April, she decided to include foxtail millet in her diet. After that day, my acidity problem has gone away and I have stuck to my millet diet, she says.

( Photo | AP)NEW YORK: Attention, word nerds: This is your bonus round, courtesy of Merriam-Webster.In addition to elevating ""surreal"" in 2016 to word of the year, the dictionary company on Tuesday added about 1,000 new words and new definitions to existing listings on its website, Merriam-webster.com.Among 17 of the latest disclosed by the company are: ""arancini,"" those stuffed, breaded and fried Italian rice balls, ""conlang,"" meaning an invented language like Klingon, ""fast fashion"" and ""microaggression,"" a flash-point favorite on some college campuses.The rest? Well, it's up to language treasure hunters to find those for themselves.This is the first time the company has freshened up website listings since 2014, when it added entries to a new paper edition of its collegiate book and online at the same time.""Some of these we've been watching for many years and some of these are very new words,"" said Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large.Alphabetically speaking, arancini leads the charge. Foreign food words are among the richest sources of new words in English and this one is borrowed from the Italian for ""little orange."" Besides, Sokolowski said in a recent interview, ""Anything that's deep-fried is good. We've all had them but I didn't know this name. We all love exploring the world through food.""Among the others:CONLANG: ""This is a personal favorite because this is a linguistics word,"" said Sokolowski, a lexicographer. In addition to Klingon, the made-up language of ""Star Trek,"" Elvish of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is another famous example. ""I have two friends who have written whole books about conlangs,"" Sokolowski said.""They're serious languages. They have declensions, they have verb tenses, they have grammar and accents and all the rest of it. They sound more realistic if the language is actually developed,"" he added.FAST FASHION: It's that thing when manufacturers can quickly bring fashion to market at relatively inexpensive prices, such as the wares sold by H&M, Zara, Topshop and others. Fashion designers have embraced the idea of moving looks quickly into stores straight from runways, as opposed to showing collections ahead of their designated seasons.The sleuths at Merriam-Webster, based in Springfield, Massachusetts, found a reference as early as 1977, in a Pittsburgh newspaper referring to a line of moderately priced shoes for women.MICROAGGRESSION: Merriam-Webster defines it thusly: ""A comment or action that subtly and often unconsciously or unintentionally expresses a prejudiced attitude toward a member of a marginalized group (such as a racial minority).""Such slights have been broadly defined in debates over acceptable speech among college students. On at least one campus, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, new freshmen on campus began last year to be introduced to the term, along with learning about ""safe spaces,"" another new lookup entry on Merriam-Webster's site.GHOST: An informal definition has been added, for the practice of abruptly cutting off all contact with someone, such as a former romantic partner, by no longer accepting or responding to calls and messages.PROSOPAGNOSIA: The inability to recognize faces. It came up recently because the late psychologist Oliver Sacks ""wrote about the fact that he himself suffered from prosopagnosia,"" Sokolowski said. It comes from the Greek word meaning face or mask.The fresh entries also include: ""Seussian,"" for ""having a playful or outlandish quality"" relating to the works of beloved children's writer Dr. Seuss, aka Theodore Geisel; ""microbiome,"" for communities of bacteria, fungi and viruses inhabiting a particular environment, most notably the human body; and  last but not least  recognition for a slang definition of ""shade,"" as in throwing some publicly as a subtle or indirect insult.""This is social media speaking,"" Sokolowski said of shade. ""What I like about it is that it assumes a very highly informed reader. It assumes you will get the whole joke."""

While the film has been made mostly with actors and technicians from the city, S P Raghu, the director, says being a resident of Mysuru made the process of filming much easier.Raghu has been in Mysuru for one-and-a half years, and prior to that, worked for Mico Labs, a pharmaceutical firm in Congo, Africa. Owing to the amount of leisure time he had, he pursued his passion for making a film, and readied a basic script. And once he did that, he felt compelled to resign to start work on the film, and moved to Mysuru. Of course, before this moment of spontaneity, Raghu had been saving up for years to make a film, and he produced Pallata himself, with a little help from his brothers.Most of the films actors, and members of the directorial team are from a theatre group in Mysuru, which was how Raghu preferred it. It is a low-budget film and theatre actors and crew are more flexible to work with. During the shoot, we all stayed in villages at homes of the locals, which would have been tougher with film actors. And I also gelled with them better. Ive always nurtured a passion for theatre and literature, and had written and directed plays in Bengaluru, he says. The shoots location in Tiptur taluk is also Raghus home town. He roped in a few illustrious names for the film, such as wildlife photographer Lokesh Mosale for cinematography and National Award winner M N Swamy for editing.The films central character, Yella, is the village drummer who beats drums whenever the situation calls for it, for example to announce something. All villagers would pay the drummers in kind with rice and millets. The profession used to be quite prevalent in villages of Karnataka until modernisation made them obsolete, which is what happens to Yella. His struggle to accept his fate is juxtaposed with the villages modernisation and his relatively modern, college-going daughters dislike for his profession, which she thinks is equivalent to begging. Raghu says the custom is still practised, albeit in a very few villages.Anil Kumar played the role of the lead character, Yella in the film. This was his debut film and he haw acted in Kannada TV serials prior to this. He has mixed memories of the shoot. I was suffering from jaundice at the time of the shoot But Raghus mother, who was at the location, nursed me back to health. I felt I was cared for very well, he said.On being asked about the films chances of winning the award - Raghu waived it off saying how every jury differs from one another. The film was also screened at a film festival in Delhi, and was much liked by the audience. In August I had spoken about the film with literary figures in a film studio.The film has been much discussed in literary circles and some universities have asked for screenings for students, says Raghu. he is now working on another film, a bilingual, something more commercial, and is scouting hard for actors for the film.Speaking about how being in Mysuru helped him to make the film, he says, Things started moving very fast here. Its easy to work here, theres peace of mind, its easy to meet people for discussions, and many subject experts and artists from various fields are available."

The tribals of BR Hills and other areas in Chamarajanagar district are selling the ghee packets worth `350 at throwaway prices.The incident came to light when forest personnel at BR check posts seized 80 litres of ghee packets recently, raising doubts that it is sold to the shopkeepers in towns.The Union government, under Additional Nutritional Scheme and through Social Welfare Department, supplies 15 kg ragi, 5 kg tur dal, 6 kg of green gram and horse gram, four kg jaggery, two litres of edible oil, one litre ghee and 45 eggs per month to fight malnutrition among tribals. But, the tribal community which doesnt consume ghee, is selling the same to agents who come at their doorsteps at throwaway prices.The Social Welfare Department supplies the essentials to around 5,000 Soliga, Jeenu Kuruba and Betta Kuruba families in the district. Meanwhile, a few tribal families even sell eggs to shops in lieu of money or any other food items like coffee and tea powder.The eggs go back to street vendors who make omelettes, egg toast and egg fried rice in the nearby towns. Sources said there are a few cases where the tribal families sell dal as well. However, other foodgrains like ragi, grams, jaggery and edible oil are used by tribals for their own consumption.Complaints from local non-governmental organisations, forest department officials and a few locals have put the Social Welfare, Revenue and Food and Civil Supplies officials on the toes. Sources said the officials have served notices to 22 families for selling ghee and food grains. Bommaiah, a tribal leader said they also visited tribal hadis and held meetings with tribals, appealing them not to sell the essentials."

It costs around Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000 per month to feed the children. I earn the income through performing some daredevil stunts in nearby schools and colleges. Some of them offer money and others pay in kind  rice and commodities  after seeing my stunts. Occasionally, some people from nearby villages also offer excess food from functions, he said.When asked about the incident, he said Praveen had taken the extreme step over a petty issue.I didnt even scold him harshly that day, despite him being caught roaming with his friends on the main road. The boy had attempted suicide as he was depressed. At that time, I was playing with the remaining children in the backyard of the home. Suddenly, on hearing Praveens screams, I rushed to the verandah. Immediately, the boy was rushed to a nearby hospital in A Konduru for treatment. The doctors there examined him and asked for him to be shifted to Vijayawada. If I committed any mistake, I will abscond from the place soon after the incident, but I didnt do so, Venkateswara Rao said."

Rama Rao's second wife Lakshmi Parvathi has threatened to move court if N. Chandrababu Naidu is portrayed as hero in a proposed film on the life of the late leader.She said on Tuesday that she will not keep quiet if historical facts were twisted in the biopic which Rama Rao's son and leading Telugu actor N. Balakrishna plans to produce.Lakshmi Parvathi said if injustice was meted out to the TDP founder, she would wage a legal battle.She alleged that Chief Minister Naidu ""backstabbed"" his father-in-law NTR to usurp power.Balakrishna on Monday announced that he would produce a film on the life of his father NTR, the legendary Telugu actor and three-time Chief Minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh.The actor said he would play the role of his father.He also said the film would tell the entire story of his father, right from his humble beginning as a farmer's son, his journey to become a superstar and one of the most popular political leaders.However, a day after his announcement, Lakshmi Parvathi voiced her doubts on how the film would portray the turbulent events of 1995 when Naidu ousted his father-in-law from power.Bonda Uma, a leader of Telugu Desam Party (TDP), said Lakshmi Parvathi would be the villain in the film.""She is a villain in real life and she will be villain in the film too. She distanced NTR from people and everybody knows this,"" he said.In another development, Balakrishna met Chief Minister and TDP President Chandrababu Naidu in Vijayawada. Naidu, who claims to be inheritor of NTR's political legacy, discussed with the actor his plans for the biopic.Balakrishna is also a TDP leader and represents Hindupur constituency in the state assembly. His daughter is married to Naidu's son Lokesh.NTR had married Parvathi, his biographer, just before the 1994 elections, which saw TDP returning to power in the state.However, her growing interference in party affairs and administration led to Naidu staging a revolt in August 1995. He became Chief Minister with the support of NTR's sons.NTR had launched a campaign against Naidu for 'backstabbing'. He died in January 1996 at the age of 72.Following his death, Lakshmi Parvathi went into political oblivion.A popular actor, NTR floated the TDP in 1982 on the slogan of ""Telugu self-respect"".Creating a record of sorts, he came to power within nine months of the formation of the party, ending the monopoly of the Congress in the state politics.With pro-poor schemes like the Rs 2/kg rice and total prohibition, he went on to become the most popular politician in the state's history."

The accident took place when he was working on a rice polishing (VT) machine in a rice mill.He reached Hyderabad for treatment within four hours where he got his hand operated in a five-hour surgery involving several grafting and repairing techniques. The key is to preserve the amputated part and get it operated within six hours which is the golden phase where the success rate is high says Dr. Suneel of MaxCure hospitals who performed the surgery. Packaging and preserving is important in such cases where the cut part is to be properly cleansed, dried and put in a plastic bag with ice on it.I almost lost hope and I never thought I would get back to work soon, said Vinod, who is back to his daily routine.While it takes about six months to completely recover, the thumb is intact now with certain physiotherapy exercises prescribed to be done every day. The process is skill and infrastructural intense and can be operated and fixed back to its normal, the doctors at MaxCure Hospitals say."

J. Ramesh, director general of the India Meteorological Department, told Reuters in an interview.The emergence of El Nino after July does not either indicate a weak start or deficient rains, as this weather pattern is only one of the many variables influencing the south-west monsoon, Ramesh said.A U.S. government weather forecaster earlier this month said La Nina conditions had disappeared and projected the possibility of El Nio developing later this year.Forecasters in Japan and Australia also see a 40-50 chance of the El Nino weather pattern later this year.El Nio, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, faded in 2016 and was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.Despite forecasts of La Nina leading to heavy bursts of rains, India only received average monsoon rainfall last year, not surplus as previously expected, Ramesh said, alluding to the limited impact of both El Nino and La Nina on India's monsoon.Typically less damaging than El Nio, La Nia is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and tends to occur unpredictably every two to seven years. Severe occurrences have been linked to floods and droughts.India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season.A weak El Nino, forecast to develop across Asia this year, would have only slight impact on crops such as wheat, palm oil, rice and oilseeds, Kyle Tapley, an agricultural meteorologist with U.S.-based MDA Weather Services, said this month.The monsoon, which delivers 70 percent of India's annual rainfall, is critical for the country's 263 million farmers and their rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybean crops because nearly half of its farmland lacks irrigation.Before receiving average rains in 2016, India suffered back-to-back drought years for only the fourth time in over a century, hurting incomes and driving some farmers to suicide."

Under the standard loan agreement, such panda cubs must be returned to China before they are 4 years old, the earliest age at which they might begin breeding.The 3-year-old Bao Bao explored her spacious new enclosure at the panda breeding base in the city of Dujiangyan, which features both indoor and outdoor play areas.Keepers have been helping her adapt to local bamboo and Chinese steamed bread made from corn, soybeans, rice and eggs. She is the 11th panda to be born overseas and returned to China.Bao Bao, whose name means ""precious"" or ""treasure,"" underwent a monthlong quarantine at the Dujiangyan base, where keepers monitored her activities and health by checking her blood and feces.Because she does not understand commands in Chinese, she is being looked after for a time by an English-speaking keeper.Giant pandas, China's unofficial national mascot, live mainly in the mountains of Sichuan, with some also found in neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi provinces.They have long been considered one of the world's most endangered animals, with an estimated 1,864 living in the wild and 200 in captivity."

Some theories claim that the Lois were pushed to the fringes of the valley for their so-called impure profession on the orders of the Vaishanava priests who called the shots when Hinduism was introduced by Bengali priest Shanti Das Gosain some 300 years ago. The distance has in a way contributed to the differences in dialect, culture and attire of the people of Andro from the mainstream Meitei society.Nevertheless, Imphal residents visit Andro, 30 km from the capital, and another Loi-dominated liquor brewing region Sekmai in the northern part of Imphal valley throughout the year. However, this Yaoshang, sales have been very less for the Andro residents as most people are busy celebrating the festival at their homes.On a normal day, cars and scooters would be lined up on the streets of Andro of revelers from Imphal. However, during Yaoshang, the sales dip substantially, Sanjay, a liquor brewer said. While a one-litre packet of Andro liquor costs around Rs 60, rice beer is pegged at around Rs 30.The local liquor that we get in Imphal is adulterated. But, the Andro brew is pure. You can check the purity of Andro brew by simply pouring water into the liquor. If you observe movements of glycerine, you can be sure that the liquor is pure, said Kh Indrajit, a regular visitor to Andro.If anyone is found adulterating and selling the liquor, he or she is excommunicated and is barred from carrying on with the business. We do not want anyone who brings a bad name to Andro and our community, said Biren, a local brewer in Andro.However, the brewers are hopeful that sales will go up as soon as Yaoshang ends. Manipuris love Andro liquor. As soon as they are done with the Yaoshang festivities, cars will again line up the streets of Andro, Biren added."

A welcome change in climate for a state which was reeling under one of the worst droughts in its history.With the showers lashing most parts of the state for the last couple of days, the temperature scaled down to 32 degree Celsius from 37 degree Celsius.Alarm bells began ringing in the state when the South-West and North-East monsoon receded with a deficient rainfall of around 62 per cent. The agriculture sector was the worst affected. But the sudden spell of showers not only lowered the rising temperature but also recorded excess rainfall. The showers bested the long period average rainfall recorded this season.Kerala registered an excess of 426 per cent summer rainfall during the first 15 days of March. The districts in central Kerala recorded a seasonal excess of 400 to 700 per cent.The state received 61 mm of rainfall against a normal of 11.6 mm during the period. Pathanamthitta, Palakkad, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Idukki registered excess rainfall, while Kasargod recorded none during this season.Indian Meteorology Department (IMD), Thiruvanthapuram, forecasted heavy rainfall ranging between 7 to 11 cm at one or two places in Kerala and Lakshadweep till Friday morning and isolated rain across the state. Summer rain may damage paddy crops which are ready for harvest, especially in parts of central Kerala. But, the destruction wont be a largescale one since most of the fields have been harvested.Also, private millers are now competing with each other to buy paddy from farmers due to a buoyancy in the price of rice in the open market. So unlike in the past, the harvested paddy is being immediately shifted to the warehouses of private millers.In the past tonnes of harvested paddy used to remain piled up in the fields waiting for Supplyco to procure it, said P Indiradevi, head, Academy of Climate Change Education and Research."

Just when I was enjoying my first mango drink, they placed a bowl with globule of rice.Even before I could give the chef a puzzled look, they poured some magenta pink fluid.The chef enlightened me that it was chawal with beetroot shorba.

It remained the show-stopper.I heard Pineapple rasam from the corner of the table and I jumped in excitement. There is no south Indian wedding that is complete without pineapple rasam. I wanted to taste the chefs style and it goes without saying, the spices of rasam, tanginess of pineapple and the infusion of red round chillis were intact.Ankuri Makkai Hara Pyaaz Ki Tikki was next on my plate.

From developing new software for corporate firms, M Gokul, a software engineer, has taken up organic farming in his native village in Perambalur district.The techie who used to involve in farming during weekends and holidays earlier, is now all set to develop a self-sustainable model for organic farming in his native village. He also aims at sensitising the fellow farmers about the importance of practising organic farming methods to preserve soil fertility.M Gokul has been working with a software major for the past 10 years as a software architect in Chennai. With his roots in Ogalur, where his father K Mullainathan has been growing paddy, Gokul had tried his luck by cultivating traditional paddy breeds in four acres.A few years ago, I was inspired by the concept of organic farming being revived by organic scientist Nammalvar and subsequently enrolled for training courses, Gokul said.Spending ample time at his farmland for the past few months including holidays, leaves and weekends, the techie was shuttling between Chennai and Perambalur during the entire crop cycle. The traditional paddy varieties; Garudan Samba, Mappilai Samba, Aathur Kichidi Samba and Vellai Ponni, were cultivated under System of Rice Intensification (SRI), without fertilisers.Amirthkaraisal and Panchakavya were the only organic manure that I used for growing the traditional paddy crop, besides neem oil as a pest repellent. Without using chemical fertilisers, we managed to post about four tonnes of traditional paddy yield from 3.5 acres of land. My father was helping me during every stage of the crop cycle as I had to be in Chennai mostly, Gokul added.Gokul also said farmers are unaware of self-sustainable farming models independent of external agents.Stating that he is currently serving his notice period with the software firm paying him in several lakhs per annum, Gokul said he is all set to engage in full-time organic farming to produce paddy and value-added products, by strictly keeping chemical fertilisers at bay."

Long queues still form at the shops, and many card holders are disappointed as they are told by PDS staff that only a few items are available.This has forced the lower and middle class families to depend on private shops, leading to higher monthly expense on provisions. The short supply of food grains has been flagged especially in the last one month, which prompted the Food Minister R Kamaraj to acknowledge the failure to extend the Special PDS scheme caused by the delay in supplying pulses and edible oil to fair price shops.When Express visited ration shops in Villivakkam, Ayanavaram and Otteri, a common refrain was that while the supply of those two items had been erratic, it had been more than month since raw rice was supplied.These three areas are among those which have a large number of people depending on fair price shops. Card holders also complained that the shortage of grains led to reduction in the quantity they were entitled to get. After standing in the queue for more than an hour, Mallika (62), of Sidco Nagar, Villivakkam came home carrying pulses (thooram paruppu), but that was not what she wanted. Her specific need was raw rice, but Mallika was told it was not available.I have been hearing this (not available) for the last one month. Forced to rely on private shops, my provision bill has increased by `200, she rued. Similarly, Rani (70), of Bharathi Nagar, said she did not get raw rice, a staple for her family as with many others in the city.Walking under the hot sun, G Malan, of Ayanavaram, carried a one litre packet of palm oil after standing in the queue at Bharathi Nagar PDS shop for about an hour. This is my fourth trip to the shop this month. Only one or two items are being sold every day. So I have to come back another day for another item.At Thiru Vi Ka Street, Otteri, a PDS staff said while boiled rice was supplied, there was no raw rice available in February. He said wheat was short supplied, as a result of which the stock ran out in just four days in March.A senior civil supplies department official said that steps were being taken to restore the supply of pulses and oil in the city, but added that the supply of raw rice would probably take longer as there was difficulty in procuring it."

But after Roelant Oltmans arrival, things started changing and the same was reflected in the Harendra Singh-coached India junior teams performance.Hockey India roped in four sports scientists  Australias Scott Conway and Daniel Barry, South Africas Robin Anthony Webster Arkell and Wayne Patrick Lombard  two weeks ago. Conway will take charge of the senior mens strength and conditioning and Arkell will work with the junior men. Lombard and Barry will oversee the senior and junior women respectively.Conway, the newly appointed scientific adviser, will also oversee the injured players rehabilitation and analyse GPS data from training sessions. He believes the fitness regime is going well and the juniors at the camp are one of the elites in the department.He considers Sumit, a member of the junior mens team that won the World Cup, one of the fittest players. In last weeks test results, some numbers were truly elite. Sumit, for example, is one of the fittest. We did a yo-yo test and he scored 22.3, which is truly elite. The players dedication in training and fitness is more than what I expected, Conway said.The Melbourne resident had previously worked with the Australian rowing team while at the Victoria Institute of Sport. He was also part of former India coach Terry Walshs staff in the Malaysia Hockey Confederation before taking up the India job.Conway feels India is almost on par with South Korea in terms of fitness.

We dont have that issue in India, Conway said.We did some strengthening tests and back squat. Five-six guys scored 1.7 times their body weight. If any player is lifting about 1.4 or 1.5 times their body weight for a back squat, theyre already strong enough. But theyve to maintain the scores and work continuously on speed and agility. There is always room for improvement, he added.Although Conway hasnt introduced many changes in the players dietary plans thus far, he believes a few changes might be needed to freshen things up. He has advised the chef at Sports Authority of India, Bengaluru, to cook less oily and fatty dishes and change white rice to brown rice every alternate day.krishnendu@newindianexpress.com"

He used to tell me You can earn money whenever you want, but to earn a good name you need to do your work with passion and interest. And Ive been following that mantra, he smiles.Rahmathullah distinctly remembers how chili, turmeric, coriander, ginger and other spices smelt while cooking. Until I was 18, I used to watch my father make it, and feed thousands who loved the Bhai biryani, he says.When I began, I knew I had to maintain my fathers reputation. I first cooked both mutton and chicken biryani for a group of 200 people, with my fathers guidance, and I can proudly say that I was successful.So whats this biryani masters favourite? Mutton biryani. I cook every other variety  be it chicken, prawn, egg or even vegetable biryani. People want to taste Rahmathullas kai pakkuvam. Many ask me how I make it specialI really dont have an answer, he says.While biryani is almost everyones favourite, there are a few side dishes that can make it a wholesome delicious meal. Chicken gravy, pepper chicken, fish gravy, prawn fry, prawn gravy, chicken 65 in savory and, bread pudding, rava bhath, semiya bhath, and rice milk in sweet are some of the chefs recommendations. You dont have to drink any aerated drinks along with biryani to feel light...have the biryani, take bites of the side dishes and after an hour, youll crave for more! he laughs.So, whats the difference between a dum and a normal biryani? Its the spice and flavour that makes the difference. A dum biryani is an infusion of masalas, spices and meat in large quantitiesits for people who love the heat of flavours. It tastes like heaven even if you store it for a day and eat it at night or the next morning! While the flavour is minimal in normal biryani, its biryani! Its always delicious, he grins.There are several types of biryanis: Mughlai, Sindhi, Kutchi, etc but Rahmathullah loves the classic mutton biryani.Though both mutton and chicken taste the same, the time it takes to get cooked makes the difference. Mutton takes more time than chicken and you have to watch closely how perfectly the meat is cooked. After all the piece matters, he shares.Biryani is popular in the villages and the chef says that the reason is verragu adupu (wooden stove) on which biryani is made.It gives a totally different and rustic flavour to the biryani. It retains the flavours of the masalas and as the meat is also cooked for long, the flavour is amazing, he explains. Rahmathullahs biryanis are famous all over the world. He sends fans in places like Singapore and Malaysia, and he sends them parcels regularly!Apart from his biryani, people love his ghee rice, chicken and mutton gravy. But my life revolves around biryani and I want to continue doing only this. If I do get an opportunity to explore other cuisines, I will be more than happy to, he says.(Biryani Fest 2017 by Chef Rahmathullah will be held at Hakico Live Kitchen, Velachery from March 31 to April 2)"

Every inch of the journey was covered live on television, with cameramen trailing the vehicles in cars and on motorcycles and at fixed points along the route.Questioning by prosecutors is a key step in South Korea's judicial process before a suspect is charged. It can last for many hours, late into the night, and can be repeated if officials deem it necessary.Park faced two prosecutors and an investigator and was accompanied by one of her lawyers, but standard procedure bars him from interjecting, only allowing consultations during rest breaks - which could be an issue for her.The 65-year-old has a reputation for fastidiousness and as president reportedly refused to use toilets that had been employed by others.She had a packed lunch of seaweed rice rolls and sandwiches brought by one of her security guards, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said.""She has been cooperating well,"" it quoted a prosecutor as saying, adding she would return home after the questioning.The interrogators were addressing her as ""Madam president"", he added, but in the transcript she was referred to as ""suspect"".Park faces multiple charges ranging from abuse of power and coercion to bribery. She is the fourth former South Korean leader to be probed or jailed over corruption scandals.Two former army-backed leaders who served in the 1980s to 1990s - Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo - served prison terms for bribery after they stepped down.Roh Moo-Hyun, who served from 2003 to 2008, killed himself by jumping off a cliff after being probed by prosecutors over corruption allegations in 2009."

Chief Minister Siddaramaiah often said that the scheme was launched to see that no poor sleeps on empty stomach.Though the scheme is well-intentioned and benefiting more than a crore of beneficiaries, some of them are misusing it in Ballari district and falling prey to middlemen from neighbouring states.Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told Express that middlemen often use two ways to purchase the Anna Bhagya rice from the beneficiaries. One way is to buy rice directly from fair price shop owners and the other is to employ some people to collect rice from BLP cardholders.Fair price shop owners strike a deal with the beneficiaries and offer more if they sell the rice back to them. They store it in godowns and sell it to the middlemen from Andhra Pradesh.The other way is hiring some women to collect rice from people. Women collect rice from BPL cardholders at `6 or `10 per kg. After collecting it, they contact middlemen who in turn take the collected to restaurants or puffed rice factories (Mandakki Bhattis) at a higher rate. Women are paid for collecting the rice.The police and the officials have been acting on such complaints for the past several days. At Honnalli village on March 18, the police raided a site and seized 252 quintals of rice worth `3.79 lakh and 9.5 quintals of wheat worth `9,600 and other food grains.The seized food grains were worth `7.04 lakh. The police booked nine people, including three fair shop owners, and their licences have been cancelled.In a recent case reported under the APMC Yard police station limits, the police arrested three women while they were waiting to transport nine quintals of rice worth `13,500 at Andralu Circle in the city.Based on the information provided by the women, the police are looking for two middlemen, who employed them to collect the rice.Deputy Commissioner Ram Prasath Manohar told Express that the raids will continue whenever there is information regarding illegal sale/hoarding of Anna Bhagya rice.I request the people to inform authorities if they see any such illegalities, he said."

Despite this, they were selected for consideration.It has come to light that over 10 other transportation contractors had applied for licence at the collectorate to participate in the process but the licences were not given in time depriving them of bagging the tenders.The transporters of Koraput and Jeypore sub-division alleged that the selected contractors were facilitated to set excess price in collusion with some officials of the Civil Supply Department. They stated that tenders should have been cancelled considering that there was weak response and quotation was on the higher side.They appealed to the Collector to cancel the entire tender process and call for fresh tenders for maximum participation and fair price for transportation.District civil supply official sources clarified that the tender has not been finalised and it is the discretion of the Collector to clear it. District Civil Supply Officer Balabh Charan Das was not available for comment.Last year, the price was Rs 3 crore and if this tender is passed, the Government would have to bear an additional expenditure of Rs 3 crore."

The rice was harvested from fields which were to be taken over for the controversial Aranmula airport project, the Agriculture Department said. Agriculture Minister V S Sunil Kumar called on Sugathakumari at Nandavanam to hand over the presents.I did not believe that it would be so easy to grow rice and harvest it in Aranmula, Sugathakumari said, accepting one para of Aranmula brand rice and the other presents. The rice was harvested last month.The airport project in Aranmula, promoted by the KGS Group, had been dropped following public protests. It was towards February-end that the LDF government launched paddy cultivation near the land originally identified for the controversial airport project.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had inaugurated the venture by sowing paddy seeds. The venture was led by the Aranmula Padasekhara Samithi.Recently, the harvest was held in 101 hectares of the total 401 hectares in this region. The payasam was prepared at the Aranmula temple using the rice. Sugathakumari requested the minister to launch paddy cultivation across the state on lands lying fallow. She also presented the minister with a copy of Mahabharatha. The rice would be used for Aranmula Vallasadya and the Ashtamirohi Sadya, the Aranmula Padasekhara Samithi said. Sugathakumaris daughter Lakshmi Devi, Kerala State Housing Board chairman P Prasad, and special officer of the Aranmula paddy cultivation revival programme J Sajeev were also present.

They believe in experimenting with varied media as they reinstate their dialogues in diverse material and base.It is amazing to find that young artist Jyotsna Velivella seeks inspiration for her present series of work from mundane life and that it was her rendezvous with a traditional function that triggered her thought process and creative instincts.Jyotsna explains, I once wnet for a baby shower and was astonished to see turmeric being applied to the cheeks of the expectant mom. Rice mixed with turmeric was showered on her as a blessing. Curiosity got the best of me and I got to know the significance of turmeric and used it in my works, she says.On the other hand, Nandita Srija focuses her entire series on hard working women. The Aayammas or the helping ladies form the central core of her visual expressions.The photographs, paintings, mixed media works and installation altogether bring forth the strong identity and strengths of women helpers at home, institutions, offices and school. Through her works the artist brings forth the fact that like any other independent, working woman, these ladies too have personal aspirations and dreams for themselves and their family.Nandita elaborates her theme by telling,I began paying attention to their culture, background and their norms, I could connect to my theme as I had many interactions with them and realised, that they follow traditions with the belief that they can contribute financially in their households. They are replaceable and hence fear the consequences of any disturbance in their life.Another young talented artist, Saranya Settipally tells about the concept on which she has worked. Trees, which give back a lot to the mankind, have always appeared in our folklore, poems, myths and mysteries as caregivers, as a mother figure. The benevolent tree is present in almost all the stories and art forms, classic or contemporary,around the world. In Hindu mythology it has often appeared with the name of Kalpa (imaginary) Taru (plant) wish-fulfilling tree.There is a consistent connection of one work with another in the recent series. The artist excels in maintaining a unanimous rhythm in her work, in terms of the subject matter and conceptual precision.While some works are inspired by traditional Indian folk style of painting, the others are immensely personalised in their diction. One of the works titled, Tree of life, is an installation that contains embroidered pieces on cloth stretched on rings.The installation also assimilates a few drawings and text that makes for a very interesting combination for the viewers. The artists works remind the viewers about their connection and innate bond with trees, and makes a serious effort to rejuvenate the warmth and accelerate concern for the fading greenery from the face of the earth.Ujwal assimilates multiple excerpts where the stationery gains its well deserved importance. My body of work largely encompasses detailed illustrations that form a narrative, emphasising on stationery as a crucial part of human life.I have used many alternative processes and mediums to elaborate on this theme, including installations, assemblages and even graphic art, explains Ujwal in his own words. One of the works contains a series of intricately rendered drawings that resemble comic strips, while yet another work unveils the working table of the versatile genius, Leonardo Da Vinci.This installation work encompasses varied materials into an interesting visual allegory.The scattered pieces of stationery look antique, weathered and reflect the artists prowess/ strength in myriad subjects."

Later, the stock was handed over to about 90 miller agents of the region for custom milling. Accordingly, the millers delivered the rice to the designated PEGs at Koraput and Dumuriput.But, there have been complaints of regular returning of rice stock delivered at PEGs and this has evoked widespread resentment among the miller agents in the district.In a letter to the Principal Secretary, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department, the millers alleged that managers of PEGs have been deliberately rejecting their rice quota due to vested interests and are even illegally collecting `4,500 per 200 quintal rice while delivering the same from the godowns. They alleged that the PEG management has also been facilitating a few selected trucks and procuring rice quota while many millers are forced to wait for several days to supply their stock.They appealed to the Secretary to put an end to such a practice at the PEGs by disengaging private godowns. They have also threatened to stop supply of rice to PEGs if the harassment is not checked immediately.Earlier, the rice millers met the Koraput Civil Supply Officer and apprised him about their problems. They demanded that the department should direct them to other godowns, including FCI and different panchayats in the district, to stop such unruly practice. But, the plea went unheard.Though the FCI godowns in Jeypore have a storage capacity up to 1.2 lakh quintal, the Corporation is directing the millers to deliver their stocks to PEGs by paying over ` 1 crore towards space cost and transportation, they alleged."

Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac was at his eloquent best as he weaved his budget proposals around characters in M T Vasudevan Nairs works.Finance ministers often tend to embellish their proposals by quoting from their favourite writers but Isaac lavishly quoted from M Ts novels to mention schemes for various sectors. In the preface to the Budget, Isaac said presenting an annual budget during the times of demonetisation was a real challenge.M T Vasudevan Nair, the doyen of Malayalam literature, compared demonetisation drive to the reforms of Mohammed Bin Thuglak. He said, it has shattered the lives of common man. The life of common man has become unbearable. We cannot help speaking about it, he said. Though Issacs efforts were to refer to the different facets of Kerala society with M Ts characters, the speech turned out to be a ponnada for the writer.Like the Karanavar of an old Tharavadu, the Central Government has locked the granary. As described by M T in his novel Naalukettu, Valiyamama said again, Not even a single grain of rice will be given  Let me see whether you learn a lesson or not. The obstinacy is that rice will not be given. The granary is locked and the key is in his pocket. It is also being heard that he is going to sell the rice to transporters. Sir, this policy is the main reason for the present ration crisis, Isaac said.The finance minister referred to Aminummas Kuri (Nalukettu) while announcing the scheme to mobilise funds for the two state highways that are vital for improving road connectivity in Kerala.Recall the proclamation of Appunni in Nalukettu: will grow  will mature and live without fearing anyone. I am Appunni, the son of Konthunni Nair. It is a challenge to the feudal hierarchy. It is a challenge that results in the demolition of Nalukettu he said.Isaac also drew the attention of the house to the cool breeze of Nainital in Manju. He also quoted from M Ts works like Bheeru, Thettum Thiruthum, Iruttinte Athmavu and Kuttiyedathi. The eternal agonies of Malayalees were recollected at regular intervals while referring to various aspects of the budget. Ironically, like the typical M T character, Isaac had his moments of embarrassment as the budget documents got leaked and Opposition pounced on it."

Then he stirs the mixture, heats it up, adds leaves of mint, and then offers it to the people present. The resulting taste is simple and delicious.Risotto is an Italian dish, but they dont make it sweet, says Ranveer. It is more a savoury, like mushroom risotto. But I decided to make something new.Ranveer had been specially invited by Mercedes Benz for their customer engagement initiative called Luxe Drive.But this is not the first time that Ranveer has come to Kerala. Eleven years ago, he had come for a friends wedding and became enamoured of Kerala cuisine. I loved the avial I ate at the function, he says.Thereafter, he started studying Mappila food, Syrian Christian recipes and the menu of the Nampoothiri Brahmins. The fascinating part about Kerala cuisine is the way it changes across regions, he says.And he lists his favourites. The biriyani that the Mappilas make is awesome, says Ranveer. It is not refined and sophisticated. Instead, it is rustic but tasty. Similarly, the practice of sadhya was started by the Nampoothiris as a way to feed the Brahmins. I also enjoy the Syrian Christian fish curry but this is something I would like to have the next day, because it tastes good only after a day of fermentation.Asked to compare Kerala cuisine with other parts of India, Ranveer says, It cannot be compared, because for 2000 years there have been so many influences: the Romans, Arabs, Dutch, Portuguese, and British. It is a unique cuisine.And thanks to his Global Menu television show, on the Foodz channel, Ranveer is always coming across unique cuisines. The show goes off the beaten track and has focused on places like North and South Korea, Sri Lanka, Romania and Mongolia, he says.The Mongolians have a dish called Khorkhog. Chicken or lamb is cooked with vegetables and stones in a closed container. When you eat it, you can detect a slight earthiness from the stones, which makes it very tasty, says Ranveer.Apart from his TV show, Ranveer runs restaurants in the USA, Canada and India. Last year, he brought out a cookbook called Come into my kitchen. His Mumbai-based premium patisserie, English Vinglish serves fusion desserts, breads and bakes.Ranveer has done a mini-video series on Twitter titled Ranveer On The Road, which featured his culinary sojourn through Australia, apart from being a judge on Season 4 of Masterchef India.And this passion for food began in the unlikeliest of places. When he was a child, growing up in Lucknow, his grandfather Jagir Singh would take him to the gurudwara. A restless Ranveer would run around and end up at the langar. That was when I saw cooking for the first time, he says. Soon, Ranveer began helping around.At age 16, he did the unthinkable for a son of an aeronautical engineer. He ran away from home and worked at a roadside kebab shop run by a man called Munir Ahmed for eight months. However, later, he graduated from the Indian Institute of Hotel Management at Lucknow.Asked the secret to a good dish, Ranveer says, Our five fingers have five rasas: sweet, sour, salty, savoury and spicy. So, when we cook with the hand, the rasas go into the food. And when we eat with our hand, the rasas go inside us. It is important to cook honestly and sincerely because food transfers emotions. So, you are always giving a part of yourself in every dish."

Andhra Pradesh exports to Africa,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2017/mar/01/whats-causing-the-rice-price-hike-in-kerala-andhra-pradesh-exports-to-africa-1576248.html,2017-03-02,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The roots of the price spiral of rice in Kerala, which has forced the government of Pinarayi Vijayan to send an SOS to West Bengal, lie in Andhra Pradesh.Kerala imports its branded rice from Andhra Pradesh, especially its preferred Jaya variety. Prices of the Jaya variety have shot through the roof in Kerala in recent week, reaching record levels. As the government admitted in the states Assembly, rice prices have shot up by 21 per cent in the state. And the reason for this is the reduction in rice arrivals from Andhra Pradesh.Andhra Pradesh has begun exporting rice to Africa and the other southern states, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, have increased their procurement of rice from Andhra. As a consequence, prices of Andhra rice varieties have risen.With the Pinarayi Vijayan government facing heat on the rice price issue in the Assembly, the Kerala government hurriedly arranged to buy 1000 tonnes of rice from Andhra Pradesh. The Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation has finalised a deal with Andhra traders for supply of 1000 tonnes of Lalitha brand Jaya variety rice, Kerala food minister P Thilothaman.As per the deal, Kerala will get the rice for Rs 39.50 a kg. It will be sold in Keralas subsidized outlets at Rs 25 per kg and for Rs 41 in the free sale market.Concurrently, Kerala civil supplies officials are frantically knocking on the doors of West Bengal traders to place urgent orders. The Kerala State Co-operative Consumers Federation Limited (Consumerfed) is conducting the negotiations and the first consignments from West Bengal are expected to arrive in Kerala by March 10.In the Assembly, the Pinarayi government continued to be pilloried over the rice issue. M Ummer of the UDF said the government has done little to stem the price rise.Citing Tuesday prices in the Connemara Market , Palayam in Thiruvananthapuram, Ummer said the Ponni variety of rice has shot up to Rs 55 a kg, Jaya Rs 48 per kg, Pavizham brand Rs 48 per kg and Surekha Rs 43 per kg."

The FBI did not respond to requests to comment on the report.The warrant was granted as the FBI conducted a counterintelligence investigation into Russian interference in the election, an operation US intelligence later concluded was ultimately designed to help President Donald Trump to victory.The FBI began its probe, which also is examining whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow, in July.Trump has repeatedly called the Russian interference story ""fake news"" while alleging, without offering evidence, that the previous administration of president Barack Obama spied on him and his campaign.In March 2016 Trump named Page as one of his small team of foreign policy advisors, and he attended the Republican convention in July, where he and others met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.But months later Page was disavowed by the campaign, apparently in part because of the attention was drawn by his trips to Moscow, which he said were a private business.His name surfaced in a dossier or reports on links between the Trump operation and Russia complied by former British spy Christopher Steele.Page told the Post he had ""nothing to hide.""""This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,"" Page said.In March he told Fox News that he did not help the Russians in their efforts to influence the campaign.""I did nothing that could even possibly be viewed as helping them in any way,"" he said.Meanwhile, CNN reported Tuesday that recent intelligence reports brought to light by a Republican Congressman Devin Nunes did not show, as Nunes alleged, that the Obama administration combed intelligence intercepts to find information about Trump and his team.CNN said bother Republican and Democratic sources said the reports showed Obama national security advisor Susan Rice had handled the intelligence in ""normal and appropriate"" ways.Nunes was forced to step aside as chair of the House Intelligence Committee's investigation of Russian election interference due to his own mishandling of those reports."
58fd210f7be9e06c9371575e,Cyborgs at work: Employees getting implanted with microchips,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/apr/03/cyborgs-at-work-employees-getting-implanted-with-microchips-1589390.html,2017-04-03,"STOCKHOLM: The syringe slides in between the thumb and index finger. Then, with a click, a microchip is injected in the employee's hand. Another ""cyborg"" is created.What could pass for a dystopian vision of the workplace is almost routine at the Swedish startup hub Epicenter. The company offers to implant its workers and startup members with microchips the size of grains of rice that function as swipe cards: to open doors, operate printers, or buy smoothies with a wave of the hand.The injections have become so popular that workers at Epicenter hold parties for those willing to get implanted.""The biggest benefit I think is convenience,"" said Patrick Mesterton, co-founder and CEO of Epicenter. As a demonstration, he unlocks a door by merely waving near it. ""It basically replaces a lot of things you have, other communication devices, whether it be credit cards or keys.""The technology in itself is not new. Such chips are used as virtual collar plates for pets. Companies use them to track deliveries. It's just never been used to tag employees on a broad scale before. Epicenter and a handful of other companies are the first to make chip implants broadly available.And as with most new technologies, it raises security and privacy issues. While biologically safe, the data generated by the chips can show how often an employee comes to work or what they buy. Unlike company swipe cards or smartphones, which can generate the same data, a person cannot easily separate themselves from the chip.""Of course, putting things into your body is quite a big step to do and it was even for me at first,"" said Mesterton, remembering how he initially had had doubts.""But then on the other hand, I mean, people have been implanting things into their body, like pacemakers and stuff to control your heart,"" he said. ""That's a way, way more serious thing than having a small chip that can actually communicate with devices.""Epicenter, which is home to more than 100 companies and some 2,000 workers, began implanting workers in January 2015. Now, about 150 workers have them. A company based in Belgium also offers its employees such implants, and there are isolated cases around the world where tech enthusiasts have tried this out in recent years.The small implants use Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, the same as in contactless credit cards or mobile payments. When activated by a reader a few centimeters (inches) away, a small amount of data flows between the two devices via electromagnetic waves. The implants are ""passive,"" meaning they contain information that other devices can read, but cannot read information themselves.Ben Libberton, a microbiologist at Stockholm's Karolinska Institute, says hackers could conceivably gain huge swathes of information from embedded microchips. The ethical dilemmas will become bigger the more sophisticated the microchips become.""The data that you could possibly get from a chip that is embedded in your body is a lot different from the data that you can get from a smartphone,"" he says. ""Conceptually you could get data about your health, you could get data about your whereabouts, how often you're working, how long you're working, if you're taking toilet breaks and things like that.""Libberton said that if such data is collected, the big question remains of what happens to it, who uses it, and for what purpose.So far, Epicenter's group of cyborgs doesn't seem too concerned.""People ask me; 'Are you chipped?' and I say; 'Yes, why not,'"" said Fredric Kaijser, the 47-year-old chief experience officer at Epicenter. ""And they all get excited about privacy issues and what that means and so forth. And for me it's just a matter of I like to try new things and just see it as more of an enabler and what that would bring into the future.""The implants have become so popular that Epicenter workers stage monthly events where attendees have the option of being ""chipped"" for free.That means visits from self-described ""body hacker"" Jowan Osterlund from Biohax Sweden who performs the ""operation.""He injects the implants  using pre-loaded syringes  into the fleshy area of the hand, just next to the thumb. The process lasts a few seconds, and more often than not there are no screams and barely a drop of blood. ""The next step for electronics is to move into the body,"" he says.Sandra Haglof, 25, who works for Eventomatic, an events company that works with Epicenter, has had three piercings before, and her left hand barely shakes as Osterlund injects the small chip.""I want to be part of the future,"" she laughs."

These are the words that one associates with farming these days. However, amidst the gloom, a woman farmer, who refused to give in to the vagaries of nature, is a beacon of hope for the distressed. While paddy crops in various districts were damaged, A Gandhi, from Sundarappatti, who cultivated traditional paddy on her one acre field, has bagged a decent harvest of 2,650 kg, and that too, without using fertilizers.She has also got five tonnes of straw, post harvest, which could earn her some extra income.The Rural Organisation for Social Education (ROSE), an NGO, has been working towards promoting traditional paddy varieties since 2011. As part of the ROSE initiative, 15 traditional paddy varieties were cultivated in about 250 acres across 15 villages of the district.The traditional varieties promoted among farmers include Milagi, Iluppaipoo Samba, Kaivara Samba, Thanga Samba, Sembuli Samba, Kudavalai, Manjal Ponni, Karuppu Kavuni, Sivappu Kavuni, Mappilai Samba, Karudan Samba and Thuyamalli. Gandhi cultivated Thulasi, a kind of traditional paddy, in her one acre land and she harvested the crops recently in the presence of Somasundaram, development officer, NABARD, and organic farmers Appavu, Velayudham, Jeevanantham, and Adhappan, managing director, ROSE. Despite drought conditions, Gandhi got a yield of 2,650 kg of paddy and five tonnes of rice straw.Speaking to Express, Adhappan said that all these traditional paddy varieties have medicinal values and will not absorb more ground water. This proves that good yield is possible even with minimal water, no fertilizers, and low quantity of seeds, he added. As many as 150 farmers who had adopted cultivation of traditional paddy varieties have started reaping good yield, despite low rainfall."

When I told them that I was visiting the worlds most happening and luxurious city  Dubai, I found them rolling on the floor, laughing and asking me how I would survive in Dubai. I just facepalmed them and walked away. I left for Dubai half-heartedly because even I was not sure I would survive being a vegetarian in Dubai. But then...Global approach:As I settled down with my seatbelt and my book on the Emirates EK 527, I was filled with excitement on my first trip to Dubai. I checked into Rove City Centre hotel and realised there was a supermarket on the ground floor. I felt relieved,thinking I would survive on chips and sodas, if not on paneer and baigan. The view of the skyscrapers from the hotel room ensured the Dubai feeling soaked in. We headed off to Global Village. Well, before we get into food, let me brief about the worlds only place where we find America and Russia under one roof. Wondering how? Global Village has pavilions of all the countries representing their culture, food and shopping activities. Guess what! Indian pavilion represented our country in the real sense of the term. While the other countries co-existed in silence, Indian pavilion had Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Kajarare playing in high decibels.The special tea at the African pavilion awakened all my senses and I was all set for the surprises Dubai was throwing at me. After some adventure with roller coasters, I went to Thailand arena just to relish those fresh-cut exotic fruits like dragon fruit, wild pineapple and peaches. Well, they are available at every supermarket in our city, but the Thai fruits were bigger and juicier. They were organic and tastier. While walking through the sprawling Fun Park, I stumbled upon Turkish ice cream stall and the magic that they weaved with it won me over. Nutella donuts to nutella icecreams and tarts, the hazelnut and chocolate lovers can go crazy. We stopped by the Grand Barbeque, anIndian restaurant to have our dinner along with our new Syrian friend, an employee of Global Village. The joy of making him taste the spicy panipuri and Afghani paneer with masala kulcha was thrilling beyond words. Just like in the movie Queen, he got teary-eyed when he first tasted the spicy pudina and imli pani, but later he couldnt resist from eating more. Well, I felt good turning into the panipuri wala bhaiya temporarily. The dinner was complete at the Chinese pavilion with some steaming hot jasmine tea.Ripe Market:After a scrumptious breakfast at the hotel, we went to Zabeel Park and were introduced to a concept called Ripe Market. Here farmers and food creators from the world over gather and exhibit what they offer to the world. Well, I got to taste caramel and lotus-flavoured iced-tea and cow milk icecream, various hybrid varieties of olives, white honey, queens honey, mountain honey, Mexican pina colada, organically grown fresh fruits, vegetables and more than 90 varieties of cooking oils. In addition of all these raw food, we got to indulge in some doughnuts, cupcakes and brownies.Beach Canteen:We Indians are used to eating at the beach. Arent we? Bhajjis, peanuts, corn and what not but the experience of having organised stalls of gourmet brands from across the globe. Well, what else can a man ask for! Clean beach, plethora of food and of course some music and dance. The live cooking sessions too were attractive, but surely not for the vegetarians. Beach Canteen at the Kite Beach had everything one could die for. Waffles with fresh cream and fruits to Japanese veg sushi to Lebanese style of cheese samosa,the authentic Emirati sweet delicacy- Luqaimat. It is fried dumplings with some date syrup or caramel syrup on it. I bet, one cant stop with one. It is as addictive as Lays or Kurkure. Some cold pressed organic drinks containing vegetables, fruits and herbs with names like Better than Botox replaced the regular aerated drinks. I tried all their flavours. Haagen-Dazs ice cream completed the beach experience.Street Night:The pop culture in Dubai is just beyond imagination. After having the taste of global platter at the Beach Canteen, the evening began with some street style food trail. Battle of BBoys welcomed us to the Street Nights where people thronged to get some chilled out vibes and sample the hottest street food vendors. Regions top graffiti artists too jammed in a live graffiti, adding to those vibes. Guess what was the best part of Street Night, Kaapi.. Kaapi Filter Kaapi! We Indians always manage to mark our presence and stand out. Well, coming to food, a young South Indian boy owns a food truck called Wokinakki, where he serves you the recipe of happiness. The fusion of Thai and Indian veg rice bowl made the non-vegetarians turn green in envy. Yes! The falvours of Thai curry with exotic vegetables and a pinch of Indian masala made the dish stand out among all the other rolls and sandwiches. Moving to the Egyptian stall, I was wondering, if I would get something non-meaty and to my surprise, a dish called Kushdari, made of rice, noodles and crispy macaroni with the right amount of spices gave me an insight into the fact that there are vegetarians in every country and it is not always about meat. Just to add fun to my goal-worthy food trails, I tried some lemon-mango popsicles. Oh wait, the Poland stall offered me some charcoal lemonade and Dutch offered me some cheese sandwich. Perhaps it is a global tradition to end the meal with a dessert and at Street Night, it was at Cryspes. It was fritters with preferred flavour topping. The toppings varied from caramel, nutella to the famous Lotus biscuits of Dubai.Comptoir 102The third day at Dubai started off on a healthy note. Comptoir 102 on Jumeriah road offered us more than just healthy food. Winner of the Whats On Award of the best Healthy cafe in Dubai, Comptoir 102 is one among the favourite places for healthy eating. The philosophy behind the caf is to offer a more conscious and healthy lifestyle by bringing more sustainable and nutritious food. The cafe had French ambience and arty stuff around were a delight to eyes. The cafe sources ingredients from local organic farms, sugar-free and dairy-free, with raw, vegan and gluten free options menu, changes daily according to harvest, just like at home. The smoothies and juices are vitamin-packed. We were served Skinny Boast- a smoothie made of cucumber, banana and basil, Heaven on earth- a smoothie made of cinnamon, cocoa and banana. Acaio, almond butter porridge, chocolate porridge and pancakes surprise my tummy that was full of junk.City Walk:From a simple milk chocolate to exotic dark chocolate, the mall had chocolates from all parts of the world. If this is not called heaven, then what is! Just when I was relishing those chocolates, I was introduced to a new snack called French fries. Puzzled? Well, these were sweet potato french fries. This just goes to prove that no matter how ugly potato looks, the output of it is delicious and addictive.Kak:At the Lebanese canteen, we tasted Kak. It is a bread with sesame seeds and a filling of our choice. For the sweet tooth, it was nutella Kak and for the chessy people, it was the herb and cheese. This authentic Lebanese dish has a history of being the most favourite street food of the middle eastern countries.We had dinner at Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai on the last night of our trip and it was exotic. Chef Atul Kochhars team ensured we were served unique dishes. The yam starter was simple, but most memorable. Wait a bit to know more about his venture and food.(The writer was invited to get familiarised with the Dubai Food Festival by Dubai Tourism)"
58fd22767be9e06c93715941,"Once critical of global deals, Trump slow to pull out of any",http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/apr/20/once-critical-of-global-deals-trump-slow-to-pull-out-of-any-1595828.html,2017-04-20,"WASHINGTON: The ""America First"" president who vowed to extricate America from onerous overseas commitments appears to be warming up to the view that when it comes to global agreements, a deal's a deal.From NAFTA to the Iran nuclear agreement to the Paris climate accord, President Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric is colliding with the reality of governing. Despite repeated pledges to rip up, renegotiate or otherwise alter them, the U.S. has yet to withdraw from any of these economic, environmental or national security deals, as Trump's past criticism turns to tacit embrace of several key elements of U.S. foreign policy.The administration says it is reviewing these accords and could still pull out of them. A day after certifying Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attacked the accord and listed examples of Iran's bad behavior. His tone suggested that even if Iran is fulfilling the letter of its nuclear commitments, the deal remains on unsure footing.Yet with one exception  an Asia-Pacific trade deal that already had stalled in Congress  Trump's administration quietly has laid the groundwork to honor the international architecture of deals it has inherited. It's a sharp shift from the days when Trump was declaring the end of a global-minded America that negotiates away its interests and subsidizes foreigners' security and prosperity.Trump had called the Iran deal the ""worst"" ever, and claimed climate change was a hoax. But in place of action, the Trump administration is only reviewing these agreements, as it is doing with much of American foreign policy.Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, said Trump may be allowing himself to argue in the future that existing deals can be improved without being totally discarded. ""That allows him to tell his base that he's getting a better deal than Bush or Obama got, and yet reassure these institutions that it's really all being done with a nod and a wink, that Trump doesn't mean what he says,"" Brinkley said.So far, there's been no major revolt from Trump supporters, despite their expectation he would be an agent of disruption. This week's reaffirmations of the status quo came via Tillerson's certification of Iran upholding its nuclear deal obligations and the administration delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.The president had previously spoken about dismantling or withdrawing from both agreements as part of his vision, explained in his inaugural address, that ""every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""The Iran certification, made 90 minutes before a midnight Tuesday deadline, means Tehran will continue to enjoy relief from U.S. nuclear sanctions. Among the anti-deal crowd Trump wooed in his presidential bid, the administration's decision is fueling concerns that Trump may let the 2015 accord stand.Tillerson on Wednesday sought to head off any criticism that the administration was being easy on Iran, describing a broad administration review of Iran policy that includes the nuclear deal and examines if sanctions relief serves U.S. interests. The seven-nation nuclear deal, he said, ""fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran"" and ""only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.""On the climate agreement, the White House postponed a meeting Tuesday where top aides were to have hashed out differences on what to do about the non-binding international deal forged in Paris in December 2015. The agreement allowed rich and poor countries to set their own goals to reduce carbon dioxide and went into effect last November, after the U.S., China and other countries ratified it. Not all of Trump's advisers share his skeptical views on climate change  or the Paris pact.Trump's position on trade deals also has evolved. He had promised to jettison the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada unless he could substantially renegotiate it in America's favor, blaming NAFTA for devastating the U.S. manufacturing industry by incentivizing the use of cheap labor in Mexico.Now his administration is only focused on marginal changes that would preserve much of the existing agreement, according to draft guidelines that Trump's trade envoy sent to Congress. The proposal included a controversial provision that lets companies challenge national trade laws through private tribunals.Trump has followed through with a pledge to pull the U.S. out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping free trade deal President Barack Obama negotiated. The agreement was effectively dead before Trump took office after Congress refused to ratify it. Even Trump's Democratic opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, opposed the accord.But on NATO, Trump has completely backed off his assertions that the treaty organization is ""obsolete."" His Cabinet members have fanned out to foreign capitals to show America's support for the alliance and his administration now describes the 28-nation body as a pillar of Western security."

Following complaints, the food delivered to pourakarmikas by ISKCON Akshaya Patra was tested at the Public Health Institute recently and the report stated it is unsatisfactory.Meals are supplied to over 30,000 pourakarmikas in all the 198 wards every day.According to BBMP sources, pourakarmikas working in Chickpet ward complained about the food. Rice was stale and watery. Samples of the food were sent to the Public Health Institute for testing, they said. Documents available with Express said the microbiological quality of the rice is unsatisfactory.However, ISKCON said Akshaya Patra delivers food to pourakarmikas by 10 am and it is to be consumed by 10.30 am. It will be fit for consumption up to 11 am. If the samples are collected after this time, the food may not pass the microbiological tests. It is learnt that the food samples were collected at 11.30 am which is beyond the intended time for safe consumption, it said.BBMP Joint Commissioner (Health) Sarfaraz Khan said ISKCON provides good food every day and officials who go on inspection eat the same food. We do not know what happened in this case... Now we have sent a notice to ISKCON asking for its reply. Till we get an answer, we cannot comment on it, he said.Vinay Sreenivas, a member of Alternative Law Forum who fights for rights of pourakarmikas, said the quantity and the quality of food given to the civic workers are not good. Pourakarmikas say there is no nutrition in their food, he said."
58fd22e77be9e06c937159dc,Pricey Veggies,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/apr/04/pricey-veggies-1589874.html,2017-04-05,"KOCHI: The goods lorry strike and harsh summer will have an adverse effect on the vegetable market, say traders. South Indian states are already reeling under the heat wave which is expected to take a heavy toll on the vegetable price. The increase in demand during the Vishu-Easter season is likely to push the vegetable prices further.Because of the recent lorry strike, there will be a shortage of vegetables in the market in the coming days, especially those items coming from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Though the domestic production has seen a surge in the last few months, the scorching summer and water scarcity have taken a toll on the organic farms in Kerala. Vegetable Promotion Council officials said because of vigorous promotions and awareness campaigns conducted by the government, more and more people in the state have begun cultivating vegetables.But the quantity is not sufficient to meet the requirement and the volume of production is very less compared to Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu still remains a major supplier of vegetables to Kerala, added the officials.The Meteorological Department has forecast that the intense heat will continue and the state is likely to witness one of the worst droughts of the last few decades. Vegetables, especially perishable items, spoil faster during summer due to adverse atmospheric conditions.Many private parties have set up organic vegetable outlets in Ernakulam. The prices of organic vegetables are almost double the rate at which the same items are sold by the local vendors. The price along with the limited availability are the reasons which make organic vegetables unaffordable for the common man, said Cyril Mathew, a trader.Many voluntary organisations, which promote green farming, are organising fairs during the Vishu season. However, the summer heat has started to affect such farms. The vegetables cultivated at such farms include long beans, bitter gourd and cucumber.Too much heat and too much of rain will have an adverse effect on vegetable cultivation. Vishu is another season like Onam when there is a surge in vegetable demand. This year, the lack of adequate stock of vegetables is likely to result in price hike, added Cyril.Meanwhile, among other essential commodities, the price of rice remains steady.

I have always been a foodie and hailing from the South of Tamil Nadu, I had the opportunity to taste and relish a wide array of cuisines  from Madurai to Virudunagar and Tirunelveli, I have savoured it all! But becoming a chef was never a planned decisionone led to another and I got into hotel management. Gradually, I became fascinated with the profession and here I am!I love travelling and in the last two decades, I have travelled to many countries. Specialising in the European and Mediterranean cuisine happened through all my travel-cum-food expeditions (smiles). One such memorable experience was in Mauritiusworking with chefs there taught me the nuances of cooking delicious Mauritian food. The usage of herbs and spices in Mauritian dishes are similar to that of Indian cuisine  turmeric, cardamom, thyme, curry leaves and coriander are most common. Sounds similar to what we use, doesnt it? Yes, they like spicy food too.But for me, developing my skills in cooking has always been experimentation and if I have to reveal something about my home kitchen experiencehere goes: I have never entered the kitchen at home! My wife and mother dont let me enter the kitchen (laughs).I have a keen interest in learning new thingsand my love for trying out organic food is beyond words. In fact, I use organic materials for my preparations and I even have an organic farm in the hotel. We grow our own veggies and herbs. The freshness of ripe organic tomatoes and brinjal can be experienced only when you taste it!I support organic food and I try and help local cultivators with their produceits their livelihood.I do a lot of molecular and progressive cooking, plus, I fuse cuisines  Indian with a touch of European and so on. When it comes to my personal preference, my palette is simple. A bowl of rice with rasam and vegetable is enough for me to savour and relish.But I have a confessionI have a sweet tooth! I love the velvety chocolate pudding and chocolate marquiseanything with chocolate and cheese  I am all for it (chuckles). The Tuscan brick chicken, which is heated over a brick, on a grill and the lamb loin are my specialties. The brick chicken has a rustic taste and aroma and is a brilliant choice.Like I said, I rarely cook for my family and I enjoy eating their food. If theres something I would like to prepare for them, it would be the classic mutton biriyani  made in the traditional way  with seeraga sambha rice, and of course, hand-ground masalas.Its always been my dream to do a back-pack trip across Europe and learn their traditional food. What we see in menus here are just a part of itapart from this, there are several authentic cuisines. Similarly, in India, not many know that there is something beyond Chettinad in South. Theres Nilgiris, Madurai, Virudhunagar, Kongunadu cuisine and many more. If I were to retire and cook a particular cuisine for the rest of my life, I would definitely choose Indian."

But when chef Alexander offers you his steaming canary-yellow pumpkin soup, you are instantly tempted. It comes with a subtle, silky texture, enhanced by the sweet, familiar flavour of coconut milk. And, instead of the traditional garlic bread arrives regular baguette garnished with cinnamon and pepper. The chef brilliantly brings in three Kerala elements in this international dish- cinnamon, pepper and coconut milk.If you ever fancied a slightly tweaked or spicier version of gourmet cuisine, a little hatke from the regular fare, the Taj Gateway Hotel at Varkala is the place to visit. The newly-joined chef Alexander specialises in fusion cuisine, giving continental delicacies a desi twist. Its crucial to maintain the balance while replacing dairy cream with coconut milk. If the flavour is overpowering, it will totally ruin the character of the classic English soup, he says. The roasted pumpkin soup is a slow preparation where the pumpkin undergoes oven-roasting before pureeing to lock in the flavour and nutrients.Milk from all coconuts are not suitable for creaming a dish. Certain parts in Kerala like Varkala and Alappuzha are known for creamier coconuts. The quality of a coconut is dependent on the soil it grows and its distance from the ocean, chips in Ashirbad Praharaj, general manager.He calls it a western-recipes-meet-Indian-ingredients menu as some risottos with red-spicy prawns roll in. While making risotto, the rich creamy Italian rice dish, the chef opts for bamboo rice, another local specialty. The short organic rice grains add a unique edge to its taste and consistency.We find the risottos super yummy, and the prawns fried in Syrian Christian style juicy and sharpened with the right amount of spices. Here most of our guests are Europeans and they normally indulge in western cuisine. But the new menu I created is a blend of local and global culinary elements, he says.Next comes grilled fish on a bed of green peas, fennel and potato mesh. Usually its sea bass, a neutral-flavored fish thats used for the preparation. But here we are using a denser, full-bodied local fish, he says.The dish, that comes with fine raw papaya ribbons on top of it, is soft and moderately spiced. Another item on menu is Rack of lamb, a New Zealand dish for which the chef uses a sauce made of demy glaze and red wine.  I do mild alterations to many original recipes without taking away the authenticity. By customising it to suit local taste, we create a little drama around the same old dish. Some call it fusion cooking, I call it personalisation, he adds.Choco mocha walnut brownie de milky ganache, a dessert so divine, turns out to be the perfect finale for our fusion dinner. But this time there is no local tweak. There are some preparations that are too perfect for customisation and this one belongs to that league, says the chef."

The main course has Pike Perch Filet and Endive, Veal Tenderloin and Garden Vegetables, and Guinea Fowl Breast Melba. In all there are seven savouries made using vanilla.The White onion Velout is prepared using white wine. The mild-flavoured white flesh of white onions adds a sweetness and a creamy texture to the soup. It is served in a coupe soup bowl with the white onion cut in a barrel or cylindrical shape, dipped in the soup. It is pleasant and soothing.Topped with bits of cheese, the Goat Cheese and Fig Salad has an overpowering bitterness of fresh greens. The Guinea Fowl Breast Melba was served with turkey, instead of guinea fowl because the other meat is difficult to get in India, informs the chef Gaurav Bathla. The meat is fibrous and tasted like hard chicken. It is served with boiled potatoes.The Pike Perch Filet and Endive is a fish delicacy. The boneless fish is delicate and melts in your mouth. The Sashimi of Tuna tastes better than the one of salmon. The fish, sliced thin, is bland and the sticky rice is a bit too chewy like gum.The Vanille Sale promotion is on till March 21 in all the Movenpick Hotel and Spa outlets.Price for two: `1,300 + taxes"

Sounds good?Chef Sathya, Hablis HotelI have been a chef for a year now. Previously I have worked in Le Meridian Chennai, London Hilton, Arbutus. My first job was in Le Meridian Chennai, which I got through campus, and my first-ever experience of cooking was when I took it up as a profession;I made a salad of tandoori, prawns and pineapple and garnished it with different peppers and lemonade sauces. When it comes to my favourites, I always prefer European food, particularly pork belly, beef burger and roasted salmon dish. I am a serious person when it comes to cooking and I am really focused!Spice or sweet; it doesnt really mater! What matters is the balance of taste. If there is one ingredient I cant live without, it would probably be potato, because when I was in London for long, we would eat lots of potatoes in different forms and it was part of our diet.Without potatoes, nothing works in the kitchen!(laughs) They contain starch and carbohydrates which is must in every meal. In Europe probably we either have mashed potatoes or baked potato and even boiled potatoes part of every meal.I have no specific person in mind that I want to cook for but to be specific, it would be a sportsperson and I will look at the preference of his taste, based on that, I will decide the menu and start cooking. If the person is a non-vegetarian I would go for braised lamb with potato, carrot puree, rice and hazelnut. If he is a vegetarian, probably something with cheese.Talking about experimenting with food, I do a lot and well, fusion is part of our job. For instance, we had lemongrass chicken cooked with Asian flavours, the combination was a success because of the different tastes and flavours that blend in together.Now settled in Chennai, I must confess that my food experience has been very minimal. Nevertheless, I always look out for samosas in Chennai and mixed chaats and snacks in Pudhucherry!"

The ban will come into effect from April.According to sources, the Corporation has been procuring rice from millers and stocking it in rice receiving centres (RRC) of 14 blocks and four Notified Area Councils (NACs) of the district as per norms.The officials of different panchayats, teachers of government schools and officials of Integrated Child Development Schemes (ICDS) used to procure their monthly requirement of rice from block-level RRC as per the guidelines under different PDS, mid-day meal and hot cooked schemes of the government. Accordingly, about 70,000 quintals of rice used to be delivered to the agencies every month.But in February, the Corporation issued a circular to Koraput District Civil Supply Officer (DCSO) informing him about abolition of six RRCs of Lamtaput, Kundra, Boipariguda, Bandhugam and Laxmipur in Maoist-hit blocks. The DCSO was directed to facilitate the agencies to procure rice from millers and stock it in Koraput, Dumuriput private entrepreneur godowns and Orissa State Warehousing Corporation godowns of Jeypore, Borrigumma and Kotpad for further delivery of rice to the agencies concerned. This has led to resentment among the agencies.If the new order is implemented, the beneficiary schools and other organisations of six blocks would have to travel more than 100 km to get even smaller quantity of rice from government godowns.A member of Self-Help Group Gouri Gadava said, We have to transport three quintals of rice for our SHG from Koraput godown which would mean additional cost.The Civil Supply Corporation should take ground realities into consideration before implementing such decisions, said a teacher of Kundra.The rice receiving agencies, on the other hand, would have to pay 100 per cent extra transportation cost while lifting their required stocks from the godowns. Earlier, the rice receiving agencies had appealed to the Collector to reconsider the decision but in vain.District Civil Supply sources clarified that they would act as per the direction of the Corporation. Some of the angry beneficiaries have met Koraput MP Jhinna Hikaka and requested him to intervene in the matter."

The festival menu is available for lunch and dinner at My Indian Oven.Dhal Churchuree is green moong dal and topped with ghee. It is thick in consistency, is smooth and flavourful.Platform Potatoes is a dry preparation of spiced fried potatoes and has dry mint in it. I love potatoes, so I had no complaints with this one, especially with the vegetable taking the centre stage with this one. The dish also has bites of jeera, so for all sukhi bhaaji fans, this one is a must.The Baluchi Kabhuli Pulav is a chickpea pilaf, served with raita. The rice is flavourful with spices, however none of the masalas or the spices overpower the other. I truly enjoyed this pulav.A special mention to the chefs dal makhani. Hands down, the best one I have had ever. The dish isnt part of the food festival menu, but I had heard good things about this dal and I couldnt help myself from ordering one. The daal makhani is buttery smooth, laced with malai, thick in conistency and tastes purely of daal and is full of flavour. If you are at My Fortune, Bengaluru; you have got to order this dal.Nargisi Kofta is a preparation od mutton mince coated boiled egg kofta served in a sweet gravy. The outer coating of boiled eggs tastes like sausage.Canteen Machhi reminds one of Bengali preparation of fish curry because of its heavy mustard flavour and prominent use of turmeric. The boneless fish is cooked well.If you happen to order dessert from the a la carte, then do ask for beetroot halwa and rasmalai served with ice cream. The halwa is smooth, with just the right amount of sweetening and served hot with shredded badam toppings.The rasmalai and ice cream combination is sure to win your heart."

I started my career with a reputed hotel group in Goa, and it was there that I fi rst got exposed to the nuances of Western cuisine, which I subsequently adopted. It was a senior chef from France who fi rst introduced me to this challenging cuisine. He told me that it would be doubly hard for me as I was taking on dishes that were not native to me.I would have to learn everything from scratch  the ingredients, cooking techniques, or presentation. To do that perfectly and at the same time satisfy the customers taste buds was a challenge. I was also introduced to German cuisine while serving on a cruise liner  nothing can substitute learning on the job. It was my fi rst time using fruits such as apricots and peaches fresh, as they are mostly used dry in Indian cuisine. I realised my fl air for Italian cuisine soon after I met a colleague from New Zealand who also specialised it.I was completely blown away by his dishes and presentation, because until then I was only exposed to a very continental style of cooking. I was introduced to homemade pizzas and pastas. One of the signature dishes that I have made is called ossobuco, braised veal shanks cooked in fl avours of cinnamon and bay leaf and served with a garnish of garlic and lemon juice. The interesting thing is that there are two ways to cook ossobuco  authentic and modern. A special preparation of the dish ossobuco alla Milanese is served with Risotto alla Milanese, which is a rice dish cooked and served in a broth with a creamy consistency.In fact, many of the dishes that are my specialty have been incorporated in the Italian Food Festival, which ends today. I believe you should engage a customer with all fi ve senses when he is presented a dish  so the presentation should refl ect that sentiment. Food is not just about taste, it is about making it visually appealing and to the other senses as well. Also, hard work and punctuality need to be ingrained from the start, the cooking will then follow automatically. The connection people have through food is so innate that one does not need language to portray it. Early in my career, at the breakfast counter in the hotel I was working in, I happened to take an order from a Russian lady who had to wait a tad longer for her meal. Once I presented the dish, I tried using my own sign language to convey my apologies  as I did not know Russian and she didnt speak English! She appreciated my dish in her own way. A translator confi rmed this later to me."

Urging people to vote for the BJP in the Zilla Parishad and see the difference for themselves, he said if BJP candidates are elected, he will take the onus of development on himself and fulfil the dreams and aspirations of people.Accusing the BJD of spearheading falsehood against him, he dared the ruling party to take action against him on charges levelled against him by the Higher Education Minister, Pradip Panigrahi. Pradhan also visited Junagarh block and charged the BJD Government of hijacking Central welfare schemes and renaming them.Alleging that the BJD-led State Government was corrupt, he cited issues of rice recycling, nexus with rice millers, mining scam, chit fund and called upon people to give a befitting reply to the BJD in the Panchayat poll. He said it was unfortunate that despite 17 years of being in power, the BJD has failed to improve the condition of Kalahandi.Star campaigner of BJD, cine star and Rajya Sabha MP Anubhav Mohanty also campaigned for BJD candidates in Madanpur Rampur and Narla blocks and appealed people to vote for the BJD.

The state government plans to form a consortium of Consumerfed and primary cooperative societies, which will raise a capital of Rs 100 crores.According to Cooperation Department special secretary P Venugopal, a pilot project will be launched using the fund raised by the consortium.A special purchase committee comprising members of cooperative societies, which procure rice from other states, has been formed.It will hold talks with rice mill owners and paddy procuring societies in states like Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Since profit is not the motto, consumers can be sure of getting rice at lower prices, said Venugopal.Two types of matta rice is sold in Kerala - long grain matta and short grain matta.Long grain matta is procured from private mill owners and sold at `48-50/kg, while short grain matta is priced between `35 and `39/kg.The Jaya variety, which is another favourite of Keralites, is priced at `45-47/kg, while Kuruva is sold for `32-36/kg.Usually, private rice mills in the state procure paddy from other states, including Karnataka, at `28/kg.

The previous record was 106.65 mt in 2013-14.Wheat output is projected to be 96.64 mt this year as against 92.29 mt in 2015-16. It may be noted that last year's wheat output has been revised downwards from 93.50 mt. The previous record was 95.85 mt achieved in 2013-14 crop year.In the case of pulses, the output is projected to be all-time high at 22.14 mt this year as against actual output of 16.35 mt last year. The previous record was 19.25 mt in 2013-14.The output, however, is still short of the country's estimated demand of 23-24 million tonnes. But the likely rise in output will reduce the country's dependence on imports.Coarse cereal output is estimated to be a record 44.34 mt this year as against 38.52 mt last year. The previous record was 43.40 mt in 2013-14.The foodgrain basket comprises wheat, rice, pulses and coarse cereals.Oilseed production is also pegged at a record 33.60 mt this year with soyabean output likely to be 14.13 mt, groundnut 8.47 mt and castorseed 1.74 mt.Last year, oilseed output was 25.25 mt and the previous record was 32.75 mt in 2013-15.Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated at 32.51 million bales (of 170 kg each) this year, as against 30 million bales last year.However, sugarcane output is likely to be lower at 309.98 mt this year as against 348.44 mt last year, while jute and mesta output is estimated to be lower at 10.06 million bales (of 180 kg each) as against 10.52 million bales last year.The government releases total four estimates on foodgrains production before the final one at different stages of production and harvesting period."

Thus an inflow of orders from Iran, even after the import ban is lifted, remains to be seen, it said.""Iran is a major export destination for Indian Basmati rice and decline in demand from Iran has played a role in the declining realisations of exports from India -- from USD 1298/MT in FY2014 to USD 784/MT in 8M FY2017,"" ICRA Assistant Vice President Deepak Jotwani said.Over the years, the Iranian Government has imposed a ban on import of Basmati rice from time to time, as per the movement in inventory held by its rice traders and also to safeguard the interests of local farmers. Iran last imposed a ban on import of Basmati in July 2016.The Indian government sent a trade delegation to Iran in January 2017 to resolve the issue. While there has been no official notification from Iran, a group of large Basmati rice importers in Iran recently capped the price of Basmati rice imports at USD 850/MT, the report said.In another adverse development for the industry, the US recently imposed fresh trade sanctions on Iran, which restrains Iran's use of the US dollar for trade. These two developments have created uncertainty around the resumption of Basmati rice exports to Iran, ICRA said.West Asian countries continue to account for the major chunk of Basmati imports; nearly 75 per cent of Indian Basmati rice exports in FY2016 were to these nations.Within West Asia, Iran and Saudi Arabia are the two largest buyers, together accounting for 40-50 per cent of total Basmati rice exports from India."

Paddy procurement is in full swing in most of the districts except Kandhamal where the the process will start from next week, Joint Director (Procurement) in the Food Supply and Consumer Welfare department B K Prusty said.Setting a target to procure 30 lakh tonnes of rice for the 2016-17 kharif marketing season (KMS), the state government started the procurement operation from Bargarh district on November 29 last year. Since post harvest operation of paddy is still on in many parts of the state, the state government requested the Ministry of Agriculture to extend the paddy procurement deadline from March 30 to end of April, 2017, he said.Besides, demonetisation of high currentcy notes impacted paddy procurement as the agencies involved in procurement could not pay the minimum support price to the farmers due to cash crunch. About 17.45 lakh tonnes of paddy (equivalent to 11.87 lakh tonnes of rice) worth Rs 2,562 crore has been procured till date and Rs 2,012 crore has been credited to bank accounts of farmers, Prusty added.This year procurement of paddy has been five percent more as compared to the corresponding period last year. About 16.63 lakh tonnes of paddy were procured by this time last year. Registered rice millers have already delivered 2,46,490 tonnes of rice to the state government.The Odisha State Civil Supplies Corporation (OSCSC) is the principal procurement agency of the State Government. The corporation is procuring paddy in all the 30 districts through Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACS), pani panchayats, Large Scale Agriculture Multipurpose Societies (LAMPS) and women self help groups. The Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has introduced paddy procurement automation system (P-PAS) in 294 of the 314 blocks of the state. The remaining 20 blocks do not have surplus paddy for procurement.The custom milled rice collected under the decentralised procurement system are supplied under the public distribution system in the state. The surplus rice was delivered to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The deadline for Kharif paddy procurement is March while for Rabi crop it is June. FCI will not accept rice from the paddy procured beyond the stipulated time frame."

She glides into the kitchen effortlessly to prepare masala puffed rice and asks us if we like it spicy or bland. All of these activities with a contagious smile on her face. Whats so different about her, you ask? Well, her personality can effortlessly make us realise, how disability is just in our head. Surbhi Mudgal, the free-spirited, independent girl, who lost her vision to brain fever in her middle school, is now a pioneering software developer and a blazing beauty pageant participant. Above all this vivacious girl who lives in Ameerpet is one who despises taking anyones help in her activities.I know there is someone sitting there, but I cant figure out if it is guy or girl, she says in the most unapologetic and unsympathetic tone, leaving us inspired within seconds of the meet.Now, she is all set to inspire others too as she has been chosen to part of Mumbai photographer Somsubhro Sarkaars photo exhibition titled My Identity My Pride where he is featuring 51 inspiring women achievers across the country. She shows off her one-minute video where she says how people with vision often fail to see the real world.Surbhi was in eighth grade when the ruthless brain fever affected her optical nerves. She gradually lost her sight. I am an independent girl now. My journey included depression, societal struggle and a lot more but I have battled them enough that they dont bother me any more. Despite being challenged, I do everything and I am proud of it, she smiles.Her fashion quotient is impeccable. Ask her if she enjoys shopping, she jumps from the couch and says, I love shopping at the malls. It is comfortable and I get assistance as well from the people there. I pick on their brain until they give what I want. I even write appreciation letters to them so that they will help me when I visit again. Sometimes I dont get good assistance. They will just tell me its blue or pink, they dont tell me it is indigo, turquoise or navy blue. I question them incessantly. If I like something and dont buy, it haunts me badly. I immediately take an auto or cab and rush to buy it. There were some embarrassing situations when I picked up wrong ones, but after I got back home, my mother was proud of my choice. I prefer going alone for shopping, she shares.How does she commute? I trust the cab or auto drivers. I have a good orientation about the places I frequent, since I didnt have this challenge from the beginning. , she informs in a determined tone.Doesnt she have trust issues? Surabhi quips, If I dont trust, I should lock up myself within these four walls. I have no other option, but to trust them. In any case, who is safe? Are you safe? No one is. Even you are vulnerable,Elaborating about her her job, I am an app tester with a software company in Hyderabad. I test MS products using screen readers where the system reads out about the image. We work to make the apps friendly for people who have challenges. For example, it the screen reader says image, what will the challenged understand? So we navigate in a way that it is comprehensible. Instead of image, it will read out girl in the garden, she explains.I have taken basic training on how to screen read from LV Prasad after being rejected 10 times. It was tough for me to prove my strength as people would ask me You are blind, what will you work. But I managed to get a placement from LV Prasad. The nature of job is on par with other jobs, it cannot be written off, she narrates.Surbhi studied in Kalpa school, Banjara Hills, and did her intermediate from St Anns college. She graduated from Nagarjuna Degree College. Graduation was depressing. I did not have strength to go to college. I stayed back at home, she says.Bouncing back to her enchanting self, she tells us how she was introduced to beauty pageant. Dr Samir Mansuri introduced the concept of visually impaired girls walking the ramp. LV Prasad Hospital informed me about a beauty contest for the visually impaired girls and if I was interested in taking part in it. My joy knew no boundaries. There were four rounds. In talent round, I emulated Hrithik from Koi Mil Gaya and Kareena from K3G. Out of 41, I was shortlisted for top 15, she proudly informs.She is not going for the next rounds of the pageant and the reason is goosebumps initiating. I cant give up on my job. I cant take leave for three weeks. I cant be without going to office for so long. If I am late by at least half hour, I feel lost. Besides, I hate competition. I want to be free and bindass. It will help me give my best and makes me feel positive.Surbhi was excited to watch Kaabil, a January 2017 Bollywood release starring Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam who play visually challenged characters, but she came back with a frown after watching the movie. They portray as if only blind people have problems, but its not, even normal people have problems, she brushes it off.Surbhi says, I want to marry a blind because he will empathise with my pain. Why cant I make another blind persons life colourful? Wouldnt a normal guy have problem in taking me out for a party. Wouldnt he have a problem with my squint eyes, she asks in a stern voice.She wants to set an identity for herself and she has been successful already. People ask me why I travel by bus, all alone, when my dad owns four cars. I tell them they are his cars, not mine, she says sipping her hot ginger tea. I hate the fact that I cant drive, she adds.Surbhi will turn 25 on May 26 and she is planning for a party, where she wants all her friends to bring her 25 gifts. It could be 25 papers or candies, but has to be 25 gifts, she laughs. Besides cooking, Surbhi enjoys dance, mimicry and watching astrology videos. Her greatest fear is being dependent on someone. Her dream is to help build a world where the differently abled are not made to feel inferior. As someone who works in a software accessibility field, she feels she can use her remaining 5 percent eyesight to help software developers create apps and software, which can help the disabled people use the modern gadgets flawlessly.Surbhi says that being independent is a big step in overcoming ones disability. Use technology to get ahead. From sensors to special apps and customised phones, there is a lot for people like me.I also want to travel the world, know different cultures and cuisines, she adds.Life is hell for people who are completely blind. I only pray to God to leave whatever is left with me. I dont complaint for what he has taken, but pray to just leave me with whatever is left, she concludes with her signature smile."

In the last 16 years, Odisha has only remained backward without any sign of development, he said.Addressing an election rally at Mohana on Friday, Pradhan said if voted to power, the BJP, under the leadership of Narendra Modi, will ensure development at panchayat level.The BJD-run State Government is corrupt and voters have already realised the inefficiency of the party which is evident from the results of first and second phase polling.Dana Majhi and issues like malnutrition deaths, Japanese Encephalitis hit the headlines last year. BJD leaders are involved in chit fund and other scams and looted the hard earned money of poor people, he said.Speaking on the occasion, district president of BJP, G Venkat Ravana, said Gajapati district saw no development under the BJD rule. There have been gross irregularities in implementation of welfare schemes in the district, he alleged, while appealing to people to vote for BJP candidates in the rural election. Apparently, the BJP has won just two of the nine zones in the district in the last three phases of polling. The party retained both the ZP zones in Rayagada block of Gajapati. The ZP zone of Nuagada went in favour of Congress and BJD has won three seats in the last three phases.Dhenkanal: Pradhan also campaigned for the fourth phase panchayat election in Dhenkanal on Friday. Speaking at a public gathering in Siminai under Odapada block, he said resentment against BJD is evident in the ongoing election.People of Odisha are poor due to poor leadership of BJD Government for 16 years. Mass resentment is being reflected in the ongoing panchayat election. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had suggested enhancement of funds for the panchayati raj system by 42 per cent in order to facilitate development at the grassroots, but the BJD Government is not willing to accept the proposal, Pradhan alleged.He said the BJD Government has been hoodwinking people by claiming that it provides them rice at `1 per kg from its own resources. For subsidised rice, the Centre provides `29 per kg whereas the State Government contributes only `2, he said.Though coal production of the undivided Dhenkanal district has met more than 50 per cent of Indias coal demand, coal workers, who are also beneficiaries of various government schemes, have to bribe officers to get benefits of the schemes, he said, adding that the poor has remained poor under the BJD rule.Earlier in the day, the Union Minister addressed public gatherings in Parjang block and Bhapur in the district."

A vast majority of PAC members, irrespective of group leanings,took the position that Chandys role is a must to carry the organisation forward in the state.The well-timed High Command decision on talks with Chandy brought a cooling effect at the meet. In a significant decision, the meet decided to hold regular PAC sessions on all second Saturdays of a month.Briefing mediapersons, KPCC president V M Sudheeran was not willing to admit the stand-off with Chandy. His absence was due to some personal inconvenience. He had informed it. He had not abstained from any party programmes nor had he raised any protest. He is an integral part of the Congress.The PAC meet also expressed the view that all should stand united and he should be present. The Congress High Command is going to talk to him. Differences of opinion whatsoever will be discussed and solved. In future, he will attend all meetings, Sudheeran said.The meet veered around a decision that the Congress should put its might in taking up the challenges thrown around by the Narendra Modi Government at the Centre on various counts, including the continuing negative effect of demonetisation as well as the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF Government in the state through anti-people measures like curtailing ration rice supplies.The picketing of Raj Bhavan and district collectorates by activists associated with the crisis-hit co-operative sector, proposed for January 18 and 24, will be made notable,he said.As part of the nationwide AICC stir against demonetisation, a state-level convention will be held here on January 21. Former union minister Jairam Ramesh will address the convention. On January 28,a meeting of the extended KPCC executive is on the cards.A siege will be laid to the RBI office in Kochi on February 9.

The things that he proudly shared on his Facebook account -- My Home, I am made in here, Savitribai Nagar, Guntur J.Only, they are all in a different corner of a different home in a different locality on the outskirts of Guntur. Its not as crammed as the house we saw in Rohiths post but one transformed into a home by his mother Radhika.This sorakaya (bottle gourd) in the dal is from my little garden, she said, pointing to a small patch of vegetables.Radhika and Raja, Rohiths younger brother, moved here three months ago after three different house owners refused to rent to them. At one house, they had unloaded their stuff from the trolley when the landlord decided to pull out. His neighbours alerted him about the family that was about to move in. She comes on TV and they are anti-Modi, we heard him say, said Raja.But out here, away from the centre of Guntur, Radhika Vemula is at peace with her surviving son. No one knows them here. They are safe, at least for now, said Shiekh Riyaz, Rohiths friend.The death threats started on the very day Rohith was cremated. After the funeral, we went to the room in Uppal where we had moved in just 20 days before his death. People gathered around us and warned us. Rohiths friends decided it was unsafe for us and we went back to the university, said Radhika, seated at the sewing machine and stitching the nine petticoats that she has to deliver in the next one hour.In the year since her sons suicide, Radhika has travelled around the country to speak for the Dalit cause. She has been to 10 places to share her story. She was at the march in Una, where thousands of Dalits marched 350 km to protest against atrocities against Dalits. She brought back stories from those places. After we were finished the Una march, we went to a SC mans house. He welcomed us but begged us to leave soon. He was the only SC in an upper caste colony. He was terrified, said Radhika.It had been her dream to see her sons as scientists. She wanted them called Dr Rohith Vemula and Dr Raja Vemula. If not for Rohiths suspension by the University of Hyderabad, Raja would by now be on his way to acquiring a PhD from a foreign university.There is no hope for me, said Raja, an MSc grad who was a project fellow at NGRI in Hyderabad till January 2016. My guiding light is not there anymore. He was the reason I believed in science and dreamt of becoming a scientist. Now I do not feel the zeal.Now he drives a Tata Ace transporting goods in Guntur to contribute Rs 500 a day to his mothers Rs 150 that she earns from her stitching work.Sometimes the neighbours offer her a cup of tea if they see that she hasnt moved from her sewing machine. I did a number of small jobs in the past year. I worked as a daily wager carrying bricks, as a mason, a painter, said Raja.A few months after Rohiths suicide and the storm blew over, Radhika wanted Raja to continue his studies but he wanted to be around. The debate over their Dalit credentials was still going on and he stayed by her side. He tried to find a job but was denied.Every night when Radhika lies down to sleep, she sees the image of her sons burning pyre.He said he was lonely but left us alone. Why? Because someone believed he was not worthy of education, said the 46-year-old mother, breaking down.However, the mother-son duo are determined to keep going. My brother has managed to rattle a system that had not been challenged for thousands of years and we are proud of him. We will keep going, said Raja.For her part, Radhika feels obliged to attend all the meetings to which she is invited. I had never seen such big crowds in all my 46 years. Talking to big groups the day after Rohiths death, I was terrified. But I realised that I represent all the Dalit mothers who have lost their children, she said.Radhika has a mission now. I was ignorant while Rohith was growing up. Now that I am aware, I will raise and educate children who understand Ambedkars ideology and they will all fight casteist mentalities, she said.Their plan is already being executed, said Raja. We are paying the fees for four students already and we plan to educate at least 10 more in the new year, he added."

And, when it comes to food, Chennai has been constantly tagged as the idly-dosa-curd rice place. Though we have taken it in our stride, many eating trends and patterns have emerged in the city in the last decade, showing the wide food palate of Chennaiites. Based on a Food consumption Survey (2016) by Swiggy, City Express finds out what Chennai likes to eat.The survey highlighted an interesting trend in the eating patterns of Chennaiites. While they like their traditional dishes like idli, dosa and Pongal, they also love to order dishes like chicken fried rice. The survey also showed the snacking habits of Chennaiites, with chaats, sandwiches, shawarmas, momos, rolls and coffee being favourites. And the neighbourhoods that orders food often are OMR, Perungudi, Adyar and Alwarpet.While south Indian cuisine continues to have a strong preference, the survey shows a change in the food palettes of Chennaiites. As opposed to common perceptions, Chennaiites enjoy multi-cuisine food including South Indian, North Indian and fast food. They are increasingly ordering North Indian dishes like paneer butter masala and naan, as well as Chinese dishes like chicken fried rice, says TS Srivats, VP, marketing, Swiggy.Talking about the huge change, Saima Farheen, a city-based vlogger and blogger, opines that people are accepting newer cuisines and are not scared to venture and try something new. But, she adds, Its been a decade since Chennai has woken up to new cuisines but idli, vada, and dosa are still the comfort foodage no bar!Talking about the trend of ordering online and the price range, Srivats says that the price range of orders varies from which meal thecustomer is ordering, to whether its a personal or group order. However, given the love for food among Chennaiites, there has been ahigher average order value in the city. We have delivered a single order as high as `15,000 in Chennai, he shares.Biryani, butter naan, idli, paneer butter masala, and chicken fried rice emerged as all-time favourites. While, it was seen that Chennaiites satisfy their sweet cravings with sweet pongal, fresh fruit salad and double chocolate chip cookies. Savory waffles are quite a hit with the college goers. A fillet-mignon was considered niche at one time. Now even lobster salad has become a part of regular Sunday brunches, shares Saima.With Sandys and LAamandier offering all-day-breakfast menu, there is no rules as to whats breakfast and dinner. We had pizza for breakfast a few days ago and eggs Benedict for dinner! she adds.With street food becoming the easiest and yummiest access to understanding ones culture and history, we ask a few foodies who are regulars in food walks about whats trending. There are no specific trends in street food and it depends on ones palate, but vada pav, pani puri, muruku sandwich, jalebi, aloo-tikki, podi-dosa and road side malli-poo idli remain most of the foodies favourite. And its not just the youngsters who like to experiment, but elder people find a great deal of happiness and satisfaction in trying new eateries too, shares Madhan Chandran, a 25-year-old.While, 60-year-old Mugilan Raj enthusiastically says that he's glad to have different options now. Until 10-15 years ago, we had very few multi-cuisine restaurants and I doubt the authenticity of taste. Things have changed now. I'm a lover of everything from Karaikudi to Italian. The amazing thing about the cityyou have an option for every palate  from veg, non-veg, spicy, bland, healthy, vegan, sweetyou name it! he grins."

In his two-and-a-half-hour policy address, he also touched upon all major development schemes of the government like the four missions and ODF status in addition to announcing elaborate development measures.The Opposition raised protest in the house by displaying banners on governments failure to ensure womens safety, and rice shortage. When the Governor read out the measures for womens safety, the UDF legislators raised the banner. To counter the Opposition protest, the treasury benches received each of the announcement with applauds.Demonetisation woesAddressing the Assembly at the start of the Budget session, the Governor termed demonetisation one of the most devastating catastrophes in Indias financial history.Terming it a wild, impulsive version without putting in place a system to replace scrapped currencies, the Governor said: Ostensibly, the measure was bandied about as a means to flush out black money in circulation. The restrictions on ATM withdrawals were a draconian curb.Our rights, safeguarded by the Constitution, were thrown to the wind through a mere executive fiat, he said. The RBI was compelled to remain a silent partner in the matter, he added. He termed the decision ill-conceived. The vast majority of less fortunate Indians scrambled from pillar to post for the currency they needed for daily existence.The address also stressed on the setback to the cooperative structure.Criticising the Centre, the Governor said: To date, the actual quantum of demonetised currency recovered in the process has not been disclosed.Stating demonetisation has had its impact on the economy, the Governor said the as per conservative estimates there will be a contraction in growth by 1-2 pc of the national GDP.The policy address also termed the Centres decision to veer away from the idea of planned development a short-sighted vision."

Restrooms are also devoid of water supply and as a result, students avoid using them. Students also complained that the college does not have a proper Internet facility on the campus, thus making it difficult for them to do their assignments.According to a student who requested anonymity, the main problem in the varsity is the lack of drinking water facility. There are no cans inside the university buildings. We are buying water from outside. In restrooms also there is no water, he said, adding that the doors and windows of the toilets are broken both for girls and boys. There is no lock system inside the boys toilet, he said.Another student said that a woman professor suffered from the infection after using the girls toilet. There are no napkins provided for the girls. There is no first aid system as such for emergency purposes, he said adding that a letter had already been sent to the registrar with 100 signatures but no step has been taken so far. Seconding this was another student who said that whenever students ask the officials to meet the registrar, officials claim the registrar is not there in the office.When it comes to the Internet, of the 50 computers in the library, only three have Internet. The Internet facility is also inconsistent and as a result, students are unable to do their assignments properly, he said.Further, he said that the cost of the food in canteen has also increased from last year. It has become more expensive. For ice also they charge `5 more. The rice quality is not good, he added. The students have demanded a union where they can discuss their grievances but the authorities are not allowing them to form a union, he said.Registrar P David Jawahar said, They have not brought these issues to the campus director. I have not received any letter from students. I will check with the students. He said that the university buildings have an RO plant that is working perfectly and that it was checked last week."

Pine trees, bamboos, lions, tigers, and birds fill her creations, each one signed with her name in Chinese and a sigil.Sucys works will be exhibited this weekend to raise funds for cancer awareness among women. CE caught up with the octogenarian for a chat on what brought her into the art form that helped her flourish! My mother was very artistic, so I owe my creative side to picking things up from her. I used to very actively pursue oil and water colour paintings, stitching, embroidery  all sorts of things! she chuckles.When she relocated to Manila, The Philippines, along with her late husband she met Professor Chen Bing Sun, who is known as the father of Chinese brush painting. It changed her life.Under his tutelage for nearly five years, Sucy developed her skill in this intricate art. I didnt study under him as a regular student, but over time I learnt the real technique from him. There were not many practitioners of Chinese painting in India at that point, she says.Her proficiency increased to such a level that she eventually started showcasing them in exhibitions in Manila  the Indian Embassy there today proudly showcases one of her works! I took a sabbatical after returning to India, but I took it up once again after my husband passed away, and found that I could use the ample time on my hands to paint! she smiles.Chinese brush painting can be called single-stroke painting  primarily because of the delicate rice paper and vegetable colours used. The colours soak into the rice paper and you cant change it, neither can you paint over it on account of the thinness, Sucy explains.All materials have to be sourced from Singapore since very few do it in India! The framing called scrolling is also extremely unique; it gives the charm of an ancient painting rendered on Chinese scrolls. I started giving some of my paintings to friends as gifts, until I realised that I wanted to also give something to charity, she says.Social work was not new to Sucy, who also contributed to the Missionaries of Charity in the Phillipines. Cancer awareness was something she was very interested in supporting, and so she has collaborated with the NGO Penn Nalam, which has been working in rural regions and slums in Chennai on raising cancer awareness among women. She will donate proceeds from this exhibition.Sucy says that she regularly sits for three or four hours a day and completes her paintings depending on the size and the extent of details. I draw from what I have seen and also from pictures I took over the course of travels in China and Japan. Also, traditionally Chinese brush paintings have elements of their own landscape like pine trees, bamboos, and birds and fishes endemic to China. But Sucy, over the years, has adapted a few of her techniques and often paints by transferring Indian landscapes.The exhibition will be inaugurated at 6.30 pmFebruary 24, on Friday, at The Folly, Amethyst, Whites Road, Royapettah, and will be displayed till Saturday"

The preparations for the conference are in full swing and, according to DYFI leaders, right from food served to delegates to minimal use of flex hoardings, the meeting will uphold the green protocol.The rice for preparing food for the delegates will be brought mainly from the two-acre Odiyappaadam paddy field near Nedumbassery. The sowing took place in September last year and the harvesting is over. The yield is around 2,000 kg of rice belonging to the Uma variety, said DYFI state joint secretary S Satheesh.The paddy field was taken on lease and the effort of the members of DYFI Nedumbassery block committee was behind the successful paddy cultivation. The DYFI workers took it as an opportunity to show their liking to farming. They were keen to be part of sowing, removal of weeds and harvesting. The local people, especially women, extended their support during the harvest, said Jibin George, DYFI block secretary, Nedumbassery.The vegetables for the delegates are also ready to be plucked. Long beans, okra, bitter gourd, snake gourd, green chilli, Indian palak and spinach will be harvested in the coming days from the three-and-a-half acre farm at Kanjoor, near Kalady.All members of the DYFI Kalady block put in their efforts to make the vegetable farming a success. There were times when the motor pump became defunct. The members manually drew water from the nearby river to water the plants, said K V Vipin, block secretary, Kalady.The Vypeen block will bring the pearl spot and prawns cultivated in fields near Edavanakkad. The fish is being grown on a 14-acre field, said A P Prinil, Vypeen block secretary. A meeting will be held on Thursday to finalise the green protocol agenda, said Satheesh."

Even as a kid, I was good with home-made recipes and I owe a lot to my mother for that!As a young chef, I also had the opportunity to work in West Asia for a while, and I collaborated with the personal chef of the Prince of Wales during my time in Europe.I also worked with Michelin star chef Vineet Bhatia at the only authentic Indian restaurant in mainland Europe. But I realised that I really wanted to explore modern Indian food and experiment with Indian flavours than cater to western cuisine. Especially, I want Indian food to be recognised globally through the Michelin star reputation, and am attempting that through my own venture, Chefman.Martin LouisI am well-versed in European, Meditteranean, modern Indian cuisine, and homemade recipes. I especially crave for authentic tastes in my food. Precisely for this reason, I always work with my own spices and grind my own powders rather than going for packaged ones  be it piri piri spices, sambar powder or Mexican flavours.I dont use adulterated mixes because working with fresh spices induces the flavours easily. Id rather use fresh tomatoes in cooking than go for processed tomato puree, and make homemade pasta in at least one of my dishes.This is because I strongly believe that authenticity is key to keeping cooking natural.I dont believe fusion food is the right way to put it  in fact a lot of our ingredients with western cooking are very similar. It is just that the cultures and climatic conditions have affected the cooking styles. So yes, while I do attempt to experiment I still keep the authentic taste of the food intact.For example, I have taken an Italian dish called Arancini (stuffed rice balls coated with bread crumbs and fried) and used our very own sambar rice or pongal to make the dish! What Ive done is taken the Italian concept and added Indian flavours to it.As for presentation and plating, making it look presentable is not as important as putting the right ingredients to garnish. You should choose elements that complement the taste of the dish and not just for decorating or to make it look vibrant. Aspiring chefs should also take care to get their basics right as well as learn portion control and hygiene control. After that, you can move on to more detailed things like molecular gastronomy!"

The samosa is stuffed with Sangri, a dessert bean which is found in the forests of Rajasthan and tastes like sour, dry pickle. The Paneer Pakoda is crunchy and soft. These are served with phulka, bajre ki roti and masala poori. The tikki has a sharp taste of ajwain.The bajra roti is thin and crunchy, served with ghee or butter and cubes of jaggery, and has a smoked flavour. Try them with Rajwadi Paneer, Panchmela ka sabji, Govind Gatta, Tamatar Bhujiya ki sabji or with some daal such as Jadhpuri dal, kanji vada, kadhi pakodi and raabdi. Prepared with cashew, the Rajwadi Paneer is creamy in texture.The Panchmela ka sabji is made of five green vegetables. The Tamatar Bhujiya has a unique combination, the tanginess of tomatoes blends well with the spicy bhujiya. The Govind Gatta, prepared with besan, also pairs well with the rotis.After the breads, comes the three varieties of rice - Masala Kheechdi, Makhan Matar Pulao and Steamed Rice - with disco papad. The Makhan Matar Pulao is rich in flavour and aroma. After a rich masaledar meal, steamed basmati rice with thick curd feels like a saviour.Desserts include gajar ka halwa and strawberry fruit cream with fruits dipped in strawberry flavoured cold milk. The Mango Kulfi tastes the best, if only for the love of mangoes.The restaurant is celebrating Fresco Fine Art festival till April 23.

I studied International Relations and French in the UK and Paris and had planned a career in an international organisation or the media.When I studied in Paris, I lived with a family who spent a great deal of time, effort and money on good food and good ingredients.This is probably where my interest in food really took off. I also learned that it wasnt just about the food and the taste but it was about what the French like to call art de vivre or the art of livingin other words lifestyle .I returned to India soon after and found I missed European food... fresh salads, healthy and tasty light food. From then on, there was no looking back. I became friends with frying pan. Wherever I travelled, whether it was southern Spain or Russia, Shanghai or Bali, food became my ambassador.I find mustard to be a unique ingredient. I love mustard in all forms  as a wholegrain mustard or Dijon mustard condiment, ground into a paste in Bengali cooking, mixed with other spices for the Bengali panch phoren and in South Indian and Gujarati dishes in a tadka. Of course it is also used to perk up a hot dog and hamburger.I use it extensively in salad dressings, the wholegrain with honey for a honey mustard dressing and the Dijon or wholegrain for a foil wrapped chicken or fish parcels where you need to use no oil. Devilishly easy, the essence of the fish parcel is simplicity and great mustard. It is inspired by the Bengali dish Paturi where Hilsa or betki is smothered in a paste of mustard ground with mustard oil and green chilli and steamed in a banana leaf. The honey mustard chicken is a perennial favourite in our house. Be creative with rice by using leftover rice for a rice salad which has dry fruit, nuts and a rich mustardy dressing.I am sharing a recipe of a salad - beetroot made zingy with a lovely mustard dre ssing.Karen Anand was recently in the city for VR Foodies Fest."

But if you are going for Goan traditional food, which the pub claims is their speciality, hit the main course first, I would say.The plain rice served with salad and pickle along with Goan Prawns Curry was delicious. The curry was rich and creamy and the Thai-based vegetable curry was a delight. Made in coconut milk gravy, it tasted sweet and looked richer than its non-vegetarian counterpart.We tried a couple of starters along with some cocktails. The Fiery Crispy Potato had the crispy wedges glazed with hot and spicy red sauce. Cooked in oriental style with bell peppers and onions, the starter looked colourful and bright against the dim lighting of the restaurant. The sauce and bell peppers made it very spicy and reminds one of masala fries.The description for the Bollywood Crackers in the menu reads crispy, crunchy, cheesyrest is a secret. But the rest in this case turned out to be a disappointing. The round patties were crunchy and cheesy, but also sour and oily. You may not enjoy this one unless you are a cheese lover.The Chicken Cafreal is served with pav. Cooked in Goan style with coriander and mint flavour, giving it a green tinge. It lacks the said flavours. The meat was a little hard and did not look appetising.The Spicy Prawns in Port Wine was better than the other starters. Do not go by its look. It does not look interesting but tastes better compared to the rest. Simmered in butter, port wine and crushed red pepper, the prawns were served, topped with chilli flakes. It had a strong flavour of vinegar and tasted sweet and sour.The cocktails lacked alcohol punch. The Watermelon basil is said to be well balanced drink to cool you down with a refreshing mix ginger, basil and vodka but you could barely feel the kick, making it just like a juice. The Lemon Drop is suggested as a tangy refreshing vodka cocktail with a burst of fresh lemon. Well, you feel the burst of fresh lemon, making it taste more like a fresh lime juice, rather than a cocktail.It lacks the alcohol punch. The Lusty Chocolate has a consistency of melted chocolate and icecream. The menu reads this sweet version made of vodka, chocolate syrup, baileys and fresh cream is so sophisticated in taste that you dont want to share. It reads true, you wouldnt really like to share, not because it is a sophisticated drink but the mix of milk, cream and alcohol was not soothing. To be safe with the choice, you can go for Mai Tai or the Orange Blossom. The Orange Blossom is a vodka-based tangy and refreshing drink.Among desserts, Bebinca, a Goan dessert is a good choice. The pudding, made with flour, sugar, egg yolk and coconut, is served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce. You can feel the sugar syrup lingering in your mouth. Definitely my favourite pick from the dinner night."

The yellow ombre colour of the round dumplings, made it the most appealing. The spongy and non-oily dumplings was an easy bite. The chicken was tender but not as juicy. The three flavoured sauces  wasabi, chilly flakes and sweet  gave each dumpling a distinct flavour.The next highlight was the flaky rice that livened up the main course. Be it the Philipino Adobo Chicken rice or the Korean Kimchi Bokkeumbap, the long-grained rice was well cooked and the ingredients were well-blended. Fish Ginger Scallion Fish that was served with Hunan noodles was aromatic, but I expected more with the taste. The steamed fish cooked Vietnamese style was a bit soggy by the time I dug in. However, the noodles, like the dumplings, were not oily.The vegetarian Bulgur and Bean Kibbeh, a Middle-Eastern dish fell short of flavours, but the grainy cracked wheat ball went well with the smooth texture of the white sauce. Vegetable wantons that looked like shells spread out was topped with soy sauce. The stuffing of the wantons was thronged with veggies. Chicken Jujeh Kebab Salad, bountiful in fresh veggies including red cabbage, lettuce capsicums and diced pineapples and lime, was a fresh delight.The chicken was marinated to its core, but was a bit too heavy to qualify for a salad.The desserts, Date Halwa Martabak was like a thin Kerela Ada with finely minced date stuffing. Pineapple Crumble Jar that looked quite pleasing was a sugary dance in the mouth.48East, a Bengaluru-based food delivering company updates its menu weekly with cuisines that are inspired from 48 countries of the eastern hemisphere."

She has been fielded by Peoples Resurgence and Justice Alliance (PRJA) from Wabagai constituency in Imphal Valley. PRJA was floated by iconic activist Irom Sharmila last year after she had ended her epic hunger strike.Without citing any reason, three clerics in Najimas village, Santhel, had publicly announced last month that she would not get space for kabar (burial). They also threatened locals to not talk to her. The supporters of Najima alleged the clerics were worried about losing their bread and butter. All three of them are said to be close aides of sitting MLA, Md Fajur Rahim, and they fear Najima could go on to win the election.Najima and her party took up the issue of threat with Governor Najma Heptulla but so far no case has been registered against the trio. Such obstacles are, however, not new to Najima, who has grown up fighting the odds against her. As a child, she fought her way to ride a bicycle.The locals in my village made fun of me when I started learning to ride a bicycle. This is the kind of struggle Muslim women are faced with in Manipur. It is not about womens issues or fighting patriarchy to its face. The struggle begins with things as insignificant as riding a bicycle, Najima told Express.She was the only girl in her class to complete her 10th standard amid taunts and harassment at school. The marriage that followed ended in divorce within six months. It was then that she came up with Cheng Marup  an economic independence programme. Under this, every woman in the group would take out a handful of rice from the quantity to be cooked at home.These were collected and kept in my house, and twice a month, whoevers turn came would get the entire rice which she sold off to earn some money. But some people looked at me with suspicion as I was divorced and our savings were considered theft, Najima said.Her effort to ensure women do not face harassment, abandonment and violence ruffled the feathers of the clerics who first banned all women self-help groups in the village on religious grounds and later, issued a fatwa asking villagers to boycott her family. But she has remained unfazed till date as she is going about her work.I am not against the clerics. They are an important part of Islam and I respect that. I just want to help the women who are in distress; Islam provides for it, Najma said explaining her work.She is very popular among women in the constituency for fighting for their cause. Wherever she goes, she is greeted by dozens and this despite her low-key campaign. There are not many banners and posters of hers and her party hung around in the constituency.Dont be scared of the threats (from clerics). Use your conscience and vote for the candidate who, you believe, can deliver, Najima told people at rally.Asked why she joined politics, she said she was inspired by Sharmila and her decision to take her fight forward through the formation of PRJA.I decided to stand alongside her as I thought that was the best way to expand the scope of my work. I have policies and vision for education and women's issues. I want to fight against corruption and Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, she said.In the course of her fight, she had got married for the second time and the couple has five children, including two sons."

It started on April 11.As per the reports from the Department of Public Instruction, about 27 lakh children registered for the scheme, but only about 10 lakh students are turning up for the meals.Children during mid-day mealsat a school| JITHENDRA MOfficials attributed the childrens absence to various reasons. In a few taluks, during the pre-meeting itself, many parents stated that they would not send their kids to have mid-day meals during holidays. In most cases, children have gone to other places to spend their vacation, said an official.According to officials, the soaring temperature in north Karnataka districts is one of the main reasons for kids skipping mid-day meals. As we have identified one school as a centre for at least five to six villages, many children find it difficult to commute in the heat, said officials.Although we also serve buttermilk along with the usual rice and sambar, kids prefer to stay indoors, said a school development monitoring committee member from Kolar district.With increasing number of absentees, some schools have decided to cook less food and a few even informed the department that they would stop cooking after 15 days.Some schools from North Karnataka and Kolar districts have communicated to us seeking permission to stop cooking if this situation continues after 15 days. We will discuss this with the higher authorities and take a decision, said an official from the mid-day meal project. The highest number of absentees has been reported from districts in North Karnataka along with Kolar and Chikkaballapur.Meanwhile, officials said some schools fail to update the number of children having food, which according to them, could also be one of the reasons for showing less attendance."

The rice mills in the district are allowed to procure paddy in strict accordance to online generated Miller Authority Slips and Society Authority Slips and once the security deposits of the rice mills get exhausted, they would be required to deposit extra security money.But, majority of 14 authorised rice mills in the district are unwilling to deposit extra security money due to cash crunch and in such a situation, procurement may be disrupted in next five to six days.Moreover, procurement authorities are facing problems in transferring sale proceeds to farmers bank accounts in some areas after total digitisation of the process.They informed that failure to update the database of farmers in time, disruption in Internet connectivity and frequent power disruptions are delaying online payments to farmers in remote pockets of Koida, Gurundia and Hemgir blocks. The procurement authorities also face the trouble in integrating Bhulek database of about 8,500 farmers, whose land records were mismatching and efforts were taken to remove anomalies.Civil Supplies Officer A Pradhan said procurement is going on smoothly and asserted to sort out the security amount issue of rice millers in consultation with the district administration.Meanwhile, Sundargarh District Cooperative Bank Ltd (SDCCBL) through its 16 rural branches has intensified opening of bank accounts of farmers linked to 44 Large and Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies (LAMPSs) in the district. Subsequent to demonetisation, LAMPSs were restricted from rendering banking services to member farmers.SDCCBL Chief Executive Officer AN Mohanty informed that from December 19, about 7,000 bank accounts were opened with about 800 farmers getting new SDCCBL accounts daily. There is no complaint regarding paddy procurement, he added.The procurement would continue till March through 112 Paddy Purchase Centres (PPCs), including 44 LAMPSs, and about 25,600 farmers have availed online registrations."

Only problem was he named Kerala CM as O Paneerselvam.Far from doing a Jallikattu on Vijayan, Paswan was actually wanting to help the Kerala CM -- an old acquaintance from UF days. Presumably, the mixup -- an inadvertent mistake -- was the result of theTamil Nadu CM being in news thanks to the fierce bull run and the youth uprising thereof.Well, the meeting was of a serious import, and the Kerala CM took the gaffe like a good sport, with a brush of hand, without any invocation of pride. His focus was more on the allocation of rice andsubsidised sugar for distribution among migrant workers and welfare institutions.In his meeting, Vijayan also asked the Centre to extend the rice procurement period for three months. Having rolled out the National Food Security Act in November 2016, under which foodgrains have tobe made available to the poor at a subsidised rate of Rs 1-3 per kg via public distribution system, Kerala is in need of a higher allocation from the Centre.Kerala CM has placed many demands before us. One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting. Sources said, the Kerala Chief Minister's basic demand was that his state foodgrains supply for PDS supply should, at least, be restored to the level of pre-NFSA days.While under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, it used to get 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.There was a bit of hand wringing on the part of the Union Food Minister, who pointed that the Centre has adopted a uniform for all states while allocating foodgrains.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is beinggiven to protect poor people, a Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population. And that's beyond the policy of the Centre.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to the entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for parboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded to up the foodgrains allocation to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from the existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has sought central support tomake extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months."

The Indian Origin Tamils, on the other hand, have a better record of participating in democratic structures from the time of Saumyamoorthy Thoondaman.Today, we are Sri Lankan in every way, but without losing our identity as a people of Indian origin, said Mano Ganeshan, who is a cabinet minister of National Dialogue and National Languages.Jaishankar told the TPA leaders that the number of houses allotted for plantation Tamils of Indian origin under the Indian Housing Project will be increased from the present 4000.Each beneficiary is given LKR 900,000 to build a house. And thanks to the efforts of the TPA, plantation workers now get land deeds with which they will be able to apply for assistance under the Indian Housing Scheme. Jaishankar also promised to expedite work on the much needed Indian-funded hospital at Dickoya.The Indian Foreign Secretary also met Muslim leaders and cabinet ministers, Rauff Hakeem of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and Rishad Bathiyutheen of the All Ceylon Makkal Congress.Jaishankar met Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Strategic Investment and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and reviewed the Indian development projects and prospects of further investment in Sri Lanka. Some of these projects have been stalled for one reason or the other.In view of the drought in parts of Sri Lanka, Jaishankar announced that India will immediately send eight water bowsers and 100 metric tons of rice and promised to send more aid."

Find them. Kill them. I want them dead. Do not give them to me alive,"" Duterte said about the fresh fighting in Bohol.""They are animals but if you want me to be an animal, I am used to that. We are the same. I can dish out more than what you can,"" he told people attending a public sports event.Six other Abu Sayyaf members had been killed in clashes on the island on April 11, when three soldiers and a policeman were also slain, authorities said.The military said they had been pursuing up to seven of the remaining gunmen.Security forces continued the hunt for the remaining three gunmen on Sunday while residents fled to safety to avoid getting caught in the crossfire.""The remaining lawless armed elements who are strangers in the area have nowhere to go,"" a joint military and police statement said.""It could just be a matter of time before we can say that the threat (on Bohol) is totally eliminated.""Bohol police told AFP Saturday's fighting erupted at a rice and coconut farming village near the town of Clarin, adjacent to the area of the April 11 clashes.The Abu Sayyaf, made up of several hundred militants, is notorious for kidnappings, beheadings and deadly bombings. Its leaders have also pledged allegiance to Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria.On Sunday, the army said the Abu Sayyaf beheaded a soldier it abducted last week in its southern Jolo stronghold.The fighting in Bohol, about 500 kilometres (300 miles) away from Jolo and 800 kilometres (500 miles) south of Manila, caused a scare for the Philippines' important tourism industry.The Philippines alerted Western governments after the military said it got wind of an Abu Sayyaf plan to raid central Philippine resorts during the Easter holidays and kidnap up to a dozen tourists.This led to travel warnings being issued by the United States, Australia, and other countries.Over the past year the Abu Sayyaf has been expanding its activities from the south where the military has been waging an offensive since last year.Its gunmen have been boarding commercial and fishing vessels and abducting dozens of foreign crew members, ransoming some of them off for huge sums of money, according to the defence ministry."

Later, it vomited out Rs 14,000.The incident was reported from Tarajuli Tea Estate in Sonitpur district on Sunday night. Forest officials blamed deforestation caused by encroachment of reserve forests for the incident.According to reports, Rs 26,000 was in currency notes of Rs 100 while the remaining Rs 14,000 was in Rs 10 notes. The elephant had vomited out the Rs 10 notes.The shopkeeper Rajendra Dugar had kept bundles of the notes in his Kai shop for payment to a trader on Monday. In every tea garden in Assam, there will be a Kai shop that deals in a whole lot of items, including grocery, bakery, stationery, hardware, etc.As the jumbo was going about with its job, the locals had unsuccessfully tried to drive it away by shouting. Once the animal had left, they visited the site and spotted the vomited out Rs 10 notes, amounting to Rs 14,000. There was no trace of the remaining Rs 26,000.Dugar was not available for comments but a local said elephants often swoop down on human settlements in the area at night searching for food and destroy shops and houses.The elephant had come around midnight and dismantled the concrete shop. It ate rice and swallowed the money. Later when it was gone, Rs.14,000, soaked with its saliva, was retrieved, Namesh Orang, a local, told the New Indian Express.The States forest department blamed encroachment for the jumbos moving about in human settlements.They go to human settlements in search of food. The Chariduar Reserve Forest (in the district) has been encroached upon to a great extent. However, the encroachment there had taken place long back, said Assams principal chief conservator of forests, Bikash Brahma."

While tensions have been mounting for some time now, the suspension of a Puducherry civil services (PCS) officer for allegedly sending obscene videos on a WhatsApp group, created by the L-G for administrative efficiency, has now led to open hostility.On Friday, January 6, Congress MLAs wrote to the Union home ministry seeking intervention against the L-Gs undemocratic conduct. The elected officials were given scant respect, not even involved seriously in addressing local issues which are normally within the domain of the elected representatives of the constituencies (sic), the letter stated.This letter was sent directly after the L-G cancelled an order issued by Congress chief minister V Narayanasamy directing government officials to desist from using social media for official work. On January 5, Bedi announced on Twitter, If Puducherry has to be a progressive UT it cannot be retrograde in communications. Hence @CM_Puducherrys order stands cancelled.According to the original circular by Narayanasamy, who took over as the chief minister in June 2016, his order was in accordance with the Official Secrets Act and guidelines of the information technology ministry. Officers are required to obtain the chief secretarys permission to use social media for official work. As soon as the CMs order was issued, a number of WhatsApp groups administered by government officials to interact with the media were shut down.On January 7, Bedi wrote an open letter to the people of Puducherry and sent it to all media houses in the UT. According to her letter, she has decided to step down on May 29, 2018, when she completes two years in Puducherry. I am happy to support them [the elected state assembly] as long as the law is not in conflict with a central law. She spoke of the various complaints against her and explained that her approach was not to punish, but to help perform, inspire and support. I have spent all my mornings over the weekends on visiting problem areas to bring about solutions, and we succeeded, she wrote.She adds that there is a lack of balance between the urban and rural budgeting, which currently heavily favours urban amenities. I have exercised financial prudence and not allowed any diversion of funds. Despite this, I have had complaints of abuse, the letter said.She ends with a promise to leave Puducherry clean, safe and prosperous.This is the first of many open letters, she said and has pledged to write one every month.A video and its aftermathThe CMs circular was issued after AS Shivakumar, registrar of Cooperative Societies and a PCS officer, was suspended for sending an allegedly obscene video to the Prosperous Rural Puducherry group, administered by the Raj Niwas, the L-Gs office. A case was registered against the officer, and Bedi ordered his suspension. Shivakumar explained that he sent the obscene video by mistake while attempting to delete it. Despite an immediate apology, and representations from officials, the LG ordered his immediate suspension without following proper rules, a senior PCS officer alleged. According to him, the LG should have informed the chief secretary, and the order of suspension should have been issued from the latters office after due enquiry.Read: Puducherry govt wants me to be mere figurehead, says L-G Kiran BediA case was filed under section 67A of the information technology act dealing with transmission of obscene material over electronic media. Shivakumar was detained at the Orleanpet police station for over 15 hours without the case being filed.Though the police refused to comment on the detention, a senior police officer said that on the face of it, it looked like the video was sent by mistake. Within two minutes of sending the offensive video, the official apologised. However, we are investigating the case, he said.Bedis action in suspending Shivakumar has raised the hackles of government officers, who have rallied against her. The Election Commission stayed the suspension on January 4 stating that Shivakumar was appointed as an electoral roll officer. Its order said the L-G ought to have taken the commission into confidence and consulted before placing him under suspension.There have been persistent rumours of a rift between the CM and the L-G ever since they found themselves at the top posts within a month of each other mid-2016. In fact, within a couple of months, Narayanasamy made it a point to tell the media that things were cordial between them. Bedi, once a star in the Anna Hazare movement, switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party in the run-up to the Delhi assembly election early 2015.Though the CMs ban on social media came after the Shivakumars suspension, his ministers insist his order was to prevent the undemocratic use of social media. The Lieutenant Governor has been issuing a number of orders on WhatsApp groups directly to heads of departments, bypassing the secretaries in charge of these portfolios. According to the business rules of Puducherry, a minister is responsible for the actions of the various departments under his ministry; but in many cases, the minister was unaware of the orders that were coming from the L-G. This is undemocratic, grumbled a minister in the cabinet. While WhatsApp and other social media are useful for communication, official government work cannot be sanctioned through these apps, he added. Often, permission and orders have been issued through social media. Orders issued through the app cannot be used to release funds for work that needs to be done, and cannot be considered official.An unprecedented animosityThe events of the past few days have left the Union Territory in a state of shock. According to Rajasekhar, a veteran journalist, this sort of animosity between the elected government and the L-G is unprecedented. Never before has a chief minister issued an order based on observations, but even more surprising is a Lieutenant Governor declaring the CMs order null and void. The government officials and the elected representatives are rallying against the L-G, he said.According to the Rules of Business of the Union Territory of Puducherry, when there is a dispute between the L-G and the elected government, the matter must be referred to the Union home ministry, a government official clarified. It is unprecedented, and against these rules, for the LG to issue an order cancelling that of the elected government, he added.In the meanwhile, the opposition party, AIADMK, has called for the L-Gs removal and the suspension of the cabinet for six months. The new government and the L-G took charge within a few weeks of each other, and since then, it has been as if there are two parallel governments. Officials are in a state of confusion and there is no work getting done, despite promises and announcements by both the LG and the CM, AIADMK legislative party leader A Anbalagan told reporters last Friday.Government employees, too, are bemused. CH Balamohan, president of the Confederation of Pondicherry State Government Employees Association, pointed out that the administration cannot function with two parallel governments. The Lieutenant Governor has been meeting separately with heads of department and issuing orders for separate programs without the knowledge of the Secretary. Often the orders issued by the L-G are in opposition to the orders of the Secretaries, which has been causing confusion within the ranks, he said.Another sore point has been Bedis requirement from the time she assumed office last May that government officials report for duty on weekends, and often as early as 6am. The L-G often conducts inspections early in the morning and on weekends; but for a government official, this is an additional burden, Balamohan said.The CM made it clear where he stood when, after the cabinet meeting to discuss Shivakumars suspension, he told reporters that the decision to work on weekends was left to officials discretion.Files pending among warring factionsThe CMs colleagues have also taken up cudgels on his behalf. The Lieutenant Governor has repeatedly flouted rules in a number of matters, social welfare minister M Kandasamy said. He alleged that a number of files placed before the L-G for consideration by elected representatives have been ignored. Even in routine matters like the transfer of PCS officers and the dredging of the port to allow fishing, the papers have been lying on her desk for several months.Accusing the L-G of flouting rules, he alleged she had convened official meetings at the Raj Niwas even before her appointment was confirmed in May 2016. Even during the model code of conduct ahead of the by-elections where Narayanasamy contested for the Nellithope constituency, the L-G continued to issue orders to officials, he said. The Election Commission had issued her a warning in November about this.Politicians say that despite a flurry of announcements from the Raj Niwas, and periodic inspections by the L-G, there has been no progress in the Union Territory. A number of schemes proposed by the current government have been placed on hold, they allege. We had proposed that the old age pension should be distributed in the homes of the elderly by bank officials, but the L-G refused permission, K Lakshminarayanan, parliamentary secretary to the chief minister, said.Ditto a proposal to purchase rice from local vendors to allow the Union Territorys free rice scheme to continue. The State Trading Corporation was unable to supply the required rice, so the scheme has been stopped for the past two months. When we approached the L-G to allow us to buy from local suppliers, she refused permission, he said. Even a large chunk of the MLA Local Area Development funds has been kept aside to pay arrears on schemes announced in the previous regime, instead of allowing current MLAs to introduce new schemes for their constituencies.Elected representatives have an obligation towards their constituencies. Unless they are given appropriate funds and allowed to perform their duties, the electorate is bound to be disappointed in them, social welfare minister Kandasamy said. He pooh-poohed that several of the LGs activities were simply media stunts, and no real work was being done.Journalist Rajasekhar observed that every week the media follows the L-G on her inspections, and every week there was a new announcement. But so far, there does not seem to be much of a follow-up.Veteran CPI (M) leader T Murugan said Puducherry appeared to be in a limbo with no major schemes up and running. A number of schemes have been announced, including the cleaning of all canals, implementation of beat policing and announcement of the 1031 crime helpline. But there has very little progress on these fronts in the past six months, Murugan said.Bedi, though, has her fan club and a number of residents are happy with her. Purushotham, a senior citizen, showered praise on her approachability and the gusto with which she undertakes work. We can contact her through Twitter, or even visit her at the Raj Niwas to air our grievances. This is a first for us. But even after seven months, there does not seem to be much change in the Union Territory. This could be because there are few people willing to cooperate with her.While there has been a deafening silence from Narayanasamy, Bedi has taken to Twitter to have her say. When a leader wants things done he will promote shared info. When he wants control & dependence he will ensure they r kept divided/deprived, she tweeted last Friday.And, for good measure, I am not in Puducherry to do a job but transform the UT. Make it cleaner, safer, responsive public services, financial prudence & rule of law, she added.(Published in arrangement with GRIST Media)"
58fedbe67be9e0429666a989,Snack and the city: How the vada pav has kept up with Mumbai's appetite,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ht-mumbai-meri-hai-vada-pav-a-migrant-learn-city-s-history-through-the-humble-snack/story-zLC1Jwbp7uZGugizovOL2I.html,2017-04-17,"Its a fairly odd recipe, as recipes go  carbs dipped in more carbs, wrapped in carbs.But thats no accident. The vada pav is the answer to a riddle from the last century: What filling snack can you offer a mill worker with just a few annas and no time to sit and eat?Even before the vada pav, its ingredients  chilli, garlic and potato  were already favourites, says food historian Kurush Dalal. What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked. It soon became a hit with students or whoever had little money to spend, but wanted a good snack. It is only later that it has become an identity of Mumbai itself. Now, everyone who comes to Mumbai tries the vada pav, he says.Today, you cant turn a corner without running into fresh, hot vadas served with garlic powder, teekha-meetha chutneys (imli and green chilli), and fried chillies on the side.You already want one, dont you? Chances are youve had at least one in the past month. And it may not have been at a pavement stall either.You can now order Mumbais favourite snack at trendy cafs and casual fine-dining restaurants in the city. Sometimes itll come to you in the form of a slider; other times, its deconstructed.Its a fairly well-travelled little fellow too. You can now get a vada pav in London, New York or Sydney  granted, you will have to ask for the Bombay burger when you order.Its been a symbol, snack and political icon. At each stage of the citys transformation, it has acted as a mirror  going corporate at the turn of the century, saffron in the oughts, and taking to casual fine-dining in the early parts of this decade.Its a migrant too!Interestingly, the vada pavs core ingredients arent really local. The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood. We would like to hear from you too.Tweet, Istagram your favourite pictures of the city with #MumbaiMeriHai, or write to us at @htmetro@hindustantimes.comPav wowTwo decades on, came the real boost for the vada pav.When the citys textile mills began to close in the 1980s and people needed income, they sold vada pav outside the mills. The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers. Weve made no changes and have no secret recipe. It just works, and has kept working.The many avatas of the Vada Pav DECONSTRUCTED At Farzi Caf (top) and SpiceKlub, you get potato mousse or patties accompanied by smears or pouches of chutneys, sprinkled with lasoon chutney, sev, fried chillies and curry leaves IN A BAO Casual fine-dine restaurants such as the popular Social chain put the patty in a soft Chinese bun called a bao. Accompaniments include a lehsun chutney mayonnaise. AS A SIZZLER At outlets of Bar Stock Exchange, the vadas come with a side of vegetables, cumin rice and kachumber, topped with AS A SALAD Dishkiyaoon in BKC serves the potato patty comes with salad leaves, pomegranate and a pinch of farsan.Smart casualWith the boom in disposable incomes and the mushrooming of stand-alone restaurants, the vada pav went smart casual.The changing economy changed the way people snacked too, says Mumbai columnist and city chronicler Smruti Koppikar. Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food. Like any true Mumbaiite, the vada pav is at its best under pressure and on the move."

We found irregularities in the ration distribution at several shops, said Singh.We conducted raids to ensure that the ration shops provide basic necessities to the citizens. At various shops, we found people indulging in malpractices and ill-doings, so we took action accordingly. An FIR was also filed regarding this. During the raids, we recovered 42 quintals of rice and 48 quintals of wheat, which were unaccounted, costing around Rs 23,000, said Singh.On April 8, we had conducted raids at five ration shops in Noida and Bisrakh, where none of the shops had any supervising official present to distribute ration commodities. We have booked the officials and prompt action will be taken against them accordingly, said Vijay Bahadur, regional food security officer, Gautam Budh Nagar.Singh informed that the district administration had carried a similar raid and inspection campaign in 2016 as well.Last year, we had conducted inspection of 1,002 shops and raids at 157 shops, where a total of four FIRs were lodged.

After a lot of discussion, it was decided to follow the one prepared by the DDC. But eventually, issues emerged in that RFP and they had to be corrected. The finance department is reviewing the file now. All this took a lot of time, an official said.Originally planned to be completed by March 31, the work of installing Point of Sale (PoS) machines at Fair Price Shops (FPS)  popularly known as ration shops  is unlikely to begin until July. The proposal is yet to get clearance from all departments. Once all comments and objections are addressed, only then tenders will be floated, another official said.According to sources, it would take at least four months for PoS machines to be operational at a majority of FPSs in the capital. Delhi has 2,282 FPSs, with nearly 72.8 lakh people using them. By now, all of them were supposed to distribute essential commodities like wheat, rice and sugar through detection of fingerprint or iris of the beneficiaries.Card holders sufferEven the pilot project in which 42 such shops were installed with PoS machines have almost been withdrawn. At present, only 28 FPSs have functioning PoS devices. Food and supplies officers have complained that the machines installed in the few FPSs are not working efficiently. These are not user-friendly and have poor battery life. Many a times, fingerprints do not match and network is a big problem, an officer said on condition of anonymity.In all such cases, while ration shop owners should ideally mark such transactions under Transactions with N (No) response from Aadhaar, they invariably mark them under Household yet to take ration, implying that the beneficiary has chosen not to take home her share.While many ration card holders are visiting these shops to get their monthly supplies, they are returning empty handed. Worse is that the system does not even show that they attempted buying commodities. Instead, it only suggests that the card holder never came to claim her share  which is probably the biggest glitch.The delay is despite the fact that Delhi is one of the easiest cities to implement the project as it has 100 per cent Aadhaar seeding. This means the government did not have to spend anything extra in getting biometrics of ration card holders as Aadhaar cards in Delhi are mandatory for getting enrolled under the National Food Security Act, 2013."

Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place. I found it interesting and it is something new. Visiting this place gives you a different feeling, different excitement and thrill, said Vinod Yadav, a resident of Borivli.We constantly innovate, said Rupesh as he rolls out the extensive menu that looks like a tabloid-sized newspaper.Caf Hydro will soon become happening place for Mumbaikars, said Rupesh. The menu has been designed looking at the taste of patrons and we constantly take their suggestions, he added.Mouth-watering itemsSome of the fast-moving food items include dishes from surimi, a paste made from fish or other seafood meat, which can be used as a primary ingredient for several dishes. Fish onion ring is another interesting mouth-watering item and so is Thai fish cake.The list also includes fried fish balls, cholli garlic fish bullets, crispy chicken pops, seafood har gow, grilled chicken and prawns shanghai, grilled fish cake bao and peri peri chicken roll. Vegetarian items include bao, hand-cut potato batons, herbed potato wedges and cheesy onion rings.Besides Continental and Thai cuisine, the restaurant also offers simple Indian food like rice and chicken curry. There is a big spread of desserts and mocktails as well.As of now it is a no-liquor restaurant. Asked about this, Sakpal said: As of now we are on the launch mode. The aquarium shop is huge. On display are 425 fish tanks and over 325 species of marine and freshwater fish. After a meal at the caf, one can see and buy fish tanks, aquarium lights, tank decoration equipment, artificial waterfall, etc. Spa for pets is the another interesting thing.Asian Arowana is the brand ambassador of Caf Hydro. Arowana basically seen in various Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia. The shop has a wide range here. One can purchase a pair of guppy for around Rs 50. The shop also fish species ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh.Some of the commonest ornamental fishes include guppy (lebistes reticulatus), molly (mollienisia latipinna), sword tail (xiphophorous hellerii), platy (xiphophorus varitus), siamesr fighter (betta splendens), angel (pterophyllum scalare), tiger barb (barbus tetrazona) and widow tetra (gymnocorymbus ternetzi)."

The state government also announced that more than 140 farmers took their lives between October and December 2016 because of crop failure. The agrarian crisis in the state is a fallout of a weather vagary that hasnt received much notice. The northeast monsoon  critical to the southern peninsula, particularly Tamil Nadu  has been a failure, with overall rainfall between October and December 45.2 per cent below normal. This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011. In October 2016, 22 districts of Karnataka were declared drought hit. As 2016 drew to a close, South Indias combined reservoir levels were 22 percentage points less than the average water availability over the past 10 years. The situation has serious implications for crops like paddy and coconut and will impact milk and sugar production, especially in Karnataka.The poor northeast monsoon, this year, is a double blow for the southern states. Tamil Nadu, Kerala and south interior Karnataka and coastal Karnataka had already reported respective shortfalls of 19 per cent, 34 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent during the southwest monsoon (June-September). The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season makes matters worse for these regions.The deficit in the northeast monsoon is likely to have implications for the economy. It may also accentuate inter-state river disputes, especially the sharing of Cauvery waters. While it is too early to predict the exact shortfalls in crop production, sowing figures from South India do not portend well. Tamil Nadu, for example, had targeted 14.5 lakh hectares under rice in 2016-17, according to the agriculture ministry. But barely seven lakh hectares was under the plough by January 5. This is 33 per cent less than the five-year sowing average of 10.68 lakh hectares. The shortfall will also impact livelihoods and have repercussions on the mechanisms to deal with crop failure. So far, less than a third of the drought hit areas in Karnataka have been covered by the Pradhan Mantri Gram Fasal Bima Yojana. The northeast monsoon is considered a fringe player in the agro-climate story. But imperatives of the economy and the needs to secure peoples livelihoods require a rethinking on that front.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

She was bemused when the chief minister asked her for a glass of water after delivering the rice packet to her.Paharin was the first beneficiary of the state governments recently launched Food Post scheme for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in her Surajbera village in Pakur districts Littipara block, around 400 km from Jharkhand capital Ranchi.Das, who was in Santhal Pargana on Thursday to launch government schemes worth Rs 280.67 crore, kicked off the scheme at the village by delivering the food packet at her doorstep. The CM told her that she would receive such packet every month at her doorstep and her family would not have to make rounds of dealers and the block.Over 24,000 families of Pahariya tribe of Santhal Paragana will be linked to the scheme soon, Das told the villagers.The Jharkhand government on April 3 started its ambitious food post scheme to provide food at the doorsteps of 70,000 vulnerable tribal families of the state, which are enrolled under the National Food Security Act (NFSA)The scheme is the first-of-its-kind in India, and through this, the state government seeks to provide food to PVTG families with the help of special messengers, who will deliver food packets to these tribal households.NFSA was launched in Jharkhand on September 25, 2015 and covers more than 2.63 crore people out of the states 3.29 crore population. Under the scheme, PVTGs are entitled to 35 kg of free ration per month.PVTGs live in jungles and hills because of which they have not been able to reap benefits of NFSA.Sundarin Paharin said: We have to walk around 12 km to reach the block headquarters for free ration. At times, we have to return emptyhanded. The scheme will save our time and money.As per a survey conducted in villages with PVTG population, families of the Soriya Paharaiya, an endangered PVTG, have to spend up to Rs 300 to access their free ration in blocks.As per the Supreme Court order dated November 28, 2001, ration distribution should be available free of cost every month to all PVTG families at a nearest point. Unfortunately, the so-called nearest points for many of the PVTGs means travelling up to 50-60 km, said Balram, a Right to Food activist, who had carried out the survey.The government has set a target to cover all districts of Jharkhand under the drive by the end of April."

Hence, from this day, good forces are on the rise and the power of evil forces which reside in the direction of South diminishes, said Pt Anand Shankar Vyas of Ujjain.Makar Sankranti is celebrated across the country with different names. While in the north it is celebrated as Lohri, in Assam as Bhogali Bihu and in the south as Pongal.But, for the last few years, the celebrations in Tamil Nadu had been mired in a political controversy over the Supreme Courts decision to ban Jallikattu, saying it causes torture to the animal.The ban has evoked strong reaction with even celebrities like Kamal Hassan and Rajnikanth opposing the ban saying one cannot curb tradition in name of animal welfare.Political parties in Tamil Nadu on Friday organised protests across the state against the apex courts refusal to pronounce a verdict before the Pongal festival on Saturday.The states opposition party DMK also accused the Centre and the AIADMK government of not taking appropriate, timely steps to ensure that the event was conducted.Jallikattu is our tradition, but the Centre and state government have failed to get us the permission to conduct it, said DMK leader MK Stalin. The Centre should bring an ordinance immediately, and the state should ensure that its followed.The four-day Pongal celebrations in Tamil Nadu began on Friday Bhogi, when people burn discarded items.Thai Pongal, which is the main day of festivities, will be celebrated on Saturday. Traditionally, Pongal is made in households across the state using freshly harvested rice grains. Maatu Pongal, the third day, is traditionally when Jallikattu events are held.Assam celebrates the mid-January Bhogali or Magh Bihu  a festival of feasting from Friday night -- with a difference.Officially, there will be no buffalo fight at Ahatguri in central Assam and bulbul bird fight at the Hayagrib-Madhab temple complex at Haju, west of Guwahati, in view of the Supreme Court ban, sources said it may be organised unofficially considering the sentiment of the locals attached.In Madha Pradesh, holy bath and pooja are witnessed on the bathing ghats of Narmada river at Amarkantak, Jabalpur, Omkareshwar, Hoshangabad and several other places.People also offer to the poor and needy food grains mainly rice, pulses and til (sesame seeds). Khichari and laddoos made of til are special dishes on the day.In north, where Lohri means start of harvest season in Punjab and Haryana, the dip in January temperature close to zero degree Celsius has dampened the spirits. Festivities have been organised for Friday night Lohri bonfire and cultural events. This year farmers expect a good winter crop because of above normal monsoon, a reason for cheer.In states such as Hayana and Rajasthan, Makar Sankranti is being celebrated to propagate girl child through campaigns such as Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao and Hamara Garv, Hamari Betiyan. In Rajasthan, scholarships will be given to girls for school to college studies.Arrangements are being made for special prayers meetings and pujas to be held at city temples and gurudwaras to mark Makar Sakranti on January 14.Hindus from Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana go to Kurukshetras Brahmasarovar and Haridwar in Uttarakhand to take holy dip in Ganga. Maghi mela is also organised in Punjab at Muktsar. People from all over Punjab gather at Muktsar Sahib for Maghi Mela and it is one of the Punjabs major fairs.

I certainly meant no disrespect, I didnt mean to have my feet on the couch, she said.The image of Conway trended widely on social media, with many Twitter users berating her for what they described as a lack of respect in the Oval Office.Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens was among those who criticized Conway, suggesting that Trumps own camp would not have tolerated such a casual stance from previous administrations.If Rice or Jarrett had sat like this in Oval Office, conservatives would have screamed themselves hoarse for weeks. Now we own trashy, he wrote, referring to previous presidential aides.Trumps predecessor Barack Obama repeatedly took flak for photos in which he appeared to be relaxing, sometimes with his feet on his desk.Critics had also chastised Obama for unbuttoning the previous Oval Office dress code that called for a suit jacket and a tie.This is not the first time Conway has found herself at the center of a storm.She recently came under fire for plugging the fashion brand of the presidents daughter. The head of the US Office of Government Ethics urged the White House to investigate Conway after the incident, saying she should face disciplinary action.She also famously coined the term alternative facts and referred to a Bowling Green massacre -- which never happened -- during an interview.Conway later tweeted that she meant to say Bowling Green terrorists -- referring to two Iraqi men who were indicted in 2011 for trying to send money and weapons to Al-Qaeda, and using improvised explosive devices against US soldiers in Iraq."

The Afghan national, Abdul Ali Noori, was admitted to the hospital by a relative and a guide.By Thursday afternoon, doctors extracted plastic pouches carrying poisonous substance from the patients stomach. The police and narcotics officers also arrived on the scene and identified the substance as heroin.The narcotics team collected the samples. Prima facie, it appears that the patient was carrying heroin packed in capsules that are five centimetres each in size, Vinay Prakash Singh, station house officer of Sector 24 police station, said.Noori, a native of Kandahar in Afghanistan, was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday night in an unconscious state by his relative and local guide-cum-translator. Noori is still unconscious and the hospital claims that they are operating on the patient as some of the pouches had burst inside his stomach.Noori has a history of loss of consciousness and was accompanied by a relative and a guide. However, he did not mention any local address and only submitted his passport, Chhaya Malhotra, spokesperson, Metro Hospital, said.As Noori was in a critical condition, the doctors admitted him to the intensive care unit and carried out a computed tomography (CT) scan on Wednesday morning.The CT scan of the abdomen showed multiple foreign bodies. We also carried out an upper GI endoscopy, which revealed multiple white cylindrical foreign bodies wrapped in plastic. Some of them possibly burst inside as we can also see swollen rice material, Dr Atul Sharma, gastroenterologist, Metro Hospital, said.Doctors said that Noori must have consumed the pouches orally as no operation marks were seen on his body.The police have deployed personnel at the hospital and held his relative and translator for further investigation. It is likely that Noori will be arrested if and when he gains consciousness.Police will decide further course of action once the Narcotics team confirms that the substance was contraband. Till then an investigation is going on, Singh said.However, Noori is a critical state and doctors said that they are trying to save his life. Repeat endoscopy or surgery might be done to remove the remaining bags from the stomach, Dr Sharma said.Many details about Noori and the events leading to his admission remain unclear."

We are moving towards making it (Aadhaar) essential, Preeti Sudan, Secretary, Department of Food and Public Distribution told a press conference here.Preeti added that benefits will not be denied for want of Aadhaar. There are other ways of authentication. Wait till we work out the nuances, was her refrain to questions about whether a person will be denied benefits if he/she does not have an Aadhaar number.Preeti said the Centre would soon issue a notification to make Aadhaar essential for receiving benefits under the NFSA. The NFSA grants rights to over 80 crore people to get 5 kg wheat or rice per person per month at Rs 2-3 per kg.The Supreme Court, on October 15, 2015, had ruled that the Aadhaar scheme was purely voluntary and cannot be made mandatory till the matter is finally decided by the court."

(Bhola Prasad)Vaarta, an annual agriculture meet that kicked off at Ganesh Puja Maidan in Kadma today, raised a toast to all those farmers who have reaped success by applying smart techniques on their land.The three-day event, featuring farmers from Kolhan region and scientists from across research institutes of the country, aims to promote better cultivation of crops in East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan. It was inaugurated by Sunil Bhaskaran, vice-president (corporate services), Tata Steel, along with R. Ravi Prasad, president, Tata Workers' Union.Around 600 farmers are taking part in the meet, which will also witness an exhibition and sale of farming equipment, agricultural produce, seeds, compost and a large variety of techniques used for better farming.On the first say, success stories like that of Vishwanath Tudu (41) were aplenty.The daily wage labourer, who till three years ago found it hard to feed his family, has a flourishing farming business now. He has wisely used his 4.8 acres of barren land at Benagadia in Ghurabandha block of East Singhbhum, thanks to Tata Steel Rural Development Society (TSRDS) that helped him dug up a pond.""The main hurdle that I faced was water scarcity. The unproductive land now yields creepers, vegetables, tomatoes and other crops. A quintal of fish was released in the pond,"" said Tudu.Another farmer, Ranjit Kumar Mahto (50) from Ghurabandha block, added: ""TSRDS helped me too. We know the crop will not fail because we have started implementing more scientific techniques and platforms like Vaarta help us learn new trends.""Over the next two days, farmers, along with scientists, will deliberate on a number of topics like climate-resilient agriculture, vegetable marketing, integrated farming, lac cultivation, pisciculture and much more.The scientists and experts have come from International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, Hyderabad; Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad; Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Bhubaneswar; Central Rainfed Upland Rice Research Station; and Birsa Agricultural University."

Clearly there is one outlier that needs to be addressed and that is China. As we move through all the other elements of the NSG membership, I think, were on a good path forward, Biswal said.Read: Why NSG membership matters to India: All you need to knowSo what remains is to be able to have a very clear understanding on what is the basis of Chinas reservations and to try to work through those. So that will be something that would move on to the next administration to carry forward, she said in response to a question.But this is something that the President himself has personally engaged on, the Secretary (of State), (National Security Advisor), Ambassador (Susan) Rice and down the line this has been an area of intense effort by this administration, Biswal said.While India not becoming a NSG member is disappointing, Biswal said the Obama Administration is very very gratified to see Indias entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).China is advocating a two-step non-discriminatory approach for admission of countries who have not signed nuclear-Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the NSG.As per the new stand announced by Beijing in November, it first wants to find a solution that is applicable to the admission of all non-NPT members followed by discussions to admit specific non-NPT member.Chinas stand for a non-discriminatory criteria is regarded significant as Pakistan, a close ally of Beijing too has applied for the NSG membership along with India."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Feb. 5: The fair price shop owners today gave an ultimatum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to release their pending commissions or they would stop supplying foodgrain under the National Food Security Act. The shop owners from across the state met here today to discuss their next course of action as the state government was yet to release their commissions since April 2016. According to the shop owners, under the act, their commissions should be given in advance. If the fair price shops stop distributing foodgrain, 2.5 crore people who receive rice at Rs 3 per kg will be affected. ""We will submit a memorandum to the chief minister on Tuesday. We will tell him that if our commissions are not released immediately, we will stop supplying foodgrain,"" said Hemanta Deka, the general secretary of Xodou Asom Xulobh Mulyor Byobaxayi Xontha, an association of the fair price shop owners. The association had earlier threatened to stop supplying foodgrain from October last year but withdrew the decision following a promise by the state government that it would release all pending amount till September immediately. The shop owners are yet to receive their commissions. ""Today's meeting discussed the issue in detail. The commission is the only source of income for ration shop owners. Since the government has not released the commission, we are facing a lot of problems. Many of us are forced to think of an alternative source of income. Today's meeting also took a resolution to stage a protest during the ongoing Assembly session besides submitting the memorandum,"" said Deka. A ration shop owner gets Rs 1.10 as commission for per quintal of rice. They want it to be raised to Rs 3 per quintal. A source in the state food and civil supplies department told The Telegraph that the commission has been released to the deputy commissioners' offices and been sitting there. Dispur has asked the deputy commissioners to pay the commission only through bank accounts of the ration shop owners. But collection and upgrade of the account numbers is yet to be completed. The source said the initial delay in releasing the commission was because the state government did not receive the central government's share. The Centre has recently released its share - Rs 50 crore - to the state government. At present, only Nalbari, Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Morigaon, Kamrup (metro) and Darrang districts have started paying commission through the bank accounts of the shop owners."

Three meals a day are provided free of cost to the patients admitted to the hospital already.We wanted to provide the food free of cost to the staff as well. However, there would have been problems in implementation like checking the I-card or providing a coupon before every meal. The cost of implementation would have been more than the cost of food, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain at the inauguration ceremony.The health minister has assured that, if possible, the food would be made free for the staff member after a month of the trial run.The hospital was able to extend the services to the relatives of the patients and staff members because of the automated kitchen it started 12 days ago. This is Delhis first automated hospital kitchen equipped with vegetable peelers and cutters, roti maker and rice cooker.Read More: This website can change the way Indians eatWith the new kitchen, the meal preparation time has halved  from three hours it took earlier to one-and-a-half hour now. We also need less people in the kitchen now. Earlier we needed 25 people in each shift, which we did not have. Now, only 12 people can do all the work, said Dr JC Passey medical director of Lok Nayak hospital.Earlier, we needed at least 10 people to just make the chapatis, we need only 3 people. Also, the machine can make up to 2,000 chapatis in just an hour, Dr Passey said.The kitchen provides breakfast, lunch and dinner to nearly 2,000 patients each day, with special therapeutic diet for patients with diabetes, heart conditions etc.With staff members wearing aprons, gloves and caps, the food is prepared hygienically and then transported in insulated carts to the wards to be served to the patients.The new kitchen was designed by the Delhi Institute of Hotel Management and Catering Technology, which will constantly monitor the functioning to ensure that the standards are maintained.As in corporate hospitals, Lok Nayak also aims to start packaging individual servings separately in the kitchen itself.From planning to realisation, the project took around two years and cost the government more than R 1 crore."

J. Ramesh, director general of the India Meteorological Department, told Reuters in an interview.The emergence of El Nino after July does not either indicate a weak start or deficient rains, as this weather pattern is only one of the many variables influencing the south-west monsoon, Ramesh said.A U.S. government weather forecaster earlier this month said La Nina conditions had disappeared and projected the possibility of El Nio developing later this year.Forecasters in Japan and Australia also see a 40-50 chance of the El Nino weather pattern later this year.El Nio, a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically occurs every few years, faded in 2016 and was linked to crop damage, fires and flash floods.Despite forecasts of La Nina leading to heavy bursts of rains, India only received average monsoon rainfall last year, not surplus as previously expected, Ramesh said, alluding to the limited impact of both El Nino and La Nina on Indias monsoon.Typically less damaging than El Nio, La Nia is characterized by unusually cold ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and tends to occur unpredictably every two to seven years. Severe occurrences have been linked to floods and droughts.India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season.A weak El Nino, forecast to develop across Asia this year, would have only slight impact on crops such as wheat, palm oil, rice and oilseeds, Kyle Tapley, an agricultural meteorologist with U.S.-based MDA Weather Services, said this month.The monsoon, which delivers 70 percent of Indias annual rainfall, is critical for the countrys 263 million farmers and their rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybean crops because nearly half of its farmland lacks irrigation.Before receiving average rains in 2016, India suffered back-to-back drought years for only the fourth time in over a century, hurting incomes and driving some farmers to suicide."

The event is being organised by the department of agriculture in collaboration with Karnataka State Agricultural Produce Processing and Export Corporation Limited, agricultural universities and Jaivik Krishik Society.The fair will act as a medium to connect farmers, buyers, sellers and FMCG (fast moving consumer goods) companies.Millets are climate-resilient and can grow easily under adverse climatic conditions. Hence, we are promoting the cultivation and consumption of millets through this fair, said Krishna Byre Gowda, Minister of State for Agriculture.In spite of millets being one of the richest sources of nutrition, the area under millet cultivation has witnessed a sharp decline over the last five decades. The production of small millets has declined by 76%. After years of neglect, small millets are now getting attention in agricultural research and development agenda of the country and this fair is a step towards the same. We will encourage cultivation of millets among farmers and promote them as potential food products for sale, said Gowda.In each hobli, we have identified a village spread across 100 hectares for organic farming. There are 566 farmers groups across the state involved in organic farming. These farmers will be certified as organic farmers after they complete three years of organic cultivation. Farmers groups will participate in the fair which will act as a platform to directly connect farmers with potential FMCG companies, said B Shivaraju, director of Karnataka State Seeds and Organic Certification Agency."

58feeefc7be9e0429666b929,Discover Delhi: A runaway poet from Kashmir and her poem about running away,http://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi/discover-delhi-a-runaway-poet-from-kashmir-and-her-poem-about-running-away/story-d82BfjOavQ3OGp3XnL6eEI.html,2017-03-24,"A paperback of Aga Shahid Alis poetry is lying on her living room mattress. The small table has an old copy of The New Yorker. The shelf is stacked with authors such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Marcel Proust, and Mirza Waheed.And then she wants us to believe she is a qualified biotechnology engineer.But that is nothing more to her than a graduation certificate.We are meeting Samia Mehraj this afternoon in her capacity as a poet. Mehraj, who recently received the coveted Young India fellowship, is looking forward to spend a year in Ashoka University, Haryana, where she will study liberal arts.In her 20s, she lives alone in her apartment with her books, her rice cooker, her laptop, and her note pads. There are no windows, which is probably a good thing because her neighbourhood in south Delhis Maidan Garhi is mostly a mumbo-jumbo of dusty lanes and concrete structures built without any concession to conventional architectural aesthetics. Even if Mehrajs flat was in a less congested locality, the window view might still have not been as beautiful as the one at her parents home in Kashmir.Mehraj grew up with a younger brother in Srinagar and Sopore where her father works as a civil engineer and mother as a Zoology lecturer. The window of her room in their Sopore house looks to an atmospheric street, an old dilapidated building and lots of poplar trees.Non-Kashmiris gather the stories about Kashmir from books, magazines and newspapers, says Mehraj, While an average Kashmiri like me knew it all merely by gazing out from our windows.Referring to her lands decades-old insurgency, she says, It hurts to see people dying.Actually, Mehraj does have a window in her Maidan Garhi flat but she keeps it closed and has instead decked it with yellow notes scrawled with Aga Shahids lines. One chit says: My memory is again in the way of your history. Another says: Your history gets in the way of my memory.In a way, Mehrajs life is full of gentle rebellions. When I was in Kashmir, I had to struggle with its conservative ways. I could never be myself. I wanted to run away. But when Im in Delhi, I want to run away back home.Mehraj moved to Delhi in March 2016 despite the reservation of her parents. She briefly worked as a creative content writer for a start-up in Gurgaon. To me, Delhi is like the Paris of runaway girls. This city challenged me. It is here that I became an independent woman.In the beginning, Mehraj wanted to be an engineer but her parents insisted on a career in medicine. Apparently, she says, most parents in Kashmir want their daughters to be doctors.But Mehraj did not budge and studied engineering in a university in Punjab. She started writing poetry only a year ago, though was always drawn towards it because of her father who tends to hum (only hum) ghazals in his melancholic voice.Mehraj shares excerpts of her poem - The runaway girl - with us.Doesnt thunder come homein the hottest of summerwhen the vows are broken and a girl runs away from her home?You must have adored her gold anklets.It must have been tinkle in their sound that never gave it away.Or maybe they shone too darkly in your stone eyesand blinded you so.Pray, why else didnt you see how they weighed her down?And now she tiptoes down this ghostly town.while you fret and fondle in your pitch dark beds.The little light that shed been kindlingso carefully, so secretlynow guides her out, guides her away!And how you wish that she was more obedient to you,and not to her waywardness,this runaway girl!Explaining the story behind this poem, she says: Leaving home with a hope that Ill be a writer one day wasnt easy. Crowded city, small rooms, hot weather and a purpose to find. I did survive it but convincing my parents to let me experiment and live in a city alone instead of doing a masters in engineering was hard. They loved me but couldnt understand me.She goes on to say, This was extremely stressful for me and my parents. At that point of time, I found Alok Dhanwas Hindi poem titled Bhagi hui ladkiyan somewhere on the internet and it instantly filled me up with emotions. Later, I clenched my fists and penned down this poem. I slept well that night."
