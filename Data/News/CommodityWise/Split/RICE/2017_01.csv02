Having spent almost his entire life outside the state, Naveen did not know anyone when he came to Odisha.During Biju Patnaiks tenure as chief minister between 1990 and 1995, Mohapatra worked as his principal secretary and was the eyes and ears of the legendary politician. With virtually no friends in Odisha, Naveen turned to his mother Gyan Patnaik, who advised him to seek the help of Pyari babu to navigate the choppy waters of politics.Mohapatra paved the way for Naveens smooth ascension to the throne in 2000 when he engineered the expulsion and subsequent political checkmating of Bijoy Mohapatra, the chairman of BJDs political affairs committee shortly before the assembly elections. The canny Mohapatra saw Bijoy Mohapatra as the main adversary of Naveen in the fledgling BJD and ensured that he did not get to contest the polls. It is PM who has stabbed me, said Bijoy at a public meeting in his constituency in Kendrapara district referring to Mohapatra.From early 2000, Mohapatra scripted almost all the moves of Naveen, including advising him on day-to-day running of the state. Naveen, a political greenhorn, depended on uncle Mohapatra and suggested his bureaucrats and ministers to often consult the retired bureaucrat on policy matters and politics.Mohapatra soon acquired a larger-than-life image in the party with bureaucrats queuing up before his house for orders on some policy issues.The BJP was an ally of BJD, but Pyari Mohan Mohapatra convinced Naveen to dump it just ahead of the 2009 assembly polls citing that the saffron partner had become a political liability in the wake of Kandhamal riots in 2008. (Arabinda Mahapatra/HT File Photo)Over time, the bespectacled Mohapatra, calculated each and every moves of moves of Naveen like a consummate chess player. More than Naveen Niwas, the residence of the chief minister, Mohapatras residence at 111 Sahid Nagar in Bhubaneswar was where the levers of power were being turned. He was dubbed as super chief minister and Chanakya of Odisha politics. What Amit Shah is to (Narendra) Modi, Pyari babu was to Naveen. He changed the DNA of BJD and made it a politically well-oiled winning machine, said political analyst Rabi Das.A grateful Naveen sent Mohapatra to Rajya Sabha in 2004. The Bharatiya Janata Party was an ally of BJD, but Mohapatra convinced Naveen to dump it just ahead of the 2009 assembly polls citing that the saffron partner had become a political liability in the wake of Kandhamal riots in 2008.While everyone said the move was suicidal, Mohapatra helped the BJD win 109 of the 147 seats in the assembly.Using a cheap rice scheme for the poor and through some deft selection of candidates, he managed to break the Congress and BJP bastion in the tribal districts of undivided Koraput, Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Sundargarh. He even propped up candidates in places where BJD candidates were on a weak wicket to ensure they eat into the rivals votes.But post-2009 polls, the bond between the two men showed signs of cracks as Mohapatra tried to assert himself as the most important leader of the party but Naveen asked his bureaucrats not to report to his political advisor. The frigidity in the realtionship was evident in 2012 panchayat polls when Naveen campaigned alone in the panchayat elections and then unilaterally announced the names of three Rajya Sabha candidates without even a phonecall to Mohapatra. To rub more salt into Mohapatras wounds, Naveen unilaterally announced BJDs support for former Lok Sabha Speaker PA Sangma as presidential candidate.Mohapatra fell from grace on May 29, 2012 when he allegedly tried to engineer a coup in the party while Naveen was away in London on his first overseas trip after becoming CM. Naveen was furious when he learnt of the coup attempt and tried to mock Mohapatra for acting like his self-appointed advisor.The rebellion fell through as just 33 of the 104 MLAs of the party showed allegiance to the Chanakya. Soon after Naveen returned from London, the smoulders of rebellion had died as Mohapatra realised his disciple had outwitted him in politics. He is a beimaan and backstabber, said Naveen, soon after suspending Mohapatra and a few others from the party.Mohapatra swore revenge promising that he would reveal explosive details about Naveen when the time comes. But his threat had no effect and his party, Odisha Jana Morcha, bit the dust in 2014 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. He receded to further political oblivion last year when his Rajya Sabha tenure ended.In between a few political leaders, including union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, visited him after he was diagnosed with lung cancer."

The bottles were found concealed in bags of rice meant for midday meal (MDM). The police arrested four school teachers, but set them free after a few hours.An enraged mob, including parents of school students and women, locked the school and blocked the Cherki-Dobhi road on Monday. A team from Cherki police station, which tried to clear the blockade, was chased away by the agitating villagers. Bodh Gaya deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ravishankar Prasad later reached there with heavy enforcement and tied to persuade the mob to lift the blockade.After four hours of persuasion, the mob agreed to end the agitation on a condition that the police would register a named FIR on the basis of the statement by school cook Jirawa Devi. The FIR lodged on Saturday was against unknown persons.In the fresh FIR, Jirawa Devi alleged that four teachersUpendra Kumar, Dilip Kumar, Sarfaraj and Nisha Kumarihad been using the school storeroom and the kitchen to conceal liquor for a long time. They were also involved in the liquor trade, she said.Despite registration of a fresh FIR, the school remained locked on Tuesday, with the parents refusing to send children there.Alarmed over the matter, the Gaya district administration directed the MDM officer to inquire into the incident and initiate steps to ensure sanctity of educational institutions.Gaya district magistrate Kumar Ravi said the law would take its own course. It is now up to the police to find out the truth and act in accordance with the law. I have directed the district MDM officer to look into the circumstances under which the liquor reached the school. I have asked him to ensure hygienic meal to children and regular inspection of the kitchen as well as storerooms of schools, the DM added.The Bodh Gaya DSP has also directed the police station concerned to club all the complaints received in connection with liquor smuggling from the school and build up a strong case against all the teachers named in the FIR.The police have swung into action to gather evidences against the accused before initiating further action, he said. When asked why the teachers were set free after their arrest on Saturday, the DSP said nobody had turned up before the police as witness and there was no concrete evidence against them. After the new complaint, we have initiated investigation afresh and are also keeping eyes on the suspects. If the allegations are found true, we will spare nobody, the DSP said, and added that efforts were still on to open the locked school building with the cooperation of parents.Manufacture, sale and consumption of alcohol is banned in Bihar since total prohibition was imposed in the state on April 5, 2016."

According to estimates, the items offered on the plate may cost nearly Rs50 in the market.The amount of Rs5 is just a token amount that we are seeking. The food will be offered only to those who have voted. Further, we have also started a signature campaign where we are offering pulao and getting signatures of people after encouraging them to vote on the polling day, Devendra Hitkari, another member of the NGO, said.The organisation members said they have also procured a bulk SMS package of nearly one lakh and will send text messages to voters on the night of February 10.Those who are arriving for the signature campaign are also asked to give us their mobile numbers.

Starting as an independent, he has been in RJD, Samajwadi Party, BSP and now, the JD (U).Dadan has been embroiled in several controversies over the years. He was once accused of forcibly occupying a government bungalow in Patna. He again hit controversy when he got a gigantic statute of the legendary wrestler Mahabali Vir Lorik Ahir installed on the premises of his official bungalow in Patna.Dadan is now in the news because the Bank of India (BoI) has attached the landed assets as well as defunct rice mill belonging to him and his son Kartar Singh, for defaulting on the repayment of a loan taken by son Kartar in which father Dadan was the guarantor.The MLAs son had taken loan from the bank for setting up the rice mill.The properties seized included the rice mill at Dumraon (Buxar) and one and a half katha of land at Saguna Mor in Danapur, which will be auctioned by the bank soon.The loan amount with interest accrued on it has gone up to Rs 1.5 crore.The Dumraon MLA, while confirming the seizure of land assets at Buxar and Danapur by the bank, was unable to recall the date and year of the loan his son had taken.I being the guarantor and my son defaulter in the case, it was natural for the bank to seize the property, said Pehalwan.Once a wrestler, who taught wrestling in Varanasi in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, Dadan plunged into politics and won as an Independent from Dumraon in 2000 Assembly poll. He was soon made commercial taxes minister in the Rabri Devi cabinet.Dadan set up the Prajatantrik Lok Ekta Dal before the 2010 Assembly polls. But he merged his outfit with HD Deve Gowdas JD (S) later. He subsequently joined forces with Mayawati after losing the poll.He contested the August 2014 Lok Sabha poll on BSP ticket but lost again.He was once the Bihar unit president of Samajwadi Party before being expelled from the party."

All were accused of playing a role in the procurement and supply of sub-standard paddy.Earlier this month, Congress party announced Mangat Rai Bansals wife, Manju Bansal as its candidate from Mansa seat. Since the ticket announcement, Manju Bansal has been facing protest from the local leaders during her campaign.However on Tuesday, Captain shared the stage with Mangat Rai Bansal and took pot shots at the SAD-BJP regime and Aam Admi Party.Rubbishing the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) poll manifesto as a bunch of lies aimed at misleading the people, Punjab Congress president Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday said, Badals have failed to implement even 20% of the promises they made during the last elections. Were they sleeping all these years, rejecting their offer of farm loan waiver as a mere gimmick with an eye on the polls and reiterating the Congress commitment to take over all the loans of the debt-ridden farmers and agricultural labourers immediately after assuming power in the state.What stopped them from working in the interest of the people all these years? Or were they too busy filling their own coffers to think about the welfare of the people? Captain Amarinder asked.The Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president alleged that neither the Akalis nor the AAP were interested in the welfare of the people of Punjab. Describing Kejriwal as a smooth and slimy operator, Captain Amarinder said the bribery and sex scandals involving AAP leaders and workers had made a mockery of his claims of providing clean and transparent governance. With all Punjabs disputes with Haryana, how can a Haryanvi be trusted to stand by the people of Punjab, asked Captain Amarinder.The PPCC president also hit out at Badal over the CIA report linking him with terrorism in Punjab and also assailed him for the growing intolerance in the state, as manifest in the increasing incidents of sacrilege.Two rebel candidatesGurpreet Kaur Gagowal and Gurpreet Singh Vickyskipped the rally in Mansa. Both the leaders withdrew their nomination papers, however they had maintained that no support will be extended to Manju Bansal. When contacted Gurpreet Singh Vicky said he was not invited for the rally."

After all, its the only place on earth where the 65-year-old farmer from Ahatguri isnt judged on the basis of the money he has.On Friday, Das exchanged fish from his pond for a few bags of turmeric and ginger at the fair. Renumai Devi (57), who took the fish off his hands, was happy she didnt have to haggle over petty change for once.In a demonetised age where cashless transactions are being projected as the countrys stepping stones to a brighter future, the Jonbeel Mela  arguably Indias only fair that works on the barter system  comes as a veritable blast from the past. To be specific, the 15th century.The three-day fair, organised by the Tiwa community at Dayang Belguri in Morigaon district for over five centuries, witnesses the exchange of goods between tribes from the hills and plains of Assam as well as Meghalaya. Tribal people from the hills come down on the invitation of Tiwa king Gova Roja, and exchange their produce with people from the plains, said Jursing Bordoloi, secretary of the Gova Deuraja Jonbeel Mela Development Samiti.Exchange of goods takes place on the second day of the fair. Nearly 40,000 people participated in the fair this year, and transactions amounting to over Rs 1 crore were made.I exchanged beaten rice and rice flour for ginger and turmeric! exclaimed Amiyo Deka of Khusunagug village in Morigaon. Her customer, Riliang Umbah from Ri-Bhoi district of Meghalaya, was happy with the transaction too.Most hill folks brought items like ginger, turmeric, black pepper, cinnamon and yam, which were exchanged for beaten rice, rice flour, fish and traditional sweets from their counterparts on the plains. As was the practice in the old days, items were sold without the use of weighing scales. Measurements were made with bowls and hands, and both parties decided how much each should get.Besides trade, Jonbeel Mela is also known for promoting friendship and harmony among tribes in the region. Every participant addresses the other as mama or mami (maternal uncle or aunt). The bonhomie only grows as tribal families stay on for days at the venue of the fair, a paddy field.Community fishing at the nearby Jonbeel (the wetland after which the fair is named), cockfights, cultural shows, community feasts and token collection of taxes by Gova Roja and his courtiers are other highlights of the fair.We spend nearly Rs 20 lakh to organise the fair. Though 30-35 acres of land is needed to accommodate everybody, none of it is ours, said Jursing Bordoloi, secretary of Junbeel Mela organising committee.Jonbeel Mela attracts thousands of tourists each year, and organisers hope chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal  who will drop by on Saturday  provides financial aid and allots a permanent site for the fair."
58fef7497be9e0429666bfbf,Modi's 'achhe din' reality check: Pressure builds to deliver on election promise,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/where-are-the-achhe-din-ask-those-who-voted-for-modi/story-zSkharcZSfHdLRtDtwd5UJ.html,2017-02-05,"Rocking the youngest of his five children in his arms, street vendor Daata Ram watches his wife tend to two sick cows whose milk once supplemented their meagre income.The 66-year-olds family of seven survives on what he now makes by selling small quantities of puffed rice in Pandra Sikanpur, a one-street, hardscrabble town of 5,000 in Uttar Pradesh.I took a loan of Rs 30,000 to buy those cows but I think they are no good now, says Ram, who uses a fourth of his monthly earnings of Rs5000-6000 to repay the local moneylender.Across the street from Rams thatched hut is the sprawling house of Neeraj Kumar Singh, a well-off sugarcane farmer who lost multiple crops to back-to-back droughts three years ago, and then suffered when farm prices crashed last year.It takes two harvesting seasons to recover the loss of one, says Singh who wants his sons to find jobs outside farming so that their lives wouldnt be held ransom to the vagaries of nature.But his four children have found no jobs, and the 60-year-old farmer is angry that he must now divide his 10 acres of cropland to secure their future.Daata Ram and Singh sit on different points on the countrys income spectrum but, in their collective discontent, the two symbolise the rising pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to deliver on his emotive election vow to bring achhe din, or good times, to Indians.The Feb. 1 budget was a chance for Modi to unveil measures that would fulfil his 2014 guarantee of growth and more jobs, a task made all the more tough by his abrupt decision to drain out 86% of all cash in the economy in his fight against illicit wealth.Its also a challenge that is urgent, given that Modi has already crossed the halfway point of his tenure.Read | Budget 2017: Akhilesh says BJP could not fulfil promise of achhe dinTo his admirers, though, Modi has already made great strides  from reinvigorating the ossified hand of a government system that hobbled progress to biting the bullet on tough decisions needed to pull Indias economy out of a dangerous morass.Many of his moves on inclusive, accountable governance and a freer hand to bureaucracy have resonated well with Indians tired of a rudderless government mired in corruption scandals and whose indecisiveness had left more than 700 major industry projects in limbo.Rambir Rathi , a Uttar Pradesh farmer at home (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Growing economySome of that good work is showing.The countrys annualised retail inflation is below the mid-point of the central banks target; public finances are better than before with higher income from taxes, monsoon-sown grain production is the highest in at least 14 years and the economy is more open to business than it has ever been. In its first two years, the government cleared more economic reforms  including deregulating diesel prices, cutting cooking gas subsidy and making it easier for companies to exit business  than in the last five years of the previous government. Millions more have been brought into the countrys banking system and the government has pushed digitisation.In the latest budget, the government also announced incentives to labour-intensive sectors such as clothing and leather along with spending more on projects like roads, railways, low-cost housing and irrigation.I will give the Prime Minister two out of 10. Even 2 seems two much. I feel like giving only one. Modis foreign policy is good . The one point is just for that.But Modis critics say much of this is old wine in a new bottle, minor cosmetic tweaks that havent put India on the path of a paradigm shift the prime minister had promised.Economic growth hasnt created enough jobs because of lack of investment, income inequality has grown, farm distress has soared and the cash ban has only worsened the economic outlook in the immediate term. Credit to industry remains flat and, despite higher farm credit target, disbursement levels have dipped as banks seek to avoid bad loans.Even for some Modi fans like Rambir Rathi, a sugarcane farmer in Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat, the dream of achhe din is coming unstruck.I voted for Modi. Farmers like us were promised Rs 500 for a quintal of sugarcane instead of the Rs 315 we were receiving then. I believed in him, says the father of two.They told us our dues would be paid by the sugar mill owners but look what has happened. The rate is the same. Our dues remain unpaid.Asked to rate Modis governance of more than two years, Rathi gives the prime minister two on 10.Do bhi jyada hai. Mann toh nahin karta hai ek bhi dene ko (Even two is too much. I dont feel like giving him even one), he says, adding Modi had only done well on dealing with Pakistan.But farms in distressWith mounting debt, poverty, increasing health cost and other ballooning farming-related expenses, farm incomes dropped 50%-70% over the past years. And just farmers hoped to claw back from two years of back-to-back drought, the government ordered a disruptive currency ban that squeezed the largely cash-only agriculture sector.Farm prices crashed as farmers dumped tomatoes and potatoes onto the streets, fed unharvested crop to cattle and farm hands sat idle. A farm loan write-off for two months after demonetisation hardly helped, some economists say.Februarys budget raised the farm credit target to by 11.1% to Rs 10-lakh crore in 2017-18 but, in reality, bank lending to farmers has dropped and the distribution of credit has focussed on a handful of relatively better-off states.Expenditure on agriculture is seen rising marginally to Rs 2.06-lakh crore in 2017/18, but this in real terms might signal a decline.Fewer jobsSigns of distress are clear in cities as well. Sharp rises in education and healthcare costs in the last two years have hit Indias burgeoning middle class hard, denting Modis popularity among the relatively well-off.Today, India stands before a unique moment in history: It could choose to squander its immense potential with its antiquated socio-political system, corruption and flighty business rules or build on its cultural heritage, democratic values and a young demography to transform the lives of its 1.25 billion citizens.To begin with, two decades on, nothing less than a $10 trillion economy will secure Indias future, says a recent study by Pricewaterhouse Coopers( PwC). It will have to create jobs on a scale that can absorb 10-12 million people who join the workforce every year, including members of the emerging middle class  a billion strong by 2034.Read | Achhe din will come only after 2019, Cong working on it: Rahul GandhiBut only 135,000 jobs were created in 2015 -- the lowest total in seven years and 67% lower than the number created in the last year of the previous government. In one quarter of 2016-17, for which official data is available, only 77,000 jobs were created  and of these 50,000 were government jobs.The gloom is affecting the youth.Chartered accountant Omprakash Sethia in Bhopal. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT PHOTO)Nothing has changed. It seems there is nobody to follow Modijis principles of hard work and integrity. Corruption is rampant . It seems there is no monitoring system in the country. I am hugely disappointed, says Omprakash Sethia of Bhopal.I thought there would be a boom on the job front but despite emphasis on digital India I dont see many job avenues, says Subhanshu Sethia, a commerce student in Bhopal.The demonetisation move worsened the plight of the vulnerably placed in the labour market in several ways, the most stress arising out of closure of establishments in the informal sector.Back in Pandra Sikanpur, Singh says he will think twice about voting for Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the next general elections scheduled for 2019.That view is far from universal, but is already on the radar of a government, which swept to power with promises of economic reforms and pro-business policies that appealed to aspirational Indians living in big towns and cities.Modi has already started turning his attention to the hinterlands. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley this month said the government will spend a record amount on rural areas and farming to help double farmers income by 2022.But Singh is unimpressed.Narendra Modi stressed on jobs during his speeches in general election. Where are those jobs? he asks.I know how I feel is how many many more Indians feel.(With inputs from Ranjan Srivastava and Sumanta Ray Chaudhuri)"

Yadav, who was subsequently brought to his battalions headquarters in Rajouri, had alleged that the poor quality food, including watery dal without tadka and burnt chapatis, was a result of pilferage of supplies by senior officers. The outrage generated by the viral video ensured it was probed by a court of inquiry headed by a deputy inspector general (DIG) of the paramilitary.The inquiry looked into the supply of items such as cumin, garlic, ginger and onion, which are required for tadka.Sources said that cumin was not available for two to three days at the base but by the time Yadav put out his selfie videos, the vital tadka ingredient had reached the base. High-altitude posts are supplied with dehydrated onions but even these were not available at Yadavs position then. Garlic and ginger are not supplied to the base at all.Apart from dal, there were other food items on the menu but Yadav didnt complain about them, said an official source privy to the preliminary findings. BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said that the inquiry report is expected in the next few days. The inquiry is always instituted to look into an incident. It is not against an individual. In this case, Yadav alleged non-availability of tadka dal and so it was necessary to look into it, he said.Yadav had used his sons Facebook account to circulate the videos on January 7-8. The court of inquiry, said sources, checked the menu on those days. It was found that jawans were served chapati, cooked vegetables, pickle and coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they got rice, chapati, fruits and moong dal, and for dinner they were served fish, moong dal, chapatti, rice and vegetables.Read | Soldiers can tell their problems directly to army chief through WhatsApp messageThe menu keeps changing. On some days, jawans get parantha for breakfast and rajma-rice for lunch. In fact, other food items available to jawans are visible in the selfie video posted by Yadav, said a source. Yadav had applied for voluntary retirement from the force, which had been accepted a few days before he posted the videos. He was to serve with the force till January 31 this year but due to the court of inquiry, his request for voluntary retirement has been denied for now.Sources familiar with the findings of the court of inquiry said Yadavs allegations of pilferage are not supported by other jawans posted at the same base. The inquiry report would also establish whether Yadav breached discipline and violated the Official Secrets Act by revealing the base structure in his videos."

He rushed towards the park in Bharat Vihar, where a procession of over 30 people was celebrating Saraswati idol immersion. His elder sister, Aarti, tried to stop him as it was 9pm and he had to get up in time for school the next day. Realising that he wont stop, she raced towards him.Read more: Minor raped, strangled and dumped in GurgaonAnkush pushed through the crowd to stand alongside the park railing. Suddenly, the tempo reversed and hit Ankush.The impact was such that the boy was crushed to death on the spot.

58fefbbc7be9e0429666c33c,Donald Trump attracts criticism for saying he respects 'killer' Putin,http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-attracts-criticism-for-saying-he-respects-killer-putin/story-n2I2ZHshQMQvwcu7cljlYJ.html,2017-02-05,"President Donald Trump drew fire from Republicans and Democrats alike on Sunday, after he defended a softer stance on Russia, playing down political assassinations and Moscows invasion of Ukraine.Trump -- now two weeks into his four-year term -- showed no signs of yielding to demands from within his own Republican Party to distance himself from President Vladimir Putin, plunging himself into a fresh political firestorm.I do respect him. Well, I respect a lot of people, but that doesnt mean Ill get along with them, Trump said in an excerpt of a Super Bowl interview with Fox Newss Bill OReilly that will air in full on Sunday.When pressed in relation to Putins alleged links to the extrajudicial killing of journalists and dissidents, Trump said, There are a lot of killers. We have a lot of killers.You think our country is so innocent? Trump asked rhetorically.Trumps fellow Republicans, including senate leader Mitch McConnell, were quick to criticise the presidents remarks.I dont think there is any equivalency with the way the Russians conduct themselves and the way the United States does, McConnell said.He is a former KGB agent, a thug, not elected in a way that most people consider a credible election, he told CNN.That criticism was echoed by Michael McFaul, a former ambassador to Russia and advisor to former president Barack Obama, described Trumps comments as disgusting.This moral equivalency that Trumps continues to draw between the USA and Russia is disgusting (and inaccurate), he said on Twitter.Major fight against ISMainstream Republicans have repeatedly called on Trump to distance himself from Putin, with little impact.Throughout the election campaign, Trump refused to criticise the Russian leader, saying better relations with the Kremlin would be in the US national interest.The new president has advocated working with Russia to combat the Islamic State group in Syria.If Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all around the world, major fight. Thats a good thing, Trump told Fox.Moscow has deployed aircraft, naval assets and troops to Syria, but has so far trained its fire on rebels with the aim of propping up Bashar al-Assads regime.In December, US intelligence agencies went public with their view that Russia conducted a hack-and-release campaign aimed at swinging the US election in Trumps favour.Trumps repeated criticism of NATO -- a common target for Putin -- has only fuelled suspicions that Trump is ready to side with Moscow over allies in Europe.Across Europe, there are growing concerns that the continent might be wedged between a hostile Russia and a hostile United States.Trumps stance on Ukraine has also raised eyebrows. After a call with Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko on Saturday, the White House said the pair addressed Ukraines long-running conflict with Russia.Russia annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea in March 2014 and has supported separatists in the east of the country.Former national security advisor Susan Rice publicly criticised Trumps framing of the situation.This distortion of even recent history is deeply troubling, she tweeted.Were watchingTrumps Vice-President Mike Pence tried to explain the administrations approach to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which had flared after Trump and Putin spoke by telephone a week ago.Were watching, and (were) very troubled by the increased hostilities over the past week in eastern Ukraine, Pence told ABCs This Week news program.During the Trump-Putin call, the Kremlin said the two men had discussed improving economic relations, a potential signal of Trumps willingness to lift sanctions on Russia.Asked whether the administration would be willing to ease sanctions while Russia is violating ceasefire agreements, Pence demurred.I think thats a question that will be answered in the months ahead. And it just simply all depends, he said.If we have opportunities to work together, I think the president is looking for an opportunity to begin that relationship anew.But make no mistake about it -- those decisions will await action. And theyll be very dependent on how the Russians respond in the days ahead."

The demand for Chutkas variety of manjha  the abrasive string used in kite-flying contests  has skyrocketed for the first time in years.The reason? A number of prohibitions placed on nylon strings made by the competition, the most recent being an interim ban by the National Green Tribunal, has come as a godsend for Chutka and others like him in the locality.The demand for Bareilly ka manjha has increased since last year, when these bans came into effect, and we hope the NGT action boosts it further, says Inam Ali, a kite trader in the old city area, adding that he doesnt use any prohibited ingredient  nylon, glass or metal powder  to make his product.The String Story Manjha manufacturers date back to over two centuriesAt least 30,000 people are involved in the manufacture and trade of manjha in the cityMost of the families involved in the business dont have any other source of incomeThe trade has an annual turnover of around Rs 50-60 croreBareillys manjha is crafted through a relatively natural processThe morning ritual of most manjha manufacturers in Bareilly is boiling pots of coarse rice into thick pasteThe end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitionsThe nylon manjha  made with synthetic materials  is banned in several states, including Gujarat, Maharastra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. It is also called the Chinese manjha, presumably because it was first introduced in the Indian market by traders from the neighbouring country.The nylon manjha was banned in Maharashtra in 2014. So, from 2015, we began coming here to buy our wares, remarks Dheeraj Sahu, a manjha trader from Nagpur.Sahu is not the only one. Over 200 of my biggest clients are from places outside Uttar Pradesh, says Ali.Read | Child killed by manjha couldnt even shout, died in fathers lapThe Bareilly ka manjha, on the other hand, is crafted through a relatively natural process. The morning ritual of most Muslim households near Hussainebagh  a major manjha production area in Bareilly  comprises boiling pots of coarse rice into thick paste. The grain is then kneaded with psyllium husk, stone powder, surma (kohl), colour and a few herbs into luddi (dough). In the next step, the luddi is smeared over cotton strings tied between two wooden poles and then left to dry for a few hours.The end-product is a sturdy manjha capable of holding its own against rivals in tough kite-flying competitions.There was a time when powdered glass was included in the luddi, but not anymore, says Asib. Now, powdered marble or ceramic fragments are used instead.So, how are the cotton strings coated with marble? First, the hard stone is crushed into miniscule grains by hand, using a mortar and pestle. It is then sieved to obtain even finer pieces. These fragments are then re-ground using mechanical or electric machinery until a smooth powder is produced. This is sold to manjha manufacturers, who use it to strengthen the string.A labourer works at a manufacturing unit in Bareilly. (Sachin Saini/Hindustan Times)Though Bareilly ka manjha is what traders from other states covet the most, the nylon version is also in high demand. It has dominated the local market ever since its introduction in 2009. While one gitta (yarn) of nylon manjha costs Rs 200, the price of the same amount of Bareilly manjha comes up to Rs 600. This is why people prefer to buy the nylon version, says Haji Puttan, a trader from Kila area.There is another reason why the nylon manjha continues to be a hit with kite flyers. According to Kamaal Asib, president of the Manjha Majdur Hath Karigar Samiti, it has fared much better than its Bareilly counterpart in lab tests as far as strength is concerned. When experts at the North India Textile Research Association laboratory rubbed a strand of Bareilly manjha with a standard string, it broke after 96 smooth cuts. The nylon manjha took 18,000 cuts to break, he says.Read | Killer manjha: Delhi govt bans kite-flying thread after 3 deaths in two daysHowever, this very strength is also why the nylon string is considered dangerous by the authorities. The rise in its popularity was accompanied by an increase in manjha-related mishaps, with over 30 such instances being recorded in Bareilly alone. Finally, the Allahabad high court issued a ban on the sale of nylon manjha in November 2015.However, due to the authorities laxity in implementing the ban, nylon manjha continues to be sold openly. Two children were killed in neighbouring Delhi last August, when their throats were slit by strings of kites being flown as part of a competition.We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings?Traders say they cant stop selling the nylon manjha just because of the ban. Majboori hai, nahi bechenge tho khayenge kya? Agar sarkar me himmat hai to ye manjha bane wali company ko band karwa de (We have our limitations what will be eat if we do not sell these strings? If the government has the courage, it must ban the firms that produce nylon manjha), remarks Ali.One can see the logic in his statement; the bans talk only of selling nylon manjha, not their manufacture. In fact, Karnataka  which banned the sale of the product in July 2016  happens to be its manufacturing hub. The biggest synthetic manjha maker  Mono Kite  is based in state capital Bengaluru.Mono Kite general manager Yogesh Saxena admits that Uttar Pradesh is their biggest market, but denies reports that their product is dangerous. Our manjha is completely biodegradable. We care for nature as well as our customers, Saxena tells HT over the phone, adding that their nylon string is manufactured with machines imported from Germany in adherence to strict research and development guidelines.Though sales have taken a hit after the bans, the company still produces six to eight tonnes of nylon manjha every month. The ban is on the sale of manjha, not its production, he says.Read | When manjha was just about kite-flying"

He didnt have a choice though. Before he made it to the US, the considerable time on the Asian Tour taught him the use of chopsticks.After all, stepping into a restaurant in the Far East and asking for a fork was insulting. At the Emirates Golf Club, there was no compulsion, but the piece of cabbage was too small to lift with a fork. Stepping up, was how he would have called it earlier. Now, he puts it as, Doing what needs to be done in order to get better.In golf too, getting to the PGA Tour hasnt put an end to the process. Anirban seeks more. Exhaustive discussions after reaching the highest platform have yielded that hes better than the average player there in terms of awareness and skill. He lacks in endurance and strength.Pushing himself and boundaries, Anirban arrived in the US on the back of non-stop golf, and perhaps that made the phase of acclimatisation tougher. A season down, he can talk about no longer being overawed by the conditions, but struggle with the body continues.The latest one, a crick in the neck (from watching too many TV shows on the laptop) is mentioned with a laugh, but sitting out 25 days (due to an overused shoulder) towards the end of last year has been looked at seriously.Teaming up with a fresh set of experts, hes looking to strike a balance between diet and workout. Its about reducing work on the (practice) range and increasing the effort off it, he said.As he goes about it, awareness about the body is up too. Till a while back, he didnt know potatoes were not for him. Now, its off the diet chart, as is rice at night. Instead, it is quinoa, a super food. Since the Bengali in him is still alive despite all the travel, he can have rice in the afternoon as long as he burns it out at practice.Popular perception can often be misleading, and thats not lost on Anirban. He offered the 2015 Maybank Malaysian Open as an example.For the record, I won but only I know how badly I played, he said, referring to the poor hitting off the tees that week. It was belief and sharp play on the greens that bailed him out. Being true to yourself, be it the state of your craft or fitness, is critical, he said.The signs of being fitter and stronger are there, and if returns come his way at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic this week, it will be welcomed. Otherwise, Anirban will plough on, telling himself that change takes time to show up."

The three were handpicked for the honour, considering their three decades long service in keeping the city spic and span.The brain behind the novel concept was M G Hegde, a progressive thinker and trustee of Mangalore Institute of Fashion Technology (MIFT) College as part of its annual day celebration. Hegde, in his address, told the gathering that the motive behind the honour is to send a message to the younger generation to continue with such noble deeds to ensure egality in the society.Vice chancellor of Mangalore University K Byrappa said, It is indeed a matter of pride that the Pourakarmikas are being honoured, when the concept of Swacch Bharat has created a vibration in the country.Multilingual actor Kasargod Chinna said when the word fashion creates a set ripples in the otherwise conservative society, one should think of fashion for a cause.Chinna recalled an incident in his native place, when a section of people were divided in their opinion on F TV, a dedicated channel on fashion. When the cableman stopped relaying the channel, there were mixed reactions, he said.Complimenting Hegde for honouring pourakarmikas, Chinna said one should always think with a difference to come out with different ideas.The inaugural session was followed by the release of audio CD of Arjun Weds Gee-tha, a Tulu film and a fashion show by the students of the institute.Chairman of MIFT and former minister B Nagaraj Shetty, former chairman of Karnataka State Minorities Commission Anwar Manippady, Tulu theatre person Vijaykumar Kodiyalbail, Principal Dr Muralidhar, Chandrakala Gowda and others were present on the occasion.DH News Service"

I used to consume only milk all those years. I never felt like eating any other food, the 52-year-old legislator said.When the anchor wondered whether it never occurred to him that he should eat solid food, Ramanjaneyulu replied in the negative. It was only when I was to get married at the age of 20, I was compelled to develop the habit of eating rice. My relatives feared that I may not get a good alliance if I dont eat proper meals, he said.Even now, the member of the legislative assembly is not very fond of solid food. I just take a little quantity of rice at lunch. For dinner, I eat some light snack and milk, he said.Ramanjaneyulu told Hindustan Times that his parents never forced him to eat solid meals. I was taking a good quantity of milk. So they never bothered about me eating rice or roti. I never relished it, he said.Asked whether he ever felt sick because of the lack of solid food, which is essential for the growth of human body, the MLA said he was absolutely alright as milk contains all the nutrients. He said he did like rice when he had it for the first time but developed the habit of eating solid food only for the sake of others.Nutritionists say a human being cannot survive only on milk and requires wholesome food with all the nutrients, vitamins, and carbohydrates that milk does not provide.Retired nutritionist Dr V Ramdas Murthy, who was associated with National Institute of Nutrition, said it can be extremely difficult for a person to survive only on milk for 20 years.Especially during the teenage, a person requires all kinds of nutrients for growth. It is really surprising how the person managed with just milk, he told HT.Enquiries revealed that Ramanjaneyulu has been a diabetic patient for a long time.In June 2014, he collapsed in the legislative assembly hall and was rushed to the hospital in Hyderabad. He underwent a bypass surgery. Maybe his food habits were responsible for his sickness then, Swamy Ayyappa, a local journalist at Bhimavaram, said."

He closes the transaction by handing over Rs 5,000 in cash to Dinesh.I used DigiPay on the Common Service Centre (CSC) portal. All nationalised and private banks are linked to the portal, Amrutbhai tells HT.But Amrutbhais fair price shop isnt the only one of its kind in Gujarat. Since January, the state government has provided access to this portal to over 17,000 fair price shops under public distribution system (PDS) across the state. A host of services like booking bus tickets, mobile recharge, DTH recharge and cash withdrawal can be availed through this portal which was launched by the UPA-II government to provide various e-services to people in rural India.Post-demonetisation, the NDA government added PDS to the CSC ambit for distribution of wheat, rice (under Food Security Act) and other rationed commodities like kerosene to the beneficiaries through a cashless system. Gujarat has become the first state to introduce this.Usually, the rush for PDS items lasts for the initial days of the month. But after 10th of every month, peoples focus shifts to other e-services, says Amrutbhai who while showing the records boasts how his store is now a one-stop shop for various services.Gujarat already had bar-coded ration cards to check pilferage. Now, the facility of cashless PDS has been introduced. All that a beneficiary needs is a bank account linked to his Aadhar number, says M K Das, principal secretary, Food, Civil Supply and Consumer Affairs Department.According to the department, the system has been installed in almost all 18,000 villages of Gujarat, which has over one crore beneficiaries. As these centres were already equipped with computers and printers, the state government had to add only thumb impression scanners.We are now planning to install iris scanners as well, adds Das."

The protesters, who are farmers from Tamil Nadu, have used strategies never heard before  from wearing skulls, eating mice, conducting mock funerals to even stripping at Raisina Hill. Adding to their eyeball popping agitation this week, a man dressed as Prime Minister Narendra Modi flogged the farmers with a whip.The farmers said the idea was to show Centres insensitivity to their plights. By ignoring us, it is like Modi is whipping us and trying to beat us out of Delhi Sometimes I think if we get arrested it might be better. Jail would be better than this, said P Ayyakkannu, the state president of the National South-Indian Rivers Linking Farmers Association. At the outset, 25 farmers had volunteered to participate in the flogging, but soon after it began 23 of them backed out. One protester even reportedly fainted because of the pain.

(Saumya Khandelwal/HT PHOTO)These farmers have been in Delhi for 37 days now and are in no mood to leave. Their protest is aimed at getting a relief package from the Centre and having their loans waved off as their crops were ruined in a severe drought and a subsequent cyclone. Their loans from cooperative banks have already been written off, under orders of the state government and the Madras High Court. They have also asked for revised drought packages, that would allow them to buy seeds for the next harvest cycle and also compensate their losses.Protesters use skulls and noose to depict suicides by their fellow farmers. (Saumya Khandelwal/HT FILE)With he mercury going up in the Capital, the protests have also become more taxing. Ayyakkannu shows us the blisters on his thighs from the heat. We are sleeping on hot tar while the PM sleeps in an air conditioned room, said Palanichamy, a farmer who has been at Jantar Mantar since the beginning of the protests.The farmers claim that they have not been able to meet the Prime Minister. This is how they are treating farmers; like slaves, said Prakash, who used to work in marketing for rice products in Tamil Nadu, before coming over to join the farmers at Jantar Mantar.Protesters strip outside South Block after being unable to meet the President with their demands.

The next in line, is a literally deranged act where they will try to showcase the impact of their current state. By wearing torn clothes and acting unstable they will depict how they have lost their minds in this long battle at Jantar Mantar."

The MP declared the video fabricated and said it was a ploy by SAD chief (and deputy CM) Sukhbir Singh Badal, who is contesting from Ghubayas home seat Jalalabad.Flanked by Congress MP and Jalalabad candidate Ravneet Singh Bittu, Ghubaya ripped open the rupture with Sukhbir to openly side with the Grand Old Party, and said, It is an attempt to politically murder me. Ghubaya has already been actively seeking votes for his son and the Congress in Fazilka, and has a significant sway over the 30% Rai Sikh (Scheduled Caste) vote in Jalalabad too.At the press conference in Jalalabad from where AAPs Bhagwant Mann is also in fray  the veteran Rai Sikh leader said he would write to the Union home minister to increase his security cover as there is a threat to my life.Playing the caste card, he said the video is an insult to Rai Sikhs.Also Read| SAD likely to take strong action against its MP Sher Singh Ghubaya for his anti-party activityBittu was quick to seize the moment: This is an attack on a mans dignity.

Sources attributed its origins to Ghubayas personal staff, while there was talk of more such videos set to be released.Ghubaya, who was MLA from Jalalabad before vacating the seat in 2009 for Sukhbir, also said he wont resign as MP or from the Akali Dal. People elected me for a full term, and I will complete it, he said.There were reports earlier of his leaving the Akali Dal, but eventually only his son and wife joined the Congress. His son Davinder even got the ticket. Ghubaya referred to a vigilance raid at a college owned by him just after the report of his switching allegiances. SAD Union minister and Sukhbirs wife, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, had at the time said Ghubaya was free to leave the party.Ghubaya on Friday recounted his version of the rift, After the 2012 polls, Sukhbir was sought to politically eliminate me from Jalalabad initially by sending outsiders as halqa in-charge. When I complained to chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, he asked me to discuss it with Sukhbir. But Sukhbir never paid any heed to my repeated pleas.Then, he said, Sukhbir ignored his requests for party ticket from Jalalabad, Ferozepur Rural, Guru Har Sahai or Fazilka seats for the assembly polls. My family then felt ditched and decided to move away, he added.He alleged that Sukhbir had tried to use muscle power to keep us down and got a vigilance raid conducted at my engineering college, besides trying to implicate my wife in a fake case of rice scam.When all their tactics failed, Sukhbir has got this fake video to go viral on WhatsApp to malign my image a day before (Congress vice-president) Rahul Gandhis Jalalabad rally, Ghubaya said."
58ff128f7be9e0429666d2e5,In Odisha Naveen Has a Fight on His Hands,http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/odisha-panchayat-elections-naveen-patnaik-now-has-a-fight-on-his-hands/story-AGGVySAkUN9qW27cG64bOJ.html,2017-02-19,"As I write, three of the five phases of panchayat elections in Odisha have been completed. Few would have cared for these elections but for the big surprise sprung by the Bharatiya Janata Party. Coming from nowhere, Prime Minister Narendra Modis party has won more than 190 seats, or 35%, of 538 seats that have so far polled, and the winning ratio keeps getting better with each round, according to unofficial results. If this trend continues, the BJP will end up winning more than 300 of the 854 zilla parishad seats  almost a 10-fold increase over the 36 seats the party won in 2012 when these elections were last held.It is a phenomenal feat for a party that has never been a force to reckon with in Odisha politics, which often revolved around two centrist parties  the Congress and the ruling Biju Janata Dal of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. That is why Modi was quick to react. He spoke about the results at a campaign rally in Uttar Pradesh and then tweeted to congratulate his party colleagues in Odisha for the good work done.Naveens BJD will still win the most number of seats, but it will have little to celebrate -- because the lead will be so narrow and the message from the voters so unnerving. Also, the effective opposition space in the state will now be taken by a party that rules at the Centre and sets the political agenda for the nation. The outcome of the panchayat elections will shape the course of the states politics between now and 2019 when Odisha holds assembly polls simultaneously with parliamentary elections.Read | BJP upbeat, Congress worried: Whats happening in Odisha panchayat electionsNaveen loses TINA card: One message that rings out loud and clear is that Naveen Patnaik is no more invincible, no more infallible; that the voters of Odisha no longer believe there is no alternative (TINA) to his Biju Janata Dal.A political outsider who was thrust into Odisha politics after his father Biju Patnaik -- a legendary politician and a folk hero  died in 1997, Naveen has never been out of power since winning the state in 2000. His lineage, his image of being not a run-of-the-mill politician and a bachelor with no temptation to hoard wealth made the people of Odisha swoon over him. He came on the political stage at a time when the Congress party, discredited by decades of misrule, had turned rudderless. The lack of an effective opposition meant Naveen had everything going for him to consolidate his power, both within and outside the party.Also, a good part of Naveens tenure overlapped with Indias economic rise and a mining boom in Odisha, which meant more money  by way of both higher central transfers and the states own revenues -- for vote-winning welfare programmes such as offering rice to the poor for Rs 2 per kg (later reduced to Re 1/kg) and building rural roads. In cities, the middle class was happy as the service sector was on an upswing. Information technology companies such as Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services set up large operations in the states capital, Bhubaneswar, creating lucrative jobs for the local educated youth  many of them have since risen through the ranks to take up US and Europe-based assignments for their employers. The expansion of the IT sector coupled with dodgy money from mining also fueled a realty boom that hugely benefited people living in the urbanizing landscape around the states capital and other cities.All of these kept reinforcing the image of Naveen Patnaik as a leader who stood for development and progress, even though his populist schemes came at the expense of longer-term welfare of the people. Critical sectors such as education and healthcare were neglected, as was investment in agriculture that provides livelihood to more than three-quarters of the states population. No one questioned or challenged Naveen, because there was no one to do so. The results of the panchayat elections suggest that may no longer be the case.In the simmering discontent over unfulfilled aspirations and the growing clamour for an alternative to the current dispensation, the BJP seems to have spotted an opportunity.Read | Odisha panchayat elections: CM Patnaik losing grip? Rise of BJP worries CongressNot a flash in the pan: Since Prime Minister Modi came to power in 2014, the BJP has assiduously worked to expand its footprint in Odisha. Rarely a month has passed without a central minister visiting the state. As PM, Modi has gone there four times.The narrative built through these visits goes something like this: the BJP cares for Odisha; money for Naveens welfare schemes come from the Centre; and the state has very little to show for his 17 years in power.The success in the panchayat polls shows the strategy has worked and the BJP has been able to build a well-entrenched organisation at the grassroots. Its ambitions have been helped by a steady disintegration of the Congress party, which has now been pushed to the margins of Odisha politics -- thanks to the lack of a leader who can steer the partys local unit. The whimsical decisions of the central leadership of the Congress in choosing local leaders and frequently changing them have only made it worse for the party, which once ruled the state with a brute majority. I will keep it for a later date to elaborate on this.For now, the BJP has effectively snatched the opposition space from Congress. The assembly elections in the state may be two years away, but Naveen already has a fight on his hands.(An abridged version of this article appeared in Hindustan Times on February 19)Click here for full coverage on assembly elections 2017"

As such, the proposals are expected to have a huge captive market.S Sidharth, principal secretary, industries department, said, Several proposals for rice mills and units based on fly ash have also been cleared. It is indicative of entrepreneurs desire to be present in sectors where the demand exists and has a potential to grow.The state is set to have a huge supply of fly ash as by-product from thermal power units, both the existing ones and several new units coming up. Similarly, five projects for manufacturing LPG cylinders and setting up LPG bottling plant also came up for consideration, apparently to tap the potential thrown open by the Centres Ujjwala scheme.A Rs 97-crore ethanol project of Majhaulia Sugar Industries Pvt Ltd was also cleared. It aims to take advantage of revised ethanol off-take policy of the Centre to encourage its blending with petrol in excess of 10% benchmark.A project aiming to leverage Bihars maize producing capacity as a summer crop came in the form of a starch manufacturing plant at Thakurganj by a Kolkata-based company and another, for hallmarked jewellery, by Ankur Jewellers, were also cleared.We have been able to take up all online applications submitted till January 11 for consideration. From now on, the SIPB will be holding regular meetings every month, Sidharth said.A decision on a Rs 304 crore investment proposal by United Breweries for producing malt-based alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, was held back for lack of clarity.Alcoholic beverage is in the negative list, Sidharth said, adding proposals for several stone crushing units had been put on hold and asked to explain whether they have requisite lease license for the same.Online application facility has introduced greater transparency and done away with chances of anybody jumping the queue at the last moment. SMS and e-mail would be sent to 109 entrepreneurs whose projects have been approved.Stage 1 approval will be followed by stage 2 clearance at the principal secretary level, for projects up to Rs 2.5 crore and at the ministers level for up to Rs 10 crore projects, while Rs 10-20 crore worth of projects will be approved jointly by finance and industries minister.Anything above it would go to the cabinet.Stage 3 will see time bound approvals within 30 days by concerned departments or lead to deemed approval by principal secretary, industries, while the last stage clearance at the production level would entitle a unit to claim post production subsidy."

But the news about them is fake. The White House is a fine-tuned machine. Russia is a ruse.For its stunning moments and memorable one-liners, Donald Trumps first solo news conference as president has no rivals in recent memory. For all the trappings of the White House and traditions of the forum, his performance was one of a swaggering, blustery campaigner, armed with grievances and primed to unload on his favourite targets.In nearly an hour and a half at the podium, Trump bullied reporters, dismissed facts and then cracked a few caustic jokes  a combination that once made the candidate irresistible cable TV fodder. Now in office, he went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to make a deal with Moscow.That matters, Trump said in one of his many improvisational asides, because hed been briefed and I can tell you ... nuclear holocaust would be like no other.This was his and his aides attempt to get the boss his groove back. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser.He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent  somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defence of his administrations early days. He bragged that his White House is a fine-tuned machine and claimed there has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time.If only the news media would give him credit. Over and over, he accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was fake news. He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does.The press  the public doesnt believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I dont know. But they dont believe you, Trump charged. But youve got to be at least a little bit fair, and thats why the public sees it. They see it. They see its not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.The hastily called news conference was not on the White Houses original schedule for Thursday, and some of Trumps own aides were surprised when the president let slip at a morning meeting that he would hold the event in the East Room just hours later.The performance was vintage Trump, a throwback to the messy, zinger-filled news conferences he held during the early stages of his campaign. And, when combined with a rally slated for Saturday in Florida, it appeared to be the start of a one-two punch meant to re-energise a president whose White House in recent days has been buffeted by crisis and paralysed by dysfunction.Yet it was a far cry from the buck stops here mantra popularised by Harry Truman and other presidents who believed that the ultimate responsibility for any White House struggles lay with the president himself. Trump was eager to assign blame elsewhere, ignoring the nations healthy economy and relative peace when he took office to say to be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess.He mostly blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that the press honestly is out of control.The press has become so dishonest that if we dont talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people, he said. Tremendous disservice.Never before has a president stood in the White House and so publicly maligned the press or attacked reporters by name, according to presidential historians. Not even Richard Nixon in the days of Watergate.It was bizarre theatre, said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. He turned a presidential press conference into a reality TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.But for Trump, it continued a defining theme and amplified his chief strategist Stephen Bannons decree that the media are the opposition party.Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the centre of his campaign in an unprecedented way and earlier this month falsely accused the media of refusing to cover terrorist attacks across the world. Though Thursdays news conference was a messy, fact-challenged affair, it may well have been cheered by Trump supporters across the country who had packed arenas last year to jeer reporters and chant tell the truth at the press pen.An Associated Press-GfK poll taken on the eve of the election revealed that 87 percent of Trumps supporters saw the media as biased against him.Trump retains support among Republicans, and solid majorities of Americans say he is following through on his promises and is viewed as a strong leader, according to a Gallup survey. But his overall job approval rating is much lower than those of past presidents at the same point in their administrations. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 39 percent of Americans approve of his job performance while 56 percent disapprove.For all of Trumps complaints, he appeared to delight in sparring with reporters in what was only his second news conference since last July. Several times he extended the event in order to field more questions.Not that he answered them all. He dodged inquiries about his campaigns links to Russia and talked down several reporters before they could finish their questions.On one subject in the news, he did defend the national security adviser he recently fired.But he also made a point of complimenting a softball inquiry about the first lady as a very nice question. He teased CNN reporter Jim Acosta for having the same last name as his new pick for labour secretary  Alexander Acosta, whose appointment was ostensibly the reason for the news conference  and said he asked his staff to make sure the men werent related.There were startling moments aplenty.He chided a Jewish reporter wearing a kippah for asking a question about anti-Semitism. He asked an African-American reporter whether she could help set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He displayed a rare moment of introspection when he discussed his love for kids amid his very, very hard decision whether to potentially deport young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children.But mostly it was Trumps bravado on display, as when he incorrectly asserted that his Electoral College victory had been the largest of any president since Ronald Reagan  and then simply dismissed a reporters attempt to correct him.Well, I dont know, I was given that information, said Trump. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?"

Siddaramaiah reiterated that the government would enhance entitlement under PDS from the present five kg per person from April 1. The quantum of enhancement would be announced soon.Siddaramaiah told officials of the food and civil supplies department to exercise caution while weeding out fake ration cards. Identifying and scrapping fake cards is important but also ensure that genuine beneficiaries are not affected, he said. Khader said ration card issue had been included under Sakala scheme.

Thirty-two years on, Avtar Singh Dhindsa, 61, takes a deep breath as he sits in the gazebo overlooking rows and rows of flowers daintily dancing in the spring breeze in his 800-acre farm at Gabhrian village on the road to Malerkotla. Im happy I fulfilled my teacher Ajay Pal Singhs dream of seeing flower seeds made in Punjab bloom across the world, particularly in Europe. Today, I dream of seeing floriculture flourish in Punjab.Watch the video here:The pioneer in the business walks fast, often leaving his better half Sukhvinder behind, but knows growing flowers, like love, takes time and patience to blossom. Going from zero to 2,000 acres under floriculture in three decades is no mean achievement for Punjab, he says when asked why growing flowers hasnt taken root as a diversification option beyond the Patiala, Sangrur and Ludhiana belt.Whether it is the business of cut flowers, raising saplings in nurseries, growing bulbs, producing seeds or processing extracts, floriculture fetches high returns. But conditions apply. This field needs an isolated vast area, water that is not saline, specialised training, skilled labour, and the owners hands-on involvement.HOW THEY GREWDiversification in floriculture has been limited so far because it is labour and technology intensive, needs a vast field to avoid cross-pollination and is demand driven. The demand for flowers is catching up slowly so progressive farmers are warming up to this niche crop, says Ajmer Singh, the head of the department of floriculture at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana.For those keen on adopting this field, the three national award-winning floriculturists of Patiala district suggest starting out small. Avtar Singh began with floriculture in 3.5 acres of the 18-acre ancestral land in 1985. Start with an acre as you need to be directly involved even if you have trained labour. I drive down from my home in Ludhiana daily because I cant ignore my flowers for even two days between October and May, he says.A mechanical engineer-turned-floriculturist Gurpreet Singh Shergill, who owns 36 acres at Mujhal Khurd, 15km from Patiala on the road to Samana, says, My father Baldev Singh was a regular farmer who followed the wheat-paddy cycle. When I joined my elder brother Karamjit Singh in farming, we decided to diversify. I equipped myself with knowhow in floriculture, fish farming and beekeeping. We started with an acre of marigold in 1996.Today, he transports 10 quintals of fresh flowers, most of them red rose stems, daily in his pick-up jeep from his fields and polyhouses to florists in Patiala. Wholesalers pick up his fresh flower supply for Ludhiana and Chandigarh. I grow a variety of flowers from marigold, gladioli, statice to the desi rose. This is a perishable product that needs care and supervision so I dont venture out too far like Delhi. I started seed production two years ago, he says.Farmer Gurpreet Singh in his farm house in Mujhal Khurd village in Chheka road in Patiala. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)NOT SO ROSYAbdul Wahid, 52, a mechanical engineer from Patialas Thapar University who turned flower seed exporter, is the eighth generation of the family to stick with the business of horticulture. I could have made more money had I set up rice mills but I stuck to horticulture. My passion drives me, he says of his farm set up in 1990 and spread over 30 acres at Dhablan village on the Patiala-Nabha stretch.In 25 years, we have trained 500-600 contract farmers in the vicinity to supplement our flower seed production and export. Many new farmers give up on floriculture when they face rough weather or encounter hardships as retaining labour is difficult and one has to be hands-on, he says.The labour cost is high as plucking dry flowers and processing for seeds involves manual work that calls for patience and diligence. No wonder these farms prefer employing women from surrounding areas.We grow seeds for foreign companies on contract. The labour cost is $80-100 (Rs 5,200-6,500) a day in Europe, while here it is $4-5 (Rs 250-300). Yet these women earn more than their husbands, says Avtar Singh.Since the demand for flower seeds is less in India, Wahid exports them to Holland, Poland and Germany. As an exporter, he hopes the government streamlines the certification for seed quality and germination standards. We need an independent liaisoning and certification authority that both the exporter and customer abroad respect. Otherwise, we face exploitation and harassment at the hands of foreign companies, he says. He cites stricter laws for foreign customers in China, Vietnam and even Tanzania.Another concern he flags is hurdles at the Customs. The import procedure is so slow that at times the mother seed stock from abroad arrives after the sowing season is over. This despite having all permits, Wahid says. The productivity of seeds falls if not sown the same year.STAY STUBBORNDespite their struggles, all three floriculturists believe the secret of their success is staying rooted. Im a little stubborn, admits Avtar Singh, but you have to be stubborn to succeed.Shergill says the turning point for him was the winter of 2000. Two acres of the marigold crop was damaged due to fog. When I reported the loss to my father he said: Kamana jaante ho toh khona bhi seekho (You know how to earn so learn to take loss too). I stuck to growing flowers and it has paid off.Another common feature with the three is that they have diversified to shield themselves from losses.WHAT FARMERS WANTTo make floriculture a viable diversification option, the three farmers want the government to take up landscaping in its offices, grow flowers in public spaces, and improve infrastructure and connectivity. If the demand increases, more farmers will take to floriculture.The 1.5-crore population of Holland consumes more flowers than the 100 crore-plus people in India, says Wahid.He also suggests replacing rather than recycling seeds every season for sharp colours and uniform features.Highlighting market fluctuation, Shergill says, Jab tara doob jata hai toh hamara bhi tara doobta hai (During inauspicious times, we run out of luck too). But Shradh (the period of rites for the departed) is followed by the Navratras (nine days of festivities) so we have learnt to adapt.Avtar Singh hopes his alma mater, PAU, looks at innovative agriculture and studies market intelligence worldwide to help boost floriculture in Punjab.The government can also support flower growers in marketing the produce in other states. We need more automation in farming. PAU can help by developing specialised harvesting machinery. Make farming an attractive option for the youth, says Wahid.Meanwhile, a centre for excellence for floriculture is coming up at Doraha near Ludhiana in collaboration with Holland. The Centre has sanctioned Rs 7.5 crore and the state has received the first installment.

It remains common among Muslim families even in Jakarta, although doctors there typically carry out a less extreme form of the procedure that involves pricking the clitoral hood with a needle.In an effort to accommodate cultural and religious considerations, the government has moved away from previous attempts to ban the practice entirely and has instead sought to stamp out the more harmful methods and ensure safety.Authorities insist the methods most commonly used in Indonesia -- usually involving a pin prick -- do not amount to female genital mutilation.The methods used in Indonesia are generally less harsh than the most brutal forms of FGM found mainly in African and Middle Eastern countries, that can go as far as total removal of the clitoris.Read: Female circumcision: A cruel practice that numbs womens sexual pleasureThe UN, however, disagrees with the Indonesian governments stance, classifying FGM among harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes and has passed two resolutions aimed at stopping it worldwide in recent years.The global body says FGM has no health benefits and can cause many problems, such as infertility and an increased risk of childbirth complications.Not in KoranDebate within Indonesia has been heating up in recent times, with activists and even a major Muslim organisation arguing against female circumcision, saying it violates a womans right to do as she wishes with her body.I believe there are no verses in my religion that allow female circumcision -- it is not in the Koran, Khorirah Ali, a member of the government-backed national commission on violence against women, said.The countrys second-biggest Muslim organisation, Muhammadiyah, discourages its followers from partaking in circumcision but the largest, Nahdlatul Ulama, and the countrys top Islamic authority the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) is still in favour.The issue is a hot potato and the government has flip-flopped in recent years.Also read: Over 800 girls circumcised in Tanzania despite govt crackdown on FGMIn 2006, the health ministry banned doctors from carrying out female circumcision, saying there was no medical benefit -- but the MUI hit back with a fatwa saying that women who undergo the procedure would be considered noble.The government backtracked several years later and said licensed medics could conduct the procedure as long as it was only scratching the clitoral hood, only to later void this measure in favour of asking a specially appointed council to issue safety guidelines.Campaigners say the constant changes have created confusion about what is allowed and more harmful practices -- such as those used in Gorontalo -- continue to exist.Despite the opposition, the practice is unlikely to end soon in the country of 255 million people.Jurnalis Uddin, an expert on female circumcision from Jakarta-based Yarsi University, and a member of the governments advisory council, said the focus should be on encouraging the less harmful methods.To get rid of the practice completely is like swimming against the current, he said."

It is late afternoon and we have been walking along the alleys of south Delhis Kotla Mubarakpur village for more than half an hour without any sign of Mubarak Shah Sayyids tomb, the areas signature monument that commemorates the 13th century king of Delhi Sultanate.That old building seems to be only a rumour. The shopkeepers we asked for directions confess to have heard of Mubarak Shah ka Makbara but they themselves have never seen it  and they have been here all their lives.Actually, we are lucky in not finding the monument. The walk in Kotla Mubarakpur is turning out to be as engaging as a stroll in scenic Lodhi Garden.This is a self-contained world teeming with roadside barbers, rice merchants, sugarcane juice vendors, and sellers of Hanuman Chalisa booklets. The showrooms of South Extension I market are just five minutes away but they seem to belong to another country. Finally, after crossing a public park, we start climbing a cramped lane, very dark and cool, and suddenly there it is  Mubarak Shahs elusive mausoleum.It looks like any obscure Lodhi-era tomb you might spot in the city. But it has far greater local atmosphere. On entering, we see four people sitting on chairs in the tombs verandah. They are playing cards. An elderly man is smoking a hookah. It could be a scene straight out of any village square in north India except that the backdrop is framed by centuries-old arches and columns of a kings memorial.The octagonal tomb is flanked by residential apartments. Some balconies are just an arm away from the dome. Walking around the monuments corridor is a brilliant way to observe the neighbourhood life that circles it  women are talking to each other in nighties, young men are glued to their smartphones, and a cat is staring down at two dogs.The areas other landmark is Shaad Hair Cutting Saloon.The central chamber is dark. There are half a dozen tombstones inside. Two dogs are sleeping on the biggest of the graves  probably of the Sultan himself. It is a most surreal view. Just then a woman in a blue salwar kurta walks in barefoot. The dogs wake up and go out quietly. The woman lights an earthen lamp, and bows at each grave with folded hands.Introducing herself as Meghnawati, she says, This makbara is of a peer who was a musalmaan Im a Hindu but I believe in peer babas.She offers us a batasha as prasada and leaves. The chamber becomes empty. The lamps flame flickers, casting shadows on the old stone walls. We quickly step out into the more assuring world of the living."

Their family -- six boys and a girl -- had been eating little for the last three months as money ran out and supplies became harder to get a hold of in the half of the northern Iraqi city that is still under the rule of the Islamic State group.Iraqi forces, after capturing the east in January, have been gearing up for a final assault on the west that officials say could come at any time. In past weeks, people have been slipping out of the western sector, saying a mix of poverty and low food stocks meant that getting food had become a serious problem.People were eating whatever they had, water with bread, or water with tomato paste, said Umm Mohammed. Her kids sometimes went to bed without even that. She and her family made it to eastern Mosul, then to a camp for displaced people outside the city.She spoke on condition she be identified by her traditional honorific because she feared for the safety of relatives still in western Mosul.The United Nations estimates that up to 750,000 civilians may be left in the western half of the city. Aid agencies have no access and all the commercial arteries have been blocked. Since the beginning of the year, around 140 families -- some 600 people -- have made it out of the west to the camps of displaced, according to the UN.The militants have been trying to prevent residents from leaving.Iraqis from Mosul queue for permission to pass through a checkpoint in Bartella. Hundreds of people arrive at the checkpoint every day either fleeing the violence in their home city or to visit their relatives elsewhere in Iraq. (AP)Dafr Mohammed, a 24-year-old farmer from Baddoush, a town on the northern outskirts of the city, said he arranged a boat to cross the Tigris river to the eastern side but was caught by the militants. He was only able to get out because he convinced them his wife was sick and needed a doctor -- and because he left other relatives back in the west, which they took as a guarantee.Most nights we went to bed hungry, including the two kids, said Mohammed.He said the problem wasnt so much the lack of food but that people had no more money to pay for it. Daesh took all the wheat and barley we harvested this year without payment so we didnt have any money, he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.He survived by doing odd jobs and sometimes getting some money from an uncle who was still receiving his pension. By January, they run out of heating fuel and wood, and started burning their clothes to keep the children warm, he said.Prices in western Mosul have skyrocketed, especially after the road to Syria was blocked late last year, because no more food was coming in, those who escaped said. A 50 kg sack of rice rose to 120,000 dinars ($95), from 19,000 ($15). A sack of flour, once 1,000 dinars ($.80), is now 7,000 ($6).The UNs humanitarian arm said earlier this month that powdered milk for babies had become almost completely unavailable and that a lack of drinking water was also a problem.Abdul-Rahman Aouf Aziz, a 24-year-old who fled in January, said he had got out because he couldnt handle it anymore and was prepared to risk his life in the escape.There was no life left there. It had become very hard, he said."

The frothing Bellandur and Varthur lakes are a deadly concoction of phosphates, nitrates and myriad industrial pollutants combining to create a foamy lather. One cannot turn a blind eye to this ugly truth.Bellandur lake once provided sustenance for people in the settlements adjoining it and the water here was used to irrigate fields of rice and vegetables. Today, however, the scenario is different as just the thought of having to bring home a bunch of vegetables grown on the periphery of the lake bed can send shivers down our spine.Vegetables grown here are finding their way into the local markets and are being bought by unsuspecting customers. DH spoke to a few residents who expressed their concerns about greens.Phosphate is not renewable and when the waste water that contains detergent enters the lake, it causes pollution. Neighbouring villages surrounding Bellandur lake use the same water for irrigation and agriculture. Therefore the vegetables grown there are metal-laden and poisonous.Most retailers, however, feign ignorance about the irrigation methods and also the whereabouts of the actual farm lands from where they procure their vegetables for fear of losing their clients.Pradeep, a retailer in Cambridge Layout, says that none of his vegetables is procured from Varthur or Bellandur as he prefers to buy from growers in Doddaballapur or has suppliers in the City market area. He says, Most growers around Varthur and Bellandur lakes sell their produce in Whitefield and Madiwala but do not supply to either HAL market or City Market as these are saturated with growers who are old-timers.He says: I have a moral duty towards my customers. Most retailers today refrain from buying produce from stray growers as they are unsure of the quality of the produce and do not wish to lose out on a regular clientele.Only a vigilant customer who asks questions and makes the right choices can survive in such a volatile situation. Kavita Jagadeesh, who lives in Defence Colony in Indiranagar, is one such customer who has always made enquiries before picking up her veggies as she puts her familys health first.She says: Most of my vegetables are bought at Hopcoms which sources it from Lalbagh and I also prefer organic stores as they get their produce from stipulated farms either in Mysuru or Ooty. Kavita has to sometimes wait for the organic vegetables that are sourced only twice a week but says that, They are worth the wait.She is wary about buying greens sold by vendors as these reek of a strong stench often found near sewage gutters. I dont mind paying double the price for healthy vegetables, she says.Hema Narang, a resident of 100 ft Road Indiranagar, would once procure her weekly stocks from HAL market but ever since she observed vegetables being grown around lakes and suspected that they may be sold in the market area, she refrains from picking them up from unknown vendors.She noticed the burgeoning pollution levels around the lake and now prefers to buy her stocks from a regular supplier who stops by near her apartment building or chooses organic vegetables.If froth was a dangerous indication, there is more horror waiting. The frothy lake recently caught fire and is believed to have been triggered by chemicals and effluents released by industries in the vicinity. When people inhale this affected air that is infused with high amounts of phosphate, it affects their lungs, causing irritation and skin allergies that are common symptoms.The valleys of Bengaluru are now conduits for sewage rather than irrigated water. Much of the estimated 500 million litres of sewage that reaches Bellandur lake daily is not treated. Until this anomaly is corrected, residents in the vicinity of the lakes feel they will be courting death."

The NGT directed the Manjha Association of India to submit a report to the Central Pollution Control Board on harmful effects of kite stringsSome kite sellers in Jaipur said desi manjha  cotton threads toughened by rice gluten  was being sold; others said synthetic and Chinese manjha were also available at outlets. Some buyers said even desi manjha was coated with glass powder.Serajuddin, who works in a jewellery industry in Johri Bazaar, said all types of manjha  desi or Chinese -- are dangerous and should be banned. Desi manjha can kill or injure birds, and Chinese manja can kill humans, he said.Manjha has killed two kids here. An acquaintance of mine was driving a scooter when Chinese manjha of a snapped kite got entangled in one of his ears; someone pulled it and half of his ear got severed, Serajuddin said. Even regular cotton string is dangerous for birds.A kite enthusiast argued that the government should not rob them of the fun of flying kites during Makar Sankranti, which, he said, is a major entertainment festival.Ban Diwali too because it causes pollution. Ban Holi too because the colours can cause cancer. Ban Eid-ul-Azha because animals are killed, said Jeetu Bhai, a businessman in the Walled City. But he supported ban on Chinese manjha, calling it dangerous for birds. But desi manjha hardly harms birds.Purshottam Agarwal, a cloth shop owner in the Walled City, hailed the ban on manjha, citing dangers to birds. Agreeing with him, another businessman said he has stopped his two kids from flying kites with manjha. I let them fly kites with sadda (cotton string). But sadly, all types of manjha are being sold. Government should strictly enforce the ban, said Rajender Jain.The NGT direction came after advocates Sanjay Hegde and advocate Shadan Farasat, appearing for People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), sought the ban.They referred to the November 2015 order of the Allahabad High Court, which banned the use of Chinese manjha in Uttar Pradesh and sought a ban on manufacture, import, sale and use of these strings.The tribunal had earlier issued notices to the state governments and sought their response on the PETA plea."

(If, as work done by Akhilesh Yadav government shows, there is a 50% vacancy in teacher posts in UP, where will the children of the poor get education?)Fact: Modi is partially right.As many as 23% teacher posts in elementary grades (up to Class 8) and 50% posts in secondary schools ( Class 9 and Class 10) are vacant in Uttar Pradesh, IndiaSpend reported in December 2016.Of six million teaching positions in government schools nationwide, about 900,000 elementary school teaching positions and 100,000 in secondary schools  put together, a million  are vacant, according to data tabled on December 5, 2016 in the Lok Sabha.Teacher vacancy in UP is the second worst in India for secondary schools and sixth worst for elementary schools.States with most teacher vacanciesCLAIM 2:Hindustan mein sabse jyada..daliton par atyachaar agar kahin hote hai, to us pradesh ka naam hai Uttar Pradesh. (If there is a region in India where crimes against lower castes are the highest, it is Uttar Pradesh)Fact: Modis claim is wrong.Though crimes against Scheduled Castes (SCs) were the highest in UP at 8,358 cases, with 8,460 people affected in 2015, UPs crime rate, or crime per 100,000 SC population, was 20, less than Gujarat (26), Madhya Pradesh (37) and Goa (51), according to data from the National Crimes Records Bureau.As many as 11 states and a Union Territory registered worse crime rates against SCs than UP.Among the other large states, Rajasthan registered the highest crime rate against dalits: 57 crimes per 100,000 SC population, followed by Andhra Pradesh at 52, Bihar at 39, Chhattisgarh at 31 and Maharashtra at 14.While the crime rate in Gujarat has always been above 25 per 100,000 SC population, it has always been below 20 per 100,000 SC population in UP.The crime rate against dalits in UP consistently fell during the tenure of former chief minister Mayawati and gradually increased during the tenure of current chief minister Akhilesh Yadav.CLAIM 3:Uttar Pradesh mein kisano ki paidavar sirf 3% khareedi jaati hai (Government procures only 3% of the farm produce in UP).Fact: The figure quoted by Modi is right for wheat but wrong for rice.Government agencies, such as the Food Corporation of India and state government agencies, procured 2.5% of wheat produced in UP in 2014-15 and 10.5% of rice produced that year in the state. Most of the farm output was sold by farmers to traders and commission agents in agriculture produce markets (APMCs).In Chhattisgarh, procurement of 60% of farm produce is done by the government at the minimum support price (MSP). In Madhya Pradesh, too, 60% is bought by the government, while Haryana is at 70% and Rajasthan at 50%, Modi said.The figures are true for Chhattisgarh for rice, close to reality for Madhya Pradesh for wheat, and close for both rice and wheat in Haryana.Modi was wrong about Rajasthan. Rajasthan farmers sold 18% of their wheat to government procurement agencies in 2014-15, not 50% as the PM claimed.CLAIM 4:Humne aisi Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana laaye hai ki agar prakrutik karano se kisan buaai nahin kar paaya, to bhi usko bima milega. Aisi koi yojana dekhi hai? (We started such a crop insurance schemenamed Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme  where, even if natural reasons affect the crop at sowing, the farmer will be insured. Has anybody seen such a scheme before?).Fact: Modi stretched the truth.While the PM claimed that this is the first time crops are being insured against weather-related vagaries, an earlier insurance scheme had a sub-scheme named Weather-Based Crop Insurance Scheme (WBCIS), which was limited to some geographical regions but insured crops against drought, excess rains and even frost.The crop-insurance spending included three parts: National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS), Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (MNAIS) and WBCIS.The PM Fasal Bima Yojana amalgamates two old schemes, NAIS and MNAIS. WBCIS is still distinct from the PM Fasal Bima Yojana.The WBCIS component was piloted in 2003 for the summer crop and in 2008 for the winter crop. The Modi government spent more than Rs 1,000 crore in its first two years 2014-15 and 2015-16 on WBCIS even before Fasal Bima Yojana was rolled out.The government, under PM Modi, more than doubled the spending on crop insurance to Rs 13,200 crore  the highest everin 2016-17 (revised estimate), to cater to increased crop failures after consecutive drought years. The spending in 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 9,000 crore.CLAIM 5:Jahaan BJP ki sarkarein hai, chahe Gujarat ho, Maharashtra ho, Haryana ho, Rajasthan ho, Chhattisgarh ho, Jharkhand howahaan 60-70% kisanonka (fayda) Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana se ho chuka hai..aur Uttar Pradesh..sirf teen percent kisanonka bima hua (In BJP-ruled states, about 60-70% farmers have benefitted from Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, while only 3% farmers in UP have benefitted).Fact: Modi is correct on the data for Maharashtra and Rajasthan, while he exaggerated the numbers for Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. He is wrong about farmers who benefitted from the Fasal Bima Yojana in UP.In Modis home state of Gujarat  a state with one of the highest rain deficits in the largely normal monsoon of 2016, as IndiaSpend reported in October 2016  a fourth of farmers have benefitted from the flagship crop-insurance scheme, not 60-70% as Modi claimed.Abhishek Waghmare is an analyst with IndiaSpend."

We will wage a legal battle against the negligence and apathy of the school management. They claim that it is an international school but the kitchen and accommodation of the boarding school, owned by former MLA K S Kirankumar, lack minimum facilities. The management is directly responsible for the death of the children, he said.Incidentally, both Akanksh and Shreyas are relatives of Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister T B Jayachandra, who was born in the village.Four students and a watchman had consumed rice and sambar for dinner and fell ill. While three students  Akanksh Pallakki, Shreyas, both native of Timmanahalli, and Shantkumar, a native of Srirampur in Chitradurga district  died due to food poisoning another student Sudarshan is recovering at District Hospital.

They soon said the sambar was bitter, and told fellow-students not to eat it. Heeding their advice, the others just ate rice mixed with buttermilk.Some time later, the three boys began to vomit and have loose motions. By 1 am, their condition deteriorated, and the authorities called up Kiran Kumar, former BJP legislator who runs the school.He arrived with Dr Siddaramanna, who examined the students. The doctor suggested they be hospitalised right away.The three students were first taken to a private hospital, where it turned out had no oxygen. At 3 am, they were taken to the district hospital, where doctors said they were dead.Parents of the students were distraught. They wanted to know why the school management had not called them when their children were experiencing such severe symptoms. A woman related to Akanksh fainted, and was taken to hospital in a police jeep.Kumar said he suspected something had happened after dinner. I ate the same meal, and nothing happened to me, he claimed. Police later said he was absconding.The residential school was unauthorised, according to an education official.Foul play suspectedLaw Minister T B Jayachandra said the boys could have been poisoned by someone. Children dont die so easily if the food is mixed with rat poison or even if a lizard falls into the dish, he told reporters.The post-mortem has confirmed the boys died of poisoning. Jayachandra, also minister in charge of the district, said two of the three boys who died, Shreyas and Akanksh, were related to him.Owners abscondingKavitha and Kiran Kumar, who own Vidyavaridhi International Residential School, went absconding on Thursday.Ravi Kumar, principal of the school, had recently been sacked. Rumours suggest he lost the job because he had been over-friendly with Kavitha. We are probing that angle, a policeman said."

DH PhotoFor the first time ever, coconut cafes are coming up on highways connecting Bengaluru to places in Tumakuru and Shivamogga districts.Called Just Relax, they serve tender coconut water and fresh and packaged snacks made from coconut. People zipping on the highways will soon have an alternative to coffee joints and dhabas: they can stop by at the new cafes and savour the goodness of coconut.The first coconut cafe will be inaugurated at Huliyar junction, CN Halli, Tumakuru district on March 15, while second, at Kondli Cross, Bengaluru-Shivamogga Road (NH 20), will come up in April.Namma Tengu Coconut Producers Company, which is establishing the cafes, will also be inaugurated on March 15. Nearly 3,000 coconut farmers from Tumakuru, Chitradurga and Chikmagalur districts have come together to set up the company.To mark the inauguration, it has announced Elaneeru Mela, which includes a tender coconut-water drinking competition.Anekatte Vishwanath, CEO, told DH Just Relax sells many varieties of coconut, tender coconut, virgin coconut oil, coconut flakes, and sweets such as burfi and holige made from coconut. The cafe also offers freshly prepared delicacies, like coconut rice and coconut dosa.Flavoured and chilled tender coconut water is another attraction. Coconut ice cream, coconut water laced with honey, lemon and salt, and ayurvedic products with coconut as an ingredient will also be on the shelves.Our aim is to promote not just coconut but all its byproducts to the young. We will introduce millets by and by, he said. Two more cafes are being planned, one on the highway to Chitradurga and another at a farm in Challakere. With seating and folk-style chittara drawings on the walls, they hope to attract people driving on highways to break for coconut refreshments.If the response is good, more Just Relax outlets could come up on the states highways.The price of tender coconut will be at least Rs 5 lower than elsewhere, Vishwanath said.Jayaprasad Ballakere of Bhoomi, an NGO supporting the coconut promotion movement, said at least eight to ten varieties of coconut will be sold at the outlets.The Tiptur tall and Tiptur dwarf x tall varieties of Karnataka will get pride of place. Varieties from Kerala, Tamil Nadu and the Andamans will also be promoted.The idea is to encourage products free of chemical preservatives, Ballakere said.At the moment, we have no plans of selling coconut milk and packaged tender coconut water as they call for advanced technology. But we will sell them in the days to come, he said.Various organisations, such as Nabard, Coconut Development Board, and Central Plantation Coconut Research Institute, Kasargod, are supporting the enterprise.A small cafe calls for an investment of Rs 5 lakh, while a bigger one with parking calls for more, he said."

His family has a priority card which entitles them 5kg ration (4kg wheat at Rs2 per Kg and 1kg rice at Rs 3 per Kg) per person listed on the card.Sunita and Kumar are not the only ones in the Sheikh Sarai slum, to be deprived of their rights, though with more than a billion enrolments, the government is tomtoming the success of the Aadhaar project.Only a few days ago, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the minister in charge of the UIDAI claimed linking of the Aadhaar with ration distribution has brought about more transparency and saved public money to the tune of Rs 14,000 crore.The government is now making the linking of permanent account numbers (PAN) to Aadhaar mandatory ignoring the controversy over the project since the inception of UIDAI in 2009.The Aadhaar has been challenged in the Supreme Court on several grounds, including national security, violating right to privacy, excluding some people from benefits of welfare programmes.Since 2013, the top court has issued seven interim orders, directing voluntary use of Aadhaar and that no one should be denied benefits to which they are otherwise entitled, if they do not have the 12 digit number.Notwithstanding such riders, the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 came into force on September 12 last year.The Act makes Aadhaar mandatory to get subsidies, benefits and services provided by the State.The government has expanded its scope to even filing of Income Tax returns.However, activists affirm that making Aadhaar mandatory is unconstitutional and a complete disregard of the Supreme Courts orders.Reetika Khera, associate professor of Economics in IIT Delhi, accused the government of creating false impression that the SC orders have become redundant following the enactment of the Aadhaar Act.The most common trick used by the government to get around the courts order is to state that those who do not have Aadhaar can continue to get their entitlements if they enrol for it and that the government will facilitate this.This is sugar-coating on a bitter pill, says Khera. You just stop getting your entitlements  until you enrol for it. This is the reality of it, though the government vehemently denies it.The civil society has been alleging government is maintaining a double-standard on the issue.Though enrolment for Aadhaar is voluntary, you have to compulsorily enroll for it if you want any entitlements from the state, pointed out Anjali Bhardwaj of Satark Nagrik Sangathan.Some even say the identification number is a tool for the government to keep a tab on the residents.Nandan Nilekani, the first chief of UIDAI, however, dismissed all concerns about Aadhaar-linked state surveillance: Surveillance is the last thing on the governments agenda. The mobile phone is a bigger tool of surveillance than Aadhaar.Ajay Bhushan Pandey, chief executive officer at UIDAI, said: The Act ensures that no one is denied of any benefits for the want of the Aadhaar. It is required only for ensuring that the benefits reach the right individuals.Since 2012, the UIDAI has done 500 crore authentications, 100 crore eKYC transactions, 32 crore Aadhaar enabled payment system transactions, and not a single case of identity theft or financial loss has been reported over a period of five years, he claimed.With ever increasing last-mile glitches, connectivity and network issues, machine malfunctioning, there is a growing criticism that in a bid to weed out the fakes, the government is depriving many deserving people of their entitlements.For the anomalies, the UIDAI officials pass the buck to concerned departments that implement the welfare schemes.The Aadhaar only helps various agencies and departments to identify a person, said a UIDAI official, adding if anyone is denied of his or her entitlement due to non-availability of the unique number, it is only because concerned officials are not properly following the law or the notification.There are more than 30,000 common service centres where people can update their existing details. They can also send details by post or email. There is a special provision to enrol a child below five years by linking his/her details at the enrolment centres or the Aadhaar ID of the parent, he pointed out.But those opposing the Aadhaar are not convinced. They argue technology is vulnerable to failures and is not a panacea for curbing corruption.Imagine if you had to board a flight or withdraw cash and your Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, mandatory for the transaction, fails, and you are requested to go re-enroll and wait for records to be updated, Khera said.Bhardwaj maintained that corruption could take place even in the welfare schemes that are based on Aadhaar authentication such as PDS.After the authentication, the ration shop owners can give less provisions than what is entitled, citing lack of availability or supply. In such a scenario, what can the beneficiaries do? There is no redressal mechanism in place. How will the thumb authentication ensure that the ration shop is not depriving the beneficiary? she asked.Amid these claims and counterclaims, the reality perhaps lies somewhere in between.The Aadhaar will solve only a part of the problem. It cannot be a one stop solution for all ails, said a senior UIDAI official.Read about the people entangled in the Aadhaar web of confusion:IDENTITY CRISIS: Sabra Khatoon Ansari, Jagdamba CampSabra Khatoon Ansari holds up her Aadhaar card which erroneously mentions her sex as male.

Due to the anomaly, she is facing severe identity problems to get benefits of various government welfare schemes such as Laadli and EWS medical card.Her father MD Salam attributes the error to chaos at the Aadhaar enrolment centre where his daughter got her biometric data registered in 2014. He says several attempts by him to rectify the mistake went in vain.MISSING LAADLI: Mahi, Motilal Nehru Camp, Near JNUSaroj and Prem Kumar Kanojia with their daughter Mahi, who could not be enrolled for the Laadli scheme.

They were sent back on the ground that the child is too young for the registration.SCHOLARSHIP WOES: Swayam Gupta, Motilal Nehru Camp, Near JNUSwayam Gupta , with his mother Geeta.

(Arun Sharma/HT PHOTO)The Syndicate Bank passbook of Swayam Gupta shows an entry of Rs 1200 on 24/11/2016 in his account. However, he cannot withdraw the money as his name in the Aadhaar card has been erroneously spelled as Shivam.His mother Geeta was told by bank officials that her son will not be able to take out the money credited in his account to purchase books and uniforms due to the mismatch. Swayam studies in Class 4 in the government school at Sector 3, R K Puram.Kaagzon pe sarkar chaltee hai (government depends only on paper), says Geeta Gupta, lamenting that just because of a clerical error her son is not getting his school scholarship.PENSION PAIN: Rukampal, Jagdamba Camp, Malviya NagarRukampal, who runs an ironing stall, cannot claim his pension because of an error in his year of birth on his Aadhaar card. (Arun Sharma/HT PHOTO)Rukampal is not getting his monthly old-age pension because his age mentioned on the Aadhaar Card is less than the pensionable age.As per the voter ID card, Rukampals age as on 1/1/2013 is 67 years, whereas his Aadhaar Card issued on 8/3/2012 mentions his year of birth as 1957, that makes him 55-year-old at the time of the enrolment.To correct the mistake, Rukampal says he even paid Rs 300 to a local agent, who works at the Aadhaar enrolment centre to make a new Aadhaar card. Nothing came out of it.After the Delhi government revised the old age and disability pensions, senior citizens in the age group of 60-69 years are now entitled to get Rs 2,000 monthly, while those above 70 years get Rs 2,500 per month.Iss burdape mein bhee koi sahayta nahee (there is no respite even in this old age), he said."

However, muted average realisations are expected to keep the value of these exports to under Rs 21,000 crore, against Rs 22,718 crore in FY16, said ICRA assistant vice-president Deepak Jotwani.This is likely to push up Basmati rice prices in the next fiscal, he said.Resumption of imports by Iran will be keenly watched by the industry as it has the potential to provide an impetus to exports, he added.Going forward, the coming financial year is expected to witness better revenue growth supported by a rise in average realisations, as paddy prices firm up during the current procurement season. Moreover, resumption of imports by Iran will also be crucial for driving industry growth in the next fiscal, Jotwani said.The basmati rice industry witnessed moderation over the last few years on the back of subdued international demand, partly attributable to the delay in resumption of imports by Iran.However, 2016-17 has seen some stabilisation in demand, ICRA said, adding after peaking at Rs 29,300 crore in FY14, the value of basmati rice exports went on a downward trajectory.While volumes saw some growth over the last few years, the decline in value is primarily owing to continued pressure on average realisations (declined from a high of Rs 77,988 per tonne in FY14 to Rs 56,149 per tonne in FY16) in the light of moderation in demand in the global market, ICRA said.Nevertheless, the export volumes in the current fiscal have largely been in line with last year, being supported by the increasing domestic demand for basmati rice, the report added.It said, the industry has registered milling gains on paddy procured at a fairly low rate in the last procurement season and favourable foreign exchange rate movement.For the next fiscal, the industry is expected to benefit from the rising paddy prices, ICRA said.After declining considerably during the procurement season in FY16, basmati paddy prices have firmed up by 20-25 per cent across various varieties, primarily due to the relatively lower production, in the recent procurement season - October to December 2016, the agency noted."

What assumes significance further is the fact that Ullal, now known as Mangaluru constituency, is represented by U T Khader, the sitting food and civil supplies minister.Shop owners from Kinya, Kotekar, Belma, Pavur, Manjanady and other rural areas, who complain of having to endure the delay ever since the coupon system was introduced, said that they would be forced to close shops till the problem is addressed as they are unable to cater to the increase in demand.Shop owners who have submitted a memorandum to minister for forest, ecology and environment B Ramanath Rai also the district in-charge minister, Khader and also to the office of deputy director of food and civil supplies are still waiting for a solution.According to them, they would be in a fix if the department continues to supply a meagre 30 quintals of rice against the indent of 123 quintals to be distributed among 600 odd card holders. Moreover, with the introduction of coupon system it is mandatory for shops to collect coupon numbers and submit the same to department. Any delay in uploading coupon numbers online will result in inadequate supply of essential commodities, they stated in their memorandum."

Several countries have implemented GST or another form of a value-added tax, but Canada is the closest to India with a dual structure.The new indirect tax is expected to shore up government revenue and spur economic growth by 1-2 percentage points.Four-slab GST structure The new regime will have four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. There will be no tax on essential items such as rice and wheat. The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption such as spices, tea and edible oil. There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services. The highest tax, of 28%, will be imposed on items such as luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks.Compensation to states The compensation bill that was passed on Wednesday will ensure states get compensated for the first five years for the revenue loss after the GST rollout. The money will come from a fund created from the cess the Centre will charge on certain goods, above the GST rate.Dual control on taxpayers The Centre and states will both assess taxpayers with an annual turnover of above Rs 1.5 crore. States will also have the power to assess taxpayers with a turnover below Rs 1.5 crore.Exemption from GST In Northeastern states, businesses with an annual turnover of Rs 10 lakh or below will be exempt from GST. For the rest of India, the limit is Rs 20 lakh."
58ff2ded7be9e04136163447,Will note ban  decide UP polls?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596742/will-note-ban-decide-up.html,2017-02-16,"Will note ban decide UP polls?By Geeta Pandey, Feb 17, 2017, 23:25 ISTIn November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"

The truth is there is no one secret, is there?Some make it here by doing what they do best. Others reinvent themselves every fortnight. Still others may find success elsewhere and return home to bask.So it is with one of the most abiding icons of our city.There are Irani cafs here that refuse to change a thing, and thrive. Even the paint on the walls is peeling at Britannia, and theres usually a pet cat at the cashier counter, but the tourists stream in with their guides all day and sit down to plates of berry pulao  that now cost more than Rs700 (yes, one thing changed).There are Irani cafs that have added cocktails, beer, palak paneer and aamras to their menus, and thrive.We have Chinese chop suey too.

Today, our Mumbai branch is doing the best and another branch is opening in Powai next week.No combing hairSo what makes a caf Irani? You dont have to be an Irani to open one, and you can have pretty much anything on the menu.But you cannot be an Irani caf if you do not have at least three of these: bun-maska, chai, marble-topped tables, bentwood chairs, glass jars full of stuff no one ever buys, and some really odd rules.No sitting for long; No asking directions; No arguing; No gambling; No discussing politics  the list of donts was as endearingly grumpy as it was specific.The owners didnt want to say these things directly to their customers; they didnt want to seem rude, says historian Rafique Baghdadi, chuckling. Hence the boards.As the world changed around them, the cafs and their quaint boards became icons of another time. No Irani caf worth its bun-maska would open without some version of the rules  not even the new ones in London (Dishoom, now a chain of five, was launched here in 2010) and Paris (which has an Irani caf called MG Road).Dishooms walls, in fact, are rather startlingly rude  Simon Go Back shouts one word cloud.

Those chai stops turned into the citys first cafs.* They set the precedent for dining out in Mumbai, says food consultant Rushina Munshaw-Ghildiyal.A warm welcomeBack in Mumbai, the revamped menus are finding the new takers they were designed to woo.Jeremy Cardoz, 29, is a banker based in Toronto who visits his granddad in Mumbai once a year.

The chicken dhansak with brown rice remains his favourite thing on the menu.Its the marriage of old and new that Sassanian was going for when they revamped their 80-year-old menu in 2000, cutting down on the tea cakes and plum cakes and adding sizzlers, burgers, rolls and Chindian fare.Around the same time, Caf Excelsior (1919) in Fort started offering paneer bhurji and palak paneer. We needed to cater to every demographic, says owner Ardeshir Mazkoori.In 2003, Caf Universal in Ballard Estate introduced a full bar, Indian-Chinese dishes, burgers, sizzlers, wraps and rolls. We realised that demand for Parsi food was limited, says head waiter Vasudev. Today, our sizzlers are one of our most-ordered items.Across the board, menus were changing at the turn of the century to cater to a rapidly changing city  there were far more youngsters and far fewer blue-collar workers in Mumbai now, more vegetarians in the island city, and a growing demographic of young professionals and college students looking for places with varied menus where they could hang out in groups.Add to that the growing competition from first lunch homes and Udupi restaurants, then the growing standalone eateries and finally the post-liberalisation multinational fast-food chains (McDonalds came to Mumbai in 1996), and the cafs were fighting for their lives.One big hurdle was the disinterested third generation, says Rashid Irani, film critic and co-owner of Brabourne, an Irani caf in Dhobi Talao that shut in 2008. These were educated and well-travelled young people who didnt want to survive on a pittance just to keep the family caf going.Farokh Shokriye, the third-generation owner of Mumbais oldest Irani caf, Kyani & Co (Marine Lines, 1904), was in his 30s at this pivotal time.I had to choose between migrating abroad and continuing this legacy, he remembers. I chose the latter because I thought it would be selfish to kill our forefathers legacy.Instead, he reinvented it. We added grilled sandwiches, sausages and baked beans, samosas, fruit bowls and aamras, he says. And today, it feels like a weekend every day.Sepia tonedThere were many stalwarts that didnt make it. In fact, most of Mumbais 400-odd Irani cafs succumbed to the cocktail of challenges.In 1998, Caf Empire shut. Brabourne downed its shutter for the last time a decade later. In the same year, Fairdeal Caf in Bandra and Cadell Caf in Mahim closed. About 30 remain today, says historian Baghdadi.As a tribute to those that were gone, filmmaker Mansoor Showghi Yezdi made a documentary called Caf Irani Chai in 2013, and two years later opened an Irani caf of the same name in Mahim. It was the first new Irani caf in the city in 50 years.Gleaming wooden furniture, mirrored walls, checked tablecloths, delicious berry pulao and bun-maska  it ticked all the boxes. In a nod to his ancestors  the famine-fleeing Yezds from Iran who set up the first cafs in Bombay  he placed Irani samovars and uris in the corners.We dont make more than 20-25% profit, but we arent aiming for more. This caf is a way of thanking India for letting us take refuge here, he says. You can get a meal here for about Rs 200.Its the perfect Irani caf for a Mahim that is changing fast but holding on tight to its heritage of Wednesday fairs, novenas and low-rise housing.In much the same way, SodaBottleOpenerWala is the perfect Irani caf for the glass-and-chrome business district of Bandra-Kurla Complex. You dont come here to reminisce; you come here to chat over retro music and take selfies against the dcor.Were a Parsi home menu-meets-Mumbai favourites place, says Singh. We knew the under-30s werent going to the old cafs, so we set one up that offered the same experience  with a very different vibe.Theres a full bar and a jukebox. The jars full of boiled sweets are shiny clean, a colourful bicycle holds bulls-eye and lemon-orange sweets that you can pose against or grab a handful of on your way out.Dhansak and bhajiya are on the menu, but so are vada pav, Eggs Kejriwal and seekh-paratha. We wanted to include very Bombay dishes because these cafs are very Bombay too, Singh says.Theres even a board of stern rules  No flirting, No asking recipe, No talking to cashier.All along one wall is a life-size photograph of an original Irani caf, taken some time in the 80s, a bicycle and two scooters parked outside. Old meets new, and takes a bow.What does Mumbai mean to you? Over the next few weeks, we are celebrating our favourite things about the city? We will trace the roots of Mumbais most popular street foods, drop in at its maidans, explore the workings of its stock markets and that grand dream machine that is Bollywood.

We now prepare only a limited quantity of biryani because we have to maintain a certain proportion of rice and meat, said Naseem Akhtar, who sells biryani opposite Labour Chowk, Sector 58.Half the customers who visit these biryani joints regularly now leave the shops disappointed. Vendors are expecting a relaxation may come their way meat traders have started an indefinite strike against the closure of illegal butcher shops and slaughterhouses.The biryani shops in Noida are mostly located in areas such as Labour Chowk, Sector 5, Sector 12 and Sector 61, Harola and Mamura.The biryani shops in Noida are mostly located in areas such as Labour Chowk, Sector 5, Sector 12 and Sector 61, Harola and Mamura. (Sunil Ghosh/HT)Mohammad Shakeel, 51, said he has seen such an implementation for the first time in his 10 years of business. He said prices will rise further since most slaughterhouses in the city have been closed.Earlier, meat was supplied to us from the interior parts of the city also. But that has stopped since the crackdown launched by state government on illegal slaughterhouses. Now traders from Delhi up to Meerut are dependent on Ghazipur only, he said.The chicken biryani is sold at a price of Rs 160 per kg at all locations, while the raw chicken used for its preparation is now being sold at Rs 200 per kg as against Rs 150 per kg prior to the crackdown on slaughterhouses.There is a rise of Rs 50 per kg in raw chicken price but the biryani is still being sold at Rs 160 per kg, the traders said.Until now, since meat was available at cheaper prices, vendors used to sell biryani from morning till evening. Now, after the crackdown, most vendors do business only half the day.The crackdown was one of the first decisions taken by Yogi Adityanath, who took over as the UP chief minister on March 19, after the BJP swept the state election.Vendors who used to run biryani kiosks are most affected and many have shut shop.We used to get chicken supply from the shops that have been closed now. With raw chicken becoming costlier, we are staring at a closure of shops, said Din Mohammad, a vendor."

Similarly, school children will get milk five days a week, instead of three days a week from April under Ksheera Bhagya scheme, he said.The announcements were made at the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting chaired by the chief minister at Vidhana Soudha. Besides, he assured his party legislators that supply of food grains under Anna Bhagya will be restored to the below poverty line families which have not submitted Aadhaar details. Two months time will be given to these families for sharing the details, he added.Sources in the CLP said many legislators took exception to the Food and Civil Supplies Departments decision to discontinue supply of food grain to those who had not submitted Aadhaar details. Siddaramaiah had recently trashed a proposal by the department to introduce the direct benefit transfer system under Anna Bhagya.The sources said Siddaramaiah asked legislators to approach him if they need any assistance in implementing any scheme in their constituencies. He also assured them he will look into the demand for increasing the annual legislators area development fund to Rs 3 crore from Rs 2 crore.Resolution for disciplinary actionThe sources said the CLP passed a resolution, urging the party to take disciplinary action against those openly criticising party leaders, including AICC president Sonia Gandhi, vice president Rahul Gandhi and Siddaramaiah.The resolution was passed after many legislators demanded that the party should act against Janardhana Poojary, Jaffer Sharief and A H Vishwanath. KPCC president G Parameshwara said he will forward the resolution to the party high command. Besides, Parameshwara directed all district in-charge ministers and legislators to chalk out programmes to protest against demonetisation. The party in the state is regularly sending reports to the high command on the protests being staged across the state. The high command will take action if anybody fails to take steps in this regard, he warned."

The world of food is more exciting than ever before. New restaurants are coming up offering novel cuisines or digging out old ones. Chefs are looking at unusual ingredients and dramatic ways of presenting food. Meanwhile, some wizened old experts continue to wield magic with their skewers and ladles in remote parts of the city. There is a world waiting to be discovered or re-embraced new cooking styles, world food, sub-regional cuisine and tiny holes in the wall which produce the most delightful dishes. Heres a guided tour.Time was when a telephone was an odd looking black box with a dial. And time was when Southeast Asian food meant a bowl of noodles for most of us. But times change  as you can tell with the way phones have transformed, along with our perception of food from other Asian countries.Now that Indians are travelling more, Southeast Asian food is no longer a mystery. Restaurants have come up across the country catering to Thai, Malaysian, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Burmese tastes. But the cuisine of Southeast Asia is such a treasure trove that the more you eat, the more will want it.Take their street food for instance. Much like in India, it is one of the most popular forms of food. But unlike many parts of the region where street food would usually mean small snacks, in Southeast Asia, it also works as a full meal. People walk out of their homes to a small shack on the roadside for their breakfast, lunch or dinner  or small meals in between. And everything is on offer there  from noodle soup and seafood fried rice to stir fried meat, steamed dumplings, skewers and cut fruits.I love the street food of the region, and was happy to find it in a restaurant in Delhi. Pings Caf Orient in the Lodhi Colony Market brings to the table some of the much loved dishes of the region. The familiar dishes  Penang curry of Malaysia, red or green curry of Thailand and khao suey of Myanmar and northern Thailand -- are all there, but you also get pho soup of Vietnam, laksa of Malaysia, nasi goreng of Indonesia or one of Singapores much loved charcoal roast pork skewers.Many of the dishes have cousins elsewhere. Fried rice, for instance, is not restricted to the nasi goreng, but has versions  with different kinds of toppings -- everywhere in the region. Likewise, dumplings and baos. I had the pork char sui bao at Pings, and loved the juicy meat in the casing.Many of the dishes are meals in a bowl. They come with noodles or rice in a thick sauce enriched with stock  usually prepared with meat or fish. The curry is flavoured with herbs and other ingredients that the region is known for  lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and so on. Chef Prantush Rai of Ping, for instance, does a delicious shrimp tom yam with lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and Thai chillies. And I love the noodles that he prepares with roasted pork, ginger, fried onions and scallions.You will find some very strong flavours in the cuisine. The fish sauce, for instance, is pungent and the shrimp paste is sharp. I enjoy the salt and sweet mix of many dishes in Southeast Asia. Thailands sticky rice with mango, prepared with rice, coconut milk and ripe mangoes, is a case in point  and mouth-wateringly good.The food is healthy, for, barring a few dishes, its seldom deep fried. Many of the dishes are simply steamed. Another great thing about the food is that it is filling yet light on the stomach. You eat to your hearts content, and then, like that boy Oliver, ask for some more.(Rahul Verma has been writing on food for over 25 years now. And, after all these years, he has come to the conclusion that the more he writes, the more there is left to be written)"

We are happy to share that many states will have 100% cashless system in rations shops by March, Paswan told reporters here.Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Maharashtra are the states that have committed to adopt digital payment system in their ration shops by March, he said.Most of the states will have digital payment system by June, he said, adding that Bihar and Uttarakhand have promised to install cashless system by July while Andaman & Nicobar and J&K by end of this year.Even West Bengal, which has been critical of the demonetisation move, has agreed to go cashless by June.Paswan said the beneficiaries would continue to have the option of payment through cash.The minister said that end-to-end computerisation of the PDS system and cashless transaction at ration shops would help check corruption and promote transparency in Public Distribution System.With some states raising the issue of banking transaction cost for electronic payments, Paswan said he would hold discussion with the Finance Minister on waiver of such costs, which at present are free till March.Food Secretary Preeti Sudan said the government is moving towards making Aadhaar essential but not mandatory and added that a notification in this regard would be issued.Stating that there is a fine line between essential and mandatory, she said, Let me work with the nuances.However, she asserted that beneficiaries would never be denied their entitlement under the food law.So far, 72% of ration cards have been seeded with Aadhaar Cards. There are 23 crore ration cards, of which about 16.62 crore have been seeded."

The court had reserved its judgment in the case on February 20.The petitioners alleged that since a state cabinet minister and an MP of the ruling party were allegedly involved in the case, the matter should be handed over to the CBI for a fair probe.The petitioner had alleged that there was a deeper conspiracy behind the incident as reflected in the fact that Jawahar Bagh, where demonstrations are not allowed, was given to Ram Vriksha Yadav for holding a satyagrah in 2014.The sect members had taken over the park gradually since 2014, turning it into a self-sufficient residential colony which had its own vegetable gardens and grocery shops. The sect even has its own tractors to ferry rice and other goods for the families.Most of the families in the park were from Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal.The incident had sparked a political blame game with the opposition attacking the government for a massive intelligence failure. The BJP had demanded a judicial probe into the matter.The self-styled organisation had a slew of bizarre demands including abolition of elections and the Indian rupee."

But political differences over how to divvy up GST revenues or compensate states for lost income because of the new tax held up progress.Once the tax reform comes into effect, consumers will pay a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services. At present, they pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed  one over the other  at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.The proposed GST will have four tax slabs. Farmers and small traders are exempt.The applied rates will be 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The cap will be on the higher side, finance minister Arun Jaitley said without elaborating on the higher limit. States want the higher limit set at 40% to obviate the need to go to Parliament every time taxes have to be raised on certain goods and services."

The number of sacrifices swells on Navami and Dashami during Navratri. Over 500 goats each are sacrificed on Navami and Dashami alone.The meat is distributed as prasad (consecrated food) to the faithful who cook it in earthen pots and enjoy a feast on the temple premises. The animal waste is buried.Tarkulha is one of the several manifestations of Goddess Durga. The deity derives the name Tarkulha Devi from the tarkul (palm) tree.The entire year, people visit the temple to offer sacrifice when their wishes are fulfilled. But the number increases during Navratri, said Dinesh Tiwari, priest at the Tarkulha Devi temple.Those who dont wish to sacrifice animals offer coconuts to the goddess, he said.The tradition here is in contrast to the practice in most Hindu temples where coconuts, sweets and lemon rice are distributed as prasad.Normally, Navratra is a period during which Hindus avoid consuming non-vegetarian food.Devotees from far-flung areas, including Bihar and Nepal, visit the temple and offer animal sacrifice to appease the deity. Most devotees bring the goats with them. Others buy the animal from shops outside the temple for Rs 2,500 or more.After the animal is bathed and sweets are offered to it, a butcher severs its head in a single stroke.It is a long-standing tradition. The devotees, whose wishes are fulfilled, sacrifice the goats and distribute its meat as prasad, said Manohar Tripathi, a devotee associated with the temple .The tradition and the history of the temple can be traced to the British era when Bandhu Singh , a devotee of Tarkulha, was hanged by the British who found him guilty of killing their soldiers.Bandhu Singh used to sacrifice animals and offer heads of the British at the feet of Devi, said Dinesh Tiwari.Bandhu Singh, adept in guerilla warfare, used to worship Goddess Tarkulha under a tarkul (tree along the Gurra river, which used to flow through a dense forest, said Dr PK Lahiri, member of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural heritage (Intach).Bandhu Singh used to sacrifice the animal to please the goddess and the practice continues, Lahiri said.Bandhu Singh beheaded the British when they crossed the forest.When senior British officials came to know about this, they caught him. A court sentenced him to death.The British tried to hang him thrice but failed.The fourth time, he prayed to the goddess for salvation, saying he was in extreme pain, and his prayer was answered.Finally, he was publicly executed at Alinagar crossing on August 12, 1857.Every time, the noose was placed around his neck and the lever was pulled, the rope broke and he escaped miraculously till he was finally executed. It is said that at the time of Bandu Singhs execution, a thunderstorm hit the area. The branch of a Tarkul tree, where he used to worship the goddess, broke and blood started oozing out of it, Lahiri told HT.From then on, people began worshipping Tarkulha Devi. They started offering sacrifices the same way Bandhu Singh did when he was alive."

Trump would not say if he reviewed new intelligence to support his claim.He told the Times he would say more at the right time.I think its going to be the biggest story, Trump said. Its such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time.Rice is the latest target for Trump and his embattled defenders.She has firmly denied that she did anything inappropriate in requesting the identities of Trump associates. As the national security adviser, Rice would have been authorised to seek identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.Officials typically unmask Americans if it is deemed necessary for understanding the information. Some Trump allies have accused Rice of unmasking officials for political reasons.Absolutely false, Rice said on Tuesday.Former president Barack Obamas national security adviser Susan Rice (Reuters File Photo)Trump on Wednesday disagreed.When the Times asked him if Rice broke the law, he said, Do I think? Yes, I think. The president did not specify what law he thinks Rice may have broken.Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for Rice, said, I am not going to dignify the presidents ludicrous charge with a comment.Trumps unfounded accusation fits a pattern for the president. Last month, he accused Obama of wiretapping his New York skyscraper and later said Obama had spied on his campaign. Neither allegation has been backed up by evidence.Trumps first national security adviser Michael Flynn is under FBI scrutiny for his ties to Russia. Two congressional committees are also investigating Flynn as part of larger probes into the Kremlins influence on the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates.Last week Trump said Flynn, who resigned in February, should seek an immunity deal.On Wednesday, House speaker Paul Ryan said the House intelligence committee investigation looking into Russias role in the 2016 election was back on track after the committees chairman had a secret meeting on White House grounds about intelligence that Trump later said vindicated his Obama wiretapping claims.A congressional aide said the documents are being made available for all committee members to view at the White House.Also, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on the witnesses to be called, Ryan said.Representative Jim Himes, D-Conn, a member of the committee, told CNN that Rice is on the witness list. A congressional aide said there were more than a dozen people on the list.According to a US official, Rice asked spy agencies to give her the names of Trump associates who surfaced in intelligence reports she was regularly briefed on. Rices official role would have given her the ability to make those requests for national security purposes.In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Rice acknowledged that she sometimes asked for the names of Americans referenced in reports.She would not say whether she saw intelligence related to Trump associates or whether she asked for their identities, though she did say that reports related to Russia increased in the final months of the presidential election campaign.The Trump White House has been particularly incensed that intercepted conversations between Flynn and Russias ambassador to the US surfaced in news reports before the inauguration.Rice denied that she had leaked details about Flynns call, saying, I leaked nothing to nobody."

We take Rs 10 as money for support (sahyog rashi). The entire cost to run the canteen is borne by Gorakhnath Temple, said Akhilesh Chowdhary, who has been looking after the canteen for the last three years.The Annapurna thali at Gorakhnath Hospital canteen has two chapaatis, pulses, 150 gram rice and two seasonal vegetables. (HT Photo)The canteen was set up for patients and their attendants visiting the hospital but it soon became popular with the poor, especially the labour class, who do not have the resources to buy costly food.Akhilesh said the food was cooked according to the tradition of the Nath sect and ingredients like garlic and onion were not used.Yogi Adityanath is of the view that low cost quality food should be the right of the poor. Before moving to Lucknow, he himself used to inspect the quality of food and took stock of cleanliness on a regular basis. He felt satisfaction by offering quality food to the needy, he said.Mithilesh Kumar, a rickshaw-puller said, Such facilities are a boon for us. Earlier, I used to pass my day on tea and samosa only and that too cost me Rs 20-30. I have been coming here for the last three years as I get good food for Rs 10 only.MD, Gorakhnath Hospital, Dr Mayank said the food provided at the canteen was nutritious and healthy."

The state government on Monday launched its ambitious food post scheme, the first of its kind in the country, for 70,000 families of particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs) enrolled under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).By delivering food through special messengers, the government aims to check malnutrition and hunger deaths among these tribes, officials said.The NFSA was launched in Jharkhand on September 25, 2015, and covers more than 2.63 people of the states total population of 3.29 crore. Under the scheme, PVTGs are entitled to 35 kg free ration every month.Since the PVTGs -- whose dwindling population is a concern for the state as well as the Centre -- lead a wanderers life in jungles and hills, the NFSA has failed to reach out to them effectively for their benefit.A survey conducted in two PVTGs villages in Garhwa and Sahebganj districts last year revealed that families of the Soriya Paharaiya -- an extremely endangered PVTG -- from the two villages have to dole out up to Rs 300 to access their free ration.Women from a tribal group in Dhawadih village in Jharkhand s Palamu feeding their children. (HT Photo)A right to food activist and the Supreme Court commissioners advisor on the same, Balram, who goes by one name, had carried out the survey.As per the Supreme Court order dated November 28, 2001, ration distribution should be made available free of cost every month to all the PVTG families at a nearest point. Unfortunately, the so-called nearest points for many of the PVTGs means travelling up to 50-60 km to and fro, which consumes an entire day, Balram said.State food minister Saryu Rai said, We got many reports that PVTGs are not getting their benefits under NFSA due to distance and unawareness towards their rights. So, we have decided to start food post so that these groups could get their rights at door step.The scheme was started from three blocks including Sundar Pahari (Godda), Chainpur (Palamu) and Barhait (Sahebganj) on Monday. All 24 districts of the state will covered under the scheme by April end, said Vinay Kumar Choubey, secretary of food and public distribution department.Choubey said that block level officials would be engaged as special messengers for the schemes, who would deliver a packet of 35-kg rice to each household.The delivery boy will carry an Aadhaar enabled POS machine to authenticate the actual delivery, said Choubey, who claimed Jharkhand is the first state in the country to launch food post.The scheme will also boost the income of rural women, as government has decided to purchase 35-kg plastic bags from Sakhi Mandal (women self-help groups).We have tied up with women SHGs in different villages for providing the 35 kg poly bags. This will increase income of rural women, Choubey said."

Though the canteens across the state continue to maintain the quality of food, limited supply of commodities such as dal, rice and other ingredients has forced the authorities to cook less in several parts of the city.The Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) supplies rice, urad dal, toor dal and edible oil to Amma canteens on a regular basis. However, due to a lack of stock, it has not been able to supply the required commodities regularly. Opposition DMK has even staged a one-day strike against the shortage of essential commodities at ration shops, controlled by the TNCSC.We cook less these days due to the short supply of rice and other commodities, an Amma canteen staff member employed in Nungambakkam area here said. According to him, each canteen, on an average, feeds almost 500 people a day in three shifts. However, at present, most of the canteens cook about 10-20% less than the target. Amma canteens are open from 7 am to 10 am, 12 pm to 3 pm and 6 pm to 9 pm everday.Though the canteen functions as usual, the food is sold out in a couple of hours, he said. I used to eat my lunch here at about 2 pm regularly. However, for the past few weeks, I have been forced to come by 12 pm since the food gets over soon, K Reddy, a customer, said. Reddy said the quality of the food served here is on par with big restaurants. A senior corporation official said there were some issues with the supply of essential commodities to the canteens a few weeks ago. However, the matter has been sorted out and the government has started supplying all the required items regularly, he said.Change in authorityTo add to the woes, the city corporation, which incurs a loss to the tune of about Rs 100 crore per year on maintaining these canteens, wants to handover the eateries to the Social Welfare Department. Amma canteens, the flagship scheme of the late chief minister Jayalalithaa, was launched in February 2013.An idli at these canteens is sold at Re 1. Likewise, mixed rice is sold at Rs 5 and chapati at Rs 3. At present, there are about 550 canteens across the state. Many states, including Karnataka, have visited Amma canteens to study the modalities and implement them in their respective states. Official statistics say Amma canteens sold a record 40 crore idlis and over 20 crore chapatis in 2016."

Even as the Chandrababu Naidu government claimed to firm up 665 Memoranda of Understanding with industries, promising investments of over a whopping Rs. 10 lakh crore with a potential to create 22 lakh jobs at CII Partnership Summit, the Opposition sweated it out for that elusive Special Category Status (SCS) citing the very same reasonsmore industries and more jobs for the youth.Who is right?Who is right, the government, the Opposition or the friend-lately-turned foe, Jana Sena Party of actor Pawan Kalyan? As pros and cons of getting SCS continues to be hotly debated, the now emotive issue arriving like a seasonal malaise and disappearing with the passage of time only to reappear again, one thing is apparently clear: the Opposition wants to use it as a potent political weapon to embarrass the ruling alliance of TDP and BJP and keep it alive till the next general elections in 2019.After all, no Opposition is expected to keep quiet, the BJP and TDP having served a laddu to them, as Pawan Kalyan would like to describe it, by failing to get SCS whatever the reasons. Oppositions argument is simple: Having fiercely fought for SCS and its extension for ten years and milked it fully to come to power how can the leading lights of the alliance now shelve it midway and say the alternative special assistance measure or special package is good ? Is it not betrayal? There is traction for Oppositions argument, the SCS having somehow become a sentimental and prestige issue for some sections of people in Andhra Pradesh.No wonder like many of the things borrowed from Tamil Nadu in the past, from Rs. 2 a kg rice scheme to Amma canteens, jallikattu- type of agitation was tried out but somewhere down the line, the script appears to have gone awry. It was good initially, the way social media was used to spread a mysterious message asking youth to draw inspiration from Tamil spirit and gather at RK beach in Visakhapatnam, in jallikattu- type of protest. It was to coincide with Republic Day and the big ticket CII Partnership Summit there the following day. But soon it became clear who was behind it with Pawan Kalyan tweeting it furiously and the leader of the Opposition in Assembly, Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy taking the plunge.What appeared to be a genuine struggle by independent youth soon metamorphosed into a full blown political battle with all Opposition parties, including Congress, CPI and CPI (M) coming on one platform to lambaste the Telugu Desam and BJP governments for cocking a snook at SCS. The government decided to use brutal force and clamp down. In the end it became another round of political up-man-ship seen in the high drama leading to halting of Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy at Visakhapatnam airport and carting him back to Hyderabad. Who won in this round is anybodys guess.Tenuous relationshipInterestingly for the first time one heard the politician in Mr. Pawan Kalyan speak out showing signs of his tenuous relationship with BJP- TDP alliance reaching a breaking point. He has not only made common cause with Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy and others in the Opposition but targeted leaders of a particular denomination. Is the honeymoon over? Will it lead to a political realignment? Time only will tell.But the moot point is if there is anyone left who sees the SCS beyond a narrow political prism? While the spirit of jallikattu protest was hijacked and used as a strategy one wonders why Andhra politicians fail to follow their Tamil Nadu counterparts of being seen on the same page when it involves states interests?While the Oppositions case is that lot of benefits flow automatically once the state gets the SCS tag, the governments argument, arising out its 30-month engagement with the Centre seems otherwise. Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu visited Delhi over 30 times to get so many pending issues resolved, but SCS remains a hard nut to crack reasons cited being States landscape not fitting the bill, demand from other states and SCS itself being phased out. On their part, BJP and TDP leaders argue that the special package would fetch more than SCS and question why states which enjoyed SCS all these years do not figure in the investment or the industries radar or show better job opportunities. Why do these states do not top the lists of ease of doing business?If this argument is true then why doesnt the government come out with a White Paper or a fact-sheet of the number of industries attracted and employment generated by states that enjoyed SCS so far? It will not as it means dumping SCS all together, involving too much of a political risk.Opposition knows this but should one keep harping on SCS alone on the grounds of sentiment and promises made on the floor of Parliament and outside when its impossibility appears inevitable? If the Congress was so concerned why did it not include in the AP Reorganisation Act itself instead of confining to a mere oral announcement by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh? Questions galore but no cogent explainers and the saga seems to continue till the next opportune time, season, or perhaps the next elections."

Sunil Kumar on Sunday announced the decision of the State government to consider a major revision of the existing crop insurance benefits for farmers as part of the governments special support schemes with focus on those engaged in paddy and coconut cultivation.Mr. Sunil Kumar, who explained the benefits in detail while launching paddy harvesting at Avalapandy kole land in Perambra Assembly constituency, said the revised scheme would offer Rs. 35,000 per hectare to paddy farmers in case of unexpected crop loss. Now, the amount is only Rs. 12,000, he pointed out.The Minister said the revised insurance package would be Rs. 2,000 instead of Rs. 700 per coconut tree for farmers in case of natural calamities or pest infestation. For plantains, the amount will be raised from Rs. 50 to Rs. 300, he said, adding that the premium amount of Rs. 100 would remain unchanged.Perambra Development Mission convener M. Kunhammad said the Avalapandy kole land farming project, covering around 1,100 acres, was a thumping success.We hope to generate a total revenue of Rs. 2.31 crore from the venture. Our investment was around Rs. 66 lakh, he added. Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran chaired the inaugural event. Cine actor Sreenivasan was the chief guest.It was in November 2016 that the large-scale padding farming project was launched in the area, which had remained fallow for close to three decades.

Believed to be more than a century old, the Njattupura was a temporary shelter for Vijayan during the late fifties and sixties.A unique live theatre on demand will be inaugurated by the month-end at the Njattupura and it would have a rich collection of video and audio footage on the eminent writer.

The police had not been intervening effectively to end this violence and the Home Department headed by Mr. Vijayan had lost its control over the police.

The Congress party would stand united and the partys activities at all levels would be strengthened and agitations carried forward.Mr. Sudheeran said the State governments inertia had led to the collapse of the public distribution system and the government had not even managed to convince the Centre about its food requirements. Immediate steps were needed to check the steep hike in the price of rice in the open market. Traditional sectors such as coir, cashew and handloom were in the doldrums and the crisis in the agrarian sector needed to be resolved immediately.The KPCC executive would meet again on February 22 and the focus would be on strengthening organisational activities.

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

Gurmeet Singh Farmers buy seeds during Kisan Mela at PAU in Ludhiana Saturday. Gurmeet SinghThe Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) sold more than 300 quintals of seeds of its new paddy variety PR-126 during the two-day kisan mela which concluded here Saturday.A short-duration variety maturing in just 125 days, PR-126 takes less water, making it suitable for water scarce conditions in Punjab. It has a yield of 30 quintals/acre.Currently, it is PUSA 44, the variety developed by Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and HKR-48 by Haryana Agricultural University (HAU), that dominates fields in Punjab.However, the scientists at PAU have warned farmers against PUSA 44 cultivation. This variety falls under non-recommended category of PAU. It is to shift farmers preference from PUSA 44 that PAU introduced a better variety in form of PR-126 last year. However, last year, its seeds were available for trial basis in limited quantity only. This time, they were sold in bulk to the farmers at Kisan Mela.Speaking to The Indian Express, Tarsem Singh Dhillon, director (seeds) at PAU, said, We do not recommend or sell seeds of PUSA 44. This variety is not only long-duration one taking more than 160 days to mature, but it also requires more water. Also, it is prone to various diseases. On the other hand, PR-126 introduced by PAU now takes just 125 days to mature, consuming less water and more resistant to various bacteria. This year, our target was to encourage farmers to grow PAU recommended varieties only.Although yield of PUSA-44 is near 32 quintal/acre, a little more than 30 q/acre of PR-126, it is prone to diseases and takes too long to mature, said Dr RS Sidhu, director extension, PAU.As per data accessed by The Indian Express from the seeds department of the varsity, PAU sold 327 quintals of seeds of PR-126 in two-day Kisan Mela at the campus.However, PAUs two old varieties, PR-121 and PR-114, recorded the highest sale of 444 quintals and 369 quintals, respectively. PAU also sold more than 300 quintals of PR-114 and 211 quintals of PR-122.Considering it was the first year of bulk seed sale of PR-126, it has recorded excellent sales, said Dhillon.When it comes to basmati rice seeds, PUSA-1121 of IARI recorded the highest sale of 295 quintals. The two new basmati varieties introduced by PAU this year, Punjab Basmati 4 and 5, recorded low sales at 14 quintals and 4.30 quintals, respectively.In his address, PAU Vice-Chancellor BS Dhillon had told farmers to buy new basmati variety seeds for trial basis only.Of the total area under rice cultivation in Punjab, around 64% is under paddy and rest is under basmati high quality rice.In basmati, PAU variety Punjab basmati-3 covers just 1.5% while 23% is under PUSA-1121 and 11.2% under PUSA-1509, both of IARI.In paddy, PAU varieties cover 26% area only while rest 38% is under HAU and IARI varieties, approximately.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 5:27 am"

DH file photoAs many as 362 fair price shops have stopped functioning in the city and no applications have been received to start new ones in the past seven months.While many owners closed down voluntarily, the government downed shutters on shops which were catering to less than 300 card-holders.Food and Civil Supplies Department secretary Harsha Gupta said they had reorganised the number of shops based on the number of card-holders they catered to. Shops which had more than the specified number of card-holders were bifurcated. He said the number of shops have come down as the department cancelled separate licences issued to kerosene stores and clubbed such stores with fair price shops.Shopkeepers say they shut shop because selling only rice and dal was not profitable to them. Wages for labourers who load and unload the foodgrains are increasing. Ration distribution is leading to increasing debts for us, the owner of a fair price shop said.Owners are expected to update information through IVRS system once they distribute the foodgrains. Many are not familiar with online transactions and are dependent on others to update the system. A food inspector said many owners who found it difficult to operate online also closed down their shops.Moreover, there are talks of introducing direct benefit transfer system, by which the funds will be directly transferred to the beneficiaries accounts, instead of providing them supplies.The department has cancelled licences of about 150 shops. However, owners of these shops have got a stay from the court and are operating. We have closed shops that had between 150 and 200 cards. We have transferred the cards of such shops to nearby outlets. Retaining shops that have fewer card-holders is not viable commercially, Gupta said.He said owners who had bagged tenders are finding it difficult to supply rice and dal at the rates they had quoted. Hence, the supply is affected. The department will supply dal from next month, he said."

In the global arena,Indian fuel prices are directly linked to the global prices while food grain prices are controlled by the government through the minimum support prices (MSP) and local wholesale markets or mandis.Crude oil prices are forecast to rise to an average of $55 per barrel (bbl) in 2017 from $43 per barrel in 2016, the World Bank said in its Commodity Markets Outlook report.The oil forecast reflects balancing forces--an upward pressure on prices from production cuts agreed by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producing countries, and downward pressure from persistently high stocks, supported by the faster-than-expected rebound of the United States shale oil industry.India, which revises petrol and diesel prices in line with global prices, is now thinking of daily revisions.Metals prices are projected to increase 16% as a result of strong demand in China and various supply constraints, the World Bank said.However, agricultural commodity prices, which gained 1% in the first quarter, are anticipated to remain broadly stable in 2017.Stockpiles of corn and wheat are at record highs globally after years of bumper crops.Global stocks of corn, wheat, rice and soybeans combined will hit a record 671.1 million tonne going into the next harvest, the third straight year of historically high surplus, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) forecast."

This bypoll is just to test the pulse of the people. As per the Budget announcements, BPL family members will get 5 kg of rice per month, from the earlier 4 kg, Anganwadi children will get egg twice a week and schoolchildren will get milk on five days in a week, effective from Saturday, he said.He campaigned for Congress candidate Kalale N Keshavamurthy in Nanjangud taluk throughout the day. He started the canvassing after holding a meeting with party workers at the party office at Nanjangud town.While he received good response in Goluru, Badanavalu and other villages, there was a lukewarm response in villages like Veeradevanapura. When he announced that a Uppara Development Corporation would be established for the development of Uppara community people, a section of the people demanded constitution of a Bhagiratha Development Corporation. Siddaramaiah responded in the positive.He met seer of Gurumalleshwara Mutt at Devanuru and proceeded to Chikka Kavalande, Dodda Kavalande, Nerale, Hedathale, Hemmaragala, Badagaiahnahundi, Mallahalli, Sinduvalli, Uppinahalli, Horalavadige among other villages.At Dodda Kavalande, Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Board C M Ibrahim spoke for 90 minutes. Criticising the Mann Ki Baat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, people need Jan Ki Baat. I was the first person to announce that Siddaramaiah would become CM during the 2013 Assembly elections. But, did I become a minister in his Cabinet? Performance of the government should be our priority. Who is there or who is not there in the Cabinet is not important. The move of V Srinivas Prasad is not justified, he said."

With the addition of two kg rice per every individual in the families (of BPL card holders), the government intends to ensure that no one goes down due to hunger, he said.Income certificateOn the other hand, following the governments announcement to revise existing guidelines to avail BPL cards, nine lakh people have applied for income certificates. According to the new guidelines, those with an annual income of Rs 1.2 lakh can go for self-declaration by filling details on the application, to avail the benefit. They have to provide income certificates as proof.To ensure a hassle-free process, the department is also in talks with both revenue department and National Informatics Commission (that deals with government websites irrespective of department) to directly download the income certificates and provide the same to applicants, he added.Vigilance committeeThat apart, to ensure timely services, a three-member vigilance committee will be constituted in each fair price shop. The three members will be randomly selected among the card holders. If elderly persons are selected, they will be replaced by others. They will be tasked with the supervision of the system related to distribution of essential commodities. In case of malpractices, they are vested with powers to recommend for cancellation of licence of such shops, he said.Indira canteensOn the ambitious programme of the state Government to open canteens in the name of Indira Gandhi, Khader said that the government has invited expression of interest in this regard. The canteens wil be set up in each ward of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagarapalike (BBMP) and a centralised kitchen will be set up for every eight wards. While the proposal of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) is in abeyance for not using onion and garlic in preparing food items, many hotel groups, including Balaji Hotel Association, has come forward, Khader said."

According to Excise department officials, the new excise duty levied will be imposed on fresh stocks from April 1 and a rate chart on the new maximum retail price (MRP) of popular brands of liquor will be released soon.For instance, a half bottle (375 ml) of McDowells whiskey, a popular brand in the state which now costs Rs 275 is likely to cost Rs 300, the officials said.VAT on liquor, beer and wine, which attracted a 5.5% VAT when consumed along with food in bars and restaurants has been done away from April 1. So, bar bills should cost less from Saturday but will be more or less compensated by the increase in additional excise duty on liquor.The price of a brand new Enfield bike is pegged at Rs 1.23 lakh. With the revision in motor vehicles tax, consumers will have to pay an additional Rs 22,000 as a lifetime tax from April. A brand new Dukes super bike priced over Rs 1.5 lakh will attract a tax of around Rs 30,000.Siddaramaiah had also proposed uniform admission fee policy in all cinema theatres including multiplexes in the state by prescribing Rs 200 as maximum admission fee but has not set a timeframe for its implementation.BPL card beneficiaries will get seven kg of rice per person instead of five kg per person under the Anna Bhagya scheme from April 1."

Speaking after the launch of the distribution of additional quantity of rice under Anna Bhagya scheme in the district at a programme in Zilla Panchayat on Friday, he said that people from villages migrated to urban areas in search of work earlier as they did not have any way to earn their daily bread.But, now, as the government provides them free rice under Anna Bhagya scheme, they can have food even if they do not get the work. Migration of villagers has almost been stopped after the implementation of the scheme, Khader said.He said that the distribution of additional quantity of rice will come to effect from April. The fair price shops should distribute food grains between the first and fifteenth days of each month. They should not receive food grains from godowns if they are of poor quality. If the fair price shops distribute low quality items, their licences will be scrapped. Vigilance teams have been formed to ensure the proper distribution and the quality of items distributed in the fair price shops, he said.Khader requested the Zilla Panchayat, Taluk Panchayat and Gram Panchayat members to coordinate with the food and civil supplies department to ensure that the food grains reach needy.Launching the distribution of additional quantity of rice under Anna Bhagya scheme in the district, District In-Charge Minister B Ramanath Rai said that there may be criticisms that the government has made people lazy by providing them free food grains. But, one has to remember that the scheme has provided the people of prioritised families, with three times of food per day.Earlier, there were days when people from these families had one time meal in a day. Anna Bhagya scheme is a huge step for hunger-free Karnataka and towards the empowerment of poor and deprived. Karnataka is the first state in the country to give free rice to people, he said.Zilla Panchayat president Meenakshi Shanthigodu, vice president Kasturi Panja, Mangaluru South MLA J R Lobo and food and civil supplies department deputy director Jayappa were present."

There is shortage of 19%. We can make second generation ethanol from bamboo, cotton straw, wheat straw, rice straw, bagass, etc. This will generate employment for 25 lakh rural youth.

For me, it is reading while eating. During the 50s, we children enjoyed being served by the womenfolk of the house as we sat cross legged on the floor. When it was time for our lunch or dinner, we would troop into the dining hall with a story book or a magazine in hand.The elders were certainly not happy with our strange habit. They used to tell us that by practicing this habit, we would not know what we were eating, how much we were eating and hence it was harmful to our health; but we were a set of spoilt kids and had our way.We would plan in advance which book to read during our next meal. Invariably there was a big competition for the latest Tamilvananans mystery novel. This authors novel used to feature a detective hero called Shankarlal, who solved crimes and fought criminals in countries around the world. His style was unique; he presented fascinating facts and surprised the reader with his original and thought-provoking ideas.We had a variety of choices in childrens magazines  Ambuli mama, Anil, Kalkandu and Karumbu. These books were gateways to our fantasies. We were not sure if the food tasted better because of the flavour of the books that we were reading or the other way around. Sometimes, the books would slip out of our hands and fall into the sambar or rasam, thus acquiring newer flavours.On full moon days, the above practice took a slight variation. We used to gather on our moonlit terrace. My grandmother would walk in with a big bowl of rice mixed with sambar or curds, and start feeding us by turn, which in itself was a big task. But the biggest task, was to tell us a story alongside.My grandmother K had the endurance of a marathon runner in storytelling; she could tell stories for hours continuously, still holding our interest. She maintained eye contact with her audience and made it interactive. Her intonation, pauses and the excitement in her voice ensured that we were able to exactly visualise the characters that she was talking about.We would gobble up our food imagining the wicked face of Pinjakan in Karunkuil Kundrathu Kolai or Ananda Singh (Sherlock Homes) walking and tapping the road and detecting a trench near a bank (red-headed league). The food would soon get over and my grandmother would shout out for more supply from downstairs.My professional life gave a long intermission to my habit of reading while eating. After retirement, I switched over to TV watching while eating which, now I realise, was a big mistake. These days, I am neither happy with the content of TV channels (violence, death, accidents) nor the presentation (a cluttered screen with nine to eleven points of information). They are certainly not an enjoyable watch during a meal time.I have now resumed my good old habit of reading a Wodehouse or R K Narayans book while having my dinner."

Will this signal a revival of funding environment for the entire start-up ecosystem, which has gone through rough weather?As part of the deal, eBay will sell its Indian business to Flipkart. The funding comes at a time when Jeff Bezoss Amazon is expanding aggressively and plans to invest $5 billion in India in the next few years. Flipkart has gone through a top-level revamp, while key investors are pushing another home-grown online retailer Snapdeal for a potential sale to Flipkart or Alibaba-backed Paytm. Expectations are that it would be three-way fight in the Indian e-commerce market among Amazon, Alibaba and Flipkart, which is consolidating its position through mergers, with backing of strategic investors.The years 2014 and 2015 saw billions of dollars being poured into the ecosystem. Then emerged the news of firms making huge losses and investors becoming cautious of putting in money and pushing firms towards sustainable business models. Hence, private equity and venture capital funding in Indian e-commerce fell to $1.94 billion in 2016 from a peak of $4.7 billion in 2015, data from Venture Intelligence show. According to the firm, there has been a notable shift away from consumer Internet and mobile deals.There has been news of employee firings and start-ups shutting down, mainly because they could not find sustainable business models. According to data from start-up tracker Tracxn, 314 start-ups closed down in 2016.Even with the latest round of funding seen in the space, some industry watchers are still sceptical about the discounting model of e-commerce firms which result in higher cash burn levels.At a recent event at IIT Madras, ace banker Deepak Parekh said the valuation game may have run ahead of what fundamentals warrant in the e-commerce space.Rein in cash burn. Time has come to caution and rein in the cash burn model. There has to be threshold level where the revenue stream and profitability have to become key considerations, rather than just focusing on gross merchandise value, he said, immediately after the latest round of fund raising by Flipkart.Unless these companies post cash profits, how will they ever be self-sustaining? Otherwise, the model is just based on going from one private equity fund to another and at some stage someone will be left holding the baby and this can have a domino effect across the entire system, he added.However, he displayed faith in the e-commerce sector pointing out that India delivers about 2 million packages a day, when compared with an estimated 57 million in China and 35 million in US. The growth of this sector hinges on sorting out logistics, warehousing and the transportation system.Kerry Rice, a senior analyst on Internet and digital media at New York-based investment bank Needham & Company, said that Indias consumer market is of a significant size. Indian e-commerce and financial services (which includes travel, digital payments, cab services, movie tickets, food delivery, online learning) is expected to reach $40-50 billion by 2020 from $15-20 billion, according to recent report by The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) along with The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE).No dominant leaderI believe investors are likely looking at India as a similar market to China, except no dominant leader exists yet, Mr. Rice said in an email response. Given that there is no dominant leader, we are seeing large global e-commerce companies, such as Alibaba, Amazon and eBay trying... to seize a leadership position. I expect more investments to come for India, he added.Anil Kumar, CEO at Redseer Consulting reckons that the e-commerce space can see profits being made. The market is still at the nascent stage. Only 1% of Indian market is online. The current size is $15 billion. If that grows by 10-15 times in next 10 years, the customer acquisition cost as well as cash burn will come down and profits would be made.He also said one of the key issues would be how quickly the players can increase the user base from 15 million at present to 100-200 million.One firm that has been successful in bringing down cash burns is online restaurant discovery and online food delivery firm Zomato, which has seen an 81% drop in annual operating burn for FY17 at $12 million, from $64 million in FY16, according to its recent blogpost. Last year, HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) had slashed the firms valuation by about half to $500 million.The sharp reduction in Zomatos burn is a significant positive, and if revenue growth momentum continues on this base, the concerns on $1-billion valuations will abate, particularly considering multiple valuation write-downs and business shutdowns over past year in the sector, Motilal Oswal said in a research note.Flipkarts fund raising (at a 24% lower valuation than its previous funding round) signals a positive sign for the entire ecosystem since it is seen as a barometer. With government approving the listing of IRCTC, one of the profitable e-commerce firms, things are looking good for the ecosystem, Mr. Kumar added. All in all, the current Flipkart deal at a reasonably rich valuation tells me there are still some takers for the Indian horizontal e-commerce story who believe that another large company can go profitably head-to-head with Amazon, notwithstanding the many who have closed down, or look close to downing shutters, said entrepreneur-turned-investor Chandu Nair said. He pointed out that the consumer Internet story in India got overheated too soon and there was too much money from certain investors, which had what the industry calls FOMO (or fear of missing out) written all over it, chasing very few quality deals.The Flipkart deal comes as a major relief to the e-commerce ecosystem, Arun Natarajan, MD, Venture Intelligence, said. However, this deal is not likely to trigger the kind of frenzy in the Internet and mobile sector that we saw in 2015. The focus now is on whether Unicorns are able to walk the talk in terms of profitability and deliver real cash exits to investors, he added.Professor Thillai Rajan, Department of Management Studies, IIT-Madras, who closely tracks the start-up sector in India, said tepid interest in e-commerce and the consumer Internet space is unlikely to change while there could be more interest towards deep innovation ventures.Unless they post cash profits, how will firms ever beself-sustaining?Deepak ParekhChairman, HDFC"

The government didnt follow the basic procedures before suspending the committee. The committee has not received the copy of the suspension order even after five days of suspension, he said.

He congratulated the Adattu Farmers bank for its services to the farmers.The bank was an integral part of the farmers life. The Adattu brand rice and organic vegetables were role models.

The remark was not about food, but television. It was around the time that the satellite boom had hit India, and there were channels galore. And this was what the columnist had to say: So much to choose from, but so little to watch.Thats my thought about the restaurant boom in Delhi: there are restaurants in all parts of town, but only a few places that you really want to go back to. In fact, I am a bit like a stuck record when it comes to something that I like: if it works for me, I keep going back there.And that is why, one pleasant afternoon some days ago, I found myself in Side Wok in Malcha Marg. Actually, I must admit that it was my first time there. But I had some great meals at two other outlets of Side Wok  in Khan Market and Connaught Place (they have branches elsewhere, too). So I thought I had to try the one out in Malcha Marg.A friend from Kolkata was in town. Every time I am in his city, he and his wife make it a point to take me out for a good meal. I try and do that when they are in Delhi, but its a tough act to follow for they are die-hard foodies. This time, just one of them was visiting. And since I know about his fondness for Chinese food, I thought it would be a good idea to take him to Side Wok.The decision to go to the Malcha Marg outlet was not just because I had not gone there. It was also because I have always liked this little market in this tony south Delhi residential area. Many years ago, before Delhi became such a happening food hub, I used to often go to Malcha Marg to have a meal at Fujiya, a Chinese restaurant that I am happy to say is still going strong. The other great point in its favour is the fact that parking there is a snap. Theres ample parking space right in front of the restaurant.So I parked my car and looked for a table for three in Side Wok. It was a weekend, and not surprisingly very busy. I was advised by one of the servers to go to Fez, which is a part of the chain that also owns Side Wok. Fez is a Mediterranean restaurant, and I have had some great meals there. We were told that we would be able to order Side Wok dishes at Fez, as well as from Fezs own menu.So we asked for a mixed mezze platter (a delicious offering of fish, prawns, chicken, lamb and veggies, with pita bread, hummus, tzatziki and a great garlic-and-yoghurt dip  all for Rs. 985). From the Side Wok menu we asked for a plate of Singapore vegetable noodles (Rs. 295), mixed fried rice (Rs. 415), spare ribs (Rs. 495) and sliced lamb with fresh red chillies and basil (Rs. 495).It was one of the nicest meals I have had in some time. The mezze platter was wonderful, as one would expect, but the Chinese dishes were superb, too. The pork belly was deliciously moist, and cooked just right. The fork went into the melted fat and tender meat easily, and I loved the sauce, a thick jus with just the right balance of sweet and sour. The lamb had all the right flavours, with the basil complementing the chillies. The noodles were light with crunchy vegetables, and the rice was very, very nice  with plump shrimps, chicken strips and lamb. All in all, it was an excellent meal.The portions are generous, too. We were hungry when we went there, but found that we had to take home some left overs, which turned into our dinner that evening. So I must say its value for money, too.I cheer all the new restaurants coming up in town, but I toast the old ones in particular. Its not easy to keep old clients happy, meal after meal."

Except for vegetables, no produce is arriving at the APMC yard. Similarly, transportation of vegetables from the yard to neighbouring states is unhindered.Supply of tur dal from Kalaburagi, Bidar and Gujarat, bengal gram from Madhya Pradesh, and rice from Raichur, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal has been stopped. In the same way, the transportation of horse gram from the yard to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and other states has been stalled. There is no change in the supply of water, medicines, milk and vegetables. However, over 1,500 trucks have been parked at various places, including the truck terminal at Bandipalya, Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed and at the Old RMC yard.According to sources, the truck owners have refused to lift cement and fertilisers from the Bannimantap Railway Goods Shed, 230 loads each, which have arrived by goods trains on Saturday. Goods Shed Lorry Owners Association president Abdul Khader Sahid said, they have received requests to lift the loads, but the association has clarified that the loads cannot be lifted until the demands of reduction of insurance premium and RTO fees are fulfilled.Sources said, the supply of gas (LPG) will not be affected in the city. LPG is supplied to the city from Mangaluru through pipelines. So, the truck protest will not have any effect on the LPG supply, said the sources. However, Petroleum Distributors Association S K Dinesh said, the association is morally supporting the protest. If the governments do not fulfil the demands, petroleum tankers will also join the protest, he said.In-charge Deputy Director for Food and Civil Supplies C L Anand said, the stocks of provisions, slated for distribution in fair price shops to ration card holders, is sufficient for April month quota.

No alcohol served.CALL: 2600-0888Have you eaten at The Blue yet? a famous restaurateur whos created many recognisable restaurant brands in Mumbai and known for his impeccable sartorial taste asks me at dinner. You should check them out; theyre doing some fantastic stuff.Its not often that you hear restaurateurs praising another restaurant, and Im intrigued.Opened by two ex-chefs who handled the Japanese and Thai food at San Qi at the Four Seasons, The Blue is extremely tiny. It seats just 14 inside and 8 outside. Its so small that every time the woman behind me adjusts her seat, her elbow digs into my back. This size of restaurant is a popular format in the stretch between Bandra and Khar. One table is occupied by a group of vaguely familiar television actors who bitch about script rehearsals between discussing the culinary delights of Singapore.The mushroom gyoza at The Blue are crisp on the outside and hold an almost mousse-like filling. They go well with the soy-chilli dip. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)With just two cuisines to choose from, ordering is easy. We start with a plate of nigiri sushi. Thin, bright pink slices of tuna akami that look like slivers of raw steak are draped over sushi rice. The rice is slightly warm, a touch over body temperature. Its unusual, but doesnt detract from the taste or texture of the sushi. Our mushroom gyoza are crisp and brown on the outside with a mousse-like texture to the filling. It tastes even better with the sweet-salty-spicy soy-chilli dip.The soft-shell crab tempura is coated in Japanese mustard. Its one of the popular starters at the Khar restaurant. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Im equally impressed by the texture of the Karashi mustard soft shell crab, batter-fried and coated in mildly piquant Japanese mustard. The crab is simultaneously, soft, crisp and crunchy. The salad though seems superfluous. We are quite pleased with all the Japanese starters.For the main course we shift to Thai: a chicken green curry and a serving of crispy pork. Its not easy to get a good green curry at a standalone place in Mumbai. Most use ready-made curry pastes, which flattens the flavours somewhat. What distinguishes The Blues curry is that you can not only taste the spices, but also the flavour of the vegetables. It also has faint citrus aroma which brings a zesty freshness to every morsel.The Blues green Thai curry doesnt taste like the usual pre-made pastes. You can taste the spices and the veggies, and theres a refreshing hint of citrus. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Tossed with baby corn and zucchini in a spicy-sweet sauce, each cube of pork has a perfectly crackled skin. Its more crunchy pork than crispy.The only disappointment was the tub tim grob. Served in a glass bowl rather than a coconut shell, it looked rather unloved and the achingly underwhelming coconut milk left you a little heartbroken.The Blue is doing some fantastic stuff indeed; its five-star hotel quality food at about one-fourth the price.HT reviews anonymously and pays for all meals"

The SP has this time promised laptops to meritorious students and smart phones for all.BJP and Congress, which is fighting the polls in alliance with SP, besides parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have all promised free wi-fi internet services in all colleges and universities, apparently to cash in on the 'Digital India' wave.Like in the past, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, has stayed clear of coming out with a manifesto this elections, with its supremo Mayawati stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but ""acting"" on them.Congress has promised to provide free school education for every girl child and give free bicycles to girl students from Class IX to XII. BJP, on the other hand, has announced free school education to all students and extending it till graduation for the meritorious ones.Notably, to instill a technical approach and scientific attitude among the students who passed class XII the state government had launched a scheme to provide a laptop to them.In 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, Rs 3,43,009.91 crore were spent and 14,82,093 students covered in the scheme. In 2016-17, it was proposed to cover 39,600 students, according to an official UP government data on planning.With nearly 20 crore people, Uttar Pradesh remains a populous state. It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly. The state, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people.BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs 1 lakh, while BJP, Congress, SP and RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.In a bid to woo farmers, parties including BJP and SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan ""karza maaf, bijli half"" (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).The BJP, in its manifesto called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra', has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto.SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs 7.5 lakh from present Rs 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the state, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents.BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks' time.Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale.Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.BJP said that on lines of the central government's decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power.BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression."

However, the government should start giving unpolished rice (brown rice) which is enriched with protiens, fibre and minerals instead of the less nutritious white rice.He said this delivering a talk on Food Security and Safety, organised as part of World Consumers Day at Tumkur University campus on Friday.Food security is all about people having access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food available locally to meet their dietary needs for leading a healthy life. The food preferences differe from region to region. In Mangaluru, people prefer boiled rice while it is ragi in old mysuru region and jowar in north Karnataka districts, the food expert explained.It is not right to distribute white rice in all regions. The white rice lacks fibre and nutritional value, he said.The rice mill owners are willing to supply unpolished rice. By doing so they can save Rs 500 spent on polishing the rice. The rice mill owners have told me that they would supply brown rice or unpolished rice If the government issues order in this regard, Bengaluru-based food expert said. He added that even the government is planning to procure the unpolished rice and if it goes ahead with its plan, it would do a world of good to the poor and underprivileged families.Sugar, new nicotineThe food expert explened to the gathering about the ill-effects of sugar. He said, 25 grams of sugar a day is enough for a person. But the people consume far more than the recommended levels and become vulnerable to many diseases. These days the food scientists call sugar new nicotine.It is wrong to process Maida out of wheat. But they do convert wheat into Maida and use as many as 12 chemicals to make it fine and white. The consumption of which will lead to many diseases. Never fall for colour and taste when it comes to food, he advised.Food and Civil Supplies Deputy Director Manteswamy called upon the people that if they find any lapses or shortcomings in the food items, they should bring it to the notice of district consumer centre.Vice Chancellor Dr A H Rajasab said that the country can achieve food security only when the foodgrains production was based on the population. ""Before Independence, the population of India was 33 crore while it is 130 crore now. However, the extent of land used for cultivation has come down considerably, the VC said.Registrar M Venkateshwaralu, district consumer information centre convener T S Niranjan and others were present."

The move will also result in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.Removal of quantitative celling on wheat, sugar, non-basmati rice, organic sugar and increasing the limit on export of organic pulses is expected to contribute to the Governments objective of doubling the farmers income, an official statement said.It will lead to reduction in input costs in farming and gaining premium price for organic agriculture products and in the process resulting in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.All organic products exports are certified by Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).It said the government is supporting the farmers and exporters to tap huge opportunity that exists within the country and abroad for organic agriculture products.A stable and consistent export policy relating to export of organic products would allow exporters to make long term commitment to the buyers and also establish linkages with the farmers.This is likely to result in enhanced realisation to farmers from organic production, it said adding a stable export policy on organic agriculture products would complement various government programmes like National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana,Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region which have been taken up to encourage organic agriculture. According to estimates, the global organic market has touched USD 80 billion in 2014 and it is expected to reach USD 100 billion by 2020.Huge export potential exist in countries including the US, Europe and Canada. Indias export of organic goods have increased from USD 12.4 million in 2002-03 to USD 298 million in 2015-16.India mainly exports organic wheat, non-basmati rice and sugar.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
