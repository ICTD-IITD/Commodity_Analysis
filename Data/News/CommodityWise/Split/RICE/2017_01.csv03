District in-charge Minister Santosh Lad was present in the programme.While stating that krishi hondas  implemented under Krishi Bhagya  are a boon, Basavaraj of Kukkuppi village, Kudligi taluk, suggested that the government come out with a permanent solution by providing irrigation cover to drought-prone taluks under the Bhadra project.B. Siddaramappa of Sirguppa taluk, who is a beneficiary under the organic farming scheme, pointed out that the scheme is limited for a period of three years.He wanted it to be extended by another couple of years so as to ensure that farmers got full benefit, including recouping the fertility of the soil.Beneficiaries of Anna Bhagya urged the Minister to ensure that the quantity of rice provided under the scheme is increased from the present five kg to eight kg besides expediting the process of issuing tokens.Mr. Lad said that he would take up the issues raised with the government."

These are no longer limited to the humble ragi mudde and rotti. Millets are now available in various avatars such as ice cream, jamun, cereal, pani puri, pizza, pasta and sohan papdi.The varieties available at the two-day Organic and Millet Mela, organised by the Department of Agriculture and Jaivik Krishik Society, which started on Saturday, are proof that the Indian diet comprises much more than rice and wheat. Eight of the 14 regional federations of organic farmers associations have come together with nearly 200 farmers and 60 stalls that have organic and millet products on sale.The demand for millet has seen nearly one lakh agriculturists in Karnataka, who were engaged in growing more conventional crops such as paddy until four years ago, start growing millets as well.With the demand for millets on the rise, the supply is said to have reduced over the last few years. One solution is to organise as many awareness programmes for farmers as possible to convince them to grow millet. The Agriculture Department has also brought in 1.8 lakh hectares under organic farming with millets, grains, fruits, vegetables and pulses, said Krishna Byre Gowda, Minister of State for Agriculture.This fifth edition of the Millet Mela, specially organised in the wake of the National Trade Fair 2017 - Organics & Millets to be launched in Bengaluru on April 28, 29 and 30 at Palace Grounds by the Department of Agriculture, will also serve as the venue for people to register for the National Trade Fair.Today, Karnataka has nearly 14 lakh hectares of land growing millets. The area is steadily growing with Ragi, Navane, Saame, Baragu, Korle, Hoodalu and Arka. We wanted Karnataka millets to have a better exposure in the national market where a host of dealers and farmers will be taking part, added Mr. Gowda.The last three years have seen the department certify 75,000 people as registered organic farmers. We thought growing millets is as important as going organic. With millets, water consumption is only 20% or lesser compared to growing paddy that requires nearly 5,000 litres of water to grow just 1 kg of rice! Millets are not only power-packed with nutrients, but consume just one-fourth of water and soil nutrients when compared to paddy. They require only two rainfalls in the sowing and flowering stages. They are, by default, largely organic, and their maximum fodder value suits our parched soil conditions. Also, they dont require pest sprays as are frequently required for rice, he said."

Tucked away from the busy East Coast Road lies the Thiruvanmiyur Clock Tower Auto Stand with 14 members who have been celebrating the festival by giving Annadhanam for over a decade now.Four of the 14 are Muslims who joined the stand at various points in time say they take up every responsibility given to them and feel proud to be a part of it. When N. Narayanan mooted the idea of offering food to all devotees during the festival 10 years ago, everyone in the stand readily agreed. Whats even more special is, the four  M. Basha, H. Mustafa, M. Abdul Kadhar and K. Dastagir  were eager to participate without an iota of hesitation. M. Abdul Kadhar, an auto driver, says, Its a privilege for us to participate with our friends in this festival. It may sound cliched but God is one for us. Even they participate in our festivals. We will continue to do this in the coming years too.They used to offer Sambhar rice, curd rice and Sakkarai pongal. We will do it on April 12 this year when Theppam Thiruvizha (float festival). We close the stand and pitch in as much as we can. It costs us around Rs. 10,000 to do it but it doesnt matter. This is our humble contribution, says Mr. Narayanan.Their participation does not stop here  it extends to Sabarimala season too. During the irumudi kattu function at Marundeewarar temple, the four used to sit along with the rest, eat with them and give them a send off, says Saravanant, another driver. H. Mustafa who has been at the stand since 2004, says, Whats heartening is our immediate families too have been extremely supportive and havent raised any objections."

Besides, it stands exposed in the self-financing college issue and on its inability to resolve the administrative crisis brought about by skirmish among top officials. The State government has also done precious little to make available through PDS shops rice despite the Centre allocating its share, he said.Punish errant officialsMr. Satheesan dared the State government to either punish erring officials if it was convinced that senior officials other than the Vigilance Director were all corrupt or to exonerate them. The governments inaction has brought the movement of files to a halt, he alleged.The march will enter Ernakulam on February 14. KPCC president V.M.

At the event, tribal artistes wearing saffron scarves with the BJP lotus symbol performed in the presence of Rupani, who was the chief guest.Ger no melo, a celebration of the harvest season, saw performers, mostly from Rathwa tribes, wearing animal masks, painted faces or peacock feathers, dancing to the beatings of Ram Dhol (tribal percussion drum). Traditionally, the dancers paint their faces with dots and circles, with a paste of rice and ash.Four such dance groups, each comprising 10 to 15 members from nearby villages, entered the ground, singing. Some of them had the BJPs Adivasi Vikas Gaurav Yatra flag tied to the drum. The party had organised the yatra last month to reach out to 15 tribal districts.Devji Bhil, a member of the Hapeswar village dance troupe, said: Every panchayat has someone from the BJP. They manage and guide the dance teams. They often give us scarves. These are the ones they gave during a past rally which we have used here.One dance troupe from the Kadipani village came with the BJP flag and performed a tribal dance at the inaugural function.Parliamentary secretary and BJP MLA from Kawant, Jayanti Rathwa, said: Tribal people in this area use such scarves and flags to honour their leaders in the area. They feel proud of it. We often distribute them during BJP events and they tend to keep them. We dont have any political motive behind such events where people come purely to celebrate.Along with Rupani, minister for tourism and tribal development Ganpat Vasava, MP from Chhota Udepur Ramsinh Rathwa and forest and tribal development minister Shabdsharan Tadvi attended the inaugural function.Addressing the gathering, Rupani said, After UP elections, Indian politics has taken a new turn towards the politics for development rather than of cast, creed and religion and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has become the symbol of development in India. There was a crisis of character and lack of transparency in Indian politics, but Modi has created the transparent and honest image of the Indian politics after he took over the charge.Rupani added, This is Gandhis Gujarat.Sardar Patels Gujarat.Narendra Modis Gujarat and thats why we have implemented strict prohibition law.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Rajaguru, teacher and convenor of Heritage Club of SSAM Government Higher Secondary School, Thirupullani, and his student M. Abinaya inspecting an impalement stoneat a temple in Pallappacheri near Ramanathapuram.Photo: L. BalachandarWhen her family members were busy offering worship at a temple in Pallappacheri near Thiruppullani, 15-year-old M. Abinaya, a class IX student stood fascinated before a historical rarity  five kazhumarams (impalement stones) in a single temple.She developed a deep passion for archaeology at the young age and made repeated visits to the area to explore more about the stones, a method of execution practised during the Pandya period and later.The execution was cruel: Impaling a human in objects such as stake, pole, spear or sharp stones by complete or partial perforation of the torso. The punishment was meted out to those who rebelled against the kingdom or charged with treason, thieves and warriors.The warriors executed in this manner remained frozen in the poles and attained divinity, it was believed, and it eventually led to their being worshipped. They were also hailed as family deities, said V. Rajaguru, teacher and convenor of the Heritage Club in SSAM Government Higher Secondary School, Thiruppullani. It was he who guided Abinaya, a student of the school, in the exploration.In most of the temples in the area, the vagaries of weather took a toll on kazhumarams, made of iron or wooden poles, and were replaced by stones. Those at the Govindan temple at Pallappacheri have the portraits of five men  Therkathi Muniasamy, Govindan, Oorvalasamy, Karupanan and Nondi Karupanan. If the weapons in the inscriptions are anything to go by, they were warriors, says Abinaya.Almost all temples from Thiruppullani to Madurai via Kamudhi had kazhumarams. The Periya Puranam says that Jains were executed by this method in Madurai, but this has been disputed by archaeological experts, says Mr. Rajaguru. While worship of kazhumarams was widely prevalent in areas under the Pandya kingdom, the method of worship differed from place to place, he adds.Abinaya has conducted extensive studies at the 500-year-old Govindan temple. And she says that temple is the only one of its kind in the district to have five kazhumarams. Two vagayaras in the village took turns in offering worship in the Tamil month of Masi and Chithirai and goat sacrifice was part of the ceremony in Chithirai.The highlight of the worship was offer of rice mixed with goat blood to the deities, including Garuda, the legendary bird, in the early hours.As they make the offering, Garuda appears from nowhere and picks up the rice in a fraction of a second, she says, quoting the villagers.As her scholarly tryst with the kazhumarams comes to an end, she feels particularly grateful for the encouragement and assistance from her school headmistress M. Prema and Mr. Rajaguru."

In the first report dated January 12, 2017, the food safety officer of Gurgaon found batches of Mirinda to be unsafe as well as substandard. Asked about the action taken against the company, the officer stated in an RTI reply: Letter (has been) sent for permission for prosecution to commissioner of FDA (Food and Drug Administration of Haryana).

DH photoPresident Pranab Mukherjee on Friday called for setting up institutions of higher learning to hone youngsters skills to make India a global economic leader.""Every year, around 600 million youngsters in India enter the job market, but their employability is low. Hence, we need to hone their skills by training for which institutions are needed, Mukherjee observed after laying the foundation stone for Bengaluru Dr B R Ambedkar School of Economics (BASE) at a function at Vidhana Soudha.The President appreciated the Karnataka governments move to start a Skill University and said India needed to train 500 million youngsters. Nalanda, Takshashila and Vikramashila universities attracted scholars and students from across the world around 1,500 years ago.There is no dearth for talent in Indian students, but we need a bunch of teachers to identity youngsters and develop their personality, Mukherjee stated.The President expressed concern over the quality of students passing out of universities. ""There are over 760 universities, over 36,000 colleges, besides 114 central institutions in the country. Campus recruitment has been 100%, while we produce excellent engineers and managers. Many outgoing students seek jobs in America, Australia, England and New Zealand. Why haven't these institutions produced a single Nobel laurate? Mukherjee asked.Sir C V Raman was the last Indian scientist to bag the Nobel Prize in 1931. Har Gobind Khorana, Sir C V Raman and Chandrashekhar were all products of the Indian universities, he said. ``BASE should not be a localised institution, but an institution of international repute, he added.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said his government wanted to set up a higher learning school on the lines of London School of Economics. BASE will promote research and training in theoretical and applied economics, along with social sciences. It will mentor economists, who contribute to the country, keeping in view Dr B R Ambedkars ideals. The government has allocated Rs 150 crore for BASE and Rs 75 crore will be released in the next five years.Besides, it will get a recurring grant of Rs 10 crore every year, he said.I dont care for Anna Bhagyas criticsI am not an economist, I have presented 12 budgets. When I finalise the budget, I remember a poor man of my village going to his landlords house begging for rice for his sick daughter as she cannot digest ragi. Anna Bhagya scheme was born out of that vivid memory. English media is opposed to the scheme, but I don't care for such critics as they are ignorant about hunger. We want Karnataka to be a hunger-free state, Siddaramaiah said."

It also goes against the principles of democracy and federalism, he said.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan Tuesday said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has refused meet an all party delegation from the state which was supposed to apprise him about various issues. Making a statement in the state Assembly, he said the state had sought a meeting with the prime minister either on March 20 or 21 to submit a memorandum on various issues including cut in rice quota under PDS and seek financial aid to face the drought situation in the state. In response to the states request, the Prime Ministers Office has informed about the unavailability of PM for a meeting due to his busy schedule and wanted the state delegation to meet the Union Home Minister and Finance Minister for the purpose.Watch what else is making news:The PMO should have given the reply with the knowledge of prime minister and this attitude is highly condemnable, Vijayan said.It also goes against the principles of democracy and federalism, he said. The PMO did not suggest another date and instead it wanted the state delegation to meet the home minister or the finance minister, the chief minister said.We do not understand the logic behind this, Vijayan said. Echoing similar sentiments, Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Modis refusal meet an all-party delegation is an insult to the people of Kerala.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is behaving like a authoritarian, he said. Congress leader and former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy also criticised Modis attitude and said the PMO should have suggested a convenient date for a meeting instead of refusing. However, the lone BJP member in the House O Rajagopal objected to the statements of both the CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF.The statements made by both leaders amounted to politicising the issue. The interpretation given to the PMOs reply is not correct. Prime Minister is a busy personality. The state, instead of suggesting date, should have sought a convenient date from the PMO, Rajagopal said.The statement of LDF and UDF leaders is part of their continuing process of insulting the PM, he added. Later, Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said Modis attitude is shameful and against the spirit of federalism.

Rejecting the opposition charges, the CPI(M)-led government maintained that effective steps had been taken to control price rise.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAttacking Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman for the price rise, Congress-led UDF opposition said he had failed in tackling the situation and demanded his resignation. UDF wanted the issue to be discussed as an adjournment motion in view of the serious situation.But, after replies of the Food Minister and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan disallowed the motion, following which the UDF staged a walk-out.Earlier, replying to the notice for the motion, Thilothaman admitted that there was an increase of 20-21 per cent in the prices of various rice varieties. He attributed the drought situation prevailing in southern states and non-availability of rice from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh as the prime reason for it. Shortage of about two lakh tons of rice in the states quota from the Centre for Public Distribution System had also contributed to price rise in open market, he said.Rejecting the opposition charge of inaction, he said the government had allotted Rs 150 crore for the purpose of market intervention to supply rice and other essential commodities through outlets of state-run Civil Supplies Corporation. A trade deal to bring 1,000 tons of rice from Andra Pradesh had been finalised, he said.The Minister blamed a section of rice dealers in the state for deliberately creating an artificial price rise and said the government will deal with them firmly.The ruling and opposition benches blamed each other for the cut in the central rice quota to the state under the PDS with the implementation of National Food Security Act.LDF members blamed the previous UPA government at the Centre as responsible for the cut in rice quota and said the then UDF ministry in the state had failed to take any remedial measures to address this.Seeking to turn the tables, the opposition members argued that it was the inefficiency of the present state government that had resulted in the rice crisis and asserted there was no shortage of rice till they vacated office in May last year.Intervening, Vijayan said the state had already taken up the issue with the Centre. An all-party delegation would be meeting the Union ministers to exert pressure on the Centre to restore the state quota to 16.25 lakh tons from the present 14.25 lakh tons of food grains, he said.The state government has already requested the Centre to restore the rice quota at the subsidised rate, he said adding both the ruling and opposition parties should go together and take up the issue with the Central ministers.Extending full support to the government in this regard, former chief minister Oommen Chandy said the opposition was ready to cooperate with it in protecting the states rights. However, he blamed the LDF governments failure in market intervention to check the soaring prices of essential commodities.The Food and Civil Supplies ministry was a total failure and P Thilothaman who failed to check the price rise should resign. He is only making statements and not taking any constructive action to address the issue, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said. He also pointed out that it was the usual practise of the successive governments to intervene in the open market to check the price rise and unearth hoardings of food grains. But, this government so far had not moved in this direction, he charged.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Express photo The prisons department has 588 hectares of agricultural land under it across the state. Express photoPRISON agriculture in Maharashtra has gone beyond just a rehabilitation and reformation programme for prisoners. The prison agricultural production across 29 prisons in the state has grown leaps and bounds and stands at almost Rs 4 crore in 2016 as compared to Rs 2.54 crore two years ago. The profits from production has also increased by 15-20 per cent. Across the 588 hectares of agricultural land held by the prisons department, the last year saw new technologies, more suitable crops and implementation of schemes in coordination with government departments, the agriculture university and NGOs. Every year, over 800 prisoners are engaged in agricultural activities and avail remissions based on the number of days they work on a farm.Sanjay Phadtare, Technical Officer, Agriculture, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, Farming is the most sought-after activity among prisoners. It gives them remissions. Besides, they are not working within four walls. Remissions and exemptions are given to those that are serving life imprisonment and depending on the number of days he works in the field and his conduct, he will avail remissions. The more he works, the less days he spends in the jail.The prisoners receive wages anywhere between Rs 40 and Rs 55 per day. Last year, a total of Rs 83.29 lakh in wages were paid to prisoners engaged in farming, steep rise compared to previous years.B K Upadhyay, Additional DG and IG, Prisons (Maharashtra), said, We have about 800 hectares of land available, of which over 500 are agricultural land, 57 per cent of which is under irrigation and rest are rain-fed. While the farming programme was started as a rehabilitation activity, it has gained a lot of momentum with a variety of produces, plantation and allied activities being undertaken by us.From the traditional cereal cultivation like rice and wheat, most prisons have now started producing fenugreek, spinach, Rajgira, tomato, potato, onion, ginger and pumpkin.In Punes Yerawada jail, a large area is dedicated to banana tissue culture and mushroom production, besides citrus plantation in Morshi prison and even mulberry plantation in Visapur jail. Sandalwood plantation is also being undertaken in a few prisons including Yerawada and Nashik.Bamboo, mango, teak, jamun and been are also being planted in the available forest area. Also undertaken on a large scale are goat farming, poultry, horticulture, dairy and fisheries.From 2014-2016, we received a funding of about Rs 1.44 crore from the government and we have been using it to enhance technology and increase wages, said Phadtare.The department, apart from improving the quality of seeds and fertilisers, has invested in drip irrigation, over 20 tractors, farm equipment, electric motors and pumps, new crops and seed production, new irrigation methods and even organic farming such as vermi-compost and also biogas plants. A soil analysis was also undertaken with the help of fertilisers that resulted in enhanced production.Earlier, the rates of the produce from our farms were low. Now, we go by the APMC rates. Therefore, the produce gets proper rates. While some of the produce is consumed in jails, the rest is sold in the market. While we have supervisors within the prison, we get help and training from agricultural departments, nearby institutes and even local farmers to improve the skills of prisoners, added Phadtare.According to the department, more funds have been sought from the government. Currently, of the 55 jails, 29 have land for farming, most of which are open prisons. We are also planning to manufacture agricultural equipment also within the prison premises to make us more self-sufficient, added Upadhyay.radhika.ramaswamy@expressindia.comFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But why this tangy chutney of indignation at the innovation? The masala dosa, after all, is a many-splendoured thing, one of Indias most inventive dishes, always metamorphosing into delicious new forms.Unlike, say, rice and daal, the masala dosa comes cloaked in the glamour of a thousand rumours. One urban legend says the masala dosa wasnt created in cosy homesteads at all but actually dished up in Udupi restaurants, where clever cooks used spare potato bhaji, folding this in a light, crisp, savoury crepe. This masala dosa was a huge hit; but it didnt stop at one chewy avataar. Constantly innovating, the masala dosa features in hundreds of variants, localising, specialising and targeting individual customers well before multinationals learnt how to spell idli; versions include the paneer dosa, khakhra dosa, cheese spread dosa, even mutton-fry masala dosas. There are ragi and oat dosas for health nuts  and there are pizza dosas for those who prefer taste over waist.Why be mealy-mouthed over meals evolving anyway? Modern gastronomy means mixing, blending, breaking rules and combining cuisines, dishing up a brave new world of food, from bacon ice-cream to vegetarian chicken, foie gras falafel to charcoal chocolate. The West may be loving fusion cooking now but India has been a master-chef at this for decades. Remember, we invented the dhokla pizza, tandoori momo, paneer enchilada, masala omlette sushi and that most brilliant of culinary creations, which even slides cheekily past a stony Great Wall  gobi Manchurian.

Reuters file photoChief Minister Siddaramaiah has not tinkered much with commercial taxes that include VAT, entry, entertainment and luxury taxes in anticipation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime which is likely to come into effect from July 1.In his budget proposals for the financial year 2017-18, Siddaramaiah, who holds the finance portfolio, said Karnataka has been at the forefront in supporting early introduction of GST.Levies like VAT, entry, entertainment and luxury taxes will be subsumed under GST and states will have a limited role in changing the rates.It is for sure that GST is going to come. There is no point in the state tinkering with the tax rates at this stage. Hence, no new taxes have been levied, pointed out B T Manohar, the chairman of the taxation committee of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI).With Siddaramaiah not touching VAT, prices of commodities will remain unchanged at least for the next four months. Ditto taxes on cinema tickets, horse racing and hotel rooms.However, the prices of coconut husk and millet flour will come down as Siddaramaiah has exempted these items from VAT.The VAT exemption on paddy, rice, wheat, pulses and products of rice and ragi has been continued. The 5.5% VAT levied on liquor and beer served in bars and restaurants has been withdrawn.Siddaramaiah has proposed to introduce a Karasamadhana scheme to waive 90% of penalty and interest on payment of full tax by May 31, 2017. He said the scheme will help trade and industry clear their pending tax liabilities and start with a clean slate in GST.He said the migration of existing taxpayers to GST is under way and taxpayers in the state have shown enthusiasm in migrating to GST.Siddaramaiah said demonetisation has hit tax collection, but the commercial taxes department will meet the revenue target of Rs 51,338 crore for the current financial year. The budget estimate for commercial taxes for 2017-18 has been fixed at Rs 55,000 crore."

But it appears this has not stopped him from announcing populist programmes aimed at wooing both rural masses and the urban poor. He, however, belied the hopes of farmers as well as opposition parties on their demand to waive farm loans.He has also not announced any major infrastructure project, especially for Bengaluru.In his last full-fledged budget before Karnataka goes to polls in 2018, the chief minister has made it a point to continue to please the Ahinda community (Kannada acronym for backward classes, Dalits and minorities), considered to be his major vote bank.The total subsidy burden on the government in this budget goes up by Rs 6,000 crore, which is about 33% more than the current financial year.Siddaramaiah appears to have taken a cue from various states to unveil populist schemes: Saviruchi canteens from the Amma canteens in Tamil Nadu, free water supply and waiver of power bills from Delhi and free LPG connections from the Centre which became a big hit in Uttar Pradesh. Besides, he has increased the quantum of rice under his pet Anna Bhagya scheme to 7 kg from 5 kg per beneficiary and decided to give milk to government school students on five days a week instead of three days. Siddaramaiah brought cheer among moviegoers by announcing a cap of Rs 200 on entry ticket to all multiplexes. The chief minister has also proposed making it mandatory for all cinemas to screen Kannada and regional language movies during prime time.The CM has tried to appease over six lakh state government employees by setting up the seventh pay commission. He has also tried to please employees in the private sector by proposing to increase their retirement age to 60 from 58.Siddaramaiah also announced the formation of 49 new taluks. Though he has not imposed any major taxes keeping the 2018 election in view, he has proposed hiking the additional excise duty on Indian Made Foreign Liquor. This will make liquor dearer.High-end two-wheelers will also cost more with the motor vehicle tax being hiked.The additional resource mobilisation due to these two levies is estimated to fetch the state exchequer Rs 1,060 crore. The chief minister has set a moderate revenue target in the coming financial year in anticipation of the implementation of Goods and Services Tax.No farm loan waiverFinancial constraints, including a shortfall in state resources by Rs 1,624 crore, is said to have restrained Siddaramaiah from announcing a farm loan waiver.In his effort to present a please-all budget, with a total outlay of Rs 1,86,561 crore, Siddaramaiah has brought down revenue surplus position to an alarming Rs 136 crore. This has, in turn, taken a toll on capital expenditure, which is crucial for infrastructure development. Namma canteens will be launched in each of the 198 wards of BBMP where breakfast (Rs 5), lunch and dinner (Rs 10) will be provided.The chief minister has allocated Rs 100 crore for this scheme. At the district level, Saviruchi mobile canteens will be set up through zilla stree shakti okkutas.Subsidy of Rs 1,600 for LPG connections to five lakh eligible poor families not selected under the Centres Ujjwala scheme, free water supply up to 10,000 litres per month for slum dwellers living in 20x30 sites and waiving their pending bills are some of the other sops on the anvil."

Farmers cannot wait to sell their crops in the wait of good price as they neither have heavy storage capacity nor enough money. Just a handful of big farmers can afford to wait for a good price to sell their crop.In the past six weeks, the rate of 1121 Basmati has been going for Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal and 1509 Basmati Rs 3,200-3,300 per quintal which is said to be one of the best prices in the recent past since the crop has met with poor fate in the past few years. This is one of the best prices since 2014, said rice sellers.We are getting Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal for 1121 Basamti rice as the rates of Basmati have gone up since March, said Vinod Gupta, a Fazilka-based commission agent and former president of Arhtiya Association where basmati has one of the biggest mandis. He said since March, the rates have gone up from Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,600-4,000 per quintal.He admitted that farmers could not sell it beyond Rs 2,000 and Rs 2300, which was almost half the current price of the crop per quintal after harvesting as they cannot hold the crop for long. Not only 1121, which is fetching around Rs 4,000 per quintal, but the 1509 variety, too, is getting a very good price between Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,300, said rice seller Sanjiv Anad from Mukerian, adding that the crop rates are decided by the rate in the international market and this time, it is fetching good price.We are growing basmati on 5 to 7 acres and after selling it, we have to make arrangements for the next crop with the income, said Jaswinder Singh, a farmer from Mukerian, adding that whatever price was available at the time of harvest, farmers have to do with that only as there is no minimum support price (MSP) for it like paddy crop.Farmers cannot hold the crop for long as they do not have the space to hold it and they have to sell it then and there only, said another farmer Ramanjit Singh, adding that traders and commission agents have huge space and godowns where they can hold the crop and wait for a good rate.Another farmer, HS Shergil, said the government should fix MSP for basamti so that farmers can also benefit. He added that only the big farmers can hold the crop for few months, not the small and medium ones.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

To further pollute the perennial river, omni and tourist bus crew clean the vehicles in the river without any restriction.The river has transformed Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi into major rice producers. But, domestic and industrial wastes are being dumped in the river for the past several decades with the knowledge of official machinery.Though various awareness programmes are conducted to highlight the need for conserving the Tamirabarani, no concrete measure has been taken. Even Tirunelveli Corporation is yet to commence the second phase of underground drainage project to save the river from being polluted by sewage as the State government is yet to release funds for the project.After poor South-west and North-east monsoons in the districts last year, water level in Papnasam, Manimuthar and Servalar dams, the prime reservoirs of Tirunelveli district, have insignificant quantity of water, which will be sufficient to meet drinking water needs only till April-end.The river has now become a narrow stream. And, domestic, commercial and industrial effluents and sewage have polluted the river further.To make things worse, private buses are being cleaned on its banks.On reaching Tirunelveli from far-off places like Chennai and Bangalore, the vehicles are taken very close the watercourse near the river bridge on North Bypass Road at Udaiyarpatti in the mornings and washed. The synthetic mats spread inside the buses are also being washed in the river water.A minimum of 15 buses are washed in the river every day. While a few of the bus crew wash the vehicle with water, many others use some cleaning agents or washing powders. The used foamy water, mixed with oil, enters the river, polluting it further, said a trader having a shop in the area.A Corporation official said the urban civic body, which adopted a resolution in the past to slap fine on those who dumped debris and waste in the river and irrigation channels, would give due attention to curb this menace.Well hold a meeting with officials of revenue and public works departments soon to discuss this issue, he said."

(Source: Reuters) Chelsea failed to strengthen their lead at the top of the Premier League after losing 2-0 to Manchester United at the Old Trafford on Sunday. (Source: Reuters)Jose Mourinhos tactical masterpiece has thrown the title rice for the Premier League wide open as Chelsea failed to strengthen their lead at the top after losing 2-0 to Manchester United at the Old Trafford on Sunday. While it was a happy easter Sunday for the Red Devils the same cannot be said about the Blues as for them it was a day when everything went wrong.Things started to go awry for Chelsea before kickoff as first choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was ruled out of the match with an injury he sustained during the ad-shoot for a promotional event for NBA. He was replaced by Asmir Begovic, who was lacking exposure and match practice. To add to their woes, Marcos Alonso was forced out of the match due to a virus.Although Chelsea began well after kickoff, it was a controversial handball decision that went against them and led to the first goal. Chelsea were on a strong counter-attack when Ander Herrera used his left hand to stop Nemanja Matics pass. However, referee Bobby Madley let the play go on which led to the build up of the opening goal. Marcus Rashford made full use of the opportunity to run behind David Luis and strike the first goal of the match past Begovic.Leaders Chelsea lost the momentum after the first goal was scored within ten minutes into the game and kept giving possession to their rivals. Herrera then made it 2-0 in early second half with an effective strike which did a see a delfection. After that it was the Red Devils domination all along, despite missing their key player Zlatan Ibrahimovic.Noticeably, goalkeeper David De Gea had zero shots to save as Chelsea failed to produce 0 shots on target. Their shots accuracy was 0% which just goes on to show how weak and out of place they were against their former managers club.Chelseas loss on Sunday loss has brought the title race alive with second placed Tottenham trailing them by only four points.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5903f87e7be9e02646bda3fa,Perils of mosaranna obsession,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594473/perils-mosaranna-obsession.html,2017-02-02,"By D V Guruprasad, Feb 3, 2017 0:09 ISTWhen I said I needed white rice and curd, Mrs Gupta said that they didn't have 'dahi.'True to my South Indian upbringing, no meal of mine would be complete without the mandatory mosaranna or curd rice. However, I had not imagined that this habit of mine might land me in trouble some day.Once, my colleague Gupta called me for dinner at his home. After serving me sumptuous food, he announced that dessert would be served in the drawing room. My meal is not complete! I exclaimed, at which he asked me if I needed more rotis or biryani. When I said I needed white rice and curd, Mrs Gupta turned red and said that they didnt have dahi at home. I gave a sheepish smile and left the table.From that day on, I would request my hosts to keep some curd for me whenever I was invited for a meal. My love for curd rice became so well known that whenever I went for inspection as a Senior Police Officer even to the remotest village, my subordinates would make extra efforts to please me.However, when I had to travel outside India, I faced difficulties. When I went to Brussels to visit my son, he said I could buy curd in any departmental store but I must ask for yogurt. I went to a store and the sales girl smilingly gave me a few packs. Triumphant, I came back home and sat for a meal with white rice and pickles. I poured the contents of a tub on the rice and as soon as I put a morsel in my mouth, I grimaced. The curd was sweet and had fruit pieces. My son, who had a hearty laugh, told me that I had to ask for natural yogurt specifically.Having learnt my lesson, my subsequent trips to Europe and US were quite comfortable. But my trip to a remote African country posed a problem. I was told that there is no chance of getting natural yogurt there and I was worried. My secretary suggested that I could buy tubs of probiotic curd in Bengaluru and carry them with me. I bought half a dozen tubs and packed them in my cabin baggage. I didnt face any problems at our airports.After landing at my destination, I confidently moved towards the customs green channel. Suddenly, an officer accosted me and asked me to go with him to a room. He made me open my suitcases and did not find anything. I was getting nervous as I had heard about the strict security rules there. When he asked me to open my handbag, I gave i to him and asked him to open it himself.He slowly opened the zipper and a popping sound, like a bullet from a silenced pistol, emanated. He peeped in to find the source of the sound. When he lifted his face, I could not control my laughter. His face had turned white! Two of the yogurt tubs had popped open because of the change in pressure and its contents had spurted out. Wiping his face, the officer shooed me out of the airport. From that day on, I have learnt to live without mosaranna."

I was a 15-year-old newly married girl then. I had come to live in my in-laws place in Bangalore and was continuing my college education.My mother-in-law used to do all the cooking herself and would not allow me even to help her, as she wanted me to do well in my studies. I had never cooked at my mothers place, too, but through sheer observation, I had a faint idea of how everything could be done. However, observation is different from hands-on experimentation, and I had little chance to do even that.But one day, the opportunity finally presented itself. My mother-in-law wanted to go to Mysore to attend her nieces marriage. I volunteered to stay back and look after the house and the kitchen in her absence. I told her not to worry and that it was a chance for me to try out some new dishes on my own.The next day, two elderly guests  who were friends of my father-in-law  arrived without notice. It was an Ekadashi day when some people fast but eat frugal food such as soji upma instead of rice to sustain themselves for the day. The two gentlemen told me that they observed Ekadashi. I immediately swung into action and prepared vegetable upma with half a kilo of soji. With no former experience, the end product was a slightly watery upma.I felt sad to cater this to the guests. So I prepared another half a kilo of upma with rava and vegetables, but I was careful this time to use less water. This second batch turned out well. I wanted to earn a good name from the guests and, therefore, kept the watery upma out of sight to ourselves. I served the good upma to the guests when they were ready. They two men finished it all and wanted more. What could I do but serve them the watery upma?But the guests were all praise for me and downed my entire preparation with curd and sweets. They burped, too  an Indian way of showing satisfaction over food! I was relieved. Suppose I had not prepared the upma the second time, what would I have done when they asked for more? There would have been a shortage, and that was unacceptable.After lunch, as the guests took a siesta, I cleaned the table and sat down reminiscing what I had done. I laughed to myself. I was really amazed at their observance of Ekadashi which had turned out to be not a fasting day but a feasting day!"

(Chinatopix via AP)American-born giant panda Bao Bao made her first appearance Friday before the public in southwestern China following her move there from Washington, DC Bao Bao was born at the National Zoo in Washington to pandas on loan from China. Under the standard loan agreement, such panda cubs must be returned to China before they are 4 years old, the earliest age at which they might begin breeding.The 3-year-old Bao Bao explored her spacious new enclosure at the panda breeding base in the city of Dujiangyan, which features both indoor and outdoor play areas. Keepers have been helping her adapt to local bamboo and Chinese steamed bread made from corn, soybeans, rice and eggs. She is the 11th panda to be born overseas and returned to China.Bao Bao, whose name means precious or treasure, underwent a monthlong quarantine at the Dujiangyan base, where keepers monitored her activities and health by checking her blood and feces. Because she does not understand commands in Chinese, she is being looked after for a time by an English-speaking keeper.Giant pandas, Chinas unofficial national mascot, live mainly in the mountains of Sichuan, with some also found in neighboring Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. They have long been considered one of the worlds most endangered animals, with an estimated 1,864 living in the wild and 200 in captivity.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"
590466837be9e04154df6503,Punjab election questionnaire: Letâs claim our environmental rights,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keep-india-beautiful/punjab-election-questionnaire-lets-claim-our-environmental-rights/,2017-01-15,"History of apathy of major political parties towards environment:In the past as India steadily faced environmental deterioration, ecological decline and depleting water reserves; the countrys main political parties campaigning for elections have all but ignored environmental issues which were utmost crucial to whole of Indias population and this omission has resulted in so many alarming problems which now India faces. We Reap What We Sow. In 2014, World Health Organization confirmed that Indias capital, New Delhi, has the most polluted air in the world, according to data reported by 1,600 cities in 91 countries.Also India being one of the most polluted country in the world with half of worlds 20 most polluted cities in India. The World Bank estimates that environmental degradation costs India 5.7 percent of its annual gross domestic product, and causes a quarter of the countrys 1.6 million deaths among children each year.Past trend has been that main national political parties competing in the elections have published manifestos that touch on the environment, but say little about major problems such as worsening pollution or projections that the country will have only half the water supply it needs by 2030 or how lack of Waste Management mechanism and adequate landfills is turning cities and villages into garbage dump yards.Lets all get united and ask for our environmental rights:Punjab Legislative Assembly Elections are going to be held on March 4, 2017 and all the major political parties have started coming up with their election manifestos, covering all the populist measures under the sun to make it look like all rosy pertaining to the needs of the common man.The population of Punjab was 2.77 crores as per Census of India, 2011 with population density of 550 km2 (highest in Ludhiana, followed by Amritsar), 2.98 crores (Census 2012) and it is estimated to touch 3 crores in 2017. Thus, as the population increases, urbanization and industrialization will increase and take its toll on the already burdened ecology and environment.Thus we, at KIB, on behalf of people of Punjab and India on the whole, have come up with a Questionnaire addressed to each major political party contesting Punjab 2017 Assembly Elections (With copies marked to President of India, Central and State Election Commission, PMO) to understand how they intend to solve below mentioned environmental issues in Punjab if they get elected to power:Please tick the options (Yes or No) and/or answer in complete sentences.1. Although Punjab is known as the Land of Five Rivers, there are locations where water is scarce and women have to fetch clean water from as far as 3 Kms. In the Malwa belt of Punjab, the water table is low; the water is brackish and contaminated with pesticides.Even the districts of Moga, Muktsar, Sangrur, Bhatinda, Ferozepur, Faridkot have been facing similar issues and Abohar, Talwandi Sabo, Pathankot, Fazilka, Malout, Muktsar, Hoshiarpur, Mudki, Malsingh wala, Buladewala, Shekhu, Bagha, Garhshankar are the worst-affected areas.Though, RO plants were set up in some of the villages, the villagers were charged Rs. 60 per month. Thus, unable to pay for water, poor villagers continued to drink water contaminated with uranium, radium, thorium etc. with the result that this region is badly hit by cancer. On the other hand, technologists insist that RO technology is not good for purification of this kind of water.Are there any plans to augment and/or improve clean water resources in the above-mentioned districts/locations of the state?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do it?________________________________________________________________________2. Waste Segregation & Management is of utmost importance since improperly stored waste causes enormous health, safety and economic problems. We simply cannot bury or burn our waste in dump yards as it causes pollution (air, water, soil, land) and precious resources depletion. The major issue being segregated waste collection from homes as per Punjab Model MSW Plan  2014 followed by their proper disposal.Does your party plan to work on this across Punjab and by when this would get implemented?Yes | NoIf yes, how does your party plan to implement the same if given a chance to govern the State?________________________________________________________________________3. Municipal Solid Waste generation in Punjab is 4300 MT per day (Source: PPCB, 2015). By 2031, the waste generated is expected to rise to approximately 5000 MT per day (Source: TERI, 2015). Almost all the MSW in the state is disposed in unscientific disposal facilities.Two Solid Waste Management (SWM) plants are fully functional in the state, one Municipal Solid Waste treatment plant at Village Waryana, Kapurthala Road, Jalandhar and other at village Pandori Mehtama, Sham Churrasi, Distt. Hoshiarpur. Under Punjab Model MSW Plan  2014, State has been divided into 8 clusters for SWM facilities (collection, transportation, segregation, processing) of which only 4 clusters (Mohali, Bhatinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar) have got environmental clearances for selected Engineered Sanitary Landfill Land.Given the amount of waste generated and current status, by when all the Landfills in 8 clusters would get operational? Would these be sufficient to handle all the garbage generation?Yes | NoIf yes/no, what is your partys agenda on this?________________________________________________________________________4. E-waste generation in Punjab was 11788 tons in 2012 and would rise to 18216 tons by 2021 as per a recent study by ENVIS Centre, Punjab. PPCB has 14 authorised collection centers, 1 producer and 1 dismantler to take care of E-waste.Do you think that it should suffice given the demography, population of state and the amount of e-waste generated? How do you plan to collect e-waste from households?________________________________________________________________________5. Recently, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) and Volunteers raised a temporary barrage on the Kala Sanghian drain in Jalandhar to divert the sewage flow towards a sewage treatment plant in Basti Peer Daad.Since it was built in a tizzy, the residents have complained that the polluted water is flowing into the Chitti Bein drain (tributary of Sutlej river) and found the water to be contaminated with heavy metals. The recently built STP (processing capacity of 50 millions litres daily) in Basti Peer Daad (Jalandhar) has been designed to cater the needs till 2025; however it is unable to meet even the present day requirements.If raised to power, how do you plan to check these grave issues since most of the rivers are getting polluted beyond remediation?________________________________________________________________________6. Air pollution is a huge issue of concern in India including Punjab at present. Various reasons for this worsening situation are  huge number of vehicles, construction activities, fuel adulteration, agricultural fires etc.Do you have any plan to control air pollution in different ways?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do that?________________________________________________________________________7. Industrial city of Khanna is among the worlds 20 most polluted cities. Though the officials claim a reduction in the air pollution levels, the particulate levels PM10 always seem to be beyond the standards of 100g/m3. The residents complaining of respiratory illness has been rising steeply. This proves that the authorities do not take actions against industries, which are polluting the atmosphere.How do you plan to monitor this and take action against the violating industries?________________________________________________________________________8. Agricultural fires are deliberate in Punjab as farmers have this perception that it results in removal of pests and convert crop residues from previous seasons harvest into fertilizing ash. Punjab burnt 80% of its rice residue in 2012.This is a major source of air and soil pollution. Since particulate matter and smoke travel long distances, it becomes one of the major sources of air pollution in neighboring states of Haryana and Delhi also during winters.Despite several Court Orders banning stubble burning and instituting fines for violators, not much action has been taken for strict enforcement. In 2015 and 2016 only 16 and 8 prosecutions were made respectively against violators. Public awareness and educating the farmers about the ill effects of the above mentioned problem seems to be the best solution in sight but they also have to be provided with alternative environment friendly technologies to manage crop residue.Does your party intend to tackle this problem?Yes | NoIf yes, what actions are you planning to tackle this pressing issue?________________________________________________________________________9. The heart of Punjabs industries is in Ludhiana followed by Jalandhar. Textile, manufacturing, leather, rubber and sports goods constitutes major share of industries there. Smaller industries do not follow prescribed rules for effluent disposal and polluting the rivers with dumping of their effluent wastes.Does your party intend to work on this issue?Yes | NoIf yes, how do you plan to do this?________________________________________________________________________10. According to Punjabs Water Supply and Sanitation Ministry, 75% of rural population has access to public toilets while rest of the population will have the same by October 2017. However still a large segment of rural population do not use public toilets and in many cases have demolished them.What plans you have to spread awareness against open defecation and by when Punjab can be declared an open defecation free state?________________________________________________________________________11. The safai karamcharis in the State work in pathetic conditions with no protective gear and no insurance cover for their health.Would your party work for their betterment if given a chance to govern the state?Yes | No________________________________________________________________________12. National Green Tribunal (NGT) has announced a fine of 10,000/- per default for people who litter in public places/ roads in Delhi. NGT has also ordered to slap fines on vegetable vendors and slaughterhouses that throw wastes in public places.Are you planning to take similar initiatives on this front?Yes | NoIf yes, what would be the key steps/initiatives?________________________________________________________________________13. How do you plan to spread awareness among the masses regarding environmental, sanitation and cleanliness issues?________________________________________________________________________How do you plan to educate people in rural areas?________________________________________________________________________How do you plan to educate housewives regarding waste disposal?________________________________________________________________________14. Four-laning of Jalandhar-Barnala highway proposal to boost Punjab-Haryana road connectivity has seeked to clear 160 hectares of forest area which includes felling of 22,700 trees. It is also proposed that the forest department would plant more than 10 times the number of uprooted trees and Public Works Department would bear the cost of the felled trees.Do you think new plantation of trees would be strictly enforced?Yes| NoWhat is the status of the project now and how would you ensure new plantation of Trees as is proposed?________________________________________________________________________15. Major wetlands in Punjab are Harike, Kanjli, Ropar and Nangal. These wetlands are inhabited by diversity of flora and fauna including some rare and threatened plants and animals..The major threats looming on these wetlands include the following: Severe problems of siltation in the reservoir leading to shrinkage of wetland area. The disturbance to the resident and migratory birds, illegal fishing and poaching of wildlife. Accidental outflows of pollutants from industries located in the vicinity affects water quality of wetlands. Inflow of pesticides and fertilizers as run off from agricultural fields and sewage from towns also affects water quality of wetlands. Invasion and growth of weeds in the wetland area is also a cause of concern. Lack of cooperation from people due to their ignorance about wetland values and functions.How do you plan to conserve these wetlands if votes to power?________________________________________________________________________Credit: Thanks to Neha Agarwal for special inputs.

590466c87be9e04154df656b,"White witches of food â Sugar, salt & rice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/white-witches-of-food-sugar-salt-rice/,2017-01-31,"The main concerns that trouble most of us are diabetes, hypertension and obesity or excess weight. Most often the evils that are blamed for these are the 3 white witches of food: sugar, salt and rice.Everything that is tasty has either sugar, salt or riceSo what happens to those tea parties or coffee meetings if we become sugarless and saltless? How do we enjoy our Indian festivities without the biryani and rice kheer up North and the Pongal and Payasam in the South? Wouldnt it be perfect to wave the magic wand at these three white witches and make them disappear from your diet and get the bliss you are looking for? Well, extremity is never the solution. The fact remains that though these are the major contributing factors to the above health problems, they are equally necessary for proper functioning of our bodies.SugarsI think I have managed to raise quite a few eyebrows here. But before you run to the nearest mithaiwala to get those mouthwatering gulab-jamuns, or to devour the death by chocolate at a confectionary, let me stop you. It is important to understand what kind of sugars are considered good and which ones are to be marked off your list.Sugars are basically carbs and are also the major source of energy. Carbohydrates are made up of sugar molecules either simple or complex, which are decisive on their absorption into the bloodstream. In other words, refined sugar, honey, jaggery, sucrose, glucose are the simple sugars. Packaged foods with fat free or low cholesterol labels often have camouflaged names such as fructose corn syrup, maltose, dextrose, raw sugar, cane sugar, malt extract and molasses but they are also simple sugars, which are absorbed quickly, causing a sugar rush. Meanwhile, sugars found in foods such as nuts, legumes, whole fruits, sweet potatoes, oats, have a slow and steady absorption into the blood. They are an excellent source of energy. They are beneficial in comparison to the simple sugars as they get converted to glycogen to be used as energy reserve for the body. The fiber is used for optimal digestion and the body also absorbs other vitamins and minerals making them a better option. They are required for the proper functioning of your body on an everyday basis.Both are sugars but all of these add up to the amount of sugar consumed by us on an everyday basis. It is the constant spike in levels of sugar in your blood that eventually causes diabetes to set in. So choose your sugars.SaltSalt enhances the taste of everything, undoubtedly. Practically all snacks have a generous amount of salt in them. All sauces have a high level of sodium content too. However, notice a difference when we eat freshly prepared food over packaged, food (or even food meant for storage). We will not need excess salt in freshly prepared food. It is an enhancer, a retainer, a modifier. Unlike sugar, it can never be consumed on its own, yet without it nothing will taste perfect. The phrase, pinch of salt has been rightly coined, because thats all we really need. Everything else is excess. Salt has one of the most important minerals. Sodium, which aids in nerve transmission, controls muscle dysfunction, retains water and electrolytes. In iodized salts, which is what we normally pick off the shelf, there is Iodine, which is vital for proper thyroid functioning. Both of these are very important for regular functioning of our bodies.RiceRice gives a feeling of immediate satiation and is directly linked with obesity. However, rice unlike its counterpart wheat is gluten free. Its consumption does not give allergies or gastric problems and is easily digestible. The main benefit of rice is the instant carbohydrate that it provides. It is instant fuel for your body. It doesnt disturb the gut bacteria and soothes gut flora incase of any intestinal issues. It is also a mood enhancer since it allows greater absorption of amino acids into the brain, which in turn gives us the feel-good hormone serotonin. If we eat enough fiber and protein with rice, it is the most wholesome meal that one could have. Rice is also good for weight watchers as a small amount can make one feel fuller faster as rice tends to expand in the stomach absorbing water whereas wheat (chapatti/bread) takes a longer time to digest and hence the signal of satiation can reach the brain much later.Hence, before we start the witch hunt, lets pause to think and actually eliminate the real causes of diabetes, hypertension and obesity which are overeating, stress and complacency or lack of exercise. If we endeavor to live an active life, eat our meals in limited quantities and at the right time, we can enjoy all our festive sweets and savoury. Happy eating."

The protests, which were catalysed by improbable groups using social media for mobilisation, defies categorisation. But it does show there is deep-seated public resentment against the states prevailing political culture.In this backdrop, VK Sasikalas ascent to the chief ministers office is incongruous. The events which led to her election as legislature party leader of AIADMK represent a political culture which runs counter to what protesters seemed to want. Unsurprisingly, it led to a flurry of unflattering jokes on social media. Sasikala, who has never won an election, will take over the administration when both the state and she face significant challenges.The disproportionate assets case is likely to resurface this month as a division bench of the Supreme Court is expected to pronounce a verdict soon. The events which led to the case remain in public memory and they will make it difficult for Sasikala to quickly earn wide public support.Beyond the personal challenge, as chief minister she has to lead a state that faces social and economic problems. Tamil Nadu is in the grip of a terrible drought and some speeches at the jallikattu protests reflected the attendant anguish. This is not a one-off issue as recent weather patterns and water scarcity have made farming a highly risky venture. In 2012-13, agricultural output in Tamil Nadu contracted by a little more than 10% on account of water scarcity.Both AIADMK under Jayalalithaa and DMK have used enhanced welfare spending to blunt the edge of erratic weather patterns on the agrarian economy and job insecurity in urban areas. Sasikala will presumably do the same but will face tougher challenges compared to her predecessors. Tamil Nadu has a problem with its tax collections even if it does not have a debt problem like Punjab.On some crucial indicators such as the ratio of interest paid on debt to the annual revenue, it does fairly well. But going ahead the space to manoeuvre is shrinking just when social problems have begun to show up. O Panneerselvam, in his role last year as finance minister, complained that growth in commercial taxes was low. The problem isnt new and there dont seem to be cogent ideas to deal with it. Sasikala, as a CM without experience at this time, presages a long and frustrating summer for the people.She represents a phase of Tamil Nadus political trajectory which saw institutions being hollowed out alongside harsh suppression of dissent. It may have worked for a while as this phase was also accompanied by an expansion of welfare architecture, best represented by free rice distributed through PDS. But the environment is far more challenging now and the next chief ministers stock response for everything has been Amma.Neither Jayalalithaa nor M Karunanidhi had a response for the social fault lines which crisscross rural Tamil Nadu. The state has an unfortunate reputation for honour killings, particularly on the heels of inter-caste marriages. The Dravidian parties have sidestepped the issue as their politics has increasingly become devoid of substance. It is difficult to see how the person set to become CM of Tamil Nadu is going to deal with the issue. It is not just an issue of local caste conflicts. The problem also comes from caste-based political mobilisation which tries to frame economic challenges as identity issues. An inevitable fallout is friction, which sometimes takes violent forms.Not only has Sasikala plenty of internal problems to confront, there are also inter-state issues. All through the tortuous negotiations to bring about GST, Tamil Nadu has been a reluctant participant. Neither AIADMK nor DMK have been comfortable with it. But with GST almost through, the state needs its leadership to protect its interests. Also, the Cauvery issue will resurface soon enough and needs deft handling. It is anybodys guess if Sasikala will have the inclination to network and thereby secure a good deal for the state.Given the magnitude of challenges Tamil Nadu faces now, Sasikalas ascent represents inability of the political culture to adapt to change. This may not be the best of times for Tamil Nadu."

Lalit Kala Akademis new administrator the distinguished artist and critic Krishna Setty inaugurated the show and stressed on the importance of having a camp such as this which puts the spotlight on Indias traditional metal-smith tribes .  They must hold on to tradition and create works that will stand on their own in the contemporary world, said Krishna Setty .History suggests that they are known as Dhokra Damar and used to carve on wax to make Bell Metal sculptures. This nomadic tribe went from village to village welding old utensils and selling their lost-wax brass figurines.Here at the Garhi studios the scene of the red dense wax is riveting. Contemporary sculptor Arun Pandit (Tirupati Airport Garuda fame), explains that the lost wax method of casting a sculpture was first practiced during Indus Valley around 2500 BC. The Shilpshastra provides details of metal working with alloys for daily use items, sacred artworks and architectural products. Interestingly while a lot of metal work largely derives its inspiration from religion the images here are an array of intricate horses, human figures a mother and child and the Madiya tribes with their bison horned head dress. There are heads with simple busts, and seated figures.Most intricate is a small urn like pot with a spout and decorated leaf like structure.The textural threading is what fascinates as well as the little cylindrical rods that they press and mould with their fingers to create the many compositions.Around them are a collection of clay and rice husk,when asked one of them says that it gives strength to the clay to make the core for the figures strong. Once dry, a broad bean leaf is rubbed on the surface of the model for smoothness. You can see them coiling the ,wax strands upon the core to add necessary details through carving on wax. The wax is soft and easily malleable material . They say that they use a mixture of bees wax, resins from the tree Damara Orientallis and nut oil to make the soft dough. This mixture is passed through sieves to attain homogenous thickness and then rolled into long strands. A number of contemporary art students from Jamia Milia Faculty of Sculpture have also come to create their own works of art and watch the process.The ambience is one of concentrated silence everyone is lost in the beauty of creation. If an image has to be made, it must be made of wax first says the Vishnusamhita,written in 5th century AD. With clouds of smoke emanating from earthen lamps, amid battered clay fragments and wax coils the casting and the final product is what entices and enchants.5 days later the works are cast and the moulds broken everything is soot laden. There is something distinct in the images-they hold strong animist religious beliefs . The 50 odd sculptures look like a host of myriad moorings.Subjects include Hindu and tribal gods and goddesses, figures of people or deities riding elephants, musicians, horses , birds and symbols of ancestor worship. Bal Mukund Nags warrior on the horse is a magnificent creature with detailed characteristics. Ravinder Nags Mother and Child is a treat for tired eyes. The warrior on the horse is one amongst many who are revered-and referred to as the spirit deity. The mother and child is intriguing for the posture and the poise interconnected and deeply evocative it has about it a universal appeal.The tribal artists are the picture of humility,they have spent the week working and creating.There is an uncanny melancholy in their faces and expressions,an unconscious emotion of angst as they sit together in deep thought. But their creations talk to us about a world that is filled with the richness of intensity and deep reverence. Of course it is imperative to extend the dialect of dokhra with technical bravura for the upkeep of their livelihood.The Lalit Kala Akademi does yoemans service in bringing together a group such as this,how happy Mahashweta Devi would have been to see their creations."
590468007be9e04154df6796,Surging cost of energy prices is slowly emerging as a cause for concern,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/surging-cost-of-energy-prices-is-slowly-emerging-as-a-cause-for-concern/,2017-01-16,"The marginal perk up in wholesale prices from 3.2% in November to 3.4% in December was unexpected as it reversed a steady three month fall in wholesale inflation since September. This is rather surprising because wholesale food prices has even fallen by a marginal 0.7% in December for the first time in almost 16 months. But this obviously did not have much of an impact as food prices account for a bare 15% of the wholesale price index which is substantially lower than its share in the consumer price index where it accounts for more than half the total weight.The price scenario on the food front seems quite comfortable. Prices of most commodities like vegetable and fruits are either stagnant or even falling sharply. High value foods like milks, eggs, meat and fish are now hovering in the 2-4% range. The trends on the cereals front is however a little uncomfortable.Though prices of rice continue to soften after a good khariff harvest that of wheat has gone up in double digits for the second consecutive month with the pickup even accelerating to 12.8% in the most recent month. This indicates that recent opening up of wheat imports has not helped matters and that the government would have to evoke more even stringent measures to ensure that the surge in wheat prices does not unduly have an impact on the electoral prospects of the ruling party.But the real reason for the perk up of the WPI in the most recent months is the sharp jump in energy prices especially fuel and power. This is a major reason for worry as recent trends show that not only has the fall in energy prices for almost two years been reversed but prices have even started picking up again. In fact the trends are ominous with price increases of fuel and power accelerating from 1.6% to 8.7% over the last five months. This can have a cost push impact on the price levels in many sectors across the economy.However, a positive sign is the slow pick up in price increases in manufacturing that indicates demand has been picking up in the segment enabling them to have better pricing power. This is a sharp turnaround from the earlier scenario when manufacturing good prices have fallen for almost a year up to February 2016. Though the trends has been reversed for the last ten months it is only now the price levels in manufacturing has slowly perked up to 3.7%.But this apparent revival in sentiments is restricted to a few industries. One of the biggest gainers in the recent period has been food products followed by beverages and tobacco and basic metal and metal products. Price levels in most other industries are edging up at a much slower pace indicating that the demand slump persists in large segments of manufacturing. Especially telling is the fact the price increases of machinery and machine tools are still stuck at less than half a percentage point indicating that investment demand is still stagnating at very low levels."
590468507be9e04154df6824,Eerie tax policies not only discriminate widely across industries but also handicap important sectors,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/eerie-tax-policies-not-only-discriminate-widely-across-industries-but-also-handicap-important-sectors/,2017-02-02,"Prime Minister Narendra Modis much touted make in India initiative hopes to make India a major manufacturing hub to supplement or even replace China as the new global supplier of goods and services. However, complex Indias tax structure is not only subjective and indiscriminate but they place a larger burden on important industries even while letting other get away with much lower rates and costing the exchequer a tidy sum.Some of this is highlighted in the budget papers presented to parliament yesterday. Numbers estimated from a sample of 5,97,884 companies show that effective tax rates was lowest in industries like sugar, which has a powerful political lobby backing it, which paid only a nominal 19.3%. But then other agro based industries paid a much higher 26.3% tax rate. In fact tax rate varied widely for different food industries. It varied from a low of 22.8% in tea and coffee to 23.5% in vanaspati and edible oils, 31.7% for flour and rice mills and 32.2% for other food processing units.This is not something unique. For instance in the health sector the drugs and pharmaceutical companies had a low tax incidence of 24.2%. However the taxes were much higher in other segments. Thus medical professionals segment paid 30.3%, specialty hospitals paid a higher 31.4% and nursing homes a very high 32.1%.The effective tax rates in the financial sector are equally disparate. While chartered accountants firms paid 30.2%, chit funds and foreign exchange dealers paid a little higher 31.3% and 31.9% respectively. However while leasing companies, money lender and share brokers companies were at an advantage paying an effective tax rate of 21.6%, 24.6% and 25.1% respectively non-banking finance companies had to pay a higher 29.3%. Rates were still higher for financial service providers (30%), and financial institutions (37.9%). But what takes the cake is the highest 40.3% levied on banking companies which is supposed to provide the backbone of the financial sector in the country.Equally bizarre are the grouping of the highest taxed sectors. At the top along with banking companies are the courier agencies who pay the highest effective rate of 41.7%. The mix of the other high paying sectors are equally weird. They include electronics which pay a high 35.5%, despite the moves made to incentive domestic production, and also forest contractors (37.6%) and security agencies (38.9%).While the much touted but stunted electronics and computer hardware industry pay a high 35.5% effective tax rate the much flaunted and widely successful software development agencies pay a much lower 24.5%. BPO service providers also pay a lower 29.4%. Similarly rates on computer training and coaching institutes are also a lower 31.7%.This strange tax policy regime is the outcome of various tax concession and incentives provided to different industries and special regions where the effective tax rates are minimal. However the government efforts to remove such anomalies and bring down effective tax rates to 25% has not gained much traction. This is a big burden too as the corporate tax incentives is estimated to have cost the central exchequer a massive Rs 83,492 crore in 2016-17."
590471017be9e04154df6c93,Nothing rogue about this Khmer cuisine!,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/nothing-rogue-about-this-khmer-cuisine/,2017-03-06,"The setting is surreal. Deep in the heart of the Cambodian jungle at a temple called Banteay Samre, we are sitting for dinner against a backdrop of lush canopy and temple silhouettes. Thousands of diyas and fairy lights illuminate the pathways and doorways, throwing into relief beautiful sculptures adorning the temple walls. The mood is serene and the ambiance gentle as we feast on delicacies from the Land of Khmer Kampuchea under an expansive night sky dotted with millions of stars.The H and I are in Cambodia to celebrate the wedding anniversary of one of our friends and this dinner, set amidst historic ruins, is the highlight of the celebrations. It is exotic and phantasmagorical: the clink of cutlery mingles with the sound of the anklets of Apsara dancers as they weave among the tables, performing the ritualistic movements that perfectly complement the mystical atmosphere in the temple.However, Cambodia is not just about temples or its well documented bloody history during the infamous Khmer Rouge days. It goes beyond the heritage ruins of the world-famous Angkor Wat and the serenity of its people. The countrys food culture, while not on the world map, is a rich amalgamation of French and Chinese cuisine as well as that of its neighbors Thailand and Vietnam. In the Khmer diet, rice and freshwater fish play big roles because of the abundance of both in the country. Other culinary traditions include regional must-haves such as fish sauce, palm sugar, lime, coconut milk, lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime and shallots.So here we are, sitting down to eat a five-course meal showcasing the finest elements of Khmer food. The exquisite plating using jute, banana leaves and locally crafted rustic crockery adds to the aesthetic appeal of the dishes. We begin our meal with a water lily and tofu salad served in a pineapple boat. Between courses, the palate cleanser is a basil seeds and coconut milk shake poured into a traditional bowl and plate, with an ice carving propping up the arrangement.And the main course is a popular Cambodian dish called Amok. Amok is a national dish made from fish, coconut milk and curry paste. Amok refers to the process of steam cooking a curry in banana leaves using thick coconut cream and galangal as the main ingredients. While the meat eaters are given a choice of fish amok or chicken amok served ingenuously in coconut shells, the vegetarians are served steamed cauliflower amok.Accompanying the amok is another Cambodian dish called Lok Lak. This is a traditional Khmer dish, which is basically stir-fried beef in a light brown sauce, served with fragrant jasmine rice and pepper sauce. The vegetarian option is pan-fried tofu with a chilli garlic sauce. And of course, perched on the matted jute plate are the ubiquitous green vegetable curry and stir fried vegetables as accompaniments. The end of the meal is signaled by a dessert symphony: a coconut ice cream tiramisu flanked by local fruits such as rambutan, watermelon and mango.But the cuisine of Cambodia goes beyond curries and rice and fish. For the faint-hearted, the site of some of the foods on sale at the Old Market in Siem Reap could lead to an esophageal eruption to rival the Old Faithful geyser. As I am wandering the French Quarter with my friends, we notice a man with a bicycle stall selling (warning: do not read ahead if you have just had a meal!) beetles, spiders, crickets and fried scorpions. Forget about snakes on a plane! He is merrily waving snakes-on-a-stick and urging us to try any of the deleeecacieesh for a dalla. As my friends and I stop to see him swallow a beetle and a spider, he beckons us over and holds out a few black bugs. One of our more adventurous friends tosses a cricket into the air and opens his mouth wide to swallow it whole. Tastes like barbeque, he says with a grin, completely unfazed by what has just popped into his mouth. The bicycle man then turns to me and hands me a small black cricket. Put een gullee, he encourages, pointing vigorously at his throat. I look at the insect, swear it is writhing and with a grimace toss it back on the cart.As I scurry off to the sound of my friends chortling, I am thinking that the only gully-cricket in my lexicon is the one which has a bat and ball attached to it!"
5904718e7be9e04154df6d7f,Growth of exports soar to a five year high giving a big boost to growth,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/growth-of-exports-soar-to-a-five-year-high-giving-a-big-boost-to-growth/,2017-04-15,"A huge 27.6% growth in exports in March 2017 boosted cumulative export growth to 4.7% in the fiscal year 2016-17 which is the highest in five years. March is the seventh consecutive month that exports have picked up after almost two dozen months of shrinking outflows and the strong surge indicates that the ongoing export recovery is gaining momentum. However, imports soared up even faster with inflows picking up by a humungous 45.3% in the month. But import growth in the fiscal year remained marginally negative. Though monthly trade deficit rose to a five month high of $10.4 billion in March pushing up the total trade deficit to $105.7 billion the gap between exports and imports was still the second lowest in as much as 9 years.What makes the surge in exports in March especially impressive is that it extended to almost all major product categories like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, petroleum products, ready made goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals and organic and inorganic chemicals? The surge in exports of many labor intensive products should give a boost to employment too. Most remarkable was the gains in engineering goods and petroleum products which soared up 46.7% and 69.1.Exports of textile ready made goods also were an impressive 20.3%. While exports of chemicals grew by 15.4%, that of gems and jewelry increased 12.5% and of drugs and pharmaceutical 5.5%. Some important agriculture related commodities like marine products, meat, dairy and poultry products, spices and rice also registered substantial gains. Only exports of fruits and vegetables shrunk in the month. Among other primary products both iron ore, coal and other minerals registered notable gains.Now let us look at the reasons for the extraordinary surge in imports to more than 45%. As in the case of exports the imports surge was also extensive and covered almost all major import products like crude oil and petroleum products, electronic goods, gold, pearls and precious stones, electrical and non-electrical machinery, chemicals, resins and plastic materials and vegetable oil. This indicates that the import surge is driven by both the surging exports momentum and a revival in domestic demand which is good news on the growth front.However, the signs are no always positive. For instance crude oil imports doubled in March which indicates either a surge in oil imports or prices or both of them which is certainly not good news. Equally worrisome is the four fold increase in gold imports in March to more than $ 4 billion. While some of it would be marshaled by the recovery in jewelry exports a lot would also go into domestic consumption which is not only a dead investments but also a useful conduit for holding ill-gotten wealth especially when government is extending its work on rolling back the black economy."
5904722a7be9e04154df6e80,Food for thought,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/jugglebandhi/food-for-thought-3/,2017-03-04,"Whenever Bertie Wooster had a particularly knotty problem for Jeeves to untangle, he would urge the latter to tuck into an extra helping of fish, being convinced that this would help to enhance his valets already formidable intellectual powers. Bertie would doubtless have been chuffed to learn that his faith in the mentally stimulating properties of a fishy diet has been endorsed by a British scientist who specializes in the chemistry of nutrition.Sounding a warning that, as a result of bad eating habits, humans are in danger of evolving into big beasts with tiny brains, the researcher has recommended cutting down on body-building proteins in favour of brain-building poly-unsaturated fats contained in seafood and vegetable oils.According to the nutritionist, too high a protein intake results in an increase in body size at the expense of brain growth, as evidenced by large savannah animals like the rhino and the ox, whose brain accounts for less than one per cent of its body weight.Arguing that the ascent of man was facilitated by the fact that our ancestors settled near fish-rich waterways, the scientist has warned that the evolutionary tide may turn against us if we persist in going the way of all flesh.Though the thesis that diet is destiny might seem to some to be a red herring, increasing concern is reportedly being voiced in Japan about the adverse effects on the body politic, supposedly caused by the replacement of traditional rice and fish fare by western-style fast foods, which many feel constitute a recipe for disaster.Extending this line of reasoning to India, it might be argued that Bengals reputed pre-eminence in matters of the mind could be attributed to the endemic passion for fish. The suggestion that it is at least partly thanks to macher jhol that Bengal thinks today what the rest of the country thinks tomorrow will seem a fishy proposition only to those not in the swim of such things."

The perfect satisfying meal, to knead it with your hands, mix the amply poured ghee and the shavings of jaggery before having a mouthful. Ahaa simply delicious. A staple diet throughout Maharashtra. A meal that any regular household can afford and is super nutritious. It gives a feeling of satiety quicker and the slow release of energy keeps you feeling fuller for longer periods.Bajra also called the pearl millet having a low glycemic index is one of the prime foods given to lower diabetes. Its insoluable fibre helps in the slow release of carbs into your system, thus providing energy over a longer period of time and keeping your blood glucose in check. Unlike the other grains and millets, bajra or the pearl millet has a distinct sweet taste to it. When ground into powder form, mixed with water and boiled makes a perfect porridge. A sustainable meal for the children and elder who are unable to eat, are ill or simply dont want to waste time chewing their food. For those having gluten intolerance, this could serve as a perfect alternative.Rich in Vitamin B (Niacin, Riboflavin, Thiamine, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, folate) that is B1,B2,B3,B5,B6,B9, it also has minerals such as iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc and selenium making it a well enriched meal by itself. It is no wonder then that this was mainly a farmers meal, who couldnt be away from his work too long and yet required enough energy to sustain himself.There are various simple ways to prepare different dishes from Bajra. During the winter, the young grain (green) taken ripe from the stalks doesnt even have to be cooked. It is often mixed with spices, sev and chutney and served as bhel. Roughly grounded Bajra cooked with yogurt and water for hours on a slow flame tempered with asafetida (hing) and fennel is a Rajasthani delicacy called the Ghaat. A staple diet to sustain the cold in the desert regions. Powdered bajra mixed with rice paste fermented with sour curds can be used to make uttapams or even steamed as idlis, a healthy south indian variety.So do include this nutritious millet in your weekly meal plan and reap its benefits."
5904725b7be9e04154df6ec8,Kali not Kannagi,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/kali-not-kannagi/,2017-03-11,"The Attukal bhagavathy is a subaltern deity. The Chilappathikaramconnection is a myth foisted by the brahminical order to domesticate the far more subversive archetype of the wounded woman [cf: wounds are at the threshold of exterior and interior, of surfaces and depths, they suggest sex and apertures]Two days ago, I wrote on Facebook that the city is craving for a shower to clean its dust-covered streets, tired trees and concrete buildings to welcome the millions who offer the Attukal Pongala.In the meantime, it rained.Today, the world fixes its worshipful eyes on Attukal Amma, the Goddess who triggers the biggest festival of women on earth. The Attukal Pongala entered the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest annual gathering of women  in 1997 with a participation of 1.5 million women devotees, and in 2009 with 2.5 million women. In 2015, the number rose to four million, and is expected to increase annually. Millions of women occupy the entire city overnight, and Thiruvananthapuram is transformed into a temple.My first tryst with the Goddess happened decades ago, as a teen, when I offered pongala with my mother. That practice continued and like every ordinary Malayali woman, it is integral to my life, something I do every year.This love and faith in Her acquired new dimensions when we started living in Thiruvananthapuram in 2012, barely a few kilometres from the temple. I could visit the temple occasionally, offer pongala without much difficulty, pray to Her, and be near Her. That was my most cherished wish.Life changed, soon. One day in October the same year, I was coming out of the temple through the western entrance after praying and I paused for a moment as I heard a distinct drum beat. It was the sheeveli procession of the Goddess and it went past me. A group of women and men, crying out Amma! trailed Her.I saw the sheeveli idol of the Goddess held close to the chest of a priest lost in adoration, who took Her idol around the temple, along the inner circumambulatory path. At that moment, the doubt as to whether She is seeing me and whether She knows the sorrows and anxieties of thousands like me, began to gnaw at me.Before that, I was not a regular visitor to the temple. The feeling that I had something more to do with the temple and the Goddess than merely praying there became deep-rooted in me on that day. Doubts raised their heads. Why is She loved this much? Why does the temple festival draw millions of women? Why is this deity so close to so many, irrespective of caste and creed?I received answers for my queries and more in the past seven years. The journey became tougher as I delved deep into the temples history, and there were perplexing anachronisms, preposterous myths and the worst among them was the medias proclamation that the Goddess at Attukal is Kannagi, the heroine of the Jain epic Chilappathikaram.The media-created narratives about the Pongala gradually encroached into the history of the Attukal temple. The temples own website repeats this incorrect information. Every attempt to convince the temple authorities to the contrary was met with ruthless opposition  almost to the extent of forcing me to end my research.I am certain that Attukal Amma is Bhadrakali, who has reigned at Attukal from antiquity, right from the times when the human race began to propitiate the divine. With the support of historical records, we can unambiguously assert that the Attukal Temple was a mudippura, where the lowest castes offered prayers, and it was taken over by an upper caste community only in the recent past.The popular anecdotes about Attukal Amma were cooked up by these vested interests to further their agenda. I also realized that it is wrong to embroil a Goddess who is so close to the soil and the people in such imaginary stories without any historical basis.The singing of Thottam Paattu by Madhu Asan and his troupe is the prime attraction of the 10-day festival and it narrates the tale of Bhadrakali.On the contrary, in Chilappathikaram, Kannagi is the daughter of a mariner, married to the Vaishya youth, Kovalan, who broke marital fidelity by taking Madhavi, the devadasi dancer, as his mistress. However, in Thottam Paattu, Kanyavu, (the female lead corresponding to Kannagi of Chilappathikaram) is Goddess Bhadrakali, the daughter of Lord Shiva.In Thottam Paattu, Bhadrakali wants to remain a virgin after marriage but in Chilappathikaram, Kovalan and Kannagi lead a blissful conjugal life. In Thottam Paattu, Devis tempestuousness comes out most clearly in her violent rage against her uncle, her future husband, and her adoptive father whom She annihilates by closing her left eye.The name Kannagi is not mentioned anywhere in Thottam Paattu. Still when media outlets keep declaring every year that Attukal Amma is Kannagi, a big blunder is made out to be the truth. As records of the past disappear and the old generation fades into oblivion, over time, the history of the Attukal Temple would have been lost irretrievably.Kannagi of Chilappathikaram is not a deity at all. The book exposes the fact that it is Bhadrakali, the daughter of Lord Shiva, who resides at Attukal and that the brahmin priests changed the nature of the temple and its rituals to cater to their own customs. There is evidence that animal sacrifice and killing of hens used to be performed at Attukal some 60 years ago.In the past seven years I have gone to the temple at dawn, at midnight, and even at 2 am. I braved pouring rain and sweltering heat. At times, I was in the midst of enormous crowds. I have always felt that ammas festival, the Pongala, is superior to the temple.We must also urge people not to waste rice, as the canonical texts say that Devi is a rice-loving deity. Unfortunately, on the Pongala day, a lot of rice is wasted. Id like to urge people to cook what is necessary, and lets treat the cooked pongala as auspicious as the Goddess Herself.Once again as the Pongala of Attukal Amma comes around, all I want to do is to offer pongala, a handful of rice, in a tiny mud pot, in total surrender. My mind is filled with the gratitude of a lifetime towards the Great Goddess for allowing me to be close to Her and to write about Her."
5904726c7be9e04154df6ee5,Why smart cities? Iâd rather have smarter villages,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/musings-from-the-mountains/84922/,2017-04-02,"Its good to know that my old friend the jackfruit is finally coming into its own. Apparently it is now much in demand in western countries, a fashionable substitute for meat fillings for burgers, sandwiches, pies etc, with one enthusiast even calling it mutton hanging from a tree.Here in India we have always appreciated a good jackfruit curry, or even better, a jackfruit pickle. Im a pickle fiend myself, and among the 20 different pickles on my sideboard there is always a jar of jackfruit pickle; thats why I call it an old friend. But I had no idea it tasted like mutton. The seed and the pulp have their own individual flavour. As it grows on a tree we call it fruit, but we cook it as though it were a vegetable. And if, to some, it tastes like mutton, then perhaps some meat-eaters will become vegetarians. On the other hand, some vegetarians might not care for its meaty flavour!When I was a boy, we had an old jackfruit tree growing beside the side veranda. I spent a lot of time in the trees surrounding my grandmothers bungalow, and this one was easy to climb. The others included several guava and litchi trees, lemons and grape-fruits, and of course a couple of mango trees  but these last were difficult to climb.Why do you spend so much time in the trees? complained my grandmother. Why not do something useful for a change?The trees are my brothers, I would say, I like to play with them.And I still think of them as my brothers, although I can no longer climb trees or play in them.And indeed I think of them as human beings possessed of individuality and charm. Just as no two humans are exactly alike (unless they happen to be twins), so no two trees are the same. Like humans they grow from seed. They develop branches as arms and leaves like flowing hair. We give birth to children; they give birth to fruits and flowers. We shelter our young, they shelter small creatures of the forest.But unlike us, they spring from the soil, from the land  that very land that gives us food and pasture and protection; the land that we so casually take for granted, preferring to build upon it rather than grow upon it. Where will our cattle graze when the last green spaces have gone?No problem, says a young friend. We can always import our milk.The other day I came across an old book that had been on my shelves for many years: Farmers Glory by A G Street, written over 60 years ago. In his epilogue he writes: It is perhaps nothing to boast about, but there is little doubt that the present prosperity of British farming is mainly due to one man, who is now dead. His name was Adolf Hitler. There is no disputing that it was the fear of famine during the early 1940s that taught the British nation that despite all mans cleverness and inventions, when real danger comes an island people must turn for succour to the only permanent asset they possess, the land of their own country. It has never, and will never, let them down; always provided they realise and obey this eternal truth  that to make the land serve man, man must first be content to serve the land.And surely it is this love of the land and willingness to serve it that is at the heart of patriotism. The patriotic songs and speeches that we hear from time to time are fine for stirring up the emotions, but it is really the connect between ourselves and the do bigha zameen on which we grow our fruit and grain that emboldens us to protect it.I think I am correct in saying that most of our jawans, the young men who join the solid ranks of the Indian Army, come from rural backgrounds; some from the hills, some from the vast plains and hinterland of our country. They know the value of the land. They have grown up in the villages and have worked with their families in the rice fields, or sugarcane plantations, or mango groves, or wheat or corn or mustard or fields of an infinite variety of crops. More than the city folk, they know the value of the land, its true worth in terms of either prosperity or poverty. And so they are ready to defend it, to fight for it against all corners. The best soldiers come from the soil that they and their forefathers have tilled. So let us protect the land  not only from the intruder or the enemy, but from those who would turn the field or the forest into one more concrete jungle.But of course there are those who prefer concrete jungles. Like my young friend who wants to live in a Smart City and never mind the cities that are no longer smart. My advice to him (unheeded of course) is to go back to his roots, create a smart little village, and plant jackfruit trees!"

Soybeans rose 0.2 percent, while wheat advanced to a five-day high. The most active corn futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade rose 0.1 percent to $3.67-1/4 a bushel, holding near $3.67-1/2 a bushel - its highest since April 4.

But, the vegetarian varieties that using mushroom or pumpkin or okras are also fairly common,"" says executive chef at Cidade de Goa, Sunit Sharma.The light yellowish-green gravy is prepared by grinding together a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, garlic and turmeric with grated coconut. The resultant paste is then strained to obtain what is called the first press coconut milk. The extraction of the second press follows post the addition of a little bit of water, and it is in the second press extract that the dish is prepared.Cooking the caldinho begins with a dash of chopped onions and some tomatoes that are used to give the curry some texture. But, one must keep in mind the acidity factor of the tomatoes during preparation. ""The tomatoes' acidic nature is highly likely to cause the coconut milk to curdle if you are not careful. It's important to use just the optimum amount of tomatoes to prevent the gravy from losing its flavour,"" says Oswin Pinto , owner and chef at Hogworth, Miramar. ""If you aren't sure, the best idea is to avoid the tomatoes entirely,"" he advises.ith its origins hidden in the ubiquitous broth or soup , the caldinho is yet another outcome of the amalgamation of Portuguese and Konkani influences that gives Goan cuisine its unique character Named after the caldo, which means soup in Portuguese, the caldinho is probably one of the most understated yet versatile dishes of the coastal state's culinary offerings.This creamy curry was once served at the dining table of the elite. ""Caldinho was eaten with bread by the rich as the first course of the meal during the Portuguese era. Besides the high-value fish, an entire coconut goes into making one plate of caldinho, which makes its preparation an expensive affair,"" says owner of Viva Panjim, Linda D'Souza.Unlike conventional curries that are heavy on spices and chillies, the caldinho is prepared using a generous amount of coconut milk. In another recipe, grated coconut is cooked till it turns into a paste.The principal ingredientbe it fish, or prawns, or vegetablesare added once the onion turns translucent, and the second press coconut milk extract follows soon after. The stew is then allowed to simmer till the ingredients are properly cooked and topped off with the first press coconut milk.The curry sauce is not spicy in the vegetarian caldinho either, but continues to be flavourful like its seafood counterpart. The caldinho goes well with traditional Goan rice or bread and is best served piping hot.""It is easy to cook and lends itself well to a variety of ingredients,"" says Sharma. ""While it might seem unlikely that a coastal state like Goa would have a vegetarian version of the caldinho, the long periods of abstinence from non-vegetarian food, practised by both Christian and Hindu communities has seen the dish evolve over time,"" he adds."

The year is ending with the largest ever global stock of foodgrains in history, some 682 million tonnes.India too is heading for a record cereal crop as the previous year's final wheat is harvested and counted in. As reported by TOI earlier, the second advance estimate of the government put cereal production for 2016-17 at nearly 250 million tonnes, crossing the record of about 246 million tonnes set in 2013-14.While the world celebrates this plentiful harvest, over 20 million people are facing starvation in Africa and Yemen in the worst drought in 60 years.Globally, some 795 million people go to bed hungry every day, according to the World Food Programme . This includes about 15% of India's population, some 20 million people.The global output was fuelled by increased wheat output in North America  by more than 10 million tonnes year on year  and increases in the Russian Federation and India.All these offset the European Union decline by 16.5 million tonnes caused by bad weather. Rice output increased in China, India, and Southeast Asia. Coarse cereal production jumped by 22.7 million tonnes, led by US, EU, India and Ukraine, offsetting El Nino-caused declines in Brazil and policy-driven dip in China.FAO is now forecasting a slight dip in world cereal production in 2017, mainly due to a fall in wheat output in Australia, Canada and the US after farmers planted less seeing lower prices. Coarse grains and rice production is forecast to continue rising in 2017. All this is subject to climatic conditions. This plentiful production has naturally caused prices to fall, especially in the past one year. US wheat is down 4.2%, Thailand rice by 2% and US rice by 12.7%. Maize, the main coarse grain, is down 0.4%.But there is something wrong somewhere in this happy story because, shockingly, over 20 million people in Africa and Yemen are facing starvation, or at least high risk, due to what Stephen O'Brien described as the largest crisis since World War II in 1945.According to aid agencies and the UN , the food crisis in East Africa and Northern Nigeria is mostly because of continued war and consequent disruption of economy and connectivity."

Roy was born on April 11, 1887, according to the English calendar but his descendants celebrate his birth anniversary on Poila Boishakh . The family, however, didn't mind the early celebrations online.""I'm really happy with Google's tribute using a painting of a horse done by Dadu. I've seen at least 10-12 different horses done by him,"" said Debabrata Roy , the 76-year-old grandson of the artist who has directed a documentary titled 'The Art of Jamini Roy'.However, Roy was certain that the painter would have reacted very differently to Google's homage. ""I can visualise him getting very angry with such adulation. He would have turned violent. He just didn't like any gadgets. Before his death, I had tried to get his consent for shooting a film on him. But, there was complete non-cooperation from his side,"" he recounted.Contrary to artists who are in search of immortality through art, the painter didn't believe in the permanence of art. ""He didn't even leave behind a will and was least bothered about how posterity would remember him. All he would say is: 'I don't agree. That's why I paint',"" Roy said.Though both the central and state governments have acquired most of the master's works from the family, Roy's collection still has some of his rudimentary sketches. However, he isn't expecting government support to preserve the master's works. ""That's not the government's job. If a private organisation is ready to come up with a permanent space where Dadu's works can be on display, I will love to give them there,"" he said.Describing his grandfather as a 'no-nonsense gentleman', Roy spoke about how the Padma Bhushan winner was ""afraid"" that his grandson, too, would take to painting. ""We can't even imagine his financial struggles. He had to struggle hard to earn one paisa that was needed to buy puffed rice to feed his children. He didn't have money to buy good quality paints. That's why restorers of his early works have such a tough time now. He even used my grandmother's sari as a canvas,"" Roy added.Yet, the artist didn't increase the price of his works because he believed in reaching out to the masses. ""I don't agree with the government's policy that declares his works as 'national treasures'. Artists have no nationalities. Can Van Gogh or Picasso be limited as a national treasure of one country? Sadly, it's impossible to export or take Dadu's works outside India. I think, this policy deprives owners of his works from taking them along if they want to shift out of India. However, I do hear that many of his works are now going under the hammer at international art auctions."""

Agricultural experts are recommending a major overhaul in policies to address this ""deep-rooted"" problem.At a conference on 'Connecting the Dots  Air quality challenges in monitoring, implementation and health' on Wednesday, air quality and agricultural experts said the government needed to address the issue holistically and not just by penalising farmers. National Green Tribunal has imposed a fine ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000  depending on the farm size  on farmers who indulge in burning stubble.""Banning and penalising farmers will not help because how will you identify which farmer is burning crop? It's difficult. Plus the farmer is burning it out of compulsion. The government can support some mechanisation at the village level for taking out the straw and then putting it to use by, say, composting it. The farmer should see economic value in the exercise,"" Ramanjaneyulu G V, executive director at Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , said at the conference organised by Global Strategic Communications Council. The government now gives subsidy on equipment to sow stubble in Punjab and Haryana.The paddy-wheat system leaves farmers with the sowing time of less than a month between the two crops, pointed out Umendra Dutt of Punjab-based Kheti Virasat Mission. Mechanised harvesting and monoculture of wheat and paddy are also behind the problem of stubble burning. ""The cropping pattern should change . In Andhra, bean gram and black gram are planted while rice stubble decomposes on its own. The government should also procure pulses and oil seeds which are suitable for north India. The problem of stubble burning will never be solved otherwise,"" added Ramanjaneyulu. He explained that the amount of stubble generated is higher than the harvest. Every four tonne rice or wheat leave behind about six tonne straw. Nearly five-seven tonne straw per hectare stay unused. Just one tonne of straw burning can release up to 3kg particulate matter (PM), 1,460kg carbon dioxide (CO2) and 199kg ash.While Delhi and the rest of the NCR are exposed to severe levels of pollution, burning also leads to an immediate decline in the bacterial and fungal population in the top 2.5cm of the soil. Repeated burning permanently diminishes the bacterial population by more than 50%, increasing farmers' dependence on fertlisers and pesticides. ""The government subsidises nitrogenous and other fertilisers. Burning stubble in Punjab is equivalent to wasting subsidies worth Rs 500 to Rs 1500 crore,"" estimated Ramanjaneyulu.'Proof on health impacts'Sagnik Dey, associate professor at Centre for Atmospheric Sciences in IIT Delhi, said several studies in India showed that air pollution was strongly linked to severe health impacts like chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, heart disease and mortality. ""I think policy-makers are looking only at traditional journals,"" Dey said while answering a question on why the Centre is suspicious of reports linking air pollution and mortality.He quoted nearly 21 medical studies published from 1980 onwards by Indian physicians and scientists linking air pollution with upper respiratory symptoms in the 1980s and lower birth weight due to mothers' exposure to polluted air in the 2000s."

One of the organisers of this cultural medley, Amrit Singh Sindhu, shares, ""We are organising the traditional giddha dance today at 11am at Jaripatka community hall, followed by a magnificent performance of gatka  a Sikh martial art technique. These events are important to keep the youngsters connected to our roots and culture.""While community meals, rituals and cultural performances add a festive touch to Baisakhi celebrations, they also provide an opportunity for families to spend time together. Educationist Tanpreet Kaur Tuli says, ""Since Baisakhi is also the beginning of the new year, all of us celebrate this festival together at home. We are making a delicious Punjabi dinner for our family and friends, wherein I will serve dal makhni, rice, naan, paneer and a lot of vegetables. What makes Baisakhi special for us is that all of us spend quality time together and share laughter. Nothing can beat this joy."""

These details surfaced during the interrogation of Meena, his aides Imran and Hansraj, and inmate Anoop Pahadia.Meena was arrested by ACB while accepting a bribe from the family member of a inmate in return for providing food and protection against criminals.According to ACB sleuths, the dreaded criminal, Anoop Pahadia, had complete control over prison operations. ""The regular food was tasteless and bad. So, inmates had to pay a regular sum, ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000, to Pahadia for availing options such as pulao, mutton, rice and milk,"" an ACB official said, adding that Pahadia shared money from the proceedings with Meena.Apart from 'food services', Pahadia and his gang also beat up new inmates for extortion. ""The new guys were a source of money. They would be regularly harassed, tortured and beaten. Pahadia would then demand money from inmates and ask them to call up their family members,"" an official said, adding that the 'rates' varied depending on the inmate. While the wealthy ones had to pay more, a 'middle class' prisoner had to cough up about Rs 15,000 a month.Pahadia and Meena would divide the money between them. From the CCTV footage recovered from the prison, ACB sleuths also discovered the unusual proximity that Pahadia enjoyed with Meena. ""As per rules, hardcore criminals should be taken to a separate barrack after 7pm. However, Pahadia enjoyed several facilities which included 'roaming' about the prison without any fear,"" an official said.An inmate could also have a 'relaxing stay' at the hospital ward if he can pay sufficient money. ""We came across this very disturbing fact wherein inmates could pay Rs 15,000 and stay in the hospital ward where the security was lax and the environment better than the prison,"" the official said, adding that several suspects were being interrogated by the police and ACB.The ACB has also seized expensive bottles of wines, costly gifts, jewellery and cash worth Rs 85,000 from Meena's quarter."

Since then, it has affected marriage ceremonies and most social and religious gatherings, the latest being Hazrat Ali's birthday, a centuries old tradition.Families in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar, Aliganj, Alambagh, Charbagh, Mahanagar and Hazratganj had prepared vegetarian dishes as they could not get mutton or chicken. Families in Chowk and Nakkhas had prepared single dish of mutton and that too in a small quantity, whome some in Maulviganj and Aminabad had prepared chicken dish in sufficient quantity.The crackdown on meat has led to loss of livelihood of not only those involved in meat trade but also of biryani rice, the sale of which has dipped more than 50%. As there is no meat available in market, people are not buying the special variety of rice. The worst affected varieties of biryani rice are 'Khus', 'Gulab', 'Hari-patti', 'Nafees' and 'Nawazish'.Rafi Hasan approached several shops for mutton but didn't find any in his area. ""I searched three localities for meat but not a single shop was open, so I asked my wife to prepare vegetarian food, much to our disappointment,"" said Rafi a resident of Rustamnagar, Chowk.""I had asked a meat seller in my area for 5kg chicken on Monday night.

It would be a common refrain of elders to yearn for those days when they used to indulge in the festivities while following customs ''strictly''. On Easter Sunday today, as the world celebrates the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we explore the significance of each day of Easter, as well as some of the different and interesting traditions of Easter followed in various parts of Kerala.The 40 days' Lent commemorates the days Jesus spent fasting in the deserts when he endured the temptation by Satan. ""We prepare ourselves for Easter through prayers, self-denial, giving alms and repenting sins. Discipline is very important, at spiritual, emotional and physical levels. We give up all luxuries - from non-vegetarian dishes to being with one's partner,"" says octogenerian Mariama Mani from Poovarani, Pala.The Holy Week comprises Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday and is the last week of Lent. Retired headmistress Olakengil Mary explains, ""The week begins on Palm Sunday and includes Spy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday. Palm Sunday is observed in memory of Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, where he was welcomed by the natives, with the waving of palm branches. The days preceding Thursday are reserved for remembering the anointing of Jesus at Bethany, his predictions about his own death and Judas planning his betrayal with the high priests.""The day honours the Last Supper of Jesus with his twelve apostles, which the Eucharist is modelled on. ""Reminiscing about what Jesus had said and done at the Last Supper, every Christian household will carry out the ritual of the cutting the pesaha appam. The eldest member of the family cuts it and distributes it among the family, along with Peseha Paalu,"" says Mary.This day will also witness the washing of the feet of parishioners in the churches, symbolising the way Jesus washed his disciples' feet. ""Morning mass will not be held on this day and only the Mass of the Lord's Supper will be conducted in the evening,"" she adds. The alter bells will remain silent on the day.The day commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus and his death at Calvary. ""It is the day of mourning. We observe fast on this day and leave for the Church early in the morning where we remember Jesus' suffering, the Way of the Cross and his crucifixion. At the church, we will be given kaipuneeru made of the juice of panal tree leaves and vinegar. A bell made of wood (Maramani) is rung during the rituals."" Mary says.The fasting goes hand in hand with complete abstinence. ""We have only one meal and bittergourd will be the important ingredient in it. We abstain from doing anything entertaining including watching TV, reading books or listening to music. Elders read Puthen Paana, the first Malayalam Christian poem written by Arnos Pathiri, a German missionary,"" says Mary.The Holy Saturday is the day between the crucifixion of Jesus and resurrection. ""We call it the day of Sabbath. Mass isn't held in our churches and we wait symbolically at Jesus' tomb, praying and fasting. It is also called the day of bereavement. We clean our houses and prepare ourselves to invite Jesus into our homes. We spray holy water from the church in our homes,"" says Marykutty Thomas Parekkat from Pala.As it is the last day of the Lent, preparations start for the big feast.The Sunday that immediately follows is celebrated as Easter. On this day, the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, is celebrated. It is the culmination of Passion of the Christ (final period in the life of Jesus).Bretty Tommy, a professor from Kalady Sankrit University, says, ""By around 10 pm on Saturday night, the entire family will leave for church to attend the mass. Our kitchens will be filled with non-vegetarian delicacies and as we return from the mass, we break the Lent and relish all the food."" At church, wine and a piece of cake will be served to mark the beginning of the celebrations and also the end of the Lent.The dishes prepared on this day vary in different parts of Kerala. ""For Pala natives, appam and egg curry is a must for breakfast while for lunch, they cook beef ularth and chicken curry. But people in Alappuzha prepare dishes with duck. They break the Lent having duck roast and palappam. When it comes to the Angamaly area, they prefer pork and rice while in northern, mutton stew is served in the morning,"" she says.It starts from the Easter Sunday and runs until the Sunday following Easter. ""This is the time when new-born babies are baptised. The Sunday after the Easter is also known as St Thomas Sunday, which recounts the story of Christ appearing to Apostle Thomas, in order to dispel his doubts about the Resurrection,"" says agriculturalist Justin Jose from Wayanad.The first Christian poem written in Malayalam by German missionary Arnos Pathiri, it narrates the life of Jesus Christ. The part which deals with the crucifixion of Christ is read out aloud in homes on Good Friday.This bitter tasting drink which is served on Good Friday is a reminder of the drink made of vinegar mixed with gall offered to Jesus by the soldiers before his crucifixion. The Kerala version of the drink is made out of vinegar and the juice of panal (a shrub) tree leaves.The sound of the church bell is often considered as a symbol of happiness and joy. Since Jesus' crucifixion isn't a happy event, there will no usual ringing of bells in churches. Until Jesus was crucified, the Jews used to ring a wooden bell mocking those who were crucified, as in those days, crucifixion was done for criminals. However after the death of Jesus, the wooden bell is rung in churches on Good Friday, in memory of the crucifixion.This sweet dumpling is made on Palm Sunday in every Christian home in Kerala to commemorate Jesus's visit to Lazarus, Martha and Mary's house. It is believed that love is folded inside the snack as it is made of sweetened grated coconut wrapped in a pancake made of rice flour.Malayalis of all religions travel to Kuravilangad, Kottayam, on Palm Sunday (Oshana Njayar) to be part of the Thamukku Nercha offered in Kalathur Martha Mariyam Church. During the festival, this sweet dish made of jaggery, cooked rice, grated coconut and banana is served. It was started off as an offering to Mother Mary to do away with troubles the villagers faced, years back.The peseha appam or Indriyappam, which is made of unfermented rice flour, is prepared on Maundy Thursday in memory of the Last Supper. It is cooked directly on a flame in the central part of Kerala while it is steamed in the rest of Kerala. It is served along with Peseha Paalu, which is made out of jaggery and coconut milk."

Since then, the entire family has been following suit and they consider the change, an informed choice. ""We didn't want to spend on medicine and hence, changed our dietary habits. The move seems to have worked as no one in the family has fallen ill since then,"" he says. Just like Immanuel, many households in Coimbatore are gradually switching to cold-pressed oil. After millets made a comeback on Coimbatorean's menu, it's the turn of cold-pressed oil (chekku ennai) to find its way back in health-conscious Coimbatorean's life.For the last three months, homemaker Rajeswari N has been making a trip to the nearest oil mill in her locality. She opts for cold-pressed gingelly oil, groundnut oil and coconut oil. ""During my childhood, back home in my village in Theni, we used cold-pressed oil for cooking. But, after I got married and moved to Coimbatore, it became an arduous task to find chekku ennai and I switched to refined oil. It was only recently that I heard of an oil mill near our house and immediately went back to those good old days of cooking. Life has come full circle,"" says Rajeswari.According to BS Venkatachalam, proprietor of a cold-pressed oil chain in the city, ""There is an increased awareness among people today and they are extremely conscious about their health. They are now aware that many health issues can be addressed by changing one's food habits and opting for cold-pressed oil is an example. It's a misconception that oil in itself is bad for the body. Human body needs lubrication and hence, it needs oil. It's in the extraction process that we go wrong. In the days of yore, the oil was extracted in chekku made of vaagai maram and the vaagai marachekku oil (vigin cold-pressed oil) was considered extremely beneficial to one's health. Vaagai maram has the propensity to absorb heat and the hence, the oil churned out from such an oil expeller is beneficial in the long run. They would also use bulls to operate the chekku as they would move slowly. This would ensure that the same temperature is maintained throughout the extraction. The cold-pressed oil extracted with this press (oil expeller) has no LDL (bad) cholesterol. On the other hand, adulterated oil when heated extensively becomes toxic in the long run. ""K Velusamy, who runs a cold-pressed oil mill in Ganapathy, says, ""People who have been making the switch to cold-pressed oil consists of two types- those who are suffering from a health issue like joint pain or sugar; and those who want to prevent diseases. But, merely switching to cold-pressed oil will not improve one's health. One needs to cut down or stop the intake of unhealthy options like white sugar and white rice. Cold-pressed oil has a unique colour, texture and taste.""Seconding him is fitness nutritionist Almas Sajjath, ""Any product in its refined form is unhealthy - be it rice or sugar. Cold-pressed oil is a healthy alternative. In India, coconut oil is considered the best as it contains Omega 3. It has the property to cut down bad fat and keep you healthy. Cold-pressed gingelly oil (nallenai) on the other hand, has the property to keep food intact for a long time. Apart from switching to chekku ennai, one should follow a good dietary pattern that provides proper nutrition to remain healthy in the long run."" Venkatachalam adds, ""Our ancestors enjoyed good health, because they opted for healthy cooking habits. It's time we followed suit and taught our younger generations about the same."""

Much disappointed are 1,500-odd farmers in tribal hamlets in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve. For the first time in a decade, these farmers were prepared to stop using chemical fertilizers and begin organic farming . But lack of rainfall has forced them to postpone sowing to April or June.NGOs and experts have suggested alternate cropping pattern to tribal farmers living at hamlets in the ATR. ""Due to various factors such as green revolution and migration of people to forest fringes, the traditional farming methods of tribals changed and this affected the entire ecosystem. The farmers in this region traditionally sowed millets, grain amaranthus, black gram and groundnuts. But they slowly shifted to rice and beans due to competition and to increase their revenue. But use of fertilizers was affecting rivers and streams inside the forest, which is a tiger reserve,"" said Peter Prem Chakravathi, a biologist working with the tribal farmers in the ATR for the past three years.""They are beginning to realise that living inside the forest they cannot pollute the environment,"" said a forest official.The major tribal hamlets that are under focus are Kodanthur, Poparai and Thalinji in the Udumalpettai division. Other hamlets that are also getting trained are Kodar, Malasar, Malai Malasar, Maduvar, Pulayur and Eravalar.P Mullai, senior project officer of World Wildlife Fund who is training and orienting the tribals, said, ""Their traditional method is natural farming. But after middlemen increased, they began producing short-term crops using a lot of fertilizers and chemicals. But slowly, we are trying to create awareness and nearly 40% of the farmers have agreed to shift to organic farming. Next week, we are taking them to Udhagamandalam to visit farms that use traditional methods,"" said Mullai.Forest rangers and officials said the only deterrent was marketing their produce. ""We are trying the show them the demand for organic produce and are trying to tie up with organisations to market their products. Once that is finalised, we can create a model and make all tribal communities follow the best practices,"" said a forest ranger.The farmers are slowly realising the multi-cropping system can get more revenue. ""Last year, they suffered huge losses as all the farmers only produced beans. But this year, TNAU has agreed to supply hybrid varieties that will increase their yield. We are hopeful that by June the cultivation would begin and the 958 sqkm area of ATR, which is biologically one of the most important part of the Western Ghats, will be preserved for the future generations,"" said Mullai.G V Rajalingam, assistant professor at TNAU, said the tribal farmers can adopt the latest technologies and grow ladies finger, small onion and cauliflower instead of paddy, lablabs and French beans. Also, crops like beetroot and turnips were suggested for the winter season."

Planting had not begun by April 9 in Iowa, the top corn state. * Large speculators increased their net short position in CBOT corn futures in the week to April. 11, regulatory data released on Friday showed. * The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly commitments of traders report also showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their net short position in CBOT wheat and increased their net short position in soybeans. * On Thursday, funds were net buyers of CBOT corn and soybean futures contracts and net sellers in wheat, traders said. * The soybean market dropped to a one-year low last week with record South American supplies anchoring the market. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in a monthly report raised its projections of the Brazilian and Argentine soy harvests. Those figures followed a March 31 USDA report projecting a jump in U.S. soybean plantings to record levels this year. MARKET NEWS * Shares dipped on Monday while the dollar and U.S. bond yields fell after soft U.S. economic data hurt investor sentiment already frayed by worries over North Korea and upcoming French elections.

5905df827be9e04154e03ea1,Indian e-tailing: It's likely to remain a three-way fight,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-e-tailing-its-likely-to-remain-a-three-way-fight/articleshow/58119409.cms,2017-04-11,"BENGALURU: The mammoth funding Flipkart has raised has made sure that the winner in Indian e-commerce will not be decided any time soon. Rival Amazon has only grown stronger in the past two years, with greater financial commitments from the parent company.Snapdeal is struggling and is expected to be sold soon, but Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce player, has invested close to a billion dollars in Paytm , which has an e-commerce market place, and is looking to see how it can make an impact in this space.This makes it a three-way fight in the near term. And with large venture capital and private equity funds and technology companies -including SoftBank , Alibaba, Tencent, eBay , Tiger Global and DST Global -invested deeply into the space, Indian customers can perhaps expect some more years of mollycoddling.""Now the war is between Amazon, Alibaba and a conglomerate of funds that want to compete with the American and Chinese e-commerce leaders for the Indian turf,"" said Kashyap Deorah, a former entrepreneur, who wrote a book on the industry, The Golden Tap: The Inside Story of Hyper Funded Indian Startups.Some recent data on the Indian e-commerce market may not look encouraging. E-commerce consultancy RedSeer estimates that the market grew to just $14.7 billion during the first three months of 2017, compared to $14 billion in the first three months of 2016.That's a 5% growth. But VCs, consultants and retail experts that TOI spoke to said Flip kart's latest funding shows that global investors are confident about the depth of the Indian e-commerce market. ""Indian e-commerce will probably see two market leaders rather than be a monopoly.It is big and unorganised for any single player to dominate in the near future,"" said a venture capital investor, requesting that he not be named.In several big markets, a single player dominates -in the US, there's none that comes anywhere close to Amazon, and in China, Alibaba rules.Kerry Rice, a senior analyst on internet and digital media at New York-based investment bank Needham & Company, said the additional funding for Flipkart and partnerships should help the e-tailer sustain its leading market share, ""but we are so early in the game that it's hard to call a winner out yet"". He said ultimately the winner has to get the three components of e-commerce right: platform, logistics, and payments.The venture capitalist quoted earlier said that there was a lot of negativity around the ecommerce sector in the past 15 months and this Flipkart funding would cheer up the industry and entrepreneurs. ""There were a lot of investors on the fence who were not clear about their India motivations, but a news like this will spur them on.The macro environment is also looking more stable and even at a lower valuation, this will send a strong signal to everyone in the ecosystem,"" said Vinod Murali, CEO of Innoven Capital India, an investor in Snapdeal.Will the funding unnerve Amazon? Anil Kumar , CEO at RedSeer Consulting , and Rice of Needham said Amazon was unlikely to be perturbed."

5909e86d7be9e033f19b8ad6,Religion and regression,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/religion-and-regression-ppp-leader-asif-ali-zardari-forced-marriage-non-muslim-girl-forced-marriage-into-islam-4462620/,2017-01-07,"Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. (Source: Reuters) Former Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari. (Source: Reuters)Last month, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari did something that no man with a conscience could have thought of doing: He gave his word to Amir Jamaat-e-Islami Siraj ul Haq that the Sindh Assembly will strike down a recently passed law meant to protect non-Muslim girls from being forcibly converted to Islam. Hindu and Christian girls have been forced to convert, so that Muslim men can take them as wives. The law would have addressed the abuse of Muslim law which forbids forcible conversion.The Movement for Solidarity and Peace, which campaigns against religious violence in Pakistan, says, 100 Christian girls and at least 300 Hindu girls (in Sindh) suffer such conversions every year and has presented its case at the US Congress too. The law passed by the Sindh Assembly laid down that change of religion will not be recognised until the person reaches 18 years of age; otherwise perpetrators will get five years in jail.Secretary general of the Jamaat-e- Islami, Liaquat Baloch, attacked the law: The provincial assembly passed the bill in haste to please foreign lobbies. We will not let it sail through and will challenge it in the Council for Islamic Ideology and the Federal Shariat Court. The Sindh Criminal Law (Protection of Minorities) Bill, 2015 was tabled by minority members Nand Kumar and Khatumal Jeewan. They must feel cheated by the ruling party using the issue as a pawn in the political battle at the national level.Hindutva may turn out to be less terminal in its destructive spread than sharia, but the seduction of religion is there in South Asia. In the Sindh district of Ghotki, there is the Sant Satram Das temple from where Hindu girls have been picked up and converted before being forcibly married to Muslim men. Near the temple, there is also the infamous Bharchundi Sharif shrine whose patrons once became famous in India for convertingnon-Muslims. But the shrine is not without its blots today, its custodians backing conversions as divine inspiration. Every April, there is the death anniversary of Bhagat Kanwar Ram, a popular Sufi poet and singer,killed in the communal riots of 1939, allegedly by the then-custodians of the Bharchundi Sharif shrine.In the past, this northern Sindh region generally abjured violence and treated Hindus well on the basis of their Sindhi identity. In southeast Sindh, in Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot and Sanghar, they suffer maltreatment. But in 2012, upper Sindh too experienced an anti-Hindu trend after madrassas from South Punjab spread their tentacles into Sindh. This trend was emphasised after Deobandi Islams Taliban affiliation gave it impunity.In the past, Hindus were the dominant class  some of their dominance is still in evidence. One local observation goes like this: In Ghotki, the cotton ginning factories are owned by Hindus. In Sukkur, half the trade in rice, grains and dates is conducted by Hindus. In Khairpur, Hindus have a big role in the date trade (which goes mostly to India). In Jacobabad and Kashmore, rice milling and trading are Hindu domains. In Larkana, Hindus have a big role in the rice trade. All of this makes them a target.Hindu girls are in fact the target and this persuaded the two Hindu members of the Sindh Assembly to table the bill about conversions. A member of the Sukkur Hindu Panchayat stated in a 2012 report by journalist Cyril Almeida: Periodically kidnapping Hindus, entering our homes, picking up our children, its all meant to prevent the community from growing, to keep us under psychological pressure. Like the Hindus of Bangladesh  whose constitution is secular  the Hindus of Sindh have tried to migrate to India. Now, if the upper Sindh leader Asif Ali Zardari decides to rescind the law that protects the Hindu community, Pakistan will sink further into chaos.The police are lax. Converted Hindu girls are often raped or beaten and, when the family complains to the police, they let the case drop when the abductors report conversion. In Islam, inward conversion is welcomed, but outward conversion attracts the death penalty, so far not enshrined in law, but all known away-convertees have been killed. Religion is not turning South Asia into paradise. Anand Teltumbde wrote in the Economic and Political Weekly (January 3, 2015): On 8 December, 57 families (nearly 350 persons) in Ved Nagar in Agra were converted to Hinduism by Dharma Jagran Samanvaya Vibhag and Bajrang Dal activists, both RSS outfits.Amarnath Motumal, the vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), reports: About 1,000 non-Muslim girls are converted to Islam each year in Pakistan. Every month, an estimated 20 or more Hindu girls are abducted and converted, although exact figures are impossible to gather.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed) Iraqi internally displaced children gather for gifts before a New Years celebration at the Hassan Sham camp, east of Mosul, Iraq, Saturday, Dec 31, 2016. (AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed)There were no big New Years celebrations for the Iraqi men, women and children who narrowly escaped the fighting in Mosul, only to wait for hours under armed guard while the fighting-age males among them were cleared of links to the Islamic State.Watch what else is in the newsThe lucky ones would go with their families to one of the wind-swept camps for displaced Iraqis, where they will endure the remainder of northern Iraqs bitterly cold winter in tents and learn to survive on insufficient supplies of food, heating oil and blankets.Those whose names were found on the wanted list would be detained, interrogated and likely face trial.Many of the Iraqis told of going hungry in Mosul for weeks, surviving on a single daily meal and drinking murky water extracted from recently dug wells. There was no formula for their small children, who survived on bread soaked in tea or soup made of rice or crushed wheat. Life was miserable without electricity or medical care. They watched mortar shells or stray bullets kill their relatives and neighbors.They dont know when they will go home, but are thankful.The camp is the lesser of two evils. Life in Mosul now kills you, said 33-year-old English teacher Ahmed Abu Karam, from the IS-held Karama neighborhood east of the Tigris River. What happens in 2017 is in the hands of God alone, but let me tell you this: My escape, thanks be to God, has given me a new life.Abu Karam was among about 200 men ordered by grim faced Iraqi soldiers to squat outside a row of abandoned stores on a main road close to the mainly Christian town of Bartella near Mosul. It is the gathering point for the mainly Sunni residents who fled Mosul to avoid being killed in the crossfire between government troops and IS militants or because they ran out of food and money.The ground where they gathered was wet from a heavy downpour a few days before and scattered with trash. Many men sported long beards they had to grow under IS rule, but some were shaving off their facial hair on Saturday as they waited. As the men were processed, the women and children sat on buses. The men were expected to be transferred separately, many in the back of army trucks, one of which flew a Shiite banner.We Sunnis are marginalized, said Abu Karam. The security forces ran away and left us with Daesh in 2014. Now they suspect us of being terrorists, he said, using the Arabic acronym for IS.Iraqs Shiite-dominated military and security forces launched a new offensive in Mosul on Tuesday, breaking a two-week lull in fighting that began in mid-October, more than two years after Iraqs military and police melted away in the face of an IS blitz across northern and western Iraq.The renewed fighting in Mosul has forced hundreds of civilians to flee, joining an estimated 120,000 who already left. Most gathered in Bartella on Saturday came from neighborhoods where the latest fighting is taking place.Electrician Ibrahim Saleh and his family escaped Mosuls Quds neighborhood on Friday and spent the night at the home of kind strangers in a suburb just east of the city. He said he, his wife and children endured most of the last two months hiding under their houses staircase for fear of shelling.We have survived only by divine intervention, he said.The camps for Iraqis displaced by the fighting in and around Mosul are mostly south and east of the city in Nineveh province and in the nearby self-ruled Kurdish region. There, many complain of rain and other severe winter conditions, or inadequate supplies of heating oil and medicines.But in one of the larger camps for the displaced in the Kurdish region  Hassan Sham  a local non-governmental organization provided a welcome change from the drab daily life there by throwing a New Years party for the children, complete with clowns and face painting.But the childrens excitement did little to conceal the camps grim realities, or erode the painful memories of life under IS and the horrors of war in Mosul since October.Shortly before the party began, camp residents pushed and shoved over blankets and clothes distributed by local donors. Some spoke of feeling imprisoned in the camp, unable to secure a sponsor allowing them to live in the urban bustle of nearby Irbil, the Kurdish regions capital.Akram Ali, a former cameraman for a Mosul TV channel, now makes less than 10 dollars a day cutting hair, but still enough to buy fresh vegetables and fruit to supplement the food handouts he, his wife and four children get from camp organizers.We died 20 times every day when we lived under fire in Mosul, he recounted emotionally. Under Daesh, it was oppression, tragedies, persecution and suffering. I can do without food and water, as long as I and my family are safe.Fellow camp resident Mustafa Mahmoud, a 21-year-old who quit school when IS took over his native Mosul in 2014, sees little to celebrate with the arrival of 2017. Since arriving at the camp six weeks ago, he goes to bed at 7 or 8 every evening.Nothing will change tonight, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Jaskiran Kapoor Tangerine tree in Sector 10, Chandigarh. Jaskiran KapoorITS the year of the rooster, and the tree weve chosen, or rather which chose us for the New Year, is the Tangerine. According to the Chinese New Year symbols, celebration and tradition, oranges and tangerines are auspicious and symbolize abundance, happiness and prosperity. While the lovely orange colour reflects gold, and hence points at luck and wealth, the tangerine or the mandarin orange is given as a gift to family and friends on New Years to usher in good fortune.Watch what else is making news:For blessings, they are also placed under childrens pillows and in rice containers. And if you feel like investing in one, follow the Chinese, who buy the trees in pairs, for then it doubles all the good luck. Interestingly, in our quest to find out more about these golden balls, we came across another nugget of info  tangerines are also used to stuff Christmas stockings, placed into the toe.Legend has it that St. Nicholas, who inherited a large sum of money, would throw sacks of gold down the chimney to help poor men afford suitors for their daughters, and it would land in the stockings of the girls left out to dry by the fire. Over time, the tangerine or orange was used as a symbol of gold.From the Alliance Francaise in Sector 36, the Water Works in sector 26, the Government Nursery in Sector 23 to schools, residences and other assorted venues, tangerine trees are a common sight in Chandigarh and are laden with bright fruit at the moment. For those who are into harvesting it, you can make delicious jams and marmalade from these sweet and sour miniature beauties.Citrus tangerina are a type of mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), and belong to the Rutaceae family. Apparently, the name comes from Tangier, Morocco. You can find it in garden nurseries, and it can be grown in a pot as well as on the ground. Make sure the soil is moist and the plant gets its fertilizer and plenty of sun  nothing extreme though, be it winters or summers.Fresh and citrusy, the tangerine is low in calories and high in nutrients  for instance, its a rich source of vitamin C, folate, and beta-carotene. Its an antioxidant, helps in skin diseases, arthritis, heals cuts and wounds, absorbs iron from food, restricts cholesterol absorption and is high in fibre.

For the past 50 years, the efforts for induced breeding of this fish were unsuccessful.The fish, known as Haragi or Hullugende locally, is endemic to Karnataka waters and once formed an important fishery of the river Tungabhadra. The indiscriminate exploitation of rivers and lack of conservation put many of these fish into the category of threatened, vulnerable and rare species.Dr N Sridhar, principal scientist and his team at CIFAs regional research centre, have been studying the reproductive biology and induced breeding of this fish  classified as critically endangered (possibly extinct) by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List  since 2003.Though initial success was achieved during 2009, it could not be sustained due to visceral fat formation in the abdomen of the fish. By conducting invitro hydrolysis of feed ingredients, Dr Sridhar identified that the traditional feed  containing rice bran and groundnut oil cake  was causing impaired ovary development among the female fish species.In 2015, a special feed was developed at the centre to overcome the visceral fat formation.The new feed ultimately resulted in maturity of the female fish, said Dr Sridhar, adding, the first generation of the induced bred healthy fingerlings is now being successfully reared at the centre.A part of the fish fingerlings will finally be river ranched at Tunga River in Gajanur, Shivamogga in order to enhance this fish stock in the river once they attain a size of about 100 mm, Dr Sridhar stated."

This was later slashed and the State had to depend on additional allocation to meet its requirements, he said.Pointing out that Kerala produced hardly 10% of its demand for foodgrains, Mr. Vijayan said the latest cut in the allocation would lead to a crisis in the State. With only 46% of the population included in the ration priority list, Keralas allocation was expected to fall further to 14.25 tonnes, the letter said.The letter also cited the large number of migrant workers in Kerala, to demand enhanced allocation from the Centre. Mr. Vijayan said the government was committed to protecting the public distribution system in the State while implementing the NFSA."

Take a trip down Gandhi Road and you can never miss out on the number of silk sari showrooms that display their best variety. Our reporter goes on a day long trip to the sari town and captures the story of weaves.Every wedding in a typical South Indian family includes an elaborate trip to Kancheepuram, to buy the best muhurtha podavai for the blushing bride-to-be. As a young kid, this meant a day in another town, running across the narrow aisles as the women gushed over row upon row of colourful saris. Now as I step through the various distinct phases on a silk trail, organised by Jhoola Activity Centre, in collaboration with Co-optex, for children and parents, I finally understand what the fuss was about.These kids are lucky to learn the Kancheepuram silk story at such a young age. Kancheepuram silk saris have a history and profundity as rich as their appearance.Often considered heirlooms, these saris range from Rs 8,000 to over Rs 1 Lakh, depending on the weight, design and quantity of zari.A silk sari passes through several hands before you buy it at the retail store. The silk and zari threads are processed separately, and reach the co-operative society from where, based on designers expertise, the silk yarn and zari are distributed to respective weavers. Once the saris are woven, they are taken back to the co-op society which then sends them to retail stores. Kancheepuram has both co-operative (government-owned) and private silk sari dealers. The silk handloom industry forms a major part of the towns economy.Raw Silk ProcessingExtraction of silk Silkworms are reared on mulberry leaves and when they start pupating in their cocoons, they are put into boiling water. The cocoons produce individual long fibres that are extracted and fed into a spinning reel. Based on thickness of silk thread, 18-20 cocoons produce one silk thread. Presently, the silk weavers co-operative societies receive ready silk from TANSILK (Tamil Nadu Co-operative Silk Producers Federation)AHIMSA SILKA more humane way of silk production: cocoons are allowed to hatch naturally, or manually, and the vacant cocoons are boiled instead. This is called Ahimsa silk, as its a non-violent way of procuring the material. Making Ahimsa silk takes 10 days, while normal silk takes only 15 minutes and the process yields six times less silk filaments. Thus it costs Rs 6,000 a kg, twice the cost of normal silk.WHATS IN A KANCHEEPURAM SARI?A sari is made by hand-weaving silk and zari threads in an elaborate process. They are known for their strength and durability, made possible by the twisted yarn  double warp and double weft, which gives it the weight. In a typical Kancheepuram sari, the main body, pallu and border are woven separately resulting in a korvai or visible zig-zag stitch that runs parallel to edge of the border and pallu. This joint is woven strongly; this differentiates the Kancheepuram silk saris from the others. Nowadays, however, the body, border and pallu are woven together, and we get different colours in the border and pallu, thanks to tie-and-dye method, wherein a single silk warp is dyed in different coloursDYING UNITRaw silk is rough and sticky in texture, and needs to undergo a series of processes before it becomes fine and shiny. Raw silk yarn is received from the co-operative society. Based on the designs, yarn loops are de-gummed, dyed and dried before sending them back to the co-operative societies to be distributed to the weavers.1. The raw silk is rinsed thoroughly in normal water to remove dirt and soften the silk before de-gumming.2. Water is heated to 90C in a boiler and the steam thus produced is sent through pipes to eachtrough of water. In a day, about 6,000 litres of water is used. Its recycled using a reverse osmosisplant, thus saving water to a large degree.3. The wet silk is immersed in boiling hot water mixed with soap and soda to remove the roughness and dirt. This process takes up to 30 minutes, during which Sekar and Mani constantly stand by, in the searing hot and humid set-up and periodically twist and rotate the silk yarn with the rods to ensure even de-gumming. Finally, the silk yarns are taken out, twisted dry and kept aside. In one turn, about 6 kg of silk is degummed. In a day, they do over 70 kg.4. The process of dying usually takes about 15 minutes, based on the colour. Originally, natural dyes were used, but now chemical acid or metal complex dyes are used. Similar to de-gumming, the yarn is immersed in a trough filled with boiling dye-infused water and periodically rotated to ensure even colouring.5. The rich dyed silk yarn loops are removed, and washed in a normal water bath. They are then soakedin a fixing agent (for lighter colours, lime juice is used) and finally the silk yarn is spun in a machine to remove all moisture and laid out to dry in the sun for about 2-3 hours, after which it is bundled and sent back to the co-op society office. This whole process imparts a soft sheen texture to the silk threads.ZARI PROCESSINGZari is essentially a silk thread coated with silver (50-55%) and gold (0.5%), and is the most expensive element of the Kancheepuram sari. Previously zari was imported from Gujarat, but now zari processing units have opened in the region to meet the increasing demand. Weavers measure and collect required amount of zari according to their saris design, in the form of warps or wefts, from the co-operative society. Saris vary in zari from 10% to about 60% . The cost of the sari is directly proportional to the zari quantity.CENTRALISED DISTRIBUTION OF DYED SILK YARN AND ZARICo-operative societies hold all the dyed silk yarn and zari in organised, numbered storage. An in-house designer allots designs to weavers who then collect their pre-assigned silk warps and zari. These are measured and weighed before distribution. One gram of zari (called koolighai) costs about Rs 45, while 1 g of silk costs Rs 5.Making of a SariSIZING AND WARPINGThe silk warps are stretched across two bamboo stands. Each thread of silk is separated slowly to remove dust, the warp is looped and then immersed in rice kanji (diluted rice gruel)  this process is called sizing. After sizing, the warp is stretched once again for dressing and dried by exposure. This is an extremely laborious and specific process. It is usually done early mornings or evenings as the heat from the sun will cause distraction and sweat may harm the silk. In the olden days, there used to be a puli thoppu in between the weavers houses where this will be done. Presently, warping is done in house backyards. A bridal sari that was being designed with zari will cost up to 1 lakh!WEAVINGWeaving a Kancheepuram sari is a complex process and takes anywhere between five to 30 days. Every sari is woven by double warp (threads along length of the sari) and double weft (shorter threads along the shorter length of the sari), the combination of which provides the weight and strength to the sari. The warps are stretched across the handloom, while the weft is inserted by hand using shuttles. The threads used in weaving are in fact three threads twisted together, which adds to the strength. In the case of small butta, motifs in the body, pallu and border, the weft consist of zari threads, instead of silk. For preparing a traditional double side contrast border sari, three shuttles are used which requires an extra semi-skilled labourer.PATTERNS & MOTIFSBorder designs are drawn to scale on drawing paper and then traced on a graph sheet. Inked-in squares are marked on paper for portions where figures come. Adai cards are punched to the requirement of the design and are read by a Jacquard machine, which accordingly lifts the thread associated with the design thus creating patterns on the sari. Motifs in border and rich designs in the pallu are produced by pulling the lever connected to the Jacquard boxes of different hook capacityDESIGNSPopular border designs found are brick, birds, animals, leaf, mango, nayapaisa, sovereign etc. Local names for designs are: MORNING EVENING : A sari with different sized borders GANGA JAMUNA : A sari with different coloured borders THANDAVALAM: Stripes run parallel along the length of the sari KOTTADI: Checked squares or rectangle pattern The most popular colours used are blue, black, green and mustard. A popular bright blue colour, which was favoured by singer MS Subbulakshmi, has been named after her as MS blue!TEST FOR PURE SILKCut out a small corner, or few fibres, from the sari and burn it. If the smell is similar to burning hair, and produces a black ash-like substance, then it is pure silk. The logic is, silk being a natural product, will burn and smell like hair, another natural product. Artificial silk will smell like burnt plastic and produce black dripping soot.A MOVIEThe early struggles and difficulties faced by silk weavers of Kancheepuram before the co-operative movement was showcased in a movie, Kanchivaram (2008), starring Prakash Raj and Shriya Reddy. The film went on to win the National Award. Though the status of these silk weavers has improved significantly now, the film portrays a very poignant past."

Its not just about facing dearth of time, but unawareness in general, also plays an equal role in our negligence of getting the basics right. One such element that needs our utmost attention and understanding is the cooking oil used in our kitchens. Being the essence of the whole culinary process to us Indians, very rarely we see cooking oil striking a balance between good health and better taste. A perfect example which comes to our rescue here is the rice bran oil.Extracted from the outer brown layer of rice after chaffing, the rice bran oil is known for its high smoke point and mild flavour, making it suitable for Indian cuisine which revolves around stir & deep fried preparations.With each passing day, the oil is witnessing a continuous rise in its popularity, especially with the fitness-conscious consumer base.Considering the numerous health merits of this oil, it does not even come as a surprise. Medical research studies have found the oil to be associated with a high presence of Oryzanol in its component, which is a major contributor in controlling bad cholesterol and amplifies good cholesterol in the blood. It is because of this property, rice bran oil is recom mended to heart patients by the doctors. Apart from this, this oil is also believed to prevent obesity and its continuous usage results in good skin. According to Pradeep Chowdhry Managing Director Gemini Edibles Oil and Fats India Pvt Ltd,According to studies, Indians are more prone to heart ailments. Product like Rice Bran oil with its high Oryzanol content improves the HDL/LDL ratio, making it one of the most heart friendly oil. Oils such as Freedom Rice Bran oil aimed at the health conscious customer base - not only consumers with medical conditions, but also the health conscious segment which believes in eating right to prevent ailments.The oil also has a good balance of fatty acids and lowers bad cholesterol (LDL and triglycerides), increases good cholesterol (HDL). It is heat stable and does not require hydrogenation, causing less chronic inflammation and helps fight metabolic syndrome, says Dr. Shalini Reddy, MD, MD, FRCA Columbus Ohio, USA."

With the economy collapsing over large swathes, people migrate as a last resort. Its both a coping tactic and a survival strategy: the children and the aged left behind can use the few traces of water left, while the able-bodied earn a fighting wage in the cities.However, since the ration card has to be kept alive, the migrants return for one day a month to draw their provisions lest their names be scratched from the welfare list.A drought without end can lead to weird effects. In the village of Kutalapalle, for instance, along came an astrologer and said he knew why there was a famine. The 100-year-old peepul tree at the local Ram temple was higher than the gopuram, how dare it. And so the villagers chopped the tree in half and are now waiting for the rains to come.ANANTAPUR: Has my father come? asks Divakar, hope flickering in his tender eyes as he runs into his house straight from school. Ledura (no), he will come next month and bring you lots of toys from Bengaluru, replies his uncle Eswarayya. The 12-year-old dumps his bag, changes his dress and gets on his tricycle to ride along an empty street lined by an endless sequence of locked houses.Kutapalle village in Nallamada mandal of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh is a ghost town. Half the houses there are locked.You find only the aged walking about or kids playing in streets. The Kadiri region of Anantapur, straddling the mandals of Nallamada, Amadaguru, and Odisi, once populated by farmers, is now a seamless zone of absence, its populace gone to Bengaluru, Kochi, Chennai, Coimbatore and, if educated, the Gulf.Divakars father Madhav Reddy does visit his son once a month. But at his age, Divakar needs parental affection and guidance. We villagers are cursed. Our children are not fortunate, says Eswarayya. The uncle himself is planning to migrate next month. My cousin suggested that I do. We too have debts. The wages we get here are not even enough to pay interest, he says.The families all have similar stories to tell: loans borrowed, hefty interest paid, borewells dug, crops sown, crops failed, and then the drought  the straw that broke the camels back.The Scheduled Caste Colony in Kutapalle epitomises the tragedy. Out of its 50 families, 20 have migrated and more are about to move. Over 40 per cent of houses are covered in caked dust.Also Read: Upon astrologers advice, villagers in Anantapur cut down tree to appease rain godsMy son J Nagappa works in a factory. He earns Rs 7, 000 and my daughter-in-law works as a maid for a pittance. I take care of their children here, as they study in a government school near Kadiri. He sends me money monthly and clears our debts. What else can we do! laments J Gangappa, a septuagenarian, the wrinkles on his face thickening in frustration. A little away, Bhavani (55), attending to household chores outside her house, casts a curious glance. Visitors are few and far between here.She has a two-year-old grandson Vishnu to take care of. I have health issues, but I have to take care of my grandson. My son and daughter-in-law work at a mango farm in Rayachoti . We have a debt of `4 lakh. Sometimes, looking at Vishnu, I cry and wonder what crime he has committed to be punished like this. Our village is cursed! Bhavani sobs.The migrants visit for a day every month. They have to. They draw their subsidy rice and other essential commodities at the fair price shop and carry some to Bengaluru. If they do not draw their rations for three times consecutively, their names will be struck off the list.Thanks to deficit rainfall this year, more farmers are gearing up to leave in the next two months. The few who remain survive by selling milk and doing odd jobs that fetch them not more than Rs 100 a day. Most villagers work as farm hands for other farmers. Due to scanty rainfall, farming has stopped in our village. Generally, farmers do NREGS works like digging farm ponds, but now such works are no longer there, says N Sriramulu, a resident of Nallamada. Even if such works are available, it is a difficult business in the hot weather.Bureaucratic red tape doubles their misery. Sources in the irrigation department said NREGS bills worth nearly Rs 57 crore have been pending in the district for the last eight months.Much farther from the village, farmers from Singanamala region are also migrating in search of daily wages.

With lack of alternative livelihood options, the fisher-folks have started migrating to various cities, looking for employment as daily wagers. As many as 300 people have migrated so far after the ban came into force on April 14 midnight, say the fisherman association leaders.Srikakulam district has 197-km coastline, the longest in the state, covering 104 villages in 11 mandals with a population of around 50,000 and the fisheries department records suggest that there are 6,211 registered fishermen in the district.However, the ban imposed every year to facilitate the fish breeding season, have spelt troubles for fishermen.As the fishing ban is on, boats stay anchored to the shore in D Matsalesam village of Srikakulam district on Tuesday. (Right) Fishermen busy repairing nets | ExpressAs many as 300 fishermen from Budgadlapalem, Jeerupalem, Badivanipalem and D Matsalesam and other villages in Etcherla and Ranasthalam mandals have migrated to Vijayawada, Chennai, and other places in search of jobs. Not skilled to pursue any other occupation, they work as daily wagers during the ban period, says Maddu Raja Rao, a fishermen community leader from Sompeta.Though the government is paying compensation, its disbursal is not free from problems.Around 700 fishermen in the district are yet to be paid the last years allowance of Rs 4,000 per head. Fishermen who can not migrate owing to old age do the repairing of nets and boats during the ban, but the rest go out looking for jobs, says D Janaki Rao, a fisherman from D Masalesam, adding that some even go to Gujarat, Mumbai and Goa to work as fishing assistants as there is no ban in the Arabian Sea.The fishermen also pick holes in the enumeration procedure of the beneficiaries for compensation. It needs 15 fishermen to run a mechanised boat, but the government considers only six per boat when it comes to granting compensation and the move keeps around 9,000 fishermen out of the list of beneficiaries, points pout Maddu Raja Rao, citing the example of Kerala where the government gives 50 kg of rice and Rs 8,000 to each fisherman, irrespective of the number of people working in each mechanised boat.Meanwhile, the authorities say that the enumeration of the beneficiaries has already begun. Registered fisherman will get Rs 4,000 each as compensation. Last year, 700 fishermen did not get the amount owing to technical reasons. We will send the final list of eligible beneficiaries to the higher-ups soon, says fisheries department deputy director V V Krishna Murthy.DWMA project director H Kurmanath told Express that the fishermen would be provided jobs near their villages under the NREGS.

Nicknamed Birdman of Chennai, Sekar feeds about 2,000 parakeets every day on the terrace of his residence situated in Royapettah, the heart of Chennai.A camera mechanic, Sekar has converted his terrace into feeding area for parrots by setting up several rows of wooden planks on which birds sit and consume food. The thought of feeding birds came to Sekar's mind when he saw two parrots eating food on the terrace, which was kept for crows. The day Tsunami struck Chennai in 2004, I saw a pair of displaced parrots eating rice kept for crows and squirrels, Sekar said.After this, Sekar started keeping more food and in a few weeks hundreds of parrots started coming regularly. Since my terrace was not equipped to accommodate several hundred parrots at a time, I fixed several rows of thick wooden planks with the help of a carpenter and started feeding birds, Sekar said.After he created extra space, the number of parrots steadily grew and it crossed a thousand over a period. He had a hitch as his landlord was not happy with his activity. It was very difficult to convince my house owner since he was not interested in my activities. He accepted half-heartedly when I literally pleaded with him, Sekar said.With more than 2,000 arriving daily, Sekar spends minimum of six hours a day to prepare food and feed them. He gets up by 4.30 am to prepare the rice mixture, which he then places on wooden planks on the rooftop. Preparing food for birds is not that difficult since it is just a mixture of rice and corn. However, keeping the food on the wooden planks takes about one hour, Sekar said. By 6 am, it will be an amazing sight. Whether it is bad weather or clear sky, all parrots fly in and promptly have their food on Sekar's terrace.Most visitors and passersby, capture the event on their mobile phones. Sometimes even doves have food. Interestingly, they will not fight each other, Sekar said. The job is not over for Sekar. He again feeds the birds in the evening. I repeat the exercise late in the afternoon to ensure night meal for birds. Many start arriving by 4 pm and leave around 6.30 pm after eating food, Sekar said.According to him, cleaning the terrace and the wooden planks is the difficult part. It takes at least a minimum of two hours, Sekar said.Sekar makes sure that rice is cleaned thrice before mixing with corn. Every day Sekar uses about 50 kg rice to ensure none of the parrots gohungry. In these 12 years, I have skipped or missed eating a meal at times. But parrots have never missed a single meal, he said proudly. They are also my kids. I love them, he says. People donate rice and sometimes money.Sekar pointed out that during summer the parrot count comes down to between 700 and 1,000 since the birds will migrate for nesting. Here there is no place for nesting since trees are less. Besides, availability of water to birds in Chennai is also less, he said.Sekar spends about four to five hours on camera repair, which is the man source of his earning. I do not allow customers when I feed birds. Birds fly away if they see strangers, he said. I have missed several marriages and important functions of my relatives over the years, he said.He spends about 40% of daily earnings to feed parrots. If Sekar earns more on a particular day, he provides special treat to the parrots by mixing American baby corn in the rice. During 2015 December deluge, not a single customer came to Sekar.The flood is only for us and not for birds. Therefore, I was badly in need of money, especially during the worst flood period. My wife offered her jewels. I was able to feed the birds after pledging them, Sekar said. Some of my friends also chipped in and helped me, he said.Sekar's parrots did not miss their meal even during cyclone Vardah, which ravaged Chennai. Most of them came and took the food, he said. Sekar said during rainy season he will set up a makeshift roof arrangement on the terrace to ensure that food is not washed away.Sekar has a worry as his landlord has put up the property for sale. I cannot abandon my birds just like that. I have more than 5,000 vintage cameras worth several lakhs. I will sell them and try to purchase this house, Sekar said.Son of a mill worker and a diploma holder in electronics, Sekar came to Chennai 35 years ago dreaming to become an electrical engineer. He started his career by repairing video cassette recorders in late eighties.As he was interested in cameras and photographs, he started collecting vintage cameras. Now, he not only repairs all the latest cameras but also teaches aspiring students, who want to become photographers."

Sajeev, the Special Officer of its Mission Green Aranmula programme, said Oil Palm India Limited (OPIL) would procure the paddy harvested at the Puncha at Rs. 22.50 a kg. The OPIL will also market the rice at the rate of Rs. 80 (for rice with bran) and Rs. 40 (without bran).Mr. Sajeev told The Hindu that the department could launch cultivation in 101.02 hectares in Aranmula Puncha to produce rice valued at Rs. 1.18 crore this year. Efforts were on to cultivate 342 acres more in the coming months. The OPIL had already procured 46 tonnes of paddy from 10.5 acres where harvesting has been completed.Aranmula is harvesting the fruits of a mass movement to protect its paddy fields. The villagers organised themselves under the aegis of the apolitical Aranmula Action Council when the once paddy-rich Puncha faced conversion threat from the land lobby four years ago for an international airport project. B. Sugathakumari, poet, steered the popular stir to protect the paddy lands, wetlands and natural streams in Aranmula.The change of guard in the State too helped the cause. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar pledged to revive paddy cultivation and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan formally launched farming on October 29, 2016.Mr. Sajeev said Mr. Sunil Kumar would launch the sale of Aranmula Rice at at Aranmula in the first week of April. The paddy procurement price of Rs. 10.38 lakh would be distributed among farmers on the occasion."

Similarly, Murgan temple at Palani in Tamil Nadu is famous for its Panchamirtham. Most of the temples across the country serve traditional food as prasadam.However, the traditional prasadams such as laddu, jaggery rice and dhal pongal have become pass at a temple on the outskirts of Chennai. The Jaya Durga Peetam temple at Padappai serves burgers and brownies along with mineral water to devotees. The temple, spread over one acre, is in Oragadam taluk, about 40 km from Chennai.The stylish western type prasadam also includes cakes (without egg), sandwiches, vegetable cutlets, tomato salads and phulkas and they are neatly packed. The temple also offers health drinks, including badam milk.The food is cooked or baked in the temple kitchen, which is certified by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The temple also has a well-maintained dining hall. The prasadam, served free of charge, carries manufacturing and best before dates on every packet.The service is also hi-tech. Devotees can collect boxes of prasadam from vending machine installed at the temple's automated kitchen. The prasadam is a big hit not only among locals but also among devotees from different places.One man who has made all these possible is Dr K Sri Sridar, a herbal oncologist. Sridar, who established the temple, says that the worship place was like other temples in the beginning. However, he wanted to make the temple formalities little different not only for offering hygienic prasadam but also for attracting children to worship god.The kumbabishekam for the temple was performed in 1996. At that time it was like any other temple. When I noticed that priests were serving prasadam by hands, I thought it was unhygienic. Then, I decided to change it in my temple, Sridar said.To start with Jaya Durga Peetam temple offered hygienic packed food, including rotis, dal and mixed rice regularly. Later, I thought why not introduce burger and other attractive food items. I elicited the opinions of several people and the response was positive, Sridar said.But, when I started serving cakes and burgers as prasadam, I faced stiff opposition from some temples as they felt my act is against the temple practices as prescribed in the Hindu religion. However, I ignored them and went ahead with my initiative, which attracted several children. The opposition slowly died down, he said.We ensure that prasadam is not repeated in the week. However, burger, cakes, sandwich and brownies are severed only on Saturdays and Sundays so that children and students can come to the temple not only to worship but also for the prasadam, Sridar said.After performing pooja, every devotee will be given a token to get prasadam through the vending machine. Sridar was not satisfied with the introduction of attractive prasadams. He felt that the devotees should get clean drinking water also. I have made sure that every devotee gets 500 ml clean water to quench their thirst after they enter the temple, he said.The temple, which runs through donations, opens at 6 am and closes at 12 noon. In the evenings, darshan will be between 4 pm and 8 pm. Another uniqueness is that the temple has no hundi (cash collection box) on the temple premises. Even the priests will not receive any offerings from the devotees for conducting poojas, Sridar said.He said that by the grace of god they have not faced dearth of people coming to sponsor the day's expenses. On occasions, devotees donate for food and flowers for one week. We will pick the bill if no devotee comes forward to sponsor the day's pooja and prasadam. Daily, about 100 devotees offer pooja at the temple. On special occasions, the figure touches 1,000, Sridar added. However, he declined to disclose the amount donors will have to pay for the daily service.Explaining functioning of the temple, Sridar said, We purchase items required for a particular day and expenses are borne by donors. The payment is directly made to the shop, Sridar said.Not only with prasadam, the temple is slightly hi-tech in welcoming the devotees. Keeping with changed times, the devotees will have to register their names and provide their mobile numbers. They are welcomed by the temple authorities through SMSes. The devotees also get regular alerts on the important poojas and rituals that are to be performed in the temple on auspicious days.The temple's doors are open for celebrating events like birthdays. They are allowed to cut the cake and blow candles. Recently 82-year-old Subbulakshmi, who had never celebrated her birthday, came to the temple with her children and cut a big cake.As a doctor, Sridar says that elderly people, who want to perform ""Angapradhashanam"" (rolling on the floor around the temple) should check their blood pressure before performing it. Besides me, lab technicians will be in the temple to check the BP of old people. If the devotees are not fit, we will not allow them to perform Angapradhashanam, he said.The temple has already banned use of camphor and plastic inside the premises. The management provides hair driers for devotees taking head bath before doing Angapradhashanam.In the next phase of improvement, the temple management is planning smart card system for the devotees to enable them to open the door and enter the temple. Many ATM kiosks have adopted the same."

Vegans in Bengaluru meet up for a potluck and spend hours discussing ideas, political issues, recipes over a hearty vegan lunch at Cubbon Park.They have been meeting up since 2009 and the vegan community in the city has only been increasing. According to the vegans, there are roughly about 400 vegans in the city and majority have turned to veganism for reasons such as animal abuse.Veganism is a practice of abstaining from animal products and is also an underlining philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.Milesh Kumar, a software engineer decided to turn vegan in 2003 and had been living in the city for years. He read up on the plight of dairy industry and decided to make a concrete decision of turning vegan. His friends and family were not able to understand his decision but he was adamant. Realising the importance of keeping oneself driven in the choice made, he decided to look up for other people following the same practice.In 2009 it was easier to connect because of Facebook and soon enough an informal group was formed, ready to meet up and share a vegan lunch. The vegans have now started meeting regularly on the last Saturday of every month between January and November. December is the only month they dont meet because people enjoy vacations then.The upcoming vegan potluck will be held this coming Saturday on April 29 between 2 pm and 5pm. It is not important that only vegans should attend the potluck. Anybody who is curious can. Aakriti Gupta, attended a potluck two years ago when she was not a vegan. It took her almost half a year and a lot of contemplation before she decided to guarantee her path.There are only two criteria on attending the potluck. First of all the person should get his/her own vegan meal which can be shared with at least five people. The second point is that the person should take care of the utensils.Southie Food Can Easily Be Made VeganVegans will agree that most of the time people look at them in awe and question what do they really eat. Milesh Kumar has an answer for that. South India cuisines such as idly, sambar, rice, rasam are almost all vegan, it is just that it has not been identified as one. If you separate the dairy products from the South Indian food, everything is easily vegan, he says.He also argues that being vegan is not being deprived as most people believe it to be. We can enjoy the same food with different ingredients and now there are many options open. We dont drink cows milk but there are options such as soy milk, coconut milk, peanut milk etc. Last potluck I made rosogulla. I also ensure to take curd rice every potluck, the curd is from peanut milk, he adds.What being vegan meansBeing vegan means being compassionately driven to be responsible not just to avoid cruelty, shares Milesh who further adds how the animal industry contributes the most to greenhouse effect.Akriti learned about veganism and explored the subject with her husband. She was not so much of a cook at home but after she turned vegan she started cooking at home and enjoying recipes her friends gave her at potluck. It obviously takes more than one try to nail the dish though, she laughs.One of her favourite dishes is the pasta she makes by using potato, onion and cashews as the sauce. I add a lot of mushrooms because I love it and season it with the usual spices and herbs, she shares. Aakriti became a vegan strictly from the environment point of view. We constantly blame and question what the politicians are doing about the environment but we ourselves dont do anything. I wanted to change that about myself, she adds.As of today, we will find majority of vegans as adults who have made a choice by themselves.A countable number of vegans are children, because of their vegan parents. About one per cent of the vegans choose to the path because of the health benefits veganism is said to have. Personally, when it comes to health benefits, I have only realised that I dont catch cold as much but besides that I havent figured other benefits, shares Milesh, who says he turned vegan for ethical reasons."

People in India and Karnataka would know of Ragi, a close cousin of Teff.Teff as SuperfoodThe Central Food and Technological Research Institute(CFTRI)introduced Teff in India this year in an effort to promote it as a superfood as well as a means of easy source of earnings for farmers.Seeds of 19 different varieties of Teff were brought to India from the US Agricultural Department. After four years of trial and field testing, only two types of seeds (white and brown) were found to be suitable to Indian conditions and yielded high produce. These seeds were further tested and distributed to local farmers and the NGO, Art of living Foundation with the aim to help farmers earn profits from this in demanded International crop.Nutritional, High YieldingProfessor Rajasekharan, Director of the CFTRI says that the import rates of Teff are very expensive for the average Indian market.CFTRI is the first institute in India to introduce the crop with an aim to make it more accessible and less expensive to the citizens. Its extensive testing and trial began in 2013 after which the seeds were grounded into powder and sold to the farmers or seed providers who were interested in growing the crop.Since farmers and citizens are still not aware of Teff, the institute is focusing on increasing awareness of the seed in order to increase its demand on a national platform, says Rajasekharan.Teff can be substituted for rice or wheat and can be also made into idli or dosa. It can also serve as a replacement for yeast to make bread. Its nutritional value is very high with essential amino acids, albumin enriching protein and is rich in micro-nutrients such as Calcium, Iron, Vitamin C and others as well.Dr Deepa Prakash, nutritionist points out that Teff helps control lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and obesity as it is gluten free and has high resistancy to starch content that helps the body retain its glucose content for a longer period. Merely 100 gms of Teff a day compensates for the lack of Iron in ones diet. Teff has a very subtle comforting nutty flavour and eben I use it every morning as porridge, it makes me feel very energetic throughout the day, she says.Teff can be grown in the Kharif (June- July) and the Rabi (October- November ) seasons and is most suitable for drier zones as it is a drought resistant crop that requires a minimum level of water to grow. Its high nutritional value and high resistannce to diseases make it easier to grow than Ragi. We plan to make Teff a crop that is in high demanded and sustainable for all households, adds Rajasekharan."

With the economy collapsing over large swathes, people migrate as a last resort. Its both a coping tactic and a survival strategy: the children and the aged left behind can use the few traces of water left, while the able-bodied earn a fighting wage in the cities.However, since the ration card has to be kept alive, the migrants return for one day a month to draw their provisions lest their names be scratched from the welfare list.A drought without end can lead to weird effects. In the village of Kutalapalle, for instance, along came an astrologer and said he knew why there was a famine. The 100-year-old peepul tree at the local Ram temple was higher than the gopuram, how dare it. And so the villagers chopped the tree in half and are now waiting for the rains to come.ANANTAPUR: Has my father come? asks Divakar, hope flickering in his tender eyes as he runs into his house straight from school. Ledura (no), he will come next month and bring you lots of toys from Bengaluru, replies his uncle Eswarayya. The 12-year-old dumps his bag, changes his dress and gets on his tricycle to ride along an empty street lined by an endless sequence of locked houses.Kutapalle village in Nallamada mandal of Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh is a ghost town. Half the houses there are locked.You find only the aged walking about or kids playing in streets. The Kadiri region of Anantapur, straddling the mandals of Nallamada, Amadaguru, and Odisi, once populated by farmers, is now a seamless zone of absence, its populace gone to Bengaluru, Kochi, Chennai, Coimbatore and, if educated, the Gulf.Divakars father Madhav Reddy does visit his son once a month. But at his age, Divakar needs parental affection and guidance. We villagers are cursed. Our children are not fortunate, says Eswarayya. The uncle himself is planning to migrate next month. My cousin suggested that I do. We too have debts. The wages we get here are not even enough to pay interest, he says.The families all have similar stories to tell: loans borrowed, hefty interest paid, borewells dug, crops sown, crops failed, and then the drought  the straw that broke the camels back.The Scheduled Caste Colony in Kutapalle epitomises the tragedy.

Limiting the initial number of CEZs to two will ensure that limited resources are not spread thinly over too many zones,"" the draft action agenda said.""Moreover, a focused approach has better chances of capturing agglomeration economies and producing results over a relatively short time,"" it added.The zones would provide a business-friendly ecosystem including ease of doing business, especially, ease of exporting and importing, swift decisions on applications for environmental clearances and speedy water and electricity connections.Apart from conventional infrastructure, the zones would need to create urban spaces to house local resident workforce.The action agenda, which will replace the five-year planning system emphasised that social subsidies should be reoriented so that beneficiary become economically independent instead of remaining perpetual dependent on them.""Open-ended schemes that can absorb ever-rising expenditure and lack clearly identifies beneficiary must be avoided,"" it said.Noting that the smooth implementations of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and related reforms will help facilitate travel and tourism, the draft agenda said, ""We should consider placing tourism in the lower tax bracket of the GST to ensure competitiveness with foreign destinations.""Referring to agriculture, it said that the reform of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) Act needs a new lease of life.Farmers should get genuine rights for direct sales to buyers of all commodities, potential buyers should get the rights to buy produce directly from farmers, entry of private agricultural markets should be free, the draft agenda said, adding""an effective legal framework for contract farming should be established.""There has been an excessive focus on the procurement of wheat, rice and sugarcane at the expense of other crops such as pulses, oilseed and coarse grains, it said as Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have distorted cropping patterns due to their use in certain commodities in selected regions.""These distortions have led to the depletion of water resources, soil degradation and deterioration in water quality in the north-west,"" it observed."

Thanks to the unhealthy lifestyle we lead, we tend to forget the most basic activity of shielding our skin from the harsh UV rays. Most of us neglect applying a sunscreen but apply moisturiser instead and let our skin get exposed to the harsh rays.Covering the face with scarfs and applying 50 and higher SPFs (sun protection factor) is of no use. Most people understand that higher SPF mean higher protection, but there are a lot of misconceptions about spfs.For example, SPF 15 and SPF 30 are both common numbers and it is incorrect to assume that SPF 30 offers twice the protection or lasts for twice as long. SPF 15 blocks about 93% of the UV rays while SPF 30 blocks about 97% and SPF 50 blocks about 98%. Ideally for a normal skin exposure, SPF 15 to 25 is good enough. If the SPF is higher, it is damaging to skin as it has more of zinc and octobenzene compounds, which are harsh on skin and can cause patches and dehydration.Effects of sunlight:1.UVA can penetrate deeper influencing collagen which causes darkening and aging2.Too much of sun exposure damages deeper layers of skin. It is called Photoburn.3.Frequent and prolonged exposure can cause cancer too.Sunscreen and its uses:Sunscreen is nothing but any topical product be it lotion,spray or gel that can absorb or reflect sun's UV rays. Protection from sun dates back to early centuries where humans used plant products to protect themselves from harmful effects of sun. For examplem the Greeks used olive oil, while Egyptians used extracts of rice and jasmine.These active principles are being used in making sunscreens till date.All conventional sunscreens protect against UVB rays in particular, however those with broad spectrum have protection against UVA+UVB.There are two types of protection. Physical, which reflect UV rays. It was also called Sunblock (usage of this term is banned now). Chemical protection absorbs UV rays. We call it sunscreen.Sun Protection Factor (SPF) measures the fraction of sunburn producing UV rays that reach the skin. For example: SPF 15 means 1/15th of the burning radiation reaches the skin through the recommended thickness of sunscreen.Uses:Protection against sunburn/photoburn.Prevents signs of aging (wrinkles, leathery skin).Protection against phototanning.Protection against skin cancers especially SCC and melanoma.20 ingredients are approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as sunscreen. Minimising UV damage is especially important for children,fair complexion people and in those having skin sensitivity due to medical reasons.How to choose the right SPF and sunscreen:Fair skin people need a higher SPF compared to the dusky people or people with age-related, acne, rosacea issues. Sunscreens with higher SPF do not tend to stay longer than those with lower SPF and need re-application at least every two hours.Side-effects of sunscreen:Some sunscreen products like PABA can cause staining.Few people might have allergic reactions of the skin like rash,itching.It can make the acne worse.Vitamin D deficiency on prolonged use as it interferes with the synthesis by preventing the sun rays from reaching the Skin.Carcinogenic especially Zno and Tio2Sunscreen is an important part of sun protection regime which includes other measures like seeking shade, avoid tanning,protective clothing and UV blocking sunglasses."

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will lay the foundation stone for a dharmashala, the second to be built on the premises by Infosys Foundation, at a cost of Rs 60 crore.Chemotherapy may last weeks, months or years depending on the severity of the case.For the benefit of patients and their attendants, the municipal corporation funded the first dharmashala, the Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala, in 1984 which accomodates 400 patients. The Infosys Foundation sponsored the second dharmashala a few years later with the same capacity. Now, a third one will be constructed.There are cancer patients from North India who have to stay here for as long as one year for radiotherapy. There are already two dharamshalas, but they are inadequate. The new facility will have a capacity of 300 people. The construction will take nearly a year, Kidwai authorities said.On Saturday evening, a music performance for the patients was under way at Sri Venkateshwara Dharmashala.

Over 80 per cent of our rural area is connected to agriculture, our focus is to double farm income by 2022, he added.The clarification comes a week after a NITI Aayog member Bibek Debroy, opined that taxes should be imposed on farm income above a certain threshold.

So there is a huge market of 80 percent for organic products internationally, the Minister said.She also called upon start-ups to help in the aggregation of organic products grown in the state. Due to manpower constraints, the government cannot perform the role of aggregating products grown all over the state, Sitharaman said.She added that the white polished rice and maida products we consume now are gluten rich and full of carbohydrates.State Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said owing to the overwhelming response the first national fair has received, it has been decided to have another millet and organic fair next year which would not just be national but an international one.Another major decision we have taken today is to set up an Advisory Council that would advise the Centre on spreading the advantages of organic products and millets across all states, Gowda said.Commending the response the fair has received, he said that business transactions worth Rs 80-90 lakh had taken place during the 3-day period. In the medium term, it could cross Rs 45 crore and in the long term Rs100 crore, he said.Up to Sunday noon, the fair had 48,000 visitors which touched 60,000 by the end of the day.There was a carnival-like atmosphere at Palace Grounds with the numerous stalls put up by leading organic manufacturers across the state packed with eager shoppers."

This attracts the Common Jay and the Tailed Jay, she says. My curry leaf plant attracts Common Mormont.There are fascinating instances of Natures balancing act in a butterfly garden. I dont use pesticides because I do not want to upset this delicate equilibrium, she says. She gives the example of mealy bugs, which is commonly considered a pest. Hibiscus, which usually attracts mealy bugs, also attracts birds. This is because ape flies lay eggs on mealy bugs and birds come to these plants to feed on the flys caterpillar.If the caterpillars survive and grow into flies, then they eat the mealy bugs, she says. On the whole, the mealy bugs draw the birds and their numbers are kept in check. But if there are too many mealy bugs, then I use neem oil and soap water made from washing soap, she says."

The think tank has proposed the government should adopt the system of Price Deficiency Payment against MSPs without unnecessarily going for procurements.While MSPs may still be used for need-based procurement, under the price deficiency payment, a subsidy may be provided to farmers on other targeted produce, contingent on prices falling below an MSP-linked threshold, the NITI Aayog stated.The move has apparently come after reports emerged from various parts of the country that after bumper crops of pulses farmers could not get MSPs due to weak procurement mechanism following which they had to consider distress selling.A senior official of the NITI Aayog said MSPs for wheat, rice and sugarcane have led to the depletion of water resources, soil degradation and deterioration of water quality in the North-west regions. The panel also argued eastern states, where procurement at the MSPs is minimal or non-existent, have also suffered."

P. Gnanasekar, secretary, Toothukudi Town, who led the road roko in front of the Thoothukudi old bus stand, said the Centre should extend enhanced drought relief as compensation to affected farmers, who have suffered crop loss owing to monsoon failure. Crop loans obtained by farmers from cooperative banks and nationalised banks should be waived off irrespective of land holdings. Further, he said compensation of Rs. 25,000 should be provided to all families of farm workers since they had no livelihood source as agriculture had become unproductive due to monsoonal failure.The job scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (MNREGP) should also be extended to town panchayats and municipalities apart from rural areas with a hike of Rs. 400 as wages and increase in the number of working days too. The officials should ensure that the implementation of the job scheme was done in a fair manner.Under the free rice scheme, the quota should be increased to 30 kilos to help the poor, they noted.Moreover, officials should take adequate steps to ensure uninterrupted drinking water supply to people in all residential localities during the summer season, Mr. Gnanasekar said. Similar road blockades were held at Tiruchendur, Kurumbur, Ottapidaram, Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram and Eral. Later, those arrested were released."

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active corn Chicago Board Of Trade rose 0.5 percent to $3.73-3/4 a bushel, having gained 1.7 percent in the previous session when prices hit a high of $3.74-3/4 a bushel - the highest since March 8. * The most active soybeans rose 0.3 percent to $9.67-3/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.7 percent on Tuesday. * The most active wheat futures rose 0.5 percent to $4.29 a bushel, having closed up nearly 2 percent on Tuesday. * The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated U.S. corn planting at 17 percent complete as of Sunday, well behind last season's pace of 28 percent and slightly below the five-year average of 18 percent. * Soybean planting, however, was estimated at 6 percent complete, ahead of a 3-percent average for the crop that is normally seeded after corn in the Midwest farm belt. * Forecasts for rainy weather and colder temperatures in the coming days are likely to keep corn planting behind the average pace which may ultimately shift more acres into soybeans, analysts said. * U.S. wheat futures rose, led by the spring and hard red winter wheat contracts, as a weakening dollar raised hopes for better U.S. export demand. Slower-than-normal planting further supported spring wheat. MARKET NEWS * The yen edged lower on Wednesday, remaining under pressure as risk sentiment improved and safe haven demand eased, on relief over the first round of the French presidential election. * Oil prices settled slightly higher on Tuesday in volatile trading, then were mixed after hours when an industry group's preliminary report showed a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories. * The Nasdaq Composite hit a record high on Tuesday, while the Dow and S&P 500 brushed against recent peaks as strong earnings underscored the health of corporate America.

Police arrived at the scene to investigate an underage drinking complaint and spotted the vehicle leaving. Oliver opened fire as the teenagers were driving away.Shots from his rifle pierced the front side passenger window, hitting Edwards in the front seat, according to Edwards' family attorneys, Lee Merritt and Jasmine Crockett. His 16-year-old brother was driving.The Dallas County district attorney and the Dallas County sheriff's office are investigating the case. The race of the fired officer was not revealed.The Dallas County medical examiner ruled Edwards' death a homicide.Thousands of Facebook and Twitter users have posted about the case in recent days with the hashtag ""#jordanedwards,"" some comparing his death to other police shootings of young black men, such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, who was fatally shot in November 2014 as he held a pellet gun.Police originally said the teenagers' vehicle was reversing ""in an aggressive manner"" toward officers, but Haber said Monday that video taken at the scene proved the vehicle was actually driving away.The police department's latest statement, released Tuesday night, says officers entering the house heard gunshots ring out during a ""chaotic scene with numerous people running away from the location."" As officers exited the house, they encountered the vehicle backing out onto a main road and driving away despite their attempts to tell the driver to stop, the new statement said.Edwards' family had called for the officer to be fired and criminally charged.A family statement released Tuesday night called for disciplinary action against other officers who ""extended this nightmare for those children.""""Our family is working hard to deal with both the loss of our beloved Jordan and the lingering trauma it has caused our boys,"" the family statement said.Cindy Stormer, an attorney for Oliver, issued a statement saying the shooting was ""recent and still being investigated.""""Everyone should wait until the facts come out and we know more,"" she said, according to the Dallas Morning News.Friends have described Edwards as a good student and popular athlete. Edwards and the four people with him decided to leave what was becoming an unruly party as they heard gunfire and police were arriving, Merritt said, citing what witnesses had told lawyers.As they drove away from the party, Crockett said, the brother driving the vehicle heard multiple gunshots that were close enough to leave his ears ringing. It took a few moments before the people inside in the car noticed Edwards slumped over, she said. They couldn't tell if he was already dead."

I have written about the different aspects of village life, but virtually nothing about the people whose toil propels the village economy. I am always nostalgic about the time we had vast tracts of paddy fields. But who ploughed the fields? Who sowed? Who harvested? And who threshed and winnowed the paddy? The fields were ploughed by pairs of bullocks and buffaloes yoked to the ploughs. And everything was done by agricultural labourers. They lived in the Dalit colony. They were the people who knew how to sow the paddy seeds and how to transplant the rice saplings. They knew how to harvest and how to thresh.They knew how to plough the fields and their toil created the food grains we feed on. Without their toil, we wouldnt have been able to sustain ourselves. Usually the harvest called Kannikkoythu would be finished before Onam. The newly harvested rice would be used for Onasadhya. To me, the harvest was as important as the Onam celebration itself. We had around 10 agricultural labourers. They stood in knee-deep water harvesting the paddy. After the harvest, they would bring it on their heads to the threshing ground. Then the paddy would be threshed, winnowed and stored in our granary.If the yield was 1,000 kg, they would get 100 kg. They would share this among themselves. Each one would get 10-20 kg. They had to celebrate their Onam with it. How hard they toiled and how meager their income was! They lived in little huts thatched with palm leaves. Our cow sheds were thatched with palm leaves. Sometimes the paddy wouldnt be ripe enough to be harvested before the arrival of Onam. We would celebrate Onam with the rice of the previous harvest stored in the granary. The people whose labour produced these grains had neither granary nor grains to be stored.How did they celebrate Onam? I have written nothing about them because I have never been to their abodes. I have only seen them from afar. They were an integral part of our lives; they were direly needed to produce the vegetables we wanted, to look after our cows that gave us milk, to toil in our fields and yet I never bothered to visit their huts, to see how they lived. Village life for me consisted of the homes of the middle class who were/are the landowners and the spacious tracts of fields that belonged to us. Their space was beyond that, in the periphery. They still belong to the periphery."

Edwards, a high school freshman, had gotten into a vehicle with four other teenagers to leave a house party as police were arriving to investigate an underage drinking complaint, according to his family's attorney, Lee Merritt.Police first said the vehicle backed up toward police at the scene ""in an aggressive manner."" But Haber said Monday that police video shows the vehicle was instead ""moving forward as the officers approached.""Before Haber's update, Merritt and the teen's family held their own news conference, during which Merritt accused police of ""offering facts that they believe paint a picture that would justify the unjustifiable."" He later told The Associated Press that Jordan's shooting brings to mind the high-profile deaths of other black people after police encounters that have sparked outrage and protest in recent years, but that this case stood out for its ""sheer recklessness.""""This has happened far too often,"" Merritt said. ""We are tired of making the same rhetorical demands, of having the same hashtags.""Indeed, thousands of Facebook and Twitter users have posted about the case in recent days with the hashtag ""#jordanedwards,"" some comparing his death to other police shootings of young black men, such as 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland who was fatally shot in November 2014 as he held a pellet gun.Merritt said Edwards' family wants to see the officer fired and criminally charged. The police chief called for time to let authorities complete their investigations. Haber wouldn't identify the officer and didn't release his race, but said he had been ""removed from all duties"" and placed on leave.Haber also wouldn't release the police video or describe it in detail other than to acknowledge he erred in describing the encounter, but said he was troubled by what he saw.""I do have questions in relation to my observation on the video, and what is consistent with the policies and core values of the Balch Springs Police Department,"" Haber said.Balch Springs' official use-of-force policy encourages officers facing an oncoming vehicle to ""attempt to move out of its path, if possible, instead of discharging a firearm at it or any of its occupants."" The policy was posted online by 'Point of Impact,' a series on police shootings reported by freelance journalist Eva Ruth Moravec. It echoes advice given by the International Association of Chiefs of Police.Haber did not return phone and email messages Monday seeking clarification about whether he believed the officer violated the policy on Saturday night. The Dallas County district attorney's and sheriff's offices are investigating the shooting. A spokeswoman for the sheriff said its probe was in the ""preliminary stages.""The original police statement about the shooting said officers responded to a report of ""several underage kids drunk walking around."" It doesn't specify whether the passengers of the vehicle in which Jordan was riding were among them.Merritt said there was no alcohol found in the car and no evidence that the passengers had been drinking."

Their medicinal value makes us understand why our elders were not affected by the many lifestyle diseases. After leaving Bombay in the early seventies to settle in Kanhangad, Kerala, I saw huge jackfruits. Back in Bombay, we would buy pods of the huge fruit and get only a piece or two as it had to be divided among us four kids. And how we loved the juicy fruits and hoped for more! But here in Kanhangad, there was jackfruit, jackfruit, everywhere and one could have the lot, at ones will and pleasure.But one thing that surprised me was while I went completely overboard eating jackfruit in all its forms, raw and ripe, the locals hardly looked at it, let alone eat it, saying it created gas in the stomach. We had, in our plot, a tree producing nearly a hundred jackfruits annually. We were at a loss as to how to consume them. The servants wanted nothing to do with the fruits even if we were ready to pay them to cart away the whole lot for free! Then I decided to fry the raw jackfruit and consume it with pulses. The raw jackfruit can also be cleaned and stocked with piles of salt and filled in porcelain jars, bound with cloth, kept for months and opened later. Thus the fruit was consumed until it turned ripe.Then it was consumed as halwa. No plant will survive under a jackfruit tree as its leaves retard any green growth under its shade. But the same leaves can be used as containers to steam rice dumplings after they are woven as cups using toothpicks to bind them. Today, that old heavy jackfruit-bearing tree has long been cut down (the wood is heavily priced ) to provide the furniture for our house. But now, there is another jackfruit tree in our plot which provides all that is needed for my family. And strange to say, we all love it as do our grandchildren.Today, each good-quality fruit can fetch `100 to `150 in the markets of Mumbai and Chennai and even in small towns, those settled abroad are ready to spend through their nose to get a beautiful and ripe jackfruit. So I feel happy for those who sell jackfruit and even happier that the neglected, heavy, prickly and sweet-smelling fruit has finally found businessmen ready to tap into its great potential. Whether the jack of all fruits will soon become the king or queen of fruits, only time will tell."
