Corn edged lower, giving up some of Monday's gains, while wheat slid a third session, pressured by ample world supplies. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active soybean contract fell 0.4 percent to $9.68 a bushel by 0336 GMT. It touched $9.72-1/2 a bushel on Monday, highest since March 29. Corn gave up 0.3 percent to $3.64-1/2 a bushel, having gained 0.5 percent in the previous session. Wheat lost 0.3 percent to $4.18 a bushel, after dropping 0.4 percent on Monday and 0.2 percent on Friday. ""The crop report released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed corn and soybean planting above forecasts,"" said Kaname Gokon from brokerage Okato Shoji in Tokyo. ""Farmers are expected to continue planting at a strong pace. U.S. Midwest conditions will remain in focus even as we have record South American supplies hitting the market."" The USDA said soybean planting was 6 percent complete, well ahead of market forecasts. It pegged corn planting at 17 percent complete as of Sunday, also exceeding market expectations. Wheat was seen at 54 percent good-to-excellent, slightly behind expectations but ample supplies in key export countries continue to drag down wheat futures, which lost nearly 4 percent in March and are down 1.9 percent so far in April. There could be additional pressure on corn with improved weather in Brazil for its winter corn crop. The advance of a cold front in southern Brazil and storms in the centre-west growing region may trigger rains and bolster prospects for the country's winter corn this week, according to weather forecasters. The likelihood of rains in parts of Mato Grosso, Goias and Minas Gerais will maintain good levels of soil humidity in those regions, according to RuralClima. U.S. export inspections of corn last week came in at 1.45 million tonnes. Year-to-date inspections are 62 percent ahead of a year ago, according to USDA data.

He warned officials that delay in benefits reaching the people or corruption would not be tolerated. He urged the secretaries to monitor the works and guide district-level top officials like the Deputy Commissioner, heads of Zilla Panchayat and CEOs on how best to help the beneficiaries of various government schemes.You have been appointed district in-charge officers because of your experience in district administration. Visit your district once a month and review all the programmes being undertaken there, he said.Those secretaries, who are in charge of taluks which have been announced as drought-affected, will not only have to visit the areas, but also inspect and collect data on the number of cattle sheds and status of fodder banks.Officials have also been instructed to make arrangements to provide drinking water and provide employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Siddaramaiah also instructed officials to treat housing on priority and finish construction of houses at the earliest.Officials have been asked to check whether the flagship schemes like Anna Bhagya are being implemented correctly, as in whether ration shops are distributing 7 kg of rice per member of a family as announced in the this years budget.He also stressed on checking whether the Jan Sampark meetings to be held in each district by Deputy Commissioners were being conducted.Action against erring officialsThe Chief Minister has warned of stern action against officials if they delay processing of benefits due to families of farmers who have committed suicide.

Admeasuring 1,890 acres and housing a population of 3,029 persons, of whom 2,300 are voters, the village is home to monuments, ancestral houses, water bodies and a railway station. Incidentally, the south western railway line passes through the village.""Guirdolim is a peaceful village. Along with its pollution-free environment, its people are friendly, too. The village has water bodies which thrive with different types of fish. It has hillocks known for seasonal fruits,"" says Fr Simao P Fernandes, who hails from Marrod vaddo.Benedito Carvalho of Moll vaddo describes Guirdolim as a scenic village with a valley surrounded by hills on three sides.Guirdolim has history dating back to the pre-Portuguese period. It has a separate comunidade from Chandor, and consisted of vangodds or clans of Brahmin families. Naik and Kamat were some of the names associated with the old gaunkars. It is also said that at one time there were temples dedicated to Hindu gods like Ravalnath and Narayana.Guirdolim comprises seven panchayat wards and 19 'vadde' (traditional village wards) including Covatem, Kantem, Birbullem, Bandul Ponsabhat , Mol, Modem, Niamorod, Ghod, Mathodi, Gall, Revorda, Bacho, Marrod, Kotting Gainal, Moll, Roinibhat, Villa Formosa, Anthoi and Kollos. Guirdolim shares borders with the villages of Curtorim, Macasana, Chandor and Assolda.Residents' SpeakGuirdolim is special and blessed with its own identity. Along both the sides of the railway line lie its heritage structures. Many grand old houses, seminary and St Francis Xavier Chapel on one side of the railway line, while numerous other sites are on the other side of the railway line. This includes the Our Lady of Bethlehem Church, which, along with the market, are actually situated in Guirdolim, although they are officially located as Chandor.Melissa Fernandes, resident of Bandul PonsabhatGuirdolim is one of the most literate villages in Goa . It has an overall 90.09% literacy as compared to 88.70% across Goa. Our girls have done exceedingly well on the literacy front as they have achieved 94.24% literacy to 86.28 % by the boys in the village. Today, it is disheartening to see Guirdolim's fields lie uncultivated and barren because our villagers have given up agriculture.Luis R A D'Costa, resident of MollSARPANCH'S TAKEFor decades, the railway gate crossing, which remains closed at regular intervals, has been hampering free movement of villagers who want to move from one part of the village to the other. In particular, students studying in educational institutes and office-goers face a nightmare every day. The nearby villages like Chandor and Macasana also get terribly affected by the railway level crossing which remains closed for nearly eight hours every day. Immediate construction of the underpass will redress the grievance of the affected villagers.Vincie PeixotoHeritage TrailSt Francis Xavier ChapelSituated at Marrod vaddo, it was constructed in 1902 and was dedicated in 1903 by D. Antonio Sebastiao Valente, the first patriarch archbishop of Goa.Our Lady of Bethlehem Parish ChurchIt was constructed in 1645. This church is among the very few in Goa which celebrates the feast of The Three Kings on January 6 every year.Palloti Jyoti NiwasSituated at Bandul Ponsabhat, this four acre complex run by the Society of Catholic Apostolate (Pallottine), is also an important place for the youth of Guirdolim and Chandor to nurture their talent for music. The credit for establishing a music school goes to Fr Valentine Alphonso. Similarly, Fr Domnic Carvalho has recently started pioneering work of uploading Konkani sermons on youtube.Noxzon TollemLike Paroda canal, this large lake which today lies in a completely neglected state, used to play an important role for the irrigation of agricultural fields for vaingon or rabi or winter crops. This tollem was also replete with fishes like waghole (kite or ray fish), Velli (anchovy or silver belly), Kalundar (pearl spot), Palu (perch) etc.Manxer (sluice gate)Situated next to the St Francis Xavier Chapel, it is famous for fish like Shevto (mullet) Shetki (whip fin majarra ) Kalundar (pearl spot) etc. The annual auction held either in the month of April or May is a big draw.Carvalho HouseConstructed in 1891, the house belonging to Benedito Carvalho is situated at Moll. Similarly, Guirdolim is also home to other famous residences like Maestro House (residence of late maestro Remedios D'Costa) or late Dr Jose Jesus Maria Gomes.Old Primary SchoolThis century-old complex at Bandul, Ponsabhat, once served as the school of formative years for the villagers, but, today, it lies shut and functions only during election time when votes are cast.Mushroom GardenAn open air venue for weddings and parties situated at MollRailway gateThe area divides the village into two parts. It is not only an eyesore, but also a nightmarish spot because every day for a large span of time, it restricts the movement of the people when trains pass through.Renowned ResidentsLate Fr Benedito Rosario Gomes served as episcopal governor of the diocese of Cochin from 1874 -1877.Late Fr Balthazar Remedios do Rosario Gomes (1883-1966) was vice-superior of the Society of Pilar. In 1939, as the only surviving member of the Society of Pilar, he was instrumental in bringing the remains of Ven. Fr.

Corn and wheat rose as grain markets recouped last session's decline, although improving U.S. weather and ample world supplies kept a lid on prices. The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade was up 0.6 percent at $9.66-3/4 a bushel. Earlier in the session, it climbed to $9.68 a bushel, its highest since March 30. Corn advanced 0.8 percent to $3.66-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.1 percent in the previous session. Wheat gained 0.8 percent to $4.24-1/4 a bushel after declining 0.2 percent on Friday. ""Today's trade is driven mainly by dollar weakness,"" said one agricultural commodities analyst. ""The focus is on U.S. planting. We also have speculators holding large net short positions and that has left the market vulnerable to short-covering."" Large speculators increased their net short positions in CBOT corn futures in the week to April 18, regulatory data released on Friday showed. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's weekly commitments of traders report also showed that non-commercial traders, a category that includes hedge funds, increased their net short positions in CBOT wheat and soybeans. But on Friday, funds were net sellers of wheat and corn contracts, while they were net buyers of soybeans, soymeal and soyoil. The euro scaled five-month highs against the dollar in early Asian trading on Monday after the centrist candidate swept to victory in the first round of the French presidential election, reducing the risk of an anti-establishment shock in the final round. A weaker dollar makes the greenback-priced U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. While corn is likely to face pressure as U.S. planting weather improves while rains in the Plains are expected to benefit the hard red winter wheat crop. Statistics Canada pegged the country's all-wheat area at 23.2 million acres, down 0.1 percent from last year. The estimate was bigger than what traders and analysts expected. Canola seedings were forecast at a record 22.4 million acres. Farming agency FranceAgriMer said on Friday that 85 percent of the French soft wheat crop was good to excellent in the week to April 17, down from 89 percent a week earlier in the second successive weekly decline.

It was only later that she learned that impalement devices, just like the crucifix, were used for executions in the olden days and now rest as objects of veneration in temples. When she dug deeper, Abhinaya found that the spears have been an intrinsic part of folk religion and temples in southern Tamil Nadu , with impalement being the state punishment during the 6th and 7th centuries AD in Madurai.In the earlier days the condemned person's body was pierced lengthwise through a sharp stake and the victim was left to die a slow and painful death.Abhinaya found that the stone impalement devices in the Govindhankoil temple had engravings of the images of village deities like Muniasamy and Oorvalsamy. ""Villagers pay obeisance to these deities by making them an offering of millets, rice, fruits and coconut. During festivals pongal mixed with goat blood is offered to the eagles,"" says Abhinaya, a student of Suresh Sudha Alagan Memorial Government Higher Secondary School, who wrote a report on the tradition for her school's historical conservation centre.""The ritual of offering rice and blood to eagles shows that the impaled persons were offered to the eagles,"" says V Rajaguru, founder of Ramanathapuram Archaeological and Historical Conservation Centre and teacher of the school.On studying the worship of impalement devices across Ramanathapuram district, the conservation centre found that the ritual has a strong Madurai connection. The centre members came across many stone spears in temples situated between Madurai and Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram district. While engravings of impalement were found in Kazhuvanpottal near Mandalamanickam, village temples in Kannankudi, Govindanenthal and Mandalamanickam had one stone impalement device each on their premises. Another device was found in the sanctum sanctorum in the temple in Kalari village too.Considering the amount of agony involved in the punishment, there is a popular belief that lives lost on an impalement device become part of its divinity, says Rajaguru.The impalement devices were earlier made of wood, usually sharpened to the length of the condemned person. Historians say impalement was prevalent till the 18th century and vanished after the arrival of the British. Impales thereafter became objects of veneration. As wooden impalement devices rotted in the course of time, people carved out stone spears for worship. ""Many of these stones impalement devices have engravings of the victims, who are worshipped by their descendants,"" he says.Folklorist A Sivasubramanian says impalement is a characteristic ritual of folk religion. ""In many folk religion temples, birds like cock offered to deities are impaled on sticks"", he said.T Lajapathi Roy, author of the book 'Madurai - Mathirai' that chronicles the history of Madurai says impalement was a state punishment in ancient Madurai. ""Legend has it that Koon Pandiyan of the Pandya Dynasty (7th century AD) ordered impalement of 8000 jains. Although the legend is still being debated, Madurai temples had customs that indicate a similar massacre. During the annual festival of Meenakshi temple, effigies were impaled on sticks and taken around as part of a ritual called 'Samanar Madam Adakkal'. The ritual was stopped in 1974. Temples also had murals on the legend which were whitewashed during renovations,"" Roy said."

But it wasn't a house he needed or wanted. He was a teenager, living with his family in Delhi. After college, he moved to the United States to study at Harvard, where he worked for three decades as an architect. Ten years ago, he became a full-time abstract painter.But the house meant something to him and his family. More than four generations had used the 300-year-old structure, built high above rice paddies in the river's flood plain. But as family members went abroad or died, the house, named Meda , sat empty and went into decline.Its foundation and lower floor were made of porous whitewashed laterite stone blocks that during monsoon floods sank a little farther into the soft ground; perched upstairs, the ancient structure of Anjili hardwood was joined, as in Japanese temples, without any nails. Its peaked roof made of clay tiles from Mangalore effectively kept out storms. Over the years, Meda's three rooms and two wide verandas on the north and south sides sheltered the family members, who grew rice.""I still had an emotional connection to this building and was thinking of renovating it,"" Mr. Oommen said. ""But, even if I had raised it again, the land was unstable and no one in our extended family was willing to return to that remote location.""Mr. Oommen, 75, still travels to India, which inspires his painting, but he does not go to the house. Rather, he goes to an island called Mankotta that still has the unspoiled air of the time when he lived in Kerala as a boy amid landscapes devoid of modern roads and shopping malls.About seven years ago, Mr. Oommen decided he had to sell the house because his children did not want it. But potential buyers were interested only in the land, so they would have dismantled and sold Meda as well-seasoned timber and artifacts for tourists.He did not want that to happen. Fortunately, a friend, Pradeep Sachdeva, 59, heard about his predicament and agreed to buy the 2,000-square-foot house and move it piece by piece to his own 3-acre farm in Sadhrana village, south of Delhi, where he lives.Mr. Sachdeva, an architect, saw a future for Meda as a guesthouse at his weekend house. He is known in India for his interiors at resorts like the Samode Palace in Rajasthan, and in Delhi for the large urban renewal projects such as the Dilli Haat market and the 20-acre Garden of Five Senses. Mr. Oommen was overjoyed. ""I never thought of taking it apart and putting it in another location,"" he said. NYT news service."

He was a well-known geneticist, plant breeder and agricultural scientist of international repute,"" Dhillon said.""Athwal developed world's first grain pearl millet hybrid 'Hybrid Bajra 1' in 1965 that heralded a new era in cultivation of this important crop,"" he said.Athwal was instrumental in developing 'PV 18' in 1966 and the most popular amber grained wheat variety 'Kalyansona' in 1967, named after the village 'Kalyanpur' in Punjab where Athwal was born in 1928.Punjab, known as the 'Green Revolution' state, had heralded India's campaign to ensure food grain security for the country in the 1960s.Athwal served as founder head of Department of Plant Breeding in PAU, and made contributions to the genetics and breeding of pearl millet, wheat, gram and tobacco.A large number of genetic stocks developed by him made a significant contribution to future research on bajra breeding and genetics.In 1967, he joined the management of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines and eventually served as the Institute's first Deputy Director General. At IRRI, he introduced many innovations in rice breeding.The University of Sydney bestowed the degree of Doctor of Philosophy on him in 1955.In 1964, he was conferred with Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which is the highest Indian award in the science category.He was also decorated with Padma Bhushan in 1975 by the government for his contributions to biological science.

For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."

Beans, broccoli, blueberries, salmon, spinach, tomatoes, kale, walnuts and yogurt are some of the chief ingredients that make up most of the dishes.The diner has definietly stepped up the game in terms of healthy food and has gone beyond the regular salad to please the fitness concious and the foodies alike. The menu features appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts. We started off with the Fruits and Nuts Super Salad. The salad offers the crispness of te romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and broccoli along with the crunch and sweetness of the walnuts, apples, dried apricots, cranberries and blueberries. While, I have always been skeptical of salads, this one definitely made me rethink.I would any day prefer binging on this good looking salad that tastes beautiful with the crisp and crunch of green and nuts, seasoned with a pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette.Try the Pomegranate Honey Mustard Salmon. The lemon and olive oil basted grilled salmon filet is grilled just right with a crisp top and a very well cooked meat inside. The fish is topped with pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette. The dish is mildly sweet, served with couscous and ginner kale along with with toasted almond, cranberry and blueberry.This one will win your heart with the saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the dressing. The Cherry Chipotle BBQ Chicken too is cooked very well. The grilled chicked breast is flavoured with lemon and olive oil and is topped with tangy cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It is served with an apple five-grain pilaf and fresh broccoli slaw.If you are a vegetarian, dealing with an itchy throat or just having a bad day in general, ask for the Vegetarian Tex Mex Chili, like I did. The dish just fills you up with warmness and the tanginess of the sun-ripened tomatoes along with the substance of the beans.Like the name suggests, this is truly a Tex Mex wholesome meal made with chipotle peppers, red onions topped with yogurt, fresh pico de galloand jalapeno. The dish is served hot and spicy on a brown rice pilaf. We ended our meal with the Fruit Crumble dessert. Do I love sweet and sour blended in with loads of crunchy crumble? Hell yeah! The dessert is heavy on the sour side, but I have always enjoyed citrus flavours, so I had a gala time devouring this delicious baby.While scaling high on the flavours, the dessert will also appeal to those watching their calories. The crumble is packed with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and juicy peaches and served hot with a topping of vanilla frozen yogurt scoop.I would highly recommend foodies and the health concious to go check out this new menu.Cost for two: `2,500 (approx)"

It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

The name may not ring a bell among the new-gen Malayalam readers. You could be forgiven if the name sounds unfamiliar even among the older generation of readers.That may be the reason why D Pradeep Kumar, writer and assistant director, programmer at the All India Radio, Manjeri in Malappuram, took the pains to compile and publish Perunna Thomas kathakal, a collection of short stories by late Perunna Thomas, regarded as one of the great short stories in Malayalam, but forgotten since half a century.The book contains eight short story collections and a novella; From Aval, published in 1945 to Daahippikkunna Rosappu (1957) and novella Bhranthumoshanam.The stories were also most criticised during those times, especially by the Church, as they lay bare the moral turpitude of the clergy, nuns and the priests in the monasteries and the Church, says Pradeep, for whom Perunna Thomas was an inspiration to enter the media profession.As the son of T V Radhamani, who is the younger sister of Perunnas wife T Kamalakshis, Pradeep had access to the writers vast collection of books and magazines at his Kadavanthara house.Perunna Thomas, after a period of prolific writing for about three decades since 1945, abruptly abandoned writing following the death of his only daughter in 1965. When Perunna died, unsung, at the age of 55 in 1980, he was working on a big novel with an autobiographical touch in the backdrop of Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala.Aval (1945), Karutha Edukal (1949), Patelum Chiruthayum (1953) Ente Cheethakkathakal (1954), Mishihathampurante Valarthappan (1955), Pazhamayute Prethangal (1955), Karthavinte Aliyan (1955), Daahikkunna Rosappoov (1957), Enikku Dahikkunnu (1958) Karthavinte Aliyan, Daahikkunna Rosappoov (1957), Bhranthumoshanam (1968) are among the noteworthy stories in the book. In fact, Aval, despite not having its initial few pages, still retains its life.The book is not only a must read for the old and new generation of Malayalam readers, but it is also a historical document for Malayalam literature.A writer who was forgotten and his works lost in oblivion, was brought back to life. Pradeep Kumar, who compiled the voluminous book after a five-year-long research, should be congratulated for his efforts."

The lands are highly fertile ones, where rice is the major cultivation, In winter, alternate crops such as chillies, cotton and gingelly are cultivated.The yield is so enormous and they contribute major production of rice to the State bowl. The villages comprises of fertile lands surrounded by thick flora and fauna, water-tanks and natural streams are cutting across the agricultural lands. More so, under the Act if fertile lands are demonstrably shown to be required, alternate equivalent lands should be given to the displaced agriculturists.The compensation payable is 4 times of market value under the 2013 Act. Unmindful of the impact on environment, the government went ahead to conduct a public hearing through the District Collector, who had ordered the arrest of the villagers, who voiced their objections during the hearing.The affected farmers had also challenged the grant of no objection certificate (NOC) to the project before National Green Tribunal."

Four tender documents have been released on Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) website calling for supply of laddoos and other sweets and refreshments to mark the launch of the entire Phase 1.The tenders for these will be opened only on June 1. Assuming that a minimum time period of a week will be given to the awardees to ready their supplies, the tender announcement by far is the loudest hint that inauguration may happen only after the first week of June.BMRCL officials have been tightlipped on the entire matter for the past few weeks. Till last month, they had asserted that the inaugural will happen by May 31.In the mean time, CM Siddaramaiah invited President Pranab Mukherjee to inaugurate the project. But even the invite made no mention of the date. Later, any query on the inaugural date was tied to the Presidents schedule and unofficially, it was deemed to be sometime in June.BMRCL is also toiling hard to get the green signal from the Metro Rail Safety Commissioner, which is critical for the launch to take place.Moreover, only the North-South Corridor from Mantri Square Sampige Road to Yelachenahalli, including its underground stretch, is yet to be opened in the 42.3-km route of Phase-I.All tenders specify that Inauguration of Phase-I Underground Stations and Reach 4 is likely to take place shortly.In one tender, BMRCL has called upon hygienic service providers to supply 5,000 laddoo packets with two in each for general public; 5 kg of dry fruits for VIPs and 3,000 packs of Tetra Pak juices.Other three tenders call for these items: breakfast for 250 VIPs comprising snacks, coffee, tea, green tea, butter milk and water bottle; a similar supply for 500 staff members; and a heavy lunch for 1,000 security staff which includes one rice item and one curd rice."
5922ccfc7be9e01fc006eef1,Continuing drought hits foodgrain production,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/continuing-drought-hits-foodgrain-production/article18203540.ece,2017-04-18,"The present spell of drought, regarded as the worst that the State has seen in several decades, is likely to cast a shadow on foodgrains production, which is already on a downtrend given last years dismal show. At 74.77 lakh tonnes, the States production for 2016-17 was barely half of what it had planned (147.8 lakh tonnes).This is in stark contrast to the States all-time record performance of 130.63 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2015-16). Only recently, the Centre had honoured the State with the Krishi Karman award (for its performance in the year 2015-16).Tamil Nadu could draw consolation from the fact that its performance in foodgrains production in 2016-17 was better than what it was four years ago (2012-13), when the State was in the midst of a drought.In 2012-13, the foodgrains production was around 56 lakh tonnes. Even though there was not much variation in rice production (40.92 lakh tonnes) this time compared to the other year, the difference could be attributed to the States impressive performance in the production of millets, which was around 27.8 lakh tonnes.Last year, two factors were primarily behind the States woes: the poor realisation of Cauvery water and the failure of the northeast monsoon (October-December). Against the quantum of 182 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of Cauvery river water to be released by Karnataka during June-December, Tamil Nadu had received 67.2 tmc ft, leaving a shortfall of 114.8 tmc ft.The rainfall during the northeast monsoon was 16.83 cm, which was 62% short of the average rainfall of 44 cm.State steps inDespite the two factors, the production was facilitated by at least two measures of the State government, which had implemented packages for the short-term Kuruvai crop and long-term Samba crop at a total outlay of around Rs. 120 crore.For the current year, the State Agriculture department has scaled down its target of foodgrains production to around 100 lakh tonnes.Notwithstanding the steep fall in the foodgrains production, the State Civil Supplies authorities say there will be no adverse impact on the availability of rice through the public distribution system (PDS). Their optimism is based on the arrangement of the State getting rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which has stood the test of time and which has been reinforced by the States decision to implement the National Food Security Act. The States monthly requirement is 3.2 lakh tonnes and the authorities have informed the FCI that they will require 15,000 to 17,000 tonnes of rice every month additionally under the present circumstances. A senior official says the State government is constantly pursuing this with the FCI."

Please take the kid to a general physician, as these are symptoms of hypertension or a condition that is commonly referred to as high blood pressure. Yes parents, children too suffer from hypertension.A study conducted in 2013 by Dr Jasmine Sundar, epidemiology department, Dr MGR Medical University showed that 21% of children between 13 and 17 suffer from hypertension. I did the study a few years back with a small group of 400 students. The results were alarming. I will be doing a follow up study with a larger sample size, says Dr Jasmine.There could be various causes of hypertension. With modernisation and globalisation, our lifestyles have changed drastically. We are exposed to different kinds of junk food, and all these food items come with a shelf life, says Dr T Balasubramanian, MGR Medical University. He adds that too much of white food (salt and sugar) is bad for health and urges you to switch to brown sugar, jaggery and palm sugar. Our forefathers would manage with just two meals a day. The rice we eat today gets digested within 90 minutes. This increases our glucose level, and thats why we tend to eat several meals a day.Talking about the two types of hypertension  essential and secondary, Dr Sivasubramanian, a paediatric cardio thoracic surgeon with MR Hospitals, states that essential hypertension is commonly diagnosed in adults and has no known cause. It may be the result of multiple variables, such as genetics, metabolic and socio-environmental factors.Secondary hypertension (high BP) is a result of several problems like kidney diseases, coarctation (congenital narrowing of a short section of the aorta, the largest artery in the body that begins at the top of the left ventricle, the hearts muscular pumping chamber), phaeochromocytoma (a tumour of the adrenal gland), and hyperthyroidism that could be the root cause of hypertension.Obesity is another common reason for hypertension. In a study conducted in 2014, children from 51 schools in Chennai were examined and the results showed high incidence of obesity and associated it with hypertension.Ragini Srinivasan, a child counsellor recalls an incident where a Class 12 student with hypertension was brought to her for counseling. The nurse had presumed that the cause of the diagnosis was stress and pressure from studies. During the session, I noticed that the students family was very supportive. The child still felt tired and was complaining of a headache. He was then referred to a general physician. In my follow up sessions, I found that the child was diagnosed with primary hypertension and was on medication. Since the student was overweight, he was asked to follow a healthy lifestyle.It is often difficult to digest the fact that a child is suffering from hypertension and this often creates tension and panic among many parents. Parents generally do not take children for treatment because it is hard for them to believe that a young kid can have a high BP. They are also worried about societal judgements, which in turn will question their parenting skills, she adds.Whereas, Raju Joseph a parent, whose 9-year-old son suffers from hypertension, says, It is very important that we handle such cases sensibly and sensitively. When a kid has high BP, the first thing to do is to take him or her to a pecialist. There is nothing to be ashamed of. Nothing is more important than your kids health.SymptomsSevere headacheHigh levels of anxietyShortness of breathNosebleedTreatmentLifestyle changeLow sodium dietRegular exerciseMedication is rarely necessary in case of children"

Delhi police had earlier registered a case against Dhinakaran and his associates.Prakash was unavailable for comment.When reporters asked Parameshwara about the arrest of Prakash, he said, I have many close friends. What do you mean by close confidant? I can comment only after ascertaining the details of the issue. The police have acted in accordance with the law and the law will take its own course.A lesser known name in publicPrakash Veerapura Channappa is a relatively unknown name in the district but Australia Prakash is a well-known figure in political circles. Prakash is a native of Veerapura, a remote village in Madhugiri taluk. His father Channappa was a farmer and mother Puttatayamma lives with him in Bengaluru.His father-in-law Rice Mill Chikkannas popularity helped Prakash as he used to allegedly operate from the rice mill during elections to help Parameshwara win from Madhugiri constituency. He also took care of the poll expenditure, a Congress leader said.After completing a diploma in engineering, he migrated to Australia where he ran businesses. He befriended Parameshwara as the latter completed his PhD in Australia.With Parameshwara representing Madhugiri in the Assembly, their relationship grew strong and in 2013 he was made the deputy chairman of NRI Forum Karnataka. The Chief Minister is the chairman.Over time, however, his relationship with Parameshwara strained as the minister kept him at bay fearing his meddling in affairs, said an aide of Parameshwara."

To celebrate World Earth Day on April 22, Chef Prateek Sadhu has partnered with celebrated vegan chef Scott Winegard to create a ten-course plant-based menu.Winegard is the Culinary Director of Matthew Kenney Cuisine, a mini food empire that includes culinary schools and restaurants such as Plant Food and Wine (in Miami and Venice Beach, California), 00+co (a vegan pizzeria in NYC), and the Asian-inspired Arata in Maine. I know Scott since 2011 when we were both at Noma. (After completing our stint) we left for our own countries but we kept in touch. I have really admired what Scott has done in New York and on the West Coast, and I wanted to welcome him into Masque and give the Mumbai market a taste of what he has been doing, says a visibly excited Sadhu.Greening the palateWhen I meet them, Sadhu and Winegard are still in the process of planning the menu over a plate of white watermelon grown at Masques own farm near Pune. The plan was to get here, see whats available and then come up with a menu. This is my first trip to India and its a challenge to work with ingredients I have never seen before, says Winegard. Sadhu adds, We have been thinking about doing one course with this watermelon, maybe with ginger, kale, and a bit of soy.Over the past week, Sadhu has been sourcing ingredients from all over India  morels and saffron from Kashmir, black rice from Manipur, bhut jolokia chillies from Nagaland, palm jaggery from Goa, dark chocolate from Pondicherry, and plants and herbs from his farm. So what can one expect on the menu? This is a completely new menu where we are playing with a lot of different ingredients and we will be very spontaneous in what we create. Since this is the peak season for mango, we have a couple of things in mind. Instead of doing a clichd dessert we will be doing a main course, perhaps smoke the mango and do an interpretation of the mango som tam (Thai mango salad), says Sadhu.Another main course will feature sunchokes (Jerusalem artichokes) used in different ways. We will use the skin to make chips, slow-roast or smoke the artichoke and serve it with saffron puree, elaborates Sadhu. The pre-dessert will see the coming together of various flavours and textures  crispy black rice, crunchy 75% dark chocolate, and creamy ice cream made from black rice and palm jaggery.Drinks to matchThe chefs have teamed up with Belvedere Vodka to create special cocktails for this menu. We partnered with Belvedere because we know their philosophy is similar to ours and they too work directly with farmers to produce their spirits, says Sadhu. The plant-based cocktails will use farm produce such as kale and cucumber, and will be mixed with housemade syrups. One of the cocktails we are planning is the Belvedere cucumber and thyme spritz, a great aperitif style drink where the aromatic freshness of cucumber contrasts with the vegetal notes of thyme. This drink pairs brilliantly with fresh, uncooked foods, says Rohan Jelkie, brand ambassador for Moet Hennessy India (which distributes Belvedere Vodka in India).To complete the World Earth Day experience, Masque will be converted into a plant lab of sorts, with vertical wall gardens from which the ingredients for both the food and drinks will be sourced. We are making three big plant installations so when people come in and see the greenery all around, they get a feel for the kind of food to expect, and this starts their dining experience, Sadhu elaborates. The meal promises to be an exciting proposition. This collaboration is a way of exchanging ideas from two different parts of the world. We want to give the diners a great vegetarian experience, asserts Sadhu.Call 24991010 / 9819069222 for reservations, The ten-course meal will be available for dinner on April 22 and for lunch and dinner on April 23 at Masque, Mahalaxmi"

The movements of these vehicles are monitored on a regular basis from the central command control centre in Civil Supplies Bhavan here. But now, some unscrupulous elements have taken to the rail route to divert the subsidy rice to the open market in neighbouring states.The enforcement teams have caught at least five gangs trying to divert the rice through trains in April. Tip offs revealed the gangs were attempting to take the rice in other bags (not PDS gunny bags).Interrogation and preliminary investigation into this new method of diversion through rail revealed the modus operandi of the gangs. Officials said these gangs are buying rice from the consumers directly at Rs 6 to Rs 8 per kg and were taking them to Maharashtra where they would sell it in the open market for Rs18 per kg to Rs 21 per kg.In some cases, gangs admitted that they exchange rice for wheat in Maharashtra. This rice is also finding its way to Andhra Pradesh and other states through trains, and also by road. Officials said every effort is being made to check this as this PDS rice is also being exported to African countries from the Kakinada Port in Andhra Pradesh.Officials admitted that that there are thousands of white card holders in Greater Hyderabad and other districts who are above poverty line. They are taking their quota of rice from Fair Price Shops every month to keep the white card in continuation and avail government benefits and other schemes.""These people are selling the rice to gangs. As identification of such above BP line card holders is not possible without the involvement of Fair Price Shop dealers, the enforcement teams are now probing the role of FPS dealers. No one will be spared,"" said officials.""The diversion has come down to a large extent but lot more needs to be checked,"" Civil Supplies Commissioner C V Anand said."

""Now, owing to the pollution in the lake, we hardly have healthy crops.Also, many residents living around the lake have been diagnosed with malaria and dengue, owing to the large number of mosquitoes here,"" he said.""Trucks would come here and dump garbage.But we managed to chase some of them away,"" Govindraju added. Another resident said that complaints to the BBMP to look into the situation had not yielded desired results.WILL BELLANDUR TRASH FIND ITS WAY HERE, ASK CITIZENSAlthough orders have been passed to penalise those found dumping garbage at Bellandur Lake, citizens fear that this could lead to trash finding its way to the Varthur Lake downstream.On Thursday, police seized nine VARTH trucks filled with mud and debris. ""The drivers had come to the lake to dump waste. The drivers have been detained for questioning, and we have seized the truck documents. We have registered a complaint at the Varthur police station, and investigation into the case is under way,"" said inspector AB Sudharkar. Pointing towards a hoarding that was installed in the lake, MLA Arvind Limbavalli said, ""We UR LAKE have complained to the BBMP several times about this, but no action has been taken. Also, the access road to the lake is illegal, which has been created by dumping mud on the lakebed.""BELLANDUR LAKE o Hydrogeologist and former p`WHO IS MONITORING FOOTAGE FROM CCTV CAMERAS?'Residents in areas living around Bellandur Lake said that they had not noticed much activity after work started on the waterbody on Monday. Seema Sharma, a resident, said that she had been monitoring the progress of the clean-up operation. ""The officials appear not to have understood the spirit of NGT's judgement. The mesh and fence that has been erected along one side of the lake is of little use, since people can still dump garbage.CCTV cameras have been installed around the lake but who is monitoring the footage?"" she asked. Hydrogeologist and former expert member of the Karnataka Groundwater Authority KC Subhash Chandra opined that cleaning one lake would not solve the problem.""In the case of Bellandur Lake, just treating sewage water that enters won't solve the problem. To ensure this lake is free of pollutants, all the lakes have to be cleaned. Also, only sewage water treated to the extent of being fit to drink must be permitted into the lake. Stormwater drains (SWDs) that are supposed to carry water only in the monsoon season are full of debris, and sewage water flows throughout the year, the lakes,"" he said."

The gingelly oil would be heated in a cast iron vessel, and pounded on my head by my grandmother, mother, or Meenakshi, our squat aayah. The gingelly oil would be replaced with kerosene when either my sister or I came home with lice. (My sister, bless her, took great pleasure in chasing me around the house on kerosene days with a box of matches in her hand, insisting that the treatment was only effective if the lice were burned to death.)The oil, once poured, was rhythmically drummed in with slaps and thumps, the intensity of which varied, depending on the mood of the person administering the massage. You would then be left in the bathroom, half blinded by the oil which had seeped into your eyes with a bowl of homemade powder (shikakai) and an unguent made of moong dal powder and other nice smelling things.Of course, I identify all of this as nice smelling now, but back then I hated it. I wanted to use the Body Shop shower gel from Singapore. The shikakai dries up and flakes out of my head and makes it look like i have brown dandruff Id whine. kozhambu again? Id groan.Post bath, homemade perfume (sambrani) was wafted through my hair, and i would hold my nose as a green kashayam was administered. After all of this, if you hadnt gone in to a catatonic state yet there was the aforementioned lunch.Why am I thinking of all of this? My parents just left after a two weeks stay with us during which my children were treated to (or in my younger sons mind, tortured with) multiple oil baths. The boys had a new experience, as in our home rituals are like winged unicorns. They dont exist. Baths and brushing teeth is a punishment and something to weasel out of or negotiate over: Ill brush my teeth if I can have 5 more minutes of screen time! Not that their grandmother was not interested in negotiations.In her no-nonsense demeanour that I remember from long ago, she corralled two slippery boys into the bathroom and proceeded to render them even more slippery with copious amounts of oil. Sucks the heat right out, my mother would mutter. This was new for the boys, as in our home, oil application is usually a quick squirt from a bottle of Parachute onto their head before a swim.My parents have returned and this morning, I attempted to coax the boys into having an oil bath. They looked at me and said that they would wait till their grandmothers next trip to have one and went back to playing with their Lego.Ah well. Some rituals are weekly and others take place twice a year. Amma, the boys are waiting.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"

Corn is set for a weekly gain, recouping last week's decline, although the outlook for a boost to U.S. planting from dry weather kept a lid on the market. The Chicago Board Of Trade's most-active wheat contract is up 2.7 percent this week, the biggest gain in 11 weeks. Corn is up 1.4 percent, recouping much of last week's losses and soybeans are down 0.4 percent, the first weekly decline in three weeks. ""There is adverse cold weather for the U.S. winter wheat crop which is reflected in the price action today,"" said Kaname Gokon from brokerage Okato Shoji in Tokyo. ""For corn we are expecting planting activity to accelerate in the U.S. as it gets dry."" Wheat prices climbed on worries that frigid temperatures in the central and southern Plains could damage the developing crop hard red winter wheat (HRW) crop. Low temperatures in north-central Kansas, the top HRW state, are expected to be in the mid- to upper-20s (Fahrenheit), according to the Commodity Weather Group. Corn is under pressure on forecasts that removed some of the rain expected in early May, easing fears of planting delays. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday reported net corn export sales hit a three-week high last week and soybean sales hit a one-month peak, with old-crop deals for both crops topping trade expectations. Large supplies continue to weigh on grain markets. The International Grains Council, in a monthly report on Thursday, raised its forecast for the 2017/18 global grains crop by 4 million tonnes to 2.054 billion tonnes, down from 2.111 billion in 2016/17. Stronger-than-expected soybean yields across Argentina could more than make up for the 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) lost to flooding and drought this season, Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said in its weekly crop report on Thursday. The 2016-17 soy harvest advanced by 16 percentage points over the last week to a total 32.3 percent of planted area, the report said.

Despite repeated pledges to rip up, renegotiate or otherwise alter them, the US has yet to withdraw from any of these economic, environmental or national security deals, as Trump's past criticism turns to tacit embrace of several key elements of US foreign policy.The administration says it is reviewing these accords and could still pull out of them. Yet with one exception an Asia- Pacific trade deal that already had stalled in Congress Trump's administration quietly has laid the groundwork to honor the international architecture of deals it has inherited.It's a sharp shift from the days when Trump was declaring the end of a global-minded America that negotiates away its interests and subsidizes foreigners' security and prosperity. Even as Trump railed Thursday against the North American Free Trade Agreement, there was little indication that he was actively pushing for wholesale changes. As a candidate, Trump threatened to jettison the pact with Mexico and Canada unless he could substantially renegotiate it in America's favor.""The fact is, NAFTA, whether it's Mexico or Canada, is a disaster for our country,"" Trump said Thursday during an event on steel imports. Of a dispute with Canada over dairy exports, he added: ""We're not going to let it happen.""Yet Trump's administration has been focused on marginal changes that would preserve much of the existing agreement, according to draft guidelines that Trump's trade envoy sent to Congress. To the dismay of NAFTA critics, the proposal preserves a controversial provision that lets companies challenge national trade laws through private tribunals.Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University, said Trump may be allowing himself to argue in the future that existing deals can be improved without being totally discarded. ""That allows him to tell his base that he's getting a better deal than Bush or Obama got, and yet reassure these institutions that it's really all being done with a nod and a wink, that Trump doesn't mean what he says,"" Brinkley said. So far, there's been no major revolt from Trump supporters, despite their expectation he would be an agent of disruption. This week's reaffirmations of the status quo came via Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's certification of Iran upholding its nuclear deal obligations and the administration delaying a decision on whether to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.The president had previously spoken about dismantling or withdrawing from both agreements as part of his vision, explained in his inaugural address, that ""every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""Trump had called the Iran deal the ""worst"" ever, and claimed climate change was a hoax. But in place of taking action, the Trump administration is only reviewing these agreements, as it is doing with much of American foreign policy.A day after certifying Iran's compliance with the nuclear deal, Tillerson attacked the accord Wednesday and listed examples of Iran's bad behavior. His tone suggested that even if Iran is fulfilling the letter of its nuclear commitments, the deal remains on unsure footing.The Iran certification, made 90 minutes before a midnight Tuesday deadline, means Tehran will continue to enjoy relief from US nuclear sanctions. Among the anti-deal crowd Trump wooed in his presidential bid, the administration's decision is fueling concerns that Trump may let the 2015 accord stand.Yet Tillerson sought to head off any criticism that the administration was being easy on Iran, describing a broad administration review of Iran policy that includes the nuclear deal and examines if sanctions relief serves US interests.The seven-nation nuclear deal, he said, ""fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran"" and ""only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.""On the climate agreement, the White House postponed a meeting Tuesday where top aides were to have hashed out differences on what to do about the nonbinding international deal forged in Paris in December 2015. The agreement allowed rich and poor countries to set their own goals to reduce carbon dioxide and went into effect last November, after the US, China and other countries ratified it. Not all of Trump's advisers share his skeptical views on climate change or the Paris pact.Trump has followed through with a pledge to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a sweeping free trade deal President Barack Obama negotiated. The agreement was effectively dead before Trump took office after Congress refused to ratify it. Even Trump's Democratic opponent in the presidential race, Hillary Clinton, opposed the accord.But on NATO, Trump has completely backed off his assertions that the treaty organization is ""obsolete."" His Cabinet members have fanned out to foreign capitals to show America's support for the alliance and his administration now describes the 28-nation body as a pillar of Western security."

A single-member family will get 7 kg of rice, while a 10 member family will get 70 kg a month, Kumuda Sharath, Deputy Director, Department of Food and Civil Supplies, told The Hindu.Vigilance committees have been formed across the district to prevent irregularities in the public distribution system (PDS).

This is more so where the traditional lifestyle associated with an agro-economy has remained unchanged. In Mysuru city, sparrows can still be found in places such as Santhepet, Nanjumalige, around Devaraja Market, and Agrahara besides in Bandipalya apart from the city outskirts in Bogadi, Yelwal, Hinkal, and Alanahalli where sparrows are quite common, according to Tanuja, an amateur ornithologist and an eco-educationist.Though these birds are still not considered endangered, they have become locally extinct in urban areas across India due to change in lifestyle and the emergence of modern architecture, she said.Sparrows thrive in areas where they find grain and in olden days sifting grain was a common activity in every household. Besides, the husk and the spill over rice used to be left behind for the sparrows to feed on and the sparrows had developed a commensal relationship with human habitations.But the growing preference for cleaned, polished and packed rice over the years obviated the need for de-husking and sifting and hence a major source of food supply to sparrows gradually declined, forcing them to retreat to more favourable areas. Hence they are found only where the traditional lifestyle has not changed, said Ms. Tanuja.Hence, large flocks of the adorable sparrows can also be sighted in the hinterland of H.D. Kote, Periyapatna, K.R. Nagar and so on with semi-urban characteristics. While their foraging habits hinged on human activity, shelter was also closely knit with the traditional architectural style like tiled roof with ample space between the wall and the roof separated by wooden beams.The emergence of modular architecture with its emphasis on use of glass, RCC and skylights for ventilation rung the death knell for the sparrows in urban areas, according to D. Rajkumar of Wildlife Conservation Foundation. Unlike pigeons, sparrows are short distance flyers and hence their survival hinges on availability of food and shelter.There are many places in Mysuru where people keep bird boxes at vantage points with adequate feed and water. But more than sparrows they tend to attract other species of birds, said Ms. Tanuja, which reinforce the decline of sparrows in urban areas."

It earns Trump the dubious distinction of being the first president since Richard Nixon to fire the official overseeing an investigation involving the commander in chief. And it cements a clear pattern of a man willing to challenge  in dramatic fashion  the institutions created to hold the president accountable.""That's why this is unprecedented,"" said Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian. ""He's showed signs of not having a great deal of respect for the system by which this investigation has been operating.""Yet Trump faces plenty of risk. If he intended to defuse the FBI investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russia in last year's election, firing Comey may well have the opposite effect. Outraged Democrats swiftly called for an independent prosecutor, and some apprehensive Republicans said they, too, were disturbed by the president's decision.""I am troubled by the timing and reasoning of Comey's termination,"" said Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who is overseeing one of the congressional investigations into Russia's election interference.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said he'd spent hours trying to find ""an acceptable rationale"" for Trump's decision. ""I just can't do it,"" he said.Trump attained his White House goal after a decades-long career in business during which he was accountable to few people other than himself. Thus, he has chafed at the constitutionally mandated constraints on the presidency. Within days of taking the oath of office, he suddenly fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates  a career Justice Department official  after she refused to defend the White House's controversial travel and immigration ban. When the federal courts blocked that measure as well, Trump aggressively castigated individual judges as political actors and challenged the court's role in curbing a president's policies.No matter which president originally appoints them  Comey was tapped by Barack Obama in 2013  almost all FBI directors are allowed to serve out their full 10-year terms under successor commanders in chief. Bill Clinton is the only other president to fire an FBI chief, amid questions about the director's use of FBI aircraft for personal purposes.The Trump White House cited Comey's handling of last year's investigation into Hillary Clinton's email practices as the cause for the firing, and, to be sure, Comey left himself vulnerable.He was widely criticized for heavy-handed and high-profile decisions in the case, particularly when he sent a letter to Congress 10 days before the election saying the bureau was looking at new information related to the inquiry. He said at the time that the new information related to emails found on a laptop belonging to the husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, the disgraced congressman Anthony Weiner.At the time, Trump praised Comey for having ""guts"" and doing ""the right thing,"" statements that complicate his assertion that now, seven months later, Comey's decisions warranted firing.Trump's announcement came as Comey was again facing criticism, this time for telling congressional lawmakers that Abedin had forwarded ""hundreds or thousands"" of emails to the laptop. On Tuesday, hours before Trump fired Comey, the FBI told lawmakers that the director was wrong, and Abedin had forwarded only a ""small number"" of emails.Although Democrats blame Comey for Clinton's loss, they are unlikely to accept Trump's explanation for the firing.The president has repeatedly dismissed Comey's Russia investigation  as well as the congressional inquiries  as a ""hoax."" He's also insisted that he is not personally under investigation  asserting Tuesday that Comey told him three times that he was not a target  though the FBI has stated unequivocally that the president's campaign and his associates are facing scrutiny.""This is Nixonian,"" said Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa.Jimmy Gurule, a former assistant attorney general who was appointed by President George H.W. Bush, said Trump's decision ""threatens our democracy and undermines the integrity of the FBI investigation."" Gurule is now a law professor at the University of Notre Dame.Nixon's decision had a ripple effect throughout his administration, with the attorney general and deputy attorney general resigning rather than carry out the president's orders. There was no such response from Trump's White House aides and other top administration officials.""We haven't had a voice from within the Trump administration denounce this yet,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. ""I think at this moment the question is, will leading Republicans step out of the box and become profiles of courage?""In the immediate aftermath of Trump's announcement, many Republicans appeared more inclined to back his decision, citing their own concerns with Comey's stewardship of the FBI following months of controversy.None of the Republicans who did raise concerns were rushing to draw comparisons to Nixon, the only president to resign from office. Yet they, too, appeared troubled by Trump's decision and wary of the prospect of White House interference in an investigation involving the president.Comey's ""removal at this particular time will raise questions,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. It is essential, he said, that ongoing investigations are full ""and free of political interference until their completion."""

After receiving the message she left for home and forgot about it until a week later she received another message bill saying that she has purchased wheat, when she did not.Beneficiaries of the States Public Distribution System (PDS) have been receiving bogus message bills for items they have not purchased from the ration shop. They fear that the retail staff illegally sell their share of the product on the black market and simply bill it under the card of somebody who has not purchased that commodity.Another resident of Villivakkam faced a similar problem. He purchased pulses and sugar and received a bill for the same. However, a few days later, he got a message bill stating that he had purchased palm oil as well. I never use palm oil; so I never buy it. After this incident, I bought the oil and gave it to a poor family nearby. I dont want fair price products to be sold illegally at higher cost, he said adding that he fears that distribution of his PDS smart card may get detained if he lodges a complaint.The situation is prevalent elsewhere in the State too. Speaking to Express in Madurai, B Selvam said his wife went to the ration shop last month to purchase dal and returned due to lack of stock. A few days later I received an SMS stating that I have purchased dal and palm oil using my ration card. I was shocked to see this and went to my ration shop and enquired about it but the employee brushed it aside, saying I received the text perhaps due to a technical glitch. When I was discussing this issue with a friend, he told me that he had recently purchased two items from the ration shop and when he came home he received an SMS saying that he had purchased four items from the ration shop, he claimed.The local official at Madurai denied malpractices in the e-PDS system and said that there are certain technical problems in linking the peoples mobile number to their ration cards. However, officials at the headquarters in Chennai admitted that there is a possibility of fraud and encouraged people to report such incidents so that the Civil Supplies-CID could investigate the case.Digitisation of the PDS has increased reporting of such incidents, according to a senior official in the Civil Supplies Corporation. People are aware of the illegal sales because of the message-bill and we encourage people to report such incidents, the official said adding that entire system from stock procurement to sales would be updated real-time digitally in a year.We are working towards increasing transparency in order to prevent such bogus sales of our products in black market, the official said, noting citizens may be unaware of the fraud or technical error that happens in their name if their mobile number is not linked with their cards."

The name itself - Shizu San - refers to a fictional traveller or collector of maps, who has travelled across the Southeast Asian countries to collect local recipes from the various shophouses.What is a shophouse, you ask? The story dates back to 18th century Southeast Asia, which was marked by colonial rule. Travellers from the West made their way to the commodity and spice-rich Asian countries and found respite in these shophouses, which were, in laymans terms, opium dens and brothels. When the colonists left, the locals turned these into eateries, catering to the working-class, and serving home-style, comfort food.Holistic, spiritual vibeThe first thing that strikes you when you enter Shizu San, is the gorgeous Tree of Life - lush creepers that hang from the ceiling. These were incorporated into the dcor wishing prosperity and positivity to anyone who sits underneath. The dcor itself is minimalistic, with no in-your-face dragons and red and gold motifs that are common in Asian restaurants. With an outdoor bar, dim lighting and their signature cocktails, an evening out at Shizu San is perfect for this monsoon season.Too many options,too little timeIf you were to say that diners are spoilt for choice here, it would be a serious understatement. The menu at Shizu San is massive (confusingly so, some might think) and picture-heavy! With delicacies from several countries, options in food and drink are endless. The cocktails are unique, and Shizu San has managed to even put an Asian twist to some signature ones. For example, the classic Lynchburg Lemonade usually made with whiskey, sugar syrup and lemon is recreated and called Saigon Lemonade, which has ginger ale for the sweetness and an Asian fruit yuzu for citrusy zing. The traditional Old Fashioned has sugar, orange rind, cherry, soda and bourbon and it has been renamed Genie in a Bottle, in which tamarind candy replaces orange rind.The Hattori Hanzo is a treat to the eyes and the tongue - this delicately flavoured drink changes colour because of the presence of the butterfly pea flower. If youre a fan of the iconic Thai Tom Yum Soup, you must try One Night in Bangkok. This very hard-to-put-down cocktail has the same flavours as the Tom Yum Soup - lemongrass and kaffir lime - but in the form of a cool, refreshing drink.Those looking for something non-alcoholic can go for the Ok Lah, made with orange juice and kaffir lime; or the Iced Milo Milkshake - the Southeast Asian equivalent of Bournvita.The food is elegantly plated and comes in large portions - so do remember to visit when youre famished. Dig into some dimsums to start with - the Poached Chicken dumplings are a big win, as they come with their own tangy broth. For the vegetarians, the delicately flavoured Shitake and Black Mushroom dumplings are ideal. From the sushi bar, give the vegetarian Sriracha Blush or the traditional Rainbow Maki a try. The Asian Watemelon Salad is ideal for summers, and the Penang Laksa Lotus Stems are the perfect, crunchy accompaniment to your meal.Seafood lovers can try the Otak Otak - a mildly flavoured piece of kingfish steamed in a banana leaf, or the Black Pepper Lobster, the latter we found to be not very fresh. The Buri Bop Tuna is the kind of comfort food you crave for when youre down in the dumps - mildly spiced rice with the meat of your choice. Shizu San also has one bowl meals, like Ramen and Khao Suey, perfect for those looking for a quick bite.When you dine at Shizu San, make sure you leave room for dessert. We especially loved the Tender Coconut Cheesecake and the Green Tea Tiramisu, but with the large slices they plate up, sharing is caring is the best mantra to adopt.Grab a quick bite or enjoy a leisurely meal at Shizu San Shophouse and Bar in Phoenix Marketcity, Whitefield.Approximate Cost for two: Rs 1,800"

None of the fields along any of the canals in the command area has received water for a second crop for the second successive year.This has hit rice cultivation and at least half of the rice mills in Raichur, Sindhanur and Gangavati. Other towns in the paddy-growing areas have downed their shutters with no supply. Rice millers in Raichur predict a sharp rise in the prices of Sona Masuri rice variety that has been in high demand for its superior quality in Bengaluru and other metros.Already, the Sona Masuri paddy price has risen from Rs. 1,500 a quintal in December last year to Rs. 2,200 a quintal now. The wholesale Sona Masuri rice prices are consequently up from Rs. 3,000 a quintal to Rs. 4,000 a quintal. The prices are expected to rise further considering the crop loss in the Cauvery basin in Tamil Nadu and Tungabhadra basin in Andhra Pradesh, Maram Tippanna, a rice miller from Raichur told The Hindu . About 50% of the local paddy that was stocked after the monsoon harvest has been supplied to Tamil Nadu, causing a shortfall in the market, he pointed out.Various canals of the Tungabhadra reservoir irrigate over 9 lakh acres in Raichur, Koppal, and Ballari districts. Sona Masuri paddy is grown extensively in the belt twice a year, except at canals tail-end parts. While poor rain hit the first crop, there is no second crop this year. The situation was similar last year. Those who have cultivated paddy in a small scale in the fields irrigated by borewells too have suffered a loss of at least by 50% thanks to groundwater depletion. Most villagers have left for Mumbai, Goa, Bengaluru and other urban centres, leaving behind the old and sick, Chamarasa Malipatil, honorary State president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, said.The one ray of hope, millers say, is getting some quantity of paddy from Krishna basin in Raichur, Yadgir, and Kalaburagi as the command area and catchment area have received relatively better rainfall."

And at all of Trump's five stops on his first overseas trip, his team has spent weeks trying to build daily downtime into his otherwise jam-packed schedule.It's all part of a worldwide effort to accommodate America's homebody president on a voyage with increasingly raised stakes given the ballooning controversy involving his campaign's possible ties to Russia. For a former international businessman, Trump simply doesn't have an affinity for much international.Even before Trump's trip morphed from a quick jaunt to Europe into a nine-day behemoth, White House aides were on edge about how the president would take to grueling pressures of foreign travel: the time zone changes, the unfamiliar hotels, the local delicacies. Two officials said they feared that a difficult trip might even lead the president to hand off future traveling duties to Vice President Mike Pence.Trump's final itinerary hardly eases him into the delicate world of international diplomacy on foreign soil. After departing Friday on an overnight flight on Air Force One, Trump will hopscotch from Saudi Arabia to Israel to the Vatican. He'll close his trip with a pair of summits in Brussels and Sicily, often-staid affairs that require leaders to be locked in lengthy plenary sessions.""The chance of something going wrong - you insult the hosts, you get sick, your boss gets sick, you miscommunicate with your hosts, you make a scheduling error, you need to change the schedule just hours before a meeting, the motorcade get stuck in traffic, or the plane is stranded due to bad weather - is extremely high,"" said Julianne Smith, who served as a foreign policy adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and is now a senior fellow at the Center for New American Security.""Personally, I think they should cut it back now before they regret it,"" she said of Trump's long jaunt.The trip marks the first time since taking office that Trump has spent a night away from the White House at a property that doesn't bear his name. And it's not just the bragging rights Trump gets when he goes to his own properties: Staffers know his meal preferences and the exact temperature he likes a room set at. He's often surrounded by long-time friends and acquaintances who have memberships to the commander in chief-owned retreats.The only overnight trip Trump took abroad as a candidate was to mark the opening of a new golf resort in Scotland. He led journalists on a roving tour of the course and said his property would benefit if Britain's currency tanked following its decision to leave the European Union. He also made a daytrip to Mexico.The stakes will be far higher as President Trump makes his debut on the international stage. He's the first president since Jimmy Carter to not travel abroad during his first 100 days in office. And he'll depart under a cloud of controversy, much of it of his own making, including the White House's botched handling of FBI Director James Comey's firing.Nearly all of Trump's senior White House officials are traveling with him. First lady Melania Trump will also be on the trip, headlining her own events on each stop.The Slovenian-born Mrs. Trump is the more seasoned international traveler in the relationship. She lived and worked as a model in Paris and Milan before moving to New York, and speaks multiple languages.Before the couple married, they flew to Slovenia so the New York real estate mogul could meet his bride-to-be's family. The day trip marked the only time Trump has set foot in his wife's home country.""At least I can say that I went,"" Trump told The New York Times last year.Foreign travel has never been high on Trump's list of priorities. During his first marriage, he usually stayed behind when wife Ivana took his children for visits to her home country, the former Czechoslovakia. He's made the occasional stops to meet business partners abroad, but most of his travel has been to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and other U.S. properties.Trump's hosts on his upcoming trip are well-aware of his aversion to travel and are trying to make accommodations to keep him happy.In Saudi Arabia, people with knowledge of the planning for Trump's trip say the caterers are planning to offer the president steak and ketchup alongside the lamb and hefty portions of rice on the menu. All the meat will have been butchered in a Shariah-compliant halal manner as per Islamic custom.The people with knowledge of the Saudis' planning insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the sensitive details."

Had the constitutions goodwill been implemented promptly, they would have gotten community certificates, which would have funded their education and aided in finding employment.According to Census 2011, Tamil Nadu, which has 36 notified tribal communities, has about 7.94 lakh-strong tribal population. The Irula community, who were rat and snake catchers traditionally, has 1,89,661 members and forms a mere 1.1% of the States population. It is practically impossible for the community to command some attention through political or social backing.Sharing his two decades-long experience, Prabha Kalvimani, the founder and organiser of PIPS, said that about 100 Irula students appear for SSLC and HSC examinations every year. Lack of community certificates keep at least 80 per cent of them from pursuing higher education. The children, who have no political or social backing to pressure the officials into issuing them certificates, drop out and begin working as daily wage labourers at farms and brick kilns. Bonded labour at kilns and rice mills is a reality to the community even today.Kalvimani says that the issue began in the December of 1989, when State government authorised the revenue divisional officers to disperse the community certificates. While this was done to avoid duplication and to ensure that no outside party could claim the certificates, this measure has troubled the community.This year, 109 students have appeared for the SSLC and HSC examinations and were awaiting for the certificates to continue their higher studies.Suguna (19), of Veerangipuram village near Kandachipuram, shared the happiness of being the first in the family to write the HSC exams. She reached there through the blood and sweat of the entire family - while the parents worked in a Chennai brick kiln for a decade, she and her brother Selvam (14) lived in their thatched roof alone, looking after themselves.The girl, who secured 619 marks and wishes to pursue a degree in Tamil, needs the certificate to fulfil this seemingly simple dream. Her parents, who had bent backwards to fund the education of both children, will be unable to raise a college fund, what with the younger brother reaching class 10.According to Pon Mari, a government school teacher said that of the 109 Irula students, Suguna alone may get the certificate - the other students all had major hurdles. A community member himself, Pon Mari was the first Irula in Gingee to get the certificate and he still was subject to humiliation at the hands of revenue officials in the name of identity scrutiny, he said. He is regularly asked if he knows to catch snakes and rats, claims the teacher.This was even worse when it came to the cases of the students, say the community members. Even with over four government orders, it is difficult for the students to avail the certificates.The government mandates that the collectors and RDOs should take the assistance of the specific anthropologists to verify the caste and tribe identities. A GO published on 8 May 2013 by the Adi Dravidar and tribal welfare department mandates the same. However, such verifications only serve to humiliate the children, say the community members.Prakash (19), of Anandhapuram, had to make a correction in his community certificate. When he approached the officials, he was allegedly asked if he knew how to catch snakes and rats. Anniyur woman revenue inspector Bharani who asked the boy the question during a verification visit to his home in the Irula quarters, allegedly held that an Irula child of this generation should look and behave like his ancestor from the medieval ages. The community, which seeks community certificates and the right to a dignified life for their children, has called for a massive hunger strike in front of the district collectorate on Thursday.GOVERNMENT ORDERS ON COMMUNITY CERTIFICATESAdi dravidar and Tribal welfare department G O 31 (dated 04/03/1999) mandates disbursal of community certificates within 7 to 15 days of receiving the applicationRevenue Department G O 165 (dated 01/04/1999 ) mandates scrutiny of applications submitted by school HM and to issue community certificates to class 10, 12 studentsRevenue department G O 246I (dated 09/08/2011) states that all students should be given certificates before they complete SSLCRevenue department G O 184 (dated 05/06/2012)states that all students should be given community certificates within January 31st while they are studying in class 6"

Find such surprising combinations at the Mango Masti Food Festival at My Cafe, My Fortune Bengaluru.Chicken Spring RollsFor beverages, there are Aam ka Panna, milkshake and smoothie. Prepared with raw mangoes and roasted cumin powder, unlike the usual aam panna, this Amma ka Panna is creamier with very little tangy flavour.The appetisers include the Mango Spring Rolls, which are available in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. The chicken spring rolls are served with hot chilli sauce.Next comes the Mango Chicken Chaat. The combination of raw mangoes and chunks of chicken in the chaat is unsual. It is a well-rounded dish with the crispness of pappad, sourness of raw mango and the sweet spiciness of sweet chilli sauce.For main course, there are Stuffed Chicken Breast, Appam, Prawn and Mango Skewers and Manga Kozhi Curry. The Stuffed Chicken Breast topped with Cinnamon Mango Sauce is served on a granite-like stone with veggies such as broccoli and capsicum, giving it a colourful appetising look. The cinnamon mango sauce adds a sweet flavour to the otherwise bland chicken stuffed with a few mushrooms.The Manga Kozhi Curry reminds of the coastal Keralas chicken curry. It is served with steam rice that has a generous amount of ghee and mango flavour. The curry leaves add an appetizing aroma to this specialty. The chicken curry made with raw mango had a predominant taste of the coconut milk. Served with green salad, it pairs well with the steam rice.Then comes the dessert. The platter with Alphonso Cheesecake, Aam ki Rasmalai and Mango Lassi are served on the stone. The Alphonso Cheesecake is the best of the lot. It is fresh with a top layer of thin slices of alphonso and a base of cookies, it is a perfect end to the meal.Aam ki Rasmalai, topped with a few cubes of mangoes, is rich and creamy.

He was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in prison by US District Judge Darrin Gayles in Miami.The first scheme involved nearly 100 investors who purchased USD 30 million worth of promissory notes purported secured by interests in iron ore mining in Chile. The second scheme involved unlawfully obtaining USD 1.2 million in economic development funds as well as valuable industrial property from the State of South Carolina.Xavier was convicted by guilty plea in January on two counts of wire fraud. One wire fraud count related to the investment fraud scheme and the other count to the South Carolina economic development scheme.According to documents filed in court, from September 2010 through May 2014, Xavier operated Essex Holdings from an office in Miami and raised more than USD 30 million from nearly 100 investors for supposed investments in sugar transportation and shipping, as well as iron ore mining in Chile.He used false financial statements, forged documents and false promises of fixed rates of return, to induce people to invest in company.Most of the money was used for purposes other than what was promised, including to support lavish spending by Xavier and his wife for expensive jewelry, luxury vehicles, wedding expenses, and cosmetic surgery.Eventually, Xavier used new investor money to pay old investors in a Ponzi-like fashion before the scheme collapsed.Evidence filed in court showed that the actual investor losses from the scheme exceeded USD 29 million. The second scheme involved Xavier using Essex Holdings toobtain USD 1.2 million in payments and approximately USD 1.5 million worth of commercial real estate from the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Economic Development (SCCCED), a division of the South Carolina state government, that was supposed to be used to develop a dilapidated industrial property into a diaper plant and rice packaging facility.According to documents filed in the court, he provided false financial documentation to SCCCED in order to obtain the contract, and later provided fake contractor invoices and fake bank statements in order to get paid under the contract.As with the investment fraud scheme, Xavier spent a significant portion of the development money for his personal expenses, and wired some of it to the same overseas accounts used in the investment fraud."

But shoulder injuries prevented her from a repeat in London. As event ambassador for Sundays TCS World 10K Run, she spoke about her career, life after swimming and other aspects of sport.Excerpts:Which gold medal was special?All three were different. The 400m medley was on the first day of the Games and it was my first race at such a level. This was my dream since I was a young girl. I achieved my biggest dream in my first race. Before the second (200m medley), I had flu. I was not going to race but told myself I should try. When I won that race, it was empowering, gave more confidence. Next was 4x200m freestyle relay. I cant pick a favourite but the first one probably is the most momentous because it was the first one.Why did you decide to retire early?I had mentally decided around two-three months before London Olympics that it will be my last. I had two shoulder surgeries, needed a third and didnt have time to fix it before the Olympics. I was training, and it got worse and worse.Did you think of a comeback?It never crossed my mind because so many Australian swimmers made comebacks and I just thought it was crazy. If I have been training since I was seven and fit as I can possibly be, what makes me think that having a year or two off and starting again would make me better than before.World record timings are getting betterI dont think it is going to stop because there are so many improvements in technology. The suits that you wear, how you train, nutrition, gym work and everything keeps improving and getting better. Its only natural that athletes will get better and better. Sometimes, you have someone like a Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt come along and no one will go faster than them for like 10 years.Are things getting too complicated with technology?It can get complicated. People who have never played will give you so much data. There has to be a balance between education and technology. My coach and I were more into hard work but were open to try new bits and pieces.What is the hardest part of being an Olympic athlete?It was going from being a normal person to being someone that everyone recognised overnight. No one can prepare you for that and no one can tell you what it is going to be like. It was just a very big change and a lot to get used to.How hard was it to come back to normal life?It was hard because I like the media, the events and competing. Nothing will ever feel the same, walking out to an Olympic Stadium with the screaming crowd and all the energy, thinking about all the preparation and the race I prepared four years for. Winning and achieving does not get replicated.What do you think of Bollywood?I would love to do a Bollywood movie. But I dont know Hindi. I tried for a couple of months, but all I can say is namaste. I am a huge fan of Bollywood.India on the world stageThe Rio Olympics showed how woefully behind India is. Rice, however, feels there is potential. There is no reason why India cannot be as good as China. There is same population and wealth. You need to put in funding and have good programmes, I would love to be a part of. A country this big cannot be without talent.Doping in sportsShe feels that though drug cheating is a part of sport, its not correct to generalise. There are always swimmers who are not clean. Its not right to generalise and say that a country is cheating. I dont think we can ever get rid of it. Cheats are ahead of testing and will always be. What they test for is only what they know to test for. There are new things coming around. I dont know how sport can be made cleaner.Liking for IndiaRice is a big fan of India, Bollywood and yoga. She is overwhelmed by the support from India. On social media, I always had a big Indian following. I had never been here until last year. I wanted to see if there was possibility of doing work inspiring people to live healthier. I was fortunate to get a role as commentator here for Rio. Cricket is big in Australia and India and that is another common love.vivekphadnis@newindianexpress.com"

But it wasn't a house he needed or wanted. He was a teenager, living with his family in Delhi. After college, he moved to the United States to study at Harvard, where he worked for three decades as an architect. Ten years ago, he became a full-time abstract painter.But the house meant something to him and his family. More than four generations had used the 300-year-old structure, built high above rice paddies in the river's flood plain.But as family members went abroad or died, the house, named Meda, sat empty and went into decline.Its foundation and lower floor were made of porous whitewashed laterite stone blocks that during monsoon floods sank a little farther into the soft ground; perched upstairs, the ancient structure of Anjili hardwood was joined, as in Japanese temples, without any nails. Its peaked roof made of clay tiles from Mangalore effectively kept out storms. Over the years, Meda's three rooms and two wide verandas on the north and south sides sheltered the family members, who grew rice.""I still had an emotional connection to this building and was thinking of renovating it,"" Mr.Oommen said. ""But, even if I had raised it again, the land was unstable and no one in our extended family was willing to return to that remote location.""Mr. Oommen, 75, still travels to India, which inspires his painting, but he does not go to the house. Rather, he goes to an island called Mankotta that still has the unspoiled air of the time when he lived in Kerala as a boy amid landscapes devoid of modern roads and shopping malls.About seven years ago, Mr.Oommen decided he had to sell the house because his children did not want it. But potential buyers were interested only in the land, so they would have dismantled and sold Meda as well-seasoned timber and artifacts for tourists.He did not want that to happen.Fortunately, a friend, Pradeep Sachdeva , 59, heard about his predicament and agreed to buy the 2,000-square-foot house and move it piece by piece to his own 3acre farm in Sadhrana village, south of Delhi, where he lives.Mr . Sachdeva, an architect, saw a future for Meda as a guesthouse at his weekend house. He is known in India for his interiors at resorts like the Samode Palace in Rajasthan , and in Delhi for the large urban renewal projects such as the Dilli Haat market and the 20-acre Garden of Five Senses.Mr . Oommen was overjoyed. ""I ne ver thought of taking it apart and putting it in another location,"" he said.But villagers who rarely ventured 100 miles outside Mepral did not want to see it go 1,500 miles away . ""In that secluded area, which is largely below sea level, people historically went to Meda seeking refuge during floods,"" Mr. Oommen said. But it was either move it or destroy it. ""Their important icon would have been entirely lost if we had not moved it,"" he said. ""I feel I saved a piece of my family .""For the move in late 2010, a speaker of Malayalam (Kerala's main language) on the staff of Mr. Sachdeva's firm recruited Narayan Achari, one of the last Mepral carpenters skilled in building traditio nal Kerala wood houses. Together with a small team, they dismantled, numbered and documented Meda's individual components. As a last nod to tradition, before the parts were loaded onto northbound trucks, they sought blessings at the local snake temple for safe passage.In the spring of 2011, Mr. Achari and his assistants put the house back together at Mr. Sachdeva's farm on a new ground floor with walls of plastered brick.""The joinery was so simple and sophisticated that within six weeks Meda was reassembled,"" Mr. Sachdeva said. ""It looked better than ever and good for another hundred years.""A modern bathroom and kitchen are both cordoned off by partition walls from the otherwise openplan ground floor. ""I really wanted a columnless space for this adaptive reuse of the building as a functioning, contemporary home,"" Mr.Sachdeva said. ""If I did not make it usable, it would gather cobwebs.Now, friends come and stay , and occasionally I use it, too.""He also turned to some of his friends to help reimagine the house.The British designer John Bowman , who lives and works in Rajokri -between New Delhi (one of Delhi's districts) and Gurgaon -created a cast-iron spiral staircase and brass railing leading to the top floor. It replaced a dilapidated exterior wood staircase whose treads were repurposed as a dining table and shelving.In a bathroom added upstairs, Mr.Bowman fashioned a dull-brass sink etched with a leaf pattern and a castbrass circular shower pan, echoing the building's handmade aesthetic and its natural surroundings.Upstairs, ""we tried to conserve nearly everything as it was, although we did add electricity and plumbing,"" Mr. Sachdeva said. Ventilation openings in the gable ends of the building, similar to those seen in traditional Kerala architecture, and a few replacement roof tiles are also new .The guesthouse, oriented northsouth as it always was, is in a garden now. ""It seems to belong there, even though the environment is completely different culturally and climatically,"" said Mr. Sachdeva, who is also a landscape architect and a co-author of "" A Naturalist's Guide to Trees & Shrubs of India.""""I know trees,"" he said. He took great care not to harm any while relocating Meda, and never worried about Meda's old wood faring poorly in this much drier, foreign place.""I think it is very old and like steel,"" he said with conviction. ""Nothing will happen to it now."""
5922d4d57be9e01fe6dfbef1,A passionate farmer,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/may/21/a-passionate-farmer-1607497.html,2017-05-22,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:On meeting you, one of the first things that K M Hilal will tell you is that farming should never be a part-time profession. Thats why many farming initiatives fail. Most farmers today are part-timers. Farming has to be a full-time job to succeed, says the man who has spear-headed a zero-budget natural farming campaign in the state.Hilal has opened an exhibition - Rice Fest 2017 - at the Chandrasekharan Nair Stadium on naturally-farmed rice varieties and products. The former SFI leader has set his eyes on the capital city next to take forward his poison-free rice campaign. At this exhibition we have rice grown in seven districts - Wayanad, Palakkad, Thrissur, Malappuram, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Alappuzha. We are extending the programme to other districts soon. Next is Thiruvananthapuram, he said.According to him, Thiruvananthapuram is ideal for growing rice, thanks to favourable water resources - compared to other districts - and conducive geography. I toured the city. The city has ample government land which can be used for paddy cultivation. Also, Thiruvananthapuram is not over-industrialised like, say, Kochi, and the air here is clean, he said.Born in Alappuzha in a family which had nothing whatsoever to do with agriculture, Hilal became interested in it during his student days in Kottayam. As an SFI leader, he had to lie low in a once-remote village in Palakkad. It opened his eyes to the way rice was grown and how the paddy farmers struggled to make ends meet. His first try at agriculture, in Marayur, was a disaster, and he switched to graphic designing and advertisements in Kochi for a while.But the bug hadnt quit his system, and a workshop by zero-budget natural farming guru Subhash Palekar in Palakkad filled him with fresh ideas. Thus began Hilals real tryst with farming. What Subhash Palekar says cannot be wholly copied in Kerala. We have to adapt it to suit our weather, geography and customs, says Hilal. He uses only dung and vegetation - like fallen leaves - as manure, for instance. In Kumarakom, Hilal manages a 17-acre paddy farm owned by actor Mammootty. That farm acts as the centre for popularising our philosophy. We will soon be starting the sowing soon, he said.Rice Fest 2017 features raw rice, boiled rice with varying bran content, and rice-based products like rice flakes (aval), powder, bran, kondattam and ada. Farming should turn profitable if farmers are to stick to the profession, he says. Kerala in fact is the best place in the world to grow rice. The geography and weather permit it. However, people are reluctant to step into paddy cultivation because they think their families will go hungry.Hilal is married to Biji, and the couple has four children all of whom are homeschooled. The exhibition will end on Wednesday."

There are between 7,000 and 8,000 outpatients and 1,000 to 2,000 inpatients at the hospital who are accompanied by about 4,000 attendants. The ""Amma unavagam'' inside the hospital premises was able to provide food for only 400 people. Now, many more would be able to get food under the scheme.In the first phase, 500 food packets are to be distributed in the hospital a day, according to the commissioner. Already, five shelters for the poor are functioning in Madurai and ten more are under construction. One of these shelters is to be established at the hospital.Steps are being taken to provide food to the people staying in these shelters. Those wishing to contribute to the scheme can do so by e-recharging the mobile number 99942-60606 or even through bank transfers to the account created for this purpose. The scheme would be expanded to feed people in places like the Madurai railway junction and bus stands depending on the donations being received.Those wishing to donate through this e-recharge will have to download the app for this purpose on their mobile phones. The minimum donation should be Rs 50 which would enable the project to feed two persons, said Alima Banu Sikkandar, the chairperson of Palakarangal Trust, the NGO partner for this project. Soon, donations can also be made through the website www.pasiillamadurai.org.On the first day, packets of curd rice were distributed to the needy. However, once the operations become full-fledged in a week or so, it is proposed to provide other rice preparations as well. There is also a proposal to provide cut fruits twice a week. Dean of the Government Rajaji hospital Dr M R Vairamuthu Raju, city health officer Dr Parthiban and assistant collector Vishnu Chandran among others participated."

Planning and coordination department officials here said on Tuesday the loss in agriculture could be to the tune of Rs 50 crore.Rough estimates show the damage to crops ready for harvest is around Rs 28 crore. Primary estimates of the state government reveal crops on over 28,000 hectare of land have suffered irreparable damage from rainfall and thunder squalls.Agriculture minister Aghore Debbarma said pre-monsoon rain and a series of Nor'westers caused untold damage to Sepahijala, Gomati and south Tripura districts while other districts were relatively less affected. Jhum cultivation also suffered damages.""The situation has worsened with insurance companies dragging their feet on paying insurance money for crop loss under the much-hyped 'Prime Minister's Fasal Bima Yojana',"" alleged Debbarma.Currently, 8,000 tribals are exclusively dependent on shifting cultivation and they live on elevated bamboo houses in the hill areas. ""We had sent a detailed project report to the Centre in 2015-2016 for funds to build houses for 'jhumias' and the Centre had sanctioned only Rs 75,000 for each house. This amount was inadequate and we have asked for assistance of at least Rs 1.30 lakh per house. We are waiting for the sum to be sanctioned.""The minister added that power distribution was also badly hampered by the rain. The supply was cut off in many areas. Besides, the rain also damaged a large number of dwelling units, roads and buildings as well as non-timber forest produce.Incessant rain for the last one week has left a trail of destruction in Lower Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh and cut off many areas from the rest of the region. A report from Dambuk ADC Atul Tayeng said communication on the Dambuk-Roing-Pasighat and Dambuk-Bizari-Paglam roads snapped for about a week. To make things worse, the log bridge at 14 Kilo on the Dambuk-Bizari Road was washed away by heavy floods on Monday.The Dibang River has eroded large swathes of land in Bomzir and Bizari while rice fields in the Dambuk area are being eroded at an alarming rate, the report said. ""The venue of the Orange Festival is also in danger of erosion by the river,"" Tayeng said, adding that ration stock would not last long if road communication is not restored soon.He suggested sorties by helicopters to provide relief for the people of Dambuk and Paglam. The district administration, monitoring the situation, has sent a message to the authorities concerned in this regard, the report added."

Tenders have already been floated for the same on MHRD website on Friday.Mahavir Mane , former director of primary education in Maharashtra, said, ""The midday meal scheme is running much smoothly in Maharashtra than in other states.

All these are local problems. Then there are delay in payment of honorarium to cooks or SHGs despite the money being released by the state.

An ice cream just as dark and cold. Activated charcoal is making a slow but dramatic entry to menus of city restaurants, and while allopathic nutritionists are a little sceptical, herbalists swear by it.Though activated charcoal  the by-product of burning plant-based material such as coconut shells, bamboo, corn or rice  is one of the latest detox ingredients creating a buzz world over, added to everything from lemonade to burgers and sushi, it has for long been used in India to purify water as well as in homeopathic cures for poisonings, intestinal gas, and acidity.Having made its presence felt in around India, the Bull's Eye black appams at The Ritz Carlton-Bengaluru being one of them, it is no being introduced by Chennai's chefs in their menus.The first to hit the road is 'Glomo', a detox drink of activated charcoal, tender coconut water and ginger, launched last month by food subscription start-up Caboutu. Though it looks a little unappetising  almost like diluted black paint  it tastes like tender coconut water. ""Though activated charcoal is power-packed with health benefits, it is odourless and tasteless,"" says Soumya Ganesh, co-founder, Caboutu. ""We use bamboo to make the charcoal.""Chef and food consultant Koushik Shankar (aka the 'mad chef'), has perfected an activated charcoal ice cream, which he will launch at his new cafe 'Sitcom', set to open in June on East Coast Road . ""It was my dentist who made me take note of the fact that it is an ingredient that has been used for centuries for brushing teeth in the country,"" says Shankar, adding that only minute quantities of charcoal are used to get the colour.Former Tamil Nadu Agriculture University dean, professor Dr K K Krishnamurthi , refers to activated charcoal as nutrition's oldest 'nano particle'. ""In homeopathy, we have a remedy called carbo vegetables  vegetable charcoal  which, if ingested in regulated quantities can aid digestion and prevent acidity. Activation of the charcoal increases its adsorptive properties,"" says Krishnamurthi, a homeopath.Another homeopath, K Sri Sridhar, says plant ash has been used in household cooking for years. ""In the old days people would cook vegetables in iron vessels to the point of charring. It was considered healthy,"" he says.The allopaths are still on the fence regarding the ebony elixir. ""I have had several clients ask me about ingesting activated charcoal, but I have not found any clear-cut health benefits in medical terms so I haven't recommended it. I'm sceptical about its use in food,"" says nutritionist Shiny Chandran.But at the restaurants, the carbon clique seems to be growing. At ITC Grand Chola's newly opened Avartana, coconut charcoal infused appams, buns and macaroons are making a splash, with senior executive chef Ajit Bangera considering stringing idiappams along this line as well. ""Using plant-based charcoal in food is a double-edged sword  a pinch is detoxifying, but too much of it, and the charcoal is likely to remove nutrients from the body along with the toxins. So we use just a trace of it,"" he says. ""In terms of presentation, the black in a dish is sexy, stunning and always evokes a reaction, whether surprise, delight or doubt,"" he adds. By the looks of it #ash could be trending on city menus for a while."

With the addition of two kg rice per every individual in the families (of BPL card holders), the government intends to ensure that no one goes down due to hunger, he said.Income certificateOn the other hand, following the governments announcement to revise existing guidelines to avail BPL cards, nine lakh people have applied for income certificates. According to the new guidelines, those with an annual income of Rs 1.2 lakh can go for self-declaration by filling details on the application, to avail the benefit. They have to provide income certificates as proof.To ensure a hassle-free process, the department is also in talks with both revenue department and National Informatics Commission (that deals with government websites irrespective of department) to directly download the income certificates and provide the same to applicants, he added.Vigilance committeeThat apart, to ensure timely services, a three-member vigilance committee will be constituted in each fair price shop. The three members will be randomly selected among the card holders. If elderly persons are selected, they will be replaced by others. They will be tasked with the supervision of the system related to distribution of essential commodities. In case of malpractices, they are vested with powers to recommend for cancellation of licence of such shops, he said.Indira canteensOn the ambitious programme of the state Government to open canteens in the name of Indira Gandhi, Khader said that the government has invited expression of interest in this regard. The canteens wil be set up in each ward of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagarapalike (BBMP) and a centralised kitchen will be set up for every eight wards. While the proposal of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (Iskcon) is in abeyance for not using onion and garlic in preparing food items, many hotel groups, including Balaji Hotel Association, has come forward, Khader said."

5922d6fc7be9e01fc7f5a7d1,Visa crunch causes Dongri’s Nigerian garment trade to fray,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/visa-crunch-causes-dongris-nigerian-garment-trade-to-fray/articleshow/58320903.cms,2017-04-23,"One of the few places to sample Nigerian cuisine in Mumbai is a canteen in Masjid Bandar. Up flights of narrow stairs, one can tuck into a bowl of ofada rice with plantains and buffalo beef stew. One shelf is lined with Maggi imported from Nigeria and the freezer is packed with Maltina, a popular non-alcoholic fermented beverage. The canteen is tiny but more than large enough for its shrinking clientelea reflection of the recent crash in the city's Nigerian-Indian trade.Until a few years ago, Nigerian businessmen and women flocked the bylanes of Masjid Bandar and Dongri , part of a wholesale garment boom. They'd visit every few months to buy baby clothes, t-shirts, flowing kaftans, reels of lace, imitation jewellery and hair wigs, selling them for a hefty profit back home. A 10-inch Indian hair wigpopular with African womencosts about Rs 2,500 per 100gm and is sold in Nigeria for over Rs 5,000. Nigerians living here also worked as agents connecting new buyers with wholesalers.But visas for Nigerian nationals have tightened since 2012, hitting both local traders and the city's small Nigerian community. Approximately 3,000 business visas were issued last year, down from 9,000 in 2011, according to Sharad Srivastava, the first secretary (consular) of the High Commission of India in Abuja. He cites three reasons for the drop: closer scrutiny of documents; a dip in the Nigerian economy due to falling oil prices; and a weakening Naira, the national currency, with the consequent rationing of dollars by Nigeria's Central Bank, which has affected Nigerian travel.As a result, wholesale sales on Mohammed Ali Road have fallen by 50-75%. Traders here have customers from other African countriesSudan, Djibouti, Ghana, Tanzanian and Kenyabut most export depends on Nigerians.Sambo Davis is one of the few Nigerians to own a shop in Dongri. Walking through the market, he points out shuttered shops that once sold baby clothes. The Indian owner of a boutique selling African 'georges' a heavily-embellished traditional dresscomplained about losing out to China. ""I don't know why the government is not issuing visas to people, who are contributing to the GDP and buying goods in dollars,"" he said. In 2013, Nigeria imported Rs 100 crore worth of textiles and clothing from India.Nigerians feel the new visa rules are draconianmost are granted only a single-entry six month visa for USD 252and don't reciprocate the good treatment Indian businessmen receive in their country. To keep their businesses afloat, many have overstayed their visas. An RTI inquiry in 2014 revealed that 2,039 Nigerians in India have expired visas. Some then get stuck because they can't afford to pay the fine.Others are afraid of serving a prison term or being banned from the country. Last year, a Nigerian with a Mumbai business, who overstayed his visa by seven years, was deported then reportedly barred from entry for 2-5 years. (The Foreigner Regional Registration Office in Mumbai was not available for comment before we went to print.)But visas are not the only obstacle to business. Even on Mohammed Ali Road, locals regard Nigerians warily because of their reputation for dealing drugs. One resident refused to walk on the same side of the road as a Nigerian, and a Pydhonie guesthouse owner, who welcomes traders from Djibouti, Yemen, Tanzania and Ghana, has a strict policy against Nigerian guests.Adebayo Ajongold is one of the lucky ones. He came to Mumbai six years ago, learnt a little Hindi and became an agent for customers from West African countries. Over the years, he's built a strong network here, a feat made easier by the fact that he is a MuslimNigeria also has a large Christian populationwho visits Zakaria Masjid with his Indian business partners.If Nigerians battle racist stereotypes in Mohammed Ali Road, it's worse in the rest of the city. Renting a flat in a good complex is next to impossible. That's why most Nigerians live in rundown buildings in Mira Road, Vashi and Nalasopara, moving whenever the landlord gets antsy. ""Brokers just wave us out of their offices,"" said Davis, while pointing out housing complexes in Kharghar that have a no-Nigerian policy.Olasunkanmi Amoo, who lives in Vashi, relates an incident on the locals reminiscent of Gandhi's experience in South Africa. ""A man came and asked me why I was travelling in the first class compartment,"" he said. ""He wasn't a ticket checker but he insisted on seeing my ticket.""Back in Mohammed Ali Road, the canteen serves as a refugea cubby-hole for friends and home food. Most Nigerians avoid bars and restaurants to steer clear of stares and comments. Davis says he'd like to open a restaurant to introduce Nigerian cuisine to Mumbaikars but doubts he'd find a space. Even renting a t-shirt shop in Dongri took a lot of persuasion. ""Modi keeps saying, 'Make in India,'"" says Davis. ""But how do we live in India? The country is so unfriendly."""

An angry minister then asked the district magistrate and chief development officer to ensure repairs and improvements in a week's time and submit a report about the same to him.Yadav had come to Bijnor on the occasion of Ganga Swachchhta Sankalp Divas to flag off a 21-day rally with a view to creating awareness to keep the river clean among the people living along its banks.On his way to the function, the minister decided to stop and inspect the primary school of Daranagar, which is located along the banks of the river.When Yadav entered the kitchen where the midday meal is to be cooked, he found that all the cooking and edible material including rice and pulses missing. He then learned that all the groceries and utensils were kept at the pradhan's house instead of the school. The only dish that was ready for the midday meal was made of potatoes instead of pulses, which is a must on the menu.Next , Yadav inspected the toilets. He found that of the two toilets, one was locked while the other one was in a dilapidated condition, This was an indication that the students were not using the toilet and were going in the open to answer a call of nature.Several other irregularities came to Yadav's notice. He found that 70 students of the 205 enrolled at the school were absentThe upset minister immediately spoke with the DM and CDO , asking them to improve the standard of education and other things . He instructed them to send him pictures of the kitchen, toilets and midday meal to him. He asked the teachers that they motivate their wards to use the toilet regularly.Chief development officer Indramani Tripathi said, ""A few irregularities were detected during the inspection. Teachers told the minister that the midday meal groceries are kept at the pradhan's house to prevent pilferage of foodstuff. The toilets are locked but opened when any student wishes to relieve himself.""After the inspection, minister Yadav attended the Ganga Swachchhta Sankalp Divas programme and administered an oath to all those who were present to make the Ganga clean. He assured the people that both central and state govt have prepared a plan to keep the Ganga clean. It would start bearing fruit within the next two or three months."

However, wheat traders are awaiting reports on the damage to the United States' winter wheat crop after a snowstorm hit the U.S. Plains over the weekend and those concerns are providing some price support. Corn edged higher after dropping 1.5 percent on Tuesday although gains were capped by rapid planting progress in the United States. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active wheat contract fell 0.2 percent to $4.53 a bushel by 0306 GMT. On Tuesday, the market climbed to $4.61-1/2 a bushel, the highest since March 6. Corn gained 0.1 percent to $3.72-3/4 a bushel and soybeans added 0.2 percent to $9.70-1/4 a bushel. ""Market is awaiting to see the extent of damage for the U.S. hard red winter wheat, but the assessment will take time,"" said one agricultural commodities analyst. ""The upside is limited as globally there is enough wheat."" Wheat has been underpinned by the concerns of frost damage but there are ample grain supplies worldwide to meet any shortfall in U.S. supplies. Strong rains expected in Argentina's upcoming 2017-18 crop year are expected to benefit key soybean, wheat and corn crops while farmers stay alert for floods that put 1 million hectares out of production last season, local meteorologists said on Tuesday. U.S. agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland Co. said on Tuesday that massive global grain stocks are making it difficult to turn a profit trading grain internationally, sending its shares plummeting by their most in eight years. For corn, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Monday that U.S. farmers had sown 34 percent of their corn crop, in line with the five-year average and more than analysts had been expecting.

They said they had no breakdown of how many individuals' phone records were among those collected.In all, according to the report, U.S. officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, the top U.S. intelligence officer reported on Tuesday.The report said the names of 1,934 ""U.S. persons"" were ""unmasked"" last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds.Officials said in the report that U.S. intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about U.S. electronic eavesdropping.""This year's report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law,"" said Office of the Director of National Intelligence spokesman Timothy Barrett.

This has now become a familiar pattern on the days following the payday or successive bank holidays.ATMs, with no cash but with ""Cash could not be dispensed,"" rice papers strewn around were a common sight through Sunday to Tuesday.Bankers said that the main problem is that the RBI is not supplying big value currency notes and the supply itself is sporadic.RBI's data shows that the notes in circulation as on April 21, 2017 was over 81% of what it was exactly a year ago. Despite this, banks keep running out of cash to fill ATMs. One senior banker said that there is enough currency in branches but most of it is in small denomination - which cannot be filled in ATMs.""People are also demanding Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 denomination notes at branches,"" said a branch manager of a public sector bank.Other reasons, apart from alleged short supply of new notes from the RBI, is that lifting of all withdrawal limits in March has meant that people are withdrawing more than they need and hoarding. Since banks have also placed restrictions on cash deposit in branches, people are not bringing cash back as they use d to earlier.""Almost all banks have put a cap on free cash deposit at branches and people are not bringing the money back,"" said a public sector banker.As a result, people have to check a couple of ATMs before they can find cash in one. For a lot of ATMs, it was observed that the ones attached to branches were dispensing cash with higher probability than standalone ones.So, why are banks still struggling to fill ATMs despite the RBI data suggesting return of over 80% of pre-demonetisation currency in circulation? The answer, bankers say, is the fact that though 80% of currency may be back in circulation, a lot of it is in the form of soiled or low denomination notes.""These notes are not what ATMs have been recalibrated for,"" said a banker.A currency chest officer with a public sector bank said, ""I don't know why there are sporadic shortages. On days, I have to literally struggle to keep the ATMs and the branches going. It is a scary situation."""

It is quite obvious that the work is 'tokenism' to collect funds for the party event but what Kadiyam Srihari chose to do was more practical.The 66-year-old deputy chief minister, who is a resident of teachers colony, Waddepalli in Hanamakonda, Warangal, said the amount he earned for teaching on Saturday would specifically be used to provide drinking water to the public attending the TRS meet on April 27.""Attempt all questions in Eamcet. First attempt all the answers you know,"" he said, while lecturing students in SVS College.He also gave tips on how to approach the examination and prepare for it.On the board, the minister explained about halogens, the five non-metallic elements found in Group 17 of the Periodic Table, ammonium chloride, potassium permanganate, and talked in detail about ionic bonds.

SIT has been formed on the Patna high court directive.The seven-member SIT led by ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar has to complete the investigation within three months. The Supreme Court on February 28 this year passed an order that all the paddy scam cases should be investigated within three months and trial should be completed in the next six months.Five special courts would be set up in Patna, Gaya, Chhapra, Darbhanga and Purnia for the trial of paddy scam cases. The SIT has also decided to form five special teams in the five cities and towns.The scam surfaced in 2013-2014 after the millowners, instead of supplying rice to government godowns, sold it in the open market, resulting in the loss of at least Rs2,000 crore to the state exchequer. Altogether 1202 FIRs had been lodged across the state. Nine cases in which embezzlement is above Rs8 crore are being investigated by the Economic Offences Unit (EOU) of the state police.Of the 1202 cases, nine are related to the misappropriation of more than Rs8 crore, 18 cases are of bungling between Rs8 crore to Rs5 crore, 55 cases of between Rs5 crore and Rs3 crore, 261 cases are related to Rs3 to Rs1 crore fraud and 845 cases in which public money of Rs1 crore or below had been embezzled by the rice millers.The SIT would supervise altogether 316 cases in which embezzlement amount is between Rs1 crore and Rs5 crore while for cases below Rs1 crore, district police would have to follow guidelines of the SIT.When contacted, home department principal secretary Amir Subhani said the SIT would work under the court guidelines and wrap up the investigations within the time frame.Orders have been issued by the home department, in the light of high court directive, that except ADG Kumar, no other member of the SIT would be given any additional work than related to the scam and none of them would be transferred from their positions without court orders."
5922d8437be9e01fc7f5a9c4,Salt-tolerant rice variety will get farmers tilling,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/salt-tolerant-rice-variety-will-get-farmers-tilling/articleshow/58306654.cms,2017-04-22,"PANAJI: Goan farmers looking for the best salt-tolerant rice variety can now choose either Goa Dhan I or Goa Dhan II, developed by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Old Goa complex, as both are higher yielding and promise other advantages.Goa's hardy white or red kernel rice, korgutt, has many variations and farmers have been growing the salt-resistant variety in khazan areas since time immemorial. After few years of research, ICAR-CCARI (Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute) scientists have narrowed the variations to just two best selections - Goa Dhan I of white kernel and Goa Dhan II of red kernel.""Goa Dhan I and Goa Dhan II are best varieties of korgutt in terms of salinity tolerance, coarse and bold grain, higher yield and suitability for raw rice and paraboiling as well,"" said Manohara K K, scientist in genetics and plant breeding, ICAR, Old Goa.Three years ago, korgutt, Goa's traditional rice variety had been accorded due recognition as a unique germplasm by National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi, for its tolerance to salinity stress at seedling stage.The state has an assortment of local rice varieties, but seeds of some of them are not available. With NBPGR granting korgutt a national identity (number INGR14055) for record purposes, its conservation for future use is assured.Now, with the official release of two best varieties, this is the first such release of rice variety in the state by ICAR, Goa. ""We have developed the two varieties from variations available within native korgutt. During process of development, scientists have involved farmers for making the selections more effective and this helped to bring out the best varieties,"" Manohara explained.Lodging or falling of the crop during later stages is a farmers nightmare. These two varieties will have less of a problem and help prevent losses due to rotting of the crop in water. ""Lodging will be reduced now compared to original korgutt,"" he added.The scientists monitored all requisite parameters during research for the farmers benefit. ""Compared to the traditional local korgutt variety that yields 1.2 to 1.5 tonnes per hectare, these two can produce 2.3 to 2.7 tones per ha,"" ICAR director Eknath Chakukar said.The pure varieties grown by ICAR scientists are close to the harvesting stage and about 100 kg of breeder seed of each will be given to state agriculture department for multiplication. Further, the multiplication process to cover more farmers will be carried out by ICAR in association with the agriculture department and progressive farmers.Agricultural activities have dwindled due to rise in labour costs and preference for other occupations, but mechanization of farming operations and attractive subsidies hold promise for revial of paddy cultivation, sources said."

5922d9487be9e01fc7f5aa70,Why crop burning may continue this year too,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/why-crop-burning-may-continue-this-year-too/articleshow/58307362.cms,2017-04-22,"KARNAL: A few patches of black disturb the golden spread of ripe wheat ready for harvesting in Haryana's Karnal district. These are tracts that were set on fire recently after the standing crop was reaped to ready the field for paddy planting in the monsoon. Many more fields will be set afire in a week or so when harvesting work ends in Punjab and Haryana. This year , however, such fires will be covert actions. Already farmers are claiming the field fires of recent weeks were accidental. Satellite surveillance by the Punjab government and stringent monitoring by Haryana government to prevent stubble burning have left farmers apprehensive.Stubble burning is being discouraged for its massive pollution impact. For the moment though, despite wheat and paddy stubble burning destroying the soil and causing severe heat stress on farmland, the cultivators cannot change this farming tradition, they say. Subsidies for agri equipment, such as happy seeder or rotavor that can sow seeds without the need to remove the remains of the paddy stubble, haven't reached most farmers. Wheat farmers who can afford it use a reaper that costs around Rs 2 lakh. It only leaves a short stubble close to the ground that is burnt by most or ploughed back into the soil by some. Those who plough the stubble into the soil are not happy because, they claim, this method can damage the paddy seedlings. Plus, ploughing back is often labour and time intensive.Satellite images show fires have just started in Punjab and Haryana, though Karan Avtar Singh, chief secretary of the state, insisted, ""Only 5 to 10 incidents have been reported this season. Many panchayats have assured us of zero stubble burning.""But Rattan Singh Mann, Haryana chief of Bharatiya Kisan Union, admitted, ""We recently courted arrest when we set our fields on fire."" He explained that wheat can be cut low to leave less stubble, but all alternatives to burning the rice stalks was too expensive.Among the options, the stubble doesn't have many takers as fodder either. ""Cattle don't eat stubble because of the frequent fuel spill during cropping,"" explained Ramanjaneyulu GV, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.At the root of the pollution-causing problem is Punjab and Haryana's wheat-paddy combination. After harvesting paddy in October, burning the residue is the quickest way to prepare the field for wheat sowing in late October or November. ""Rice cultivation should be banned in these regions, but not many agree with me,"" said Mann. Rice plant stubble is not the only problem, paddy requires a lot of water too. ""Farmers here have to dig down 400 feet to get water,"" revealed Mahtab Kadyan, another farmer leader.At Jundla village, Sulakhan Singh Kamboj argued, ""We cannot plant replacement crops such as oilseeds or pulses unless the government procures our produce at good prices. Last year I planted peas that I finally sold at Rs 5 per kilo. That did not even cover the labour cost.""Farmers with the Kheti Virasat Mission in Punjab are, however, gradually moving away from paddy. They claim not to burn the wheat stubble also, but ""either make manure of it or mulch it"", according to Umendra Dutt Recent NASA images show large fires in Madhya Pradesh and parts of east India. According to Ramanjaneyulu, these could be signs of forest fires, stubble burning or slash-and-burn cultivation. ""Wheat stubble burning across the country is on the rise because getting labour to deal with it is tedious and expensive,"" he added."
5922da6e7be9e01fc006f761,The weaves of river country,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-weaves-of-river-country/article17896027.ece,2017-04-09,"Entering the handloom weavers neighbourhood at Pasalapudi village in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh is an unforgettable experience. Take a left turn and a quick right to the narrow concrete street that stretches straight ahead. On either side are neatly organised houses with sloping roofs of thatch or tiles and spacious verandas that open into the street. Each veranda has a handloom, sometimes two, and it is here that the rhythmic movement of hand and the rest of the body and the simultaneous woody clickety-clack of the loom shuttle, as it carries the weft across the warp, leave an indelible impression on the visitor.A similar scene plays out in village after village in this rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh, where the mighty Godavari, the lush paddies and a string of rice mills form the backdrop for a handloom weaving tradition that goes back many centuries. Thousands of families continue to weave even today, and this is in no small measure on account of the right climate (for instance, high humidity), long-standing and intricate social and economic networks, and the communitys considerable innovative and adaptive capacities.While the region is best known for the Uppada Jamdani sari, it is the medium-skill, fine-count cotton weaving that forms the backbone of its strength and identity. It is also a world of surprises as it is of many contrasts  of the high-value, high-skill Uppadas that exclusive designer labels have promoted aggressively even as many looms go silent because medium- and low-skilled weavers are leaving their traditional profession. There are weavers cooperatives as in Hasanabad that have thrived because of dynamic leadership and a strong belief in the handloom, but others like the one in Dulla have fallen upon bad times on account of bad management practices and exit of weavers.Velasawaram has, over the past four years, made a significant shift to weaving plain silk saris from being an exclusive cotton-handloom weaving village. Traders from Bengaluru provide us the silk warps and buy back the saris, one weaver says. We dont know where the saris go finally and dont know how long this work will last, he continues. He is not worried, he says, because he will move back to cotton if the wind blows that way again. The trends and demands of the market might change, but he is confident his skills will not."

The eutrophication is evident from increased turbidity, high chlorophyll values, and increased organic productivity. Exceedingly high concentrations of plant nutrient elements such as phosphates, nitrates, and nitrites were detected, said D. Ambika Devi, associate director, RARS.Samples of soil, water, fish, sediments, grain, straw, and clams collected from different stretches of the Vembanad wetlands, adjoining Kuttanad lowlands, channels, and different padasekharams have been analysed. Residues of pesticides above prescribed limits and presence of heavy metals such as manganese copper, cadmium, iron, aluminium, and chromium above safe limit could be detected in many of these samples, she said.Five-year dataThe report is based on the analysis of data collected for five years on critical parameters. The riverine locations near the Pampa and the Manimala indicate very high levels of bacterial coliform. The tourism houseboat terminals at Thannermukkom, Punnamada, Pallathuruthy, and Kumarakom revealed high pollution. According to P. Rajendran, Vice Chancellor, KAU, the report points to the need for management of nutrient discharge from rice polders and domestic urban settlements. The study has helped in assessing the environmental status of Kuttand wetlands. It is also a grim reminder about the impending dangers faced by the fragile ecosystem.A research boat Gaveshiny, the first of its kind in the State, was deployed by KAU for the environmental monitoring programme. A state-of-the-art laboratory was also established for the purpose.Based on the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Commission, RARS, Kumarakom, has been tasked with monitoring the changes in the hydrobiology of Vembanad wetlands."

Vijaya BhaskarCH_VIJAYA BHASKARCanal Road, the throbbing trading hub of the city, witnessed religious fervour on Sunday evening when the annual rathotsavam, the celestial chariot procession, was taken out on a grand note culminating Maha Shivaratri fete.Thousands of devotees tugged the chariot that carried the processional deities of Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy, Sri Bhramaramba Malleswara Swamy and Vasanta Mallikarjuna Swamy. The environs reverberated with loud chants of Om Namah Sivaya even as the devotees picked up the massive ropes of the chariot, which they pulled up to the Vinayaka temple. The chariot procession passed through the Canal Road, with the devotees watching the colourful event from either side of the road.Besides the ratham decorated with flowers and festoons, a couple of well-decorated tractors too were used to take out the processional deities of Bhramaramba Malleswara Swamy, Bhadrakali Veerabhadra Swamy and Ganga Parvathi Sametha Vasantha Malleswara Swamy.Cultural troupes performing the traditional Kolatam, Puliveshalu and Lambada dances, along with music bands, enthralled the huge crowds that turned up for the event organised by Sri Kanyakaparameswari Annasatram Committee, which set the tone for the Maha Shivaratri festival in the city.Mythological scenes enacted by artistes caught the attention of the crowds that milled from all parts of the district. Tight security arrangements were made to ensure smooth conduct of the festivities.The procession moved at a snails pace with the women waiting on the roadside with their offerings like rice and fruits competing with each other to have a close glimpse of the processional deities. Youngsters thronged the cultural performances, despite several restrictions imposed by the police.The procession began from Ratham centre at around 5.30 p.m. DCP (Admin) GVG Ashok Kumar, DCP (Law and Order) G. Palaraju, Kanaka Durga temple Executive Officer A. Surya Kumari, Committee president Bayana Hareswara Rao, vice-president Vallamkonda Prasad and others were present at the launch of event."
5922dcc97be9e01fc7f5ad77,"MGNREGS will eat into food security, claims study",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/mgnregs-will-eat-into-food-security-claims-study/articleshow/58634491.cms,2017-05-11,"Madurai: The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), rolled out a decade ago, has impacted households and individuals in a positive as well as negative way, but the adverse impacts of the scheme could impact the nation's food security, according to an authoritative study.What may set the alarm bells ringing is the projected decline in acreage under rice cultivation in states like Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh by three to eight per cent in the next five years. This could be a threat to the nation's food security, according to the experts, Hari K Nagarajan, professor RBI chair in Rural Economics, IRMA, G Pazhanithurai, Rajiv Gandhi Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Anirudh Tagat, senior researcher, Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai, who conducted the study.The scheme is implemented in all the districts in states and union territories. Official statistics reveal that MGNREGS has a cumulative generation of 2235.93 crore person days and a total expenditure of Rs 3,70,667 crore. As on date 67,33,214 workers are expected to be working in 4,42,385 sites across the country.The study took into account 48,000 households and 100,000 individuals belonging to 104 villages in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for their study. They found that the adverse impacts of the scheme would include decrease in agriculture and decline in crop incomes by 15 per cent in these states. Already, there is a decline in the availability of skilled farm labour.The data showed that the workers of this scheme were likely to opt for skilled work, which would have a significant adverse implication on the employment generation in rural India. The probability of an average farmer in Tamil Nadu finding skilled labour to work in paddy fields was as high as 85 per cent, as skill levels had declined in places where MGNREGS was implemented.Also, panchayats spend more time on implementing the MGNREGS with the result that the time spent on core functions like planning and service provision had declined by 75 per cent in the past six to eight years. Hence it was affecting the concept of panchayat raj.Women, however, have seen the positive impact of the scheme. Financial inclusion has significantly strengthened with women opening their own bank accounts without relying on their male counterparts, leading to relaxation in their budget constraints. Women have also spearheaded efforts to create common property resources like fruit orchards in villages using the income from the scheme. There are also seeking information about market price and acquiring gold and silver more.In Tamil Nadu where the government has provided free goats, the scheme has resulted in the animals becoming herds and all families owning them. Herd owners have withdrawn from agriculture and are ready to participate in agricultural activities only for a premium wage. Hence, given the current status, the farmers would have no option but to reduce the acreage or leave the land fallow, which could seriously affect food security and impact prices.Even as the MGNREGS is here to stay the state governments are adopting various strategies to keep the voters interested. They have suggested that the policy makers and bureaucrats ensure that failure in coordination is removed and that incentives and capacity building be given greater focus. The model agriculture produce market committee (APMC) act had to be implemented so that farmers could innovate. Panchayat raj institutions had to be strengthened, the states say."

The 46-year-old farmer-turned-entrepreneur runs a food company that manufactures products from indigenous crops grown by marginalized farmers. Ibu also practises natural farming at her own garden, where she's aided by her son Nafi, all of 5.Ibu grows a variety of indigenous crops to inspire other farmers to turn organic. ""If a farmer does not follow the three ways of farming  natural, organic and spiritual he will never have a good harvest,"" said Ibu who visited Bengaluru on Tuesday to attend a two-day natural farming summit organized by the Art of Living Foundation.While Ibu learnt natural farming a few years ago from her driver, baby sitter and house assistant, it comes naturally to Nafi. She's proud that he has learnt the tricks of the trade at such a tender age. ""When Nafi was only three months old, some farmers advised me to take him to the fields every morning, saying it was good for health. By the time he was 13 months old, he started watering the plants. Eventually, Nafi started interacting with farmers and learnt how to grow crops.""At Ibu's farm, one can find 129 varieties of edible plants like corn, sorghum, tubers, herbs, spices, fruits and rice in pots. She has another farm (half acre) in Ciawi, 30km from Jakarta, that houses more than 129 varieties of edible plants.""All plants in my garden are grown organically, without using chemicals and fertilizers. We convert our food waste into compost and use that as fertilizer. Unused, rotten food makes for good fertilizer as well. My son helps me in pulling out insects, if any,"" added Ibu.Her firm, Javara Indegenous Indonesia, manufactures coconut chips, jam, sugar and many more products from indigenous crops, thereby creating a supply chain for farmers in the market. ""At present, we are partnering with 52,000 farmers and cultivate around 1,100 varieties of indigenous rice,"" she said.Ibu also spoke about how she took to natural farming and inspired several other indigenous farmers in Indonesia to follow suit."

Roja has said.Addressing a press conference here on Sunday, she said that even BJP legislator from the city, Vishnu Kumar Raju, had been seeking a CBI inquiry into the issue.The government appears to have adopted a strategy to help land-grabbers, she alleged.Pointing the finger at Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, she said: Mr. Naidu and his son N. Lokesh, and Minister from the district Ganta Srinivasa Rao have a share in land-grabbing, and Visakhapatnam is their prime target.Ganja smugglingI was surprised when a section of the media reported that ganja smuggling in the Agency area was being done at the behest of Panchayat Raj Minister Ayyanna Patrudu.This is the time for people to come out and reject the TDP government, she said.Referring to a national survey on atrocities against women, Ms. Roja said that the names of two legislators of the TDP, Devineni Umamaheswara Rao and K. Atchannaidu, find a mention in it. They have to tender their resignations, she said.Referring to the demand for a new railway zone with headquarters in Visakhapatnam, Ms. Roja said that it had been close to three years, and the promise was yet to be fulfilled.The people of Vizag should question the TDP legislators on what they have achieved so far, she said.Falling short of calling the Chief Minister as one who brings bad luck, she said: Till about three years ago, A.P. was the rice bowl. Now, it is reeling under drought and the number of farmer suicides has doubled. Anantapur was a district that had given the highest mandate to the TDP in the 2014 elections. Today, it is a district that is witnessing large-scale migration of farmers and suicides.False casesShe alleged that the voice of the Opposition was being stifled in Assembly by the ruling party by foisting false cases on us and our leader Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy.Former Chief Secretary Ramakanth Reddy had, in an interview, said that Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy was falsely implicated in various cases at the behest of the Congress and the TDP, she said. If we raise our voice inside Assembly, we are banned from entering it, and if we do it outside, we are arrested and booked under false cases. This is not democracy, she asserted."
5922ddc27be9e01fc006f98c,The flowers that launched a thousand haikus,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/the-flowers-that-launched-a-thousand-haikus/article17895938.ece,2017-04-09,"Cherry blossoms or sakura , the flowers that have launched a thousand haikus, are in full bloom in Japan. During peak flowering time, which lasts from a week to 10 days, the nation engages in a frenzy of blossom appreciation with the kind of ardour that other countries reserve for sporting events or religious festivals. In the run-up to sakura , a televised Cherry Blossom Forecast offers a petal-by-petal analysis of the advance of the blooms as they ripple from the south to the north like a pink and white Mexican wave.And because this is Japan, a country that loves accuracy and order, the sakura season isnt official until a specially appointed civil servant  an army of officials spends weeks examining barometer trees in locations that are secret  gives the signal that yes, indeed, the trees are in bloom. Over 600 different varieties of cherry trees exist, but its the pale pink blossoms of the yoshino that are used by the bloom-investigating bureaucrats as the yardstick by which to judge the season open.Among the cherry blossoms fans are swooning poets and aesthetes, but also cash register-dinging retailers. Like with Christmas in the West, shops in Japan are quick to switch to saccharine sakura mode, with cherry blossom Kit Kats, cherry blossom cookie cutters, sakuramochi or rice cakes wrapped in cherry tree leaves and so on and on, on offer. You can sip on a cherry blossom mojito (with sakura liqueur and cranberry juice instead of the usual white rum) in upmarket bars.But its more in keeping with tradition to have a wild booze-up under a cherry blossom tree. For the short sakura period, usually staid city parks are transformed into rowdy scrums with everyone from grandmas to pet dogs in prams in the mood to party. The mode of this partying is the hanami , literally looking at flowers, which is a flower appreciation picnic held under the blossoming trees.Force of beautyUsual social conventions are turned topsy-turvy by the sheer force of beauty. The quiet and polite morph into raucous revellers. Students visit the trees playing hooky from classes. Neighbourhoods organise their own sake -soaked viewings. Companies send their newest employees to stake out areas, by spreading blue tarp on prized squares of ground, for corporate picnicking. Modern-day hanamis are a democratic microcosm of Japanese society, but the tradition has origins stretching back to at least a thousand years, when it was mostly aristocrats and poets who would philosophise and sip sake (rice wine) under the shade of blossoms. Some of the finest bards wrote their most beloved verses while enjoying a cherry blossom picnic.Consider Kobayashi Issas (1762-1827) haiku:Under the cherry-blossomsnone are utter strangers.Or Matsuo Bashos (16441694):Between our two livesthere is also the life ofthe cherry blossom.This haiku refers to the philosophical underpinning of the Japanese fascination with sakura : their ephemeral nature. Within a week of blooming, cherry blossom petals float gently off the trees in a snow-like flurry and no human entreaty can prevent this swift, yet elegant demise. Sakura are an embodiment of mono no aware, a Japanese aesthetic concept that refers to the pathos of things evoked by an awareness of their impermanence. It is the pain of the finiteness of things, laced with the knowledge that transience is an essential part of their beauty or essence. Luckily in Japan, its easy enough to numb the pain with a long swig of sake and a wistful bite of red-bean filled mochi (rice cake).Modern-day hanamis are a democratic microcosm of Japanese society, but the tradition has origins stretching back to at least a thousand years"

5922dfcc7be9e01fc7f5afff,Property insurance likely to go up,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/property-insurance-likely-to-go-up/articleshow/58617304.cms,2017-05-11,"Chennai: Insurers are likely to increase their rates on property/fire insurance post-July, after the insurance regulator on Wednesday instructed them to peg new rates to the Insurance Information Bureau's (IIB) revised data.The regulator also increased the list of risk occupancies from 90 to 109, effective from July 1, 2017.How does the move affect the industry? Till 2007, rates were fixed when it came to fire and property insurance. The only differentiater an insurer could offer was the service quality as rates fixed. Later, when the industry was de-tarriffed, there was unhealthy, cut-throat competition among insurers as they fought over clients; offering them lower and lower rates as incentives. ""Charging lower premiums at some point started affecting the profitability of that line of business and the servicing of claims. Loss ratios increased from around 30% before de-tarrifing to 60-75% in recent years. And in an effort to cut losses IRDAI came out with the first set of regulations in 2015,"" said an executive from United India Insurance Co.The regulator then set out guidelines on how much an insurer could charge on fire policies. ""IRDAI then instructed the IIB to come with a rate insurers could charge for different occupancies. The way we insure a cinema theatre or rice mill or hospital would be different from how we'd insure a godown which had inflammable goods. For instance, an IT office would have a much lower insurance/fire risk than a manufacturing unit. So IIB put together rates based on occupancy. And now they've revised the rates in 2017, after the 2014 guidelines,"" said an executive at a private insurer.The guidelines are to ensure that insurers' do not charge premiums that are lower than prudent.""What the new guidelines say is that you can take IIB's rates. Or you can make your internal assessment and set your own rate. But your base rate cannot be lower than IIB rate,"" said the executive.The assumption is that the base rate, plus the cost of acquiring the new business, management expenses  which is the ""burning cost"" should be proportional to the premium so that the company does not make losses.""The idea being that with the new burning cost calculated, you cannot make losses. Of course fire as a line of business does not make as high losses as health and other portfolios; but it still is better to be prudent,"" said the executive.Another guideline the IRDAI has issued is with regard to IIB data on burning costs does not include natural catastrophes such as strong typhoons, flood, inundation (STFI) risks and earthquake. The regulator has instructed insurers to use their own judgement for pricing add-on covers, apart from FLEXA risks (fire, lightning, explosion, aircraft (insurance)."

Amjyot Singh Gill (L) and Amritpal Singh pose with cheerleaders of Tokyo Excellence.Palpreet Singh Brar was to feature in an NBA draft. Instead, the 23-year-old is close to signing a deal that will take him in the opposite direction to Japan. This is not the first time that an Indian will look east for exposure. Amjyot Singh Gill and Amritpal Singh have quietly put in the hard yards in Japans National Basketball Development League. Shahid Judge retraces the steps of the two trailblazers, who might have taken a giant leap for Indian basketball.Bowing and BrellasTwo summers ago with the cherry blossoms in all their May glory, hoopsters Amjyot Singh and Amritpal Singh took their first trip to Japan. They were in Hyogo, training with the Hyogo Impulse ahead of the summer league. Abroad and alone for the first time with only each other for company, doubts steadily crept into their heads  as the first wave of home-sickness hit. How will we adjust? Yahan roti bhi nahi milta, alag khana hai recalls 25-year-old Amjyot. Wasabi was yet to hit the Punjabi palate that had grown up on the slow charred cook of the paneer tikka.But they found support from Rohit Bakshi, an Indian businessman born and brought up in Japan, and co-owner of the Team Hamamatsu, a 33 basketball team that would sign Amjyot a year later. He would take the boys around the area to help get them acquainted with their surroundings.One night, returning from dinner, the trio would get caught in the rain. Theyd find shelter under the shed of a shop, needing to sprint the remaining 100 metres back to their apartment. Japan suddenly didnt seem like a bright idea. That was until an elderly lady, almost half their size, approached them with three over-sized umbrellas.It was around 11 at night, and we didnt even notice the lady pass us by, recalls Amjyot. A few minutes later she handed us the umbrellas and walked away. We tried looking for her the next few days but we never found her, and those umbrellas stayed with us.For the two cagers, it was their first experience of Japanese hospitality. It helped them overcome their fears faster than they thought. A few days later, they walked to a grocery store in Hyogo. Before they could enter, a staff member rushed out to meet the pair. We couldnt understand him, and he kept bowing. So we bowed back because thats how Japanese greet each other, Amjyot recalls. But he was actually telling us to mind our heads when we walk in! Surprises were not in short supply for the tall twosome in Japan.Indians Can Play Basket ballGetting the pair to Japan however, was never an easy prospect. The misconception in Japan was that Indian players cannot even hold a basketball, Bakshi says. According to the rules, a foreign player has to be associated with a recognised FIBA agent before travelling abroad to play professionally. No agent wanted to take on these two Indians. I was quite upset. I was meeting my old college coach for lunch one day, and he asked me what was bothering me. I told him, and he gave me a contact. Turns out, one of his juniors was an agent, Bakshi recalls, vividly.He got in touch quickly, and the deal was finalized. Amjyot and Amritpal were to play for the Impulse for the duration of the 2015 summer league  the contract double their Indian salaries with PSU employers in India. But there too the agent was clear. He told me that this was just a favour and that he had no interest in the boys, Bakshi says.In the first week of matches, they averaged 40 points each in the 20 odd minutes they got on court. Teammates and opponents, were stunned by the level of skill and flair the duo brought into the game. All of a sudden, everyone was taking the Indian pair seriously, agent included. More importantly, the pair managed to capture the imagination of the Tokyo Excellence coach who was scouting from the stands. The summer league ended in August 2015. A month later, the pair signed up for the Itabashi-based outfit.GulliversHome & AwayOvernight, new posters were put up, decorating the streets and bylanes of Itabashi City, in the Tokyo Metropolis of Japan. From the local barbers shop, to any grocery store, the posters would be there, bearing photographs of the Tokyo Excellence team, and the schedule for the National Basketball Development League (NBDL) final the squad was to play in. Amjyot Singh Gill and Amritpal Singh remember seeing themselves on those posters for the first time at their usual grocery store.The pair walked in, ducking to pass through the door frame that was too short for Amjyots six-foot-nine and Amritpals seven-foot figures. They saw a poster neatly pinned up on the board that would normally exhibit the price list. It was their first glimpse of the fame the sport could bring to them.With Indian businessman and co-owner of Team Hamamatsu. They are on the posters of Tokyo Excellence. With Indian businessman and co-owner of Team Hamamatsu. They are on the posters of Tokyo Excellence.By now they were used to eyes following them wherever they went. Theyd experienced it in India as well. It wasnt too dissimilar in Japan, as they towered over the locals. Its a given, that if you are tall and in Japan, you probably are a basketballer, Amritpal says. In India, we get stopped all the time for photographs, but because people think were freaks of nature to be so tall. In Japan, they know we are professional athletes and people are respectful, adds the 26-year-old.When it was time to pay their bill, the store manager approached them. We had picked up just a few things, like some pancake mix. But the manager refused to let us pay. He didnt speak English, but he kept saying win, win, recalls Amritpal.Its into this very culture that another Punjab lad, six-foot-nine Palpreet Singh Brar may soon be venturing into. The 23-year-old was drafted into the NBA D-League, by the Long Island Nets, but could not secure a spot for himself in the starting roster. The team had a few players from the senior side (Brooklyn Nets) and wanted to take a few players they had waitlisted from the last two years. So they told me they will pick me next year, Palpreet says. So he followed Amjyot and Amritpal to Japan.Cook and Not-so-CleanLiving abroad meant that the pair would have to fit in the household chores into their daily schedule. And they started quite well, looking after the two-bedroom apartment the team had allotted to them. Simple cheez tha, main khana banata tha, Amjyot bartan saaf karta tha, Amritpal says. They also managed to find a store that stocked Indian ingredients  complete with garam masala.At the beginning, theyd work together to keep their apartment tidy. But it wasnt long till they slacked off. Theyd start cleaning up the place when they knew I was coming over. Paaji aa rahe hai, chalo safai kar lete hai, Bakshi recalls laughing. Eventually, they didnt bother cleaning whether I was coming or not. Until I told them that you guys are disgusting.Then there was the problem of getting them ready on time. On occasions, the Tokyo Excellence team would provide a bus service to the players. True to the stereotype of Punjabi punctuality, Bakshi had warned the team officials to give the boys an earlier timing to make sure the team doesnt get delayed. A lady was in charge since she could speak English. So I told her to tell the boys 10:30 if it was actually 11. And theyd still get late, Bakshi laughs. Eventually they improved, but it was more out of respect for the lady than for them wanting to be on time.Fans Favourite AmjyotLife in Japan also required them to travel on their own, particularly in the metro, during rush hour. It was a sight to see. Both of them had to bow down to get inside the train. Amjyot was still alright, but Amritpal had to bend the entire time because his head would touch the top if he was standing, Bakshi says  the roof roughly at 72 same height as Amritpal.(Clockwise from top) Amjyot, six-foot nine, and Amritpal, seven foot, tower over locals at a metro station in Tokyo. (Clockwise from top) Amjyot, six-foot nine, and Amritpal, seven foot, tower over locals at a metro station in Tokyo.A translation application they had downloaded on their mobile phones was their key method of communication. Eventually they didnt need much of that to get around. The rage they had created on court started making waves around Itabashi. People around the neighbourhood recognised the pair as the two tallest players in their local team. Even if the language proved to be a barrier, a simple smile from the duo had the Japanese locals bowing down in greeting. Amjyot anyway has a very charming personality. Hes always smiling and talking. Amritpal is the quieter one, but still very polite. And together these two giants were easy to get noticed, Bakshi says.Outside, they would not remain unknowns for too long. But on court, they became an instant hit with fans. The cheerleaders only wanted to pose with those two, Bakshi laughs. On some match days, fans queue up for autographs. Amjyots was always the longest queue, and he ended up getting the team bus delayed because of it.Mini Punjab in TokyoBakshi initially was sir, but soon became paaji. The 35-year-old grew fond of the pair and found himself spending more time with them, sometimes even staying overnight at their apartment. He took them around  sometimes for dinner or even a movie. On Baisakhi, he took them to a Gurudwara in Tokyo.Amjyot, had been a budding fast bowler in Chandigarh before a back injury took him out of the game. Once he recovered, his father, who played the game as a form of physical fitness in the police force, nudged him towards the big ball. Meanwhile, Amritpal was first introduced to the game as an 18-year-old at the Ludhiana Basketball Academy where he first met Amjyot. Before that, the Fattuwal village resident used to play circle kabaddi and spent most of his time helping his parents in the family farms, tending to the wheat and rice crops. Even today, he enjoys working on the farm when hes at home.As soon as I get home, my parents give me a broom and some tools and tell me to get to work. It doesnt matter that Im a professional athlete, Amritpal laughs. In Tokyo, steadily, Bakshi became their elder brother, as they would confide in him and seek advice on a range of topics, be it family matters, their love lives, boarding, and even basketball. In turn, he found that he steadily started speaking in the North-Indian dialect.Earlier, I could only understand it a bit and spoke more in Hindi. But because of them, I started talking in Punjabi. Through them, he learnt and often finds himself humming tunes of the latest Punjabi and Bollywood tracks. They were heavily into Diljit Dosanj, Badshah and Honey Singh. It grew on me too.India First AlwaysThen there was Amjyots fiery ambition on court. Considered among the most naturally talented players India has produced, it wasnt uncommon to see the Chandigarh-lad shouting instructions to his teammates. Only, the language was a problem, and Amritpal was the only one who could understand. The pair would more often than not pull the team through to a win, but sometimes, they would fall short. Ive seen Amjyot crying on the sidelines whenever that happened, Bakshi says.At the end of the season, Amjyot would prove to be second best shot blocker in the league, and Amritpal would have the third highest field goal percentage  stats that helped the pair pull the team to another title. Their talent got them the opportunity to play in Japan. Still, they would not neglect their responsibilities to the national team where they were the tallest players on the Indian team  and not reluctant to play back then like Satnam.On one occasion, Amjyot and Amritpal reached Bangalore from Japan early morning, while the team was expected to fly out to Hong Kong later in the evening. Tired and jet-lagged, the duo reached the court half an hour after landing for the last practice session before the tournament. They were tired, but they came, dressed in their kit for that session, says current India captain Vishesh Bhriguvanshi. I told them that since theyre here, that wed walk on court and go over a few drills. It was the only chance for us to train together, but they ended up doing a full session.How the East was WonThe first time the pair got on court at Tokyo Excellence, they were asked to play in unfamiliar positions. Both were used to passing and shooting outside the area, charging in occasionally. But the coach wanted Amjyot to drive in every time, and Amritpal to play as a centre  win rebounds and tap home two pointers from under the basket. Then the coach decided to let them play their natural game, and they started using their old skills and the new ones they developed. It scared the Japanese players, Bakshi says.They had become an integral part of the team, and the management knew it. So much so that when Amjyot injured his back before the semi-finals, team officials stepped in to provide him with as much medical assistance as possible. There was no way he would recover for the semis. But the team brought in lots of physios who worked hard on him. He was declared fine to play just a day before, Bakshi adds. Amjyot followed up the successful 2015-16 campaign by helping Team Hamamatsu reach the final of the FIBA 33 World Tour Finals in Doha, Qatar last November.The pair are looking for greener pastures now. They recently attended the two-day National Basketball League (NBL) Draft Combine in Australia, and are rumored to have impressed scouts. But theyve paved the way for Palpreet to take over in the far East. He wasnt getting a chance in the US, but in Japan hell get playing time and exposure, Amritpal says. They have left a legacy behind in Japan, along with the umbrella.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

Arumugam, the villagers in a memorandum submitted to Collector S Natarajan here on Monday, complained that they were very poor people holding BPL ration cards and the officials who conducted the enumeration stamped their cards as NPHH. The government has began the exercise as mandated under the National Food Security Act, 2013 before issuing smart cards.Stating that about 150 BPL ration cards in the village were wrongly reclassified as NPHH ration cards, the villagers said that the salesman in the fair price shop in their village had said that they would not be entitled to get rice and other essentials after they were issued smart cards with NPHH tag.They said after agriculture failed for the second consecutive season this year in the district due to failure of monsoons they were surviving purely on rice distributed in the ration shop and the NPHH tag had come as a shock to them. When contacted, the District Supply Officer said the classification might have been done based on facts that the cardholders would be living in bungalows, owned cars, had two cooking gas cylinders and more than five acres of land. The tagging, however, would not deprive them of ration items, he said."

Vijayan penned his magnum opus Khasakinte Ithihasam (Legendas of Khasak) with the scenic Thasrak village in Palakkad district as backdrop, its 205-minute-long theatre version, infused with poetry and unbridled dramatic energy, is set to be staged by April last week, that too on the premises of Njattupura, the rustic building used to store rice seeds and agricultural implements where the novels protagonist, Ravi, taught children.This is the first time that the drama by Deepan Sivaraman, which won much critical acclaim, is visiting Thasrak that still retains its rustic charm.The three-day O.V. Vijayan festival, in which the drama would be staged, will begin on April 29 and it also comprises literary seminars, cultural programmes, poets meets, and an exhibition. Gramaya, a collective of old students of Palakkad Polytechnic, is taking the initiative to organise the programme, which would help improve the literary pilgrimage prospectives of Thasrak .Three-day feteKerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi and O.V. Vijayan Memorial Committee are also involved in the conduct of the three-day festival in which the role of Thasrak in shaping the literary career of the cartoonist-turned-writer would be explored.Though Vijayan found most of his characters from the village in which he stayed along with his sister while she was working with the single-teacher school there way back in 1956, Thasrak was not properly acknowledged or assessed in the Malayalam literary world. So we thought of bringing the drama to Khasak, along with its legendary characters Maimoona, Allapicha Mollakka, and Naisamali, said Sudheesh Kumar, one of the organisers of the event.Located in the middle of vast stretches of paddy fields, Thasrak had metamorphosed into Khasak in the acclaimed novel, published first in 1969. It has had over 50 reprints in the past 45 years. Believed to be more than a century old, the venue Njattupura was a temporary shelter for Vijayan during the late fifties and sixties.Acclaimed dramaIt was two years ago that Deepan Sivaraman, theatre director, scenographer, and associate professor at Ambedkar University, rendered The Legends of Khasak in theatrical form. The director, who has designed and directed more than 60 performances for various companies and academic institutions in India and Europe, was able to stage it in different parts of the country under the banner of KMK Nataka Samithy at Thrikkarippur in Kasaragod district."
5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

The USDA's supply/demand report on Wednesday will include the government's first official crop production and usage estimates for the 2017/18 marketing year. Wet conditions that have slowed planting in some crop areas added support. The USDA on Monday said the U.S. soybean crop was 14 percent planted, behind the five-year average of 17 percent and below an average of analyst expectations for 16 percent. The most active corn futures advanced 0.1 percent to $3.66-3/4 a bushel, after gaining 0.1 percent in the previous session. The most active wheat futures remained unchanged at $4.29-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.9 percent on Tuesday. The government also reported that the U.S. spring wheat crop was 54 percent planted, behind the five-year average of 60 percent, but well above the average trade expectation of 45 percent. Wheat remained under pressure on fears of widespread production losses as a result of a recent frost ease.

One of his five sons, 27-year-old Anuj who has been under treatment for schizophrenia, was booked for the murder.Police said Ishwar Chand Tyagi was shot in his sleep. He had retired for the night on a divan in the living room of the single-storey house, and that was where his lifeless body lay when his wife Rajkumari walked in around 6.45am.On the basis of a complaint filed by Tyagi's nephew Amit later in the day, murder charges were filed against Anuj (Dabbu) at Kavi Nagar police station. No arrests have been made yet.SP (City) Akash Tomar told TOI, ""The wife of the deceased has corroborated the allegations made in the police complaint and confirmed that Anuj had indeed shot at Tyagi. We have formed three teams to nab the accused while efforts are under way to trace his location. The body was sent for an autopsy and its report is awaited.""Anuj, who used to live in a separate house in Kavi Nagar had come to his father's place on Wednesday evening and stayed overnight.Since the shooting, he has gone missing and switched off his mobile phone. The others present in the house at the time of the murder included Amit, a domestic help Manish and Tyagi's daughters-in-law. Police said Tyagi's elder brother Ranveer had also visited the residence on Wednesday but had left at night.Anuj and Tyagi's youngest son Kapil live in Ghaziabad. Of Tyagi's three elder sons, Pravin and Kuldeep live in Mumbai while Sanjiv is a cop, a UP-cadre officer now posted in Lucknow as SP (cooperatives) cell. Tyagi owned a rice mill. The family is originally from Morta village in Ghaziabad.Police said there were differences between Anuj and Tyagi, which had led to quarrels between the two. Anuj is believed to have suffered huge financial losses in a company in which he had invested as a partner around three years ago. A source said he had a history of violent behaviour and had been jailed in the past for opening fire inside a park. Anuj has been undergoing treatment at Vimhans in Delhi for the past few years.Dr Neerav Tyagi, superintendent of Pulmonic hospital that examined Tyagi's body, said, ""The victim was brought to the hospital around 8.30am. There was a single lacerated wound at the top of his skull. He was dead by the time his body was brought to the emergency ward of the hospital.""The hospital issued a memo about the death to police around 9.30am. Teams of policemen thereafter reached the hospital as well as the Tyagi residence for investigations."

""The main reason for the mission this week is to look for Brazilian suppliers of grains,"" Urteaga said.Mexico wants to substitute mainly U.S. corn suppliers.A longer-term objective is to deepen an economic cooperation agreement between Brazil and Mexico. ""Both sides are seeking better access to each other markets,"" Urteaga said without elaborating on any deals closed.The Mexican visit coincides with looming talks to change the North American Free Trade Agreement and underscores Mexico's concerns about a possible overhaul of the pact with Canada and the United States.Mexico's agricultural exports, ranging from beer to meat and tequila, total about $30 billion a year, with the U.S. buying 78 percent of the country's agricultural products, Urteaga said.""The rhetoric coming out of Washington is only focusing on merchandise trade, and what matters here is the total account,"" he said referring to American companies operating in Mexico, which benefit from the trade of goods and services and can repatriate profits as a result of such exchanges.Mexico's poultry industry uses about 10 million tonnes of corn and 3 million tonnes of soybean meal as animal feed each year, said Cesar Macias, head of the National Union of Poultry Farmers, who is also in the delegation.Mexico does not produce the yellow corn needed to feed animals, and the U.S. standing as the country's priority supplier may be coming to an end.Feed represents 70 percent of chicken and egg production costs, he said.""Trade with the U.S. is very efficient because of the infrastructure in place but we believe Brazil can also be competitive, especially if it can efficiently ship production out of its northern ports,"" Macias said.

We will impose heavy penalty on the company and initiate an enquiry into the matter even though its contract ends on May 12,"" Sharma said.According to the NR officials, the four-year-old contract of the company was suspended on May 8, four days before its closure, on grounds of repeated complaints about the quality of food being served. Catering services on board Rajdhani Express will be taken over from the NR by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism and Corporation (IRCTC). IRCTC has hired another New Delhi-based catering company for the purpose.Wednesday's fiasco may be triggered from the suspension of contract. ""The company told us that its staff did not turn up for work,"" a senior NR official said.Train attendants, who reached Ranchi on Thursday morning, claimed most of the contractual staff was convinced that they will not get their salary even if they worked as the company's contract was suspended.Passengers have long been complaining about the quality of the food being served on the Rajdhani Express. Last year, two passengers had posted photographs of insects in pulses and rice that were served on board the train. Passengers also faced various problems during winters. With the train running hours behind its schedule due to fog in Northern India, many passengers claimed that the catering company did not serve them meals because of timing delays."

The tenders close on May 18. The TMO will hold 15 separate tenders each for 12,000 tonnes of corn, with Russia not named as an accepted origin, traders said.WHEAT TENDER UPDATE: Iraq's state grains board is continuing talks in an international tender to buy at least 50,000 tonnes of wheat after the deadline for offer validity passed, European traders said. The tender from Iraq's state grains buyer sought wheat from the United States, Canada or Australia only and closed on May 7 with offers having to remain valid until May 11. The cheapest price offered in the tender was $267.17 a tonne c&f free out for wheat sourced from the United States. The lowest offer for Australian wheat was $271.17 a tonne c&f free out, traders said. Iraq has held several wheat tenders in recent months without announcing a purchase.WHEAT PURCHASE UPDATE: Algeria' state grains agency OAIC bought around 470,000 tonnes of milling wheat and 75,000 tonnes of animal feed barley in a tender which closed on Wednesday, European traders said. The origin of both grains is optional, but traders said they thought the barley is likely to be sourced from the Black Sea region. Some put the barley purchase at 70,000 tonnes.PENDING TENDERS:RICE TENDER: Iraq's state grains buyer is seeking to purchase about 100,000 tonnes of rice to be sourced from the United States, European traders said. Offers are to be submitted on May 15 and must remain valid until May 21, they said.RICE TENDER: South Korea's Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp issued an international tender to purchase around 65,000 tonnes of rice, European traders said. The tender registration deadline is May 15, they said.WHEAT AND BARLEY TENDER: Jordan's state grain buyer issued new international tenders to purchase 100,000 tonnes of hard milling wheat and 100,000 tonnes of animal feed barley both to be sourced from optional origins, European traders said. Deadline for the wheat tender is May 16 and deadline for the barley tender is May 17, they said.WHEAT TENDER UPDATE: Japan's Ministry of Agriculture said it received no offers for feed-quality wheat or barley in a simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) auction that closed late on May 10. The ministry had sought 120,000 tonnes of feed wheat and 200,000 tonnes of feed barley to be loaded by August 31 and arrive in Japan by October 31 in the tender that is usually conducted weekly. It is seeking the same amounts for each grain to be loaded and shipped during the same period in a similar tender that will be held on May 17.RICE TENDER: Mauritius' state purchasing agency issued an international tender to buy up to 6,000 tonnes of long grain white rice sourced from optional origins, European traders said. Tender deadline is May 19, traders said.RICE TENDER: Bangladesh's state grains buyer issued an international tender to import 50,000 tonnes of parboiled rice, state grains officials said, its first such tender in many years. The deadline for offers is May 21 and the rice is to be shipped in 40 days after signing the deal, a senior official at the state grains buyer said.The head of the state grain buyer said the agency will import 600,000 tonnes of rice in an effort to replenish reserves and rein in prices of the staple.(Compiled by Julie Ingwersen)"

The price of various rice varieties has gone up by Rs. 5 to Rs. 10 a kg during the past one-and-a-half-month period.While the price of the much sought-after Jaya variety touched Rs. 48 a kg, the Kuruva and Bodha varieties have touched Rs. 38 and Rs. 33 respectively, a situation unheard of in the past, says Kumaran, a grocery merchant at Mavungal in Kanhangad.The increase of Rs. 4 a litre of milk has added to the woes of the consumers who are slowly coming out of the general slump generated in the economy due to demonetisation of higher value currency notes.The price of sugar that was hovering around Rs. 35 a few weeks ago had shot up to Rs. 41 and some retailers sell it at Rs. 44. The price of raw rice has touched Rs. 24 and chilli Rs. 380 a kg. The hike in price of coconut oil, Rs. 150 a litre, has also affected consumers badly.The Public Distribution System is also not offering any relief to the consumers thanks to the short supply of food grains from the Central pool."

Chandrasekhar Rao with Anganwadi workers as part of his Janahitham programme with a cross section of population at his camp office on Monday. Mr. Rao also announced that the nomenclature Anganwadi workers be changed to Anganwadi teachers. Within hours of the announcement, a government order modifying the nomenclature was issued.Second hikeThis is the second hike in honorarium for personnel at Anganwadi centres in less than two years. It was hiked from Rs. 4,200 to Rs. 7,000 for teachers and Rs. 2,200 to Rs. 4,500 for helpers in February 2015. It will benefit 67,411 teachers and helpers at 35,700 centres in the State.A release after the meeting said it was also decided that the Anganwadi teachers will be promoted as supervisors on the basis of their seniority and qualifications. The teachers as well as helpers will be insured. They will be given priority in the allotment of double bedroom houses.Fine rice will be cooked for consumption by pregnant and lactating women and children at the centres from next month. The cooked rice will be home delivered in May as the women and children will find it difficult to go to the centres due to oppressive summer."

There are 110 settlements in the sanctuary.Sources said 24 of the 238 families at Chettyalathur, the largest settlement inside the sanctuary; five of the six at Ponkuzhi; eight of the nine at Easwarankolly; and all families of Narimanthikolly and Puthur had shifted base.Though we have 50 cents with title deeds and a house, we are living in a rented house at Kudukki, near Cheeral, nearly 12 km from my land owing to continuous attack from wild animals, says K. Narayanan of Chettyalathur settlement.He said 25 students doing courses in institutions at Sulthan Bathery and Cheeral used to travel nearly 5 km through dense forests fearing wild elephants and leopards.238 familiesA total of 238 families, including 82 tribal families, are living in the settlement and are in possession of 265 acres with proper title deeds. We cultivated rice on 165 acres till 2001. Now, the land has been left fallow owing to increasing attacks by wild animals, says T. Sreedharan, a marginal farmer from the settlement.We are depending on odd jobs outside the settlement for our livelihood, he adds.The plight of farmers in the other settlements is no different, N. Badhusha, president, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samithi, says. More than 100 settlers had been killed in wild animal attacks in the past 20 years, he said.2010 studyA study in 2010 under the supervision of S. Sankar, scientist at KFRI, Peechi, identified 1,388 people from 880 families in 14 settlements for relocation in the first phase at an estimate of Rs. 88 crore. But only 213 families had been relocated under the project since it launch in 2011, Mr. Badhusha said.The settlers fear the resettlement project, the first in the State and the largest outside the tiger reserves in southern India, will collapse if the delay and funds issues are not sorted out immediately."
5922e7c27be9e01fc7f5b80f,Selfies from Garbage Goa,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/selfies-from-garbage-goa/articleshow/58651338.cms,2017-05-13,"GOA: Just below the water surface near Grande Island, opposite Dabolim airport, a carpet of trash stretches in every direction. Up on the little beach, and spread all around its picturesque vistas, the situation is even worse. A fortnight ago, I joined a group of licensed divers and volunteers from the Goa-based NGO, Coastal Impact, for a clean-up of this ostensibly idyllic spot.The experience was a deeply disturbing eye-opener. Tour operators who picnic on the island have left massive amounts of garbage. Underwater, we picked up bottles hand over fist like previous generations must have collected mussels. In just a couple of hours of work, the team amassed 45 large jute bags filled with glass and plastic, and transferred them to the mainland for recycling.A few days later, I did some time-honoured evening rambling with my sons through beloved Bardez fieldscapes we've returned to constantly ever since they were able to walk. Some things have not changed: dappled sunlight fading golden over the hills, flocks of egrets winging overhead to roost. But then again, shock, horror and rude awakening. The quaint narrow paths through rice paddies from Pilerne across to Saligao have become lined with glass and plastic, beer cans and snack food detritus. Just recently pristine terrain, but now we had to step carefully because innumerable bottles lay smashed along the route. On the way out, there was a tourist taxi parked incongruously right down on the fields, surrounded by men hoisting cans of beer. On the way back, no car or men, but the cans remained.Shift the focus to Miramar, where we walk most evenings until crimson flashes low on the horizon. Here, the Captain of Ports irresponsibly granted permission for ultra-low budget tour boats to ply right off the beach, without any provisions for oversight, appropriate infrastructure, or enforcement of any rules. Chaos and filth has resulted. The stand of casuarina trees leading from Miramar circle to the tour boats is strewn throughout with mounds of trash. Vendors sit bus-station style on the sands. Hordes of domestic tourists trample through the vegetation, toss garbage at their feet, and line up to urinate directly onto the sands. The beloved Panaji landmark has never been so abused, so abandoned.These are snapshots of personal experiences, but the bottom line is universal and inescapable. Golden Goa is now Garbage Goa. Every successive government swears this issue is highest priority, and then the situation becomes worse. On September 14, 2014, then-chief minister Manohar Parrikar trumpeted his new ""clean Goa, beautiful Goa"" campaign, declaring ""all beaches will be garbage-free within a year. By December 19 this year, almost 90-95% of the garbage will disappear from the beaches."" Nothing happened, the beaches only became filthier. Today, every roadside is festooned with signboards for ""Swachh Bharat, Nitol Goem"", and again-chief minister Manohar Parrikar promises the state will be garbage-free by 2020, ""you will see results in six months."" Don't hold your breath.Everyone understands garbage is a thorny problem that cannot be easily resolved, anywhere in the world. What cannot be forgiven is nonsense promises made in the knowledge they will be broken, and denial that the problem exists in the first place. This is Goa, where the administration is much more interested in beating its chest over the multi-crore waste management plant in Saligao (which steadily pollutes the water resources downhill), than addressing the shameful fact of piles of garbage lining the roads leading to and from the facility.Millions of further dollars are committed for more advanced technologies to deal with trash, while the required political will and comparatively small sums of rupees are absent to actually go pick it up. Like most else gone awry in Goa, this is gross mismanagement.A few easy steps would dramatically reduce the scale of Garbage Goa's problems, but they require political will and vision. Bottles and cans should carry a ten rupee redeemable deposit. Just like Sikkim, Goa must ban disposable thermocol and styrofoam, and greatly restrict the sale and use of PET and plastic. For the next couple of years, every major beach in Goa should have small teams of camera-equipped ""Green Police"" to record, identify, and fine anyone who does not use clearly signposted waste facilities. Everywhere in the state, illegal dumping can be deterred by judicious use of surveillance cameras and strict enforcement, including stiff fines.Any government that applies these measures would guarantee the lasting gratitude of the electorate. And then just maybe we can talk about Golden Goa again.The writer is a photographer and a widely published author and . The views expressed are his own."

Rice would be provided at subsidised rates through the 1,535 outlets of Supplyco.

5922e7cd7be9e01fc7f5b822,#CompassionatePune initiative brings summer respite to strays,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/compassionate-pune-recuses-strays/articleshow/58647602.cms,2017-05-13,"For the spate of incidents of cruelty against (especially) street animals being reported, there's an equal number of examples, if not more, of people in the city working for their adoption and welfare. Case in point, the number of clay pots that have been lining streets in areas like Koregaon Park (KP), Kalyani Nagar, Boat Club Road and Shivajinagar, among others, of late. Replenished with drinking water regularly, these have been lovingly placed by a growing group of animal lovers - a mix of NGO members, volunteers, restaurateurs, societies and even watchmen, in a bid to make the harsh summer a bit easier for Pune's strays to get by.People doing their bit for animals in summer isn't new, but this is a revolution of sorts. Explaining why, Mojdeh Farashahi, one of the volunteers spearheading the drive, says, ""There's a lot you can do when people come together. Many were feeding strays in their vicinities, but we decided to team up this time to also implore more people to join in."" They've named the cause #CompassionatePune The pledge is simple, Mojdeh says. ""You have to just be willing to place a bowl of water, also agreeing to clean and replenish it daily."" And many seem to have warmed up to the idea. Restaurateurs including those of Prem's, Euriska, The Yogi Tree, High Spirits , The Flour Works and The Little Next Door have adopted or taken the responsibility to feed dogs from nearby.But it isn't just restaurateurs. Commercial set-ups (like Sabby's Tattoo Studio, Anand Opticians, Royal Medicals), NGOs and shelters (People ForAnimals, Bodhisattva, Petforce), housing societies (Nityanand Society on Boat Club Road), expats as well as security guards have taken up the cause, which is evident by the many heart-warming posts that Mojdeh puts up on Facebook every time someone pledges. ""There's great power in social media. Seeing thesepeople leading the way, many others have been inspired to join in,"" says Mojdeh.Anuja Alevoor, who tends to over 40 dogs in Kalyani Nagar, believes that such initiatives create awareness among the masses. ""As volunteers, we face a lot of harassment from residents. A movement like this can make people aware of the fact that if these animals are taken care of regularly, it will only help reduce human-animal conflict and improve co-existence.""Over 100 earthen pots have been placed across the city, with 50 in KP alone. Mojdeh says. ""To join in, one could either ask us for pots, sponsor some, or source some themselves."" Or, you could get innovative, like Mangaldas Road resident Manish Dholepatil. ""After our neighbours renovated their bathroom, I made their old washbasin a feeding bowl,"" says Manish. Installed outside Wellness Medicals on Dhole Patil Road, it has benefited strays and birds alike.After the institute shifted elsewhere, the dogs here were left to fend for themselves. I'm very attached to them, so I continue feeding them. This initiative will help me continue tending to these animals.  Raju Gaikwad, caretaker of the Mundhwa property previously rented out by FAD InternationalI wasn't used to seeing dogs on the streets; it was distressing. So, I decided to help the eight dogs in our vicinity in the best way possible. We replenish their water bowls and feed them chicken and rice every day. It's very gratifying!  Clementina Borsani, Italian expatriate from Naragi Baug Road Similar initiatives across India.To spread awareness about the plight of stray dogs and that they aren't harmful, student Eden Dias started this Facebook page last year. After uploading selfies with homeless dogs, she's started getting submissions too, hence furthering the message.Five students from LSR started this community to look after the feeding, sterilisation, and adoption of campus strays, thereby greatly reducing chances for human-animal conflict in colleges.For several years now, Anjali Sharma has been feeding homeless animals (at Harrington Road) out of a van. Restaurants have been helping out by providing leftover food."

Corn rose around half a percent while soybeans ticked up after closing marginally lower with the focus on planting weather in the U.S. Midwest, which is expected to be favourable for crops. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract was up 0.1 percent at $4.38 a bushel by 0301 GMT after dropping 3.6 percent in the previous session.

""The amount of snow that fell in the U.S. grain belt took the market a while to digest how much wheat is going to be lost but the reality is that the global supply outlook is unchanged,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist, National Australia Bank. ""In this environment how do you sustain a rally. There might be some downside to production in the U.S. but you have huge inventories and crops are looking good everywhere else."" For the week, wheat is up 1.3 percent, a second week of gains while soybeans have added almost 2 percent, the biggest weekly gain since Feb. 10. Corn is up for a second week. Wheat has come under heavy pressure in recent days as fears of production losses after recent cold weather across key growing regions eased. Wheat yield potential in Kansas was estimated at 46.1 bushels per acre (bpa), crop scouts on the annual Wheat Quality Council crop tour said on Thursday. That tops the tour's five-year average for the state. Concerns linger that recent wet weather in the United States may have washed away recently planted corn and soybeans crops. But forecasts for drier weather in key growing areas of the U.S. Midwest are likely to result in a pick up in the pace of planting.

It will affect negatively the ability of the government to move on the reform programme, with the risk of second-round inflation.""An IMF delegation arrived in Cairo on Sunday to review Egypt's progress with the reforms, a condition for the multilateral lender to disburse the second instalment of a $12 billion loan programme agreed in November.The reforms have included floating the Egyptian pound, which triggered a depreciation and eased a dollar shortage but also fuelled inflation. Annual urban consumer price inflation hit 30.9 percent in March, the highest in over three decades.Azour, who previously served as Lebanon's finance minister and as a senior executive at consultants Booz & Co, did not specify what actions Cairo should take to restrain inflation.But he said the IMF review now underway was ""an opportunity to look at all the policies the government is implementing"".IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said in early April that the IMF would discuss both tighter monetary and fiscal policies as ways to bring down Egyptian inflation.Azour said the IMF review was expected to be completed in the next couple of months, roughly in line with Cairo's expectations. Finance Minister Amr El-Garhy said in mid-March that Egypt expected to receive the second instalment of the IMF loan in May or June.The IMF is also providing financial assistance or policy advice across the rest of North Africa. In Morocco, it has been encouraging authorities to let the exchange rate move more freely to help fight inflation and shrink the country's trade deficit.The Moroccan central bank said last month the initial stage in a programme to liberalise the dirham would start in the second half of this year, but it is not yet clear how quickly a new government - formed only in April in the wake of last October's election - will pursue the policy.Azour said he understood the reform was on track to begin by the end of this year. ""As planned, this move has been prepared by the central bank and communicated to the banking system, and is expected to be implemented in 2017.""

As against Rs 18.33 crore revenue in 2014-15 and Rs 21.74 crore in 2015-16, the income of the temple has jumped to Rs 24.09 crore in 2016-17.With around 2,000 devotees visiting the hill shrine every day  the footfall rises to about 5,000 during holidays  to have the darshan of the goddess Chamundeshwari, the temple has seen a rise in its revenue. It has earned Rs 9.17 crore from hundis. The revenue through the special entrance fee has risen from Rs 1.95 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 2.41 crore in 2016-17. But the income through the general entrance fee, which is Rs 4.24 crore, has not seen much difference for the past two years.As the temple also sells a good number of laddus (prasadam) to devotees, it has fetched Rs 2.75 crore. It has also been able to garner Rs 1.13 crore from various sevas: Rs 1.16 crore from donations for dasohas, Rs 49.92 lakh from interest from various banks, Rs 7.10 lakh from e-seva and others sources.As movie producers of many languages prefer to shoot atop Chamundi Hills, the muzrai department collects Rs 35,000 for the shoots and this is said to have added to the revenue. The number of devotees offering saris to goddess Chamudeshwari has increased. The temple which earned Rs 47.53 lakh in 2014-15 by auctioning the saris, has generated Rs 1.49 crore in 2016-17.The temple could also generate revenue from donations through money orders and demand drafts, rent from guesthouse and halls, Sankasta Hara seva and others.Of the donations, Rs 3.5 lakh was in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 (demonetized currency notes). After the bank did not accept old notes, the temple authorities are possessing the scrapped currencies.Apart from donations, the temple also received offerings in the form of rice from devotees. It has received 87,510 kg of rice in 2016-17. The temple authorities have decided not to purchase rice for anna dasoha (mass-feeding) service this year.TVS Motor Company has given a battery-operated vehicle to ferry senior citizens and physically challenged persons between the bus stand and the temple. The temple has increased the duration of its anna dasoha from 12.30pm to 3.30pm (It was from 12.30pm to 2pm earlier).To enable devotees have hassle-free darshan, the temple has introduced swiping machines (PoS machines) to purchase tickets for special darshan and seva tickets (using debit or credit cards).Sri Chamundeshwari Temple executive officer Prasad told TOI that various development works have been taken to facilitate devotees, and they have led to the rise in the number of devotees."

The rice is being reportedly sold at a higher price.This has been going on for long in this district. There has been no action in this regard from the government or the administration. It is time the government took over the entire process of purchasing paddy, milling and supplying rice to the civil supplies corporation, said J. Venkama Raju, president, Andhra Pradesh Rythu Sangham.The main concern of the farmers associations is that the rice millers are forming a syndicate to deny farmers their rightful share of the benefits in paddy purchase.The ordinary grade variety paddy should be purchased at Rs. 12,499 per 850 kg bag from the farmers, but they are being offered nearly Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 less by the millers.In many instances in the past, the millers were said to have purchased paddy at lower price from the farmers and sold the same at the purchase centres at a higher cost. In this context, the farmers association leaders demanded that the role of the millers in procurement be eliminated by creating a revolving fund which should take over the process in the best interests of the farmers.Mr. Raju said gross violations had been committed in the custom milling rice (CMR) aspect last year and the Revenue Recovery Act should be applied to recover the nearly Rs. 400 crore from the erring rice millers, who were trying to avoid these payments under one pretext or the other."

A festival which gives adults a chance to forget their responsibilities for a while and make retreat to childhood. While in the good old times, the colours used for celebration were made at home, today a lot of toxins used in the synthetic colours result in rashes, itching and severe skin issues. The simplest way to make colours at home would be to mix any flour with food colour, but the fact that even the latter is increasingly getting contaminated of late begets a more organic solution. These are some simple methods to make your own customised colours at home this festival for healthy and holistic revelry.RedRed, the colour of celebration is the most beloved of all holi colours. A simple way to recreate this colour would be to dry red hibiscus flowers in shade, grind them and to increase its texture add any flour to it. Another alternative is to boil peels of pomegranate in water and use the water to splash colours.YellowThe marriage of haldi or Turmeric powder, a staple of every household with twice the quantity of besan (flour) results in a lovely yellow coloured gulal . Both haldi and besan are extremely beneficial for skin, so it acts as a natural exfoliate for your skin apart from adding a homemade tinge to the festivities. Besan, can be substituted by any kitchen regular  maida , rice flour or even multani mitti .GreenThe color of peace and prosperity can be easily achieved by using mehendi /henna powder and mixing it in equal quantities with any preferred flour. It also acts as a conditioner for your hair, which is only an added bonus. Another herbal substitute is to make a thick paste of green leaves (spinach, palak, pudina ), add it to water and drench family and friends!BrownBrown is used as a substitute for black, which is considered inauspicious.

Baker and Jessica ToonkelREUTERS - Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc is nearing a deal to acquire Tribune Media Co for close to $4 billion after prevailing in an auction for one of the largest U.S. television station operators, according to people familiar with the matter.A potential deal for Tribune, first reported by Reuters, could come as soon as Monday, just weeks after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters can buy.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai, named by President Donald Trump in January, is planning to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households.Still, a combined Tribune and Sinclair could surpass this cap and face some regulatory challenges which could result in divestitures, analysts said.The combination of Sinclair and Tribune would be a competitive blow to Fox because the added scale would give Sinclair more leverage in negotiations to carry Twenty-First Century Fox Inc's local networks. Together the companies would own a large chunk of Fox broadcast affiliates around the country.Fox Networks Group Chairman Peter Rice said at the Milken Institute Global Conference last week that Fox was looking to buy Tribune Media because ""having more scale and more control of distribution is important.""Twenty-First Century Fox was in talks with Blackstone Group LP last week about submitting an offer to buy Tribune Media, sources said at the time. Nexstar Media Group Inc also considered an acquisition of Tribune Media, sources have previously said.Fox never submitted a bid, according to a source familiar with the matter.Representatives for Fox and Blackstone both declined to comment.Sinclair's offer values Tribune Media at around $44 per share, the sources said on Sunday. That would represent a premium of close to 30 percent of the price of Tribune Media shares on Feb. 28, the day before Reuters broke the news that Sinclair had approached Tribune Media to discuss an acquisition.Tribune Media shares ended trading on Friday at $40.29, giving it a market capitalization of $3.5 billion.Negotiations between Sinclair and Tribune Media have not yet been finalized, and there is still a possibility the deal will not be reached, the sources cautioned.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Tribune Media declined to comment. Sinclair did not respond for comment.Tribune Media has 42 owned or operated broadcast stations, as well as cable network WGN America, Tribune Studios and WGN-Radio.

The Aranmula airport project is now a closed chapter with the National Green Tribunal cancelling the Environmental Clearance issued by the Union government for it.Greening missionThe Left Democratic Front government has decided to revive paddy cultivation in Aranmula Puncha as part of its Harita Kerala project. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunilkumar took special interest in reviving paddy cultivation in Aranmula Puncha.He visited the puncha on several occasions to assess the progress of work there. The government also deputed J. Sajeev, award-winning Agriculture Officer, as the Special Officer of its Mission Green Aranmula programme.According to Mr. Sajeev, paddy cultivation has already been completed in 101.01 hectares against the original target of 56 ha.Aranmula witnessed a historic harvest festival on February 20.

5922ef407be9e01fc7f5c14b,HC restores mangroves destroyed by illegal buildings,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/hc-restores-mangroves-destroyed-by-illegal-buildings/articleshow/58567714.cms,2017-05-08,"Mumbai: Judicial activism shown by the Bombay high court has come to the rescue of mangroves on a three-acre plot in Thane district. The mangroves had been destroyed by illegal constructions three years ago.On May 4, after numerous orders and site visits by the court receiver, mangrove saplings were back on the plot in Agasan village in Diva. Earlier, the Thane civic body had finally razed 160 unauthorised rooms and cleared the debris to ensure free flow of tidal water for their survival. The forest department planted two varieties of mangroves to ensure quick regeneration.The mangroves had been systematically destroyed with an illegal wall to cut off water supply. In its place, about 18 illegal chawls had sprouted, a few even after the high court had ordered their demolition.The brazen destruction was first highlighted by a local, Gangaram Patil, who filed a public interest litigation in early 2014. But in three months and after over half a dozen orders, Patil withdrew, without reason. By then the HC had already upbraided the state for its ""insensitivity'' and observed how ""due to their inaction, the mangroves have been destroyed''.The state was unable to point out the names of offenders and a criminal case was registered against unknown offenders with Mumbra police under the Environment Protection Act. A blame-game too had begun among various public departments, with the notorious bureaucratic red tape in play. But a bench of Justices Abhay Oka and M S Sonak, then hearing the matter, said the ""petition cannot be allowed to be withdrawn'' and directed the HC to suo motu (on its own) step in as the litigant in public interest. ""The mangroves have to be saved,'' said the bench on May 9, 2014.Three years later the mangroves finally were saved, despite the initial tardy, lackadaisical attitude of state, civic and forest officials. The HC had appointed its court receiver to take charge. The receiver, M S Deshpande, would inspect the site and report back to court, the steps taken and measures that needed to be adopted. Forest department citing Google imagery said two plots used to be substantially covered with mangroves.The HC persisted with its orders, even seeking the personal presence of Thane civic chief Sanjeev Jaiswal and M Vasudevan, chief conservator of forests, mangrove cell, on March 2. Jaiswal said the demolition was carried out but the ""huge expenses"" of demolition and debris clearance ""cannot be clamped on the corporation''. The court asked the corporation to submit bills but directed expeditious debris removal since monsoon was ""fast approaching"".Vasudevan and Makarand Ghodke , assistant forest conservator had said, ""EPA is the law to punish those responsible for destruction of mangroves on private land.'' The HC bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni were quick to point out that, ""at this stage'', what needed to be implemented was its earlier directions to restore mangroves already destroyed by cultivation and construction, ""even though it is a private land"". ""The restoration cost will have to be borne by the people who destroyed the mangroves for their benefit.''A few months ago, still not satisfied with the pace of restoration, the HC appointed Shiraz Rustomjee, a counsel who more than a decade ago was heavily into environmental litigation in public interest, as the second amicus curiae (friend of court) along with advocate Bhushan Walimbe. Ram Apte with Rohit Sakhadeo for the Thane civic body pointed to the plot being cleared of all debris too. The TMC had spent almost Rs 56 lakh so far for all the work.The latest report on May 3, after a visit by the court receiver, Dhananjay Gosavi, executive engineer, TMC, the assistant conservator of forest, advocate Naveen Chomal for two landowners who were granted permission by court earlier to cultivate rice on part of the land, and others including petitioner Baliram Pandit, said the TMC would complete planting two varieties of mangrove saplings within a week.Ruing the lack of an awareness drive by state or civic departments on the ""serious consequences"" of mangrove destruction, CJ Chellur and Justice Kulkarni said, ""On every occasion of such destruction of mangroves, there cannot be a marathon exercise of litigation...If no constant vigil is kept, possibility of recurrence cannot be ruled out.'' The HC has now directed the forest department and TMC to keep a ""vigil"" to see that mangroves are maintained and posted the matter after three months to monitor the status."

Collect two north facing branches of a Banyan tree (east facing will also suffice) that has grown in a stable, take precisely two grains of urad dal mustard seeds, grind all the ingredients with curd, and consume the mixture.This recipe is not some self-styled godman's prescription to fool gullible couples. It's part of the third-year Bachelor of Ayurveda , Medicine, and Surgery (BAMS) textbook that informs students on techniques to conceive a boy The text has been copied from Charaka Samhita, the pre-2nd Century CE compilation on Ayurveda, which is included in the current BAMS syllabus. According to the textbook, the process of creating a male foetus is called `pusanvan', and any woman who desires a boy should be ""blessed with the pusanvan ritual"" as soon as she gets pregnant.The textbook lists various techniques to ensure the birth of a boy. One such technique is rather expensive. It says: ""Create two miniature statues of a man out of gold, silver, or iron after throwing the statues in a furnace. Pour that molten element in milk, curd or water, and on an auspicious hour of Pushp Nakshatra, consume it.""The BAMS syllabus in the state is supervised by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) in Nashik, and Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, former dean of the Dr Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College in Nanded, is the vice-chancellor.Objection to the textbook's contents were recently raised by Ganesh Borhade, a member of the district supervisory board of the PreConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, who is also associated with the Lek Ladki Abhiyan supervised by advocate Varsha Deshpande.""Doctors with BAMS degrees have a thriving practice not just in rural areas, but also in cities such as Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik. Many people shun allopathy in favour of Ayurveda, and if this is what medical students are being taught, God help this society,"" Borhade said.He brought the textbook content to the notice of the PCPNDT Act authorities in the state, but it is unlikely that such content will be removed from the textbooks in the coming academic year.Dr Asaram Khade, the Maharashtra PCPNDT Act consultant, told Mumbai Mirror that a letter has already been issued to the joint secretary, public health, Government of India regarding the syllabus in violation of the PCPNDT Act, even as Borhade warned that the Centre had less than a month to act. ""The academic year starts in July, and such content supports,"" he said.Borhade pointed out a part of the content in the textbook, which he said had no scientific backing whatsoever. The portion of the content said, ""Cook rice flour with water, and while cooking, the woman should inhale the steam. Then add water to the cooked flour, and soak a ball of cotton in it. The woman should lie on the threshold so that her head touches the ground. Then, with that cotton ball, the liquid should be poured in her nostrils. It should not be spit out, instead it should be swallowed.""MUHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Mhaisekar said the BAMS curriculum was decided by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), and that he had written to the ministry regarding the objectionable content.""We are awaiting a reply from the ministry,"" Mhaisekar told Mumbai Mirror yesterday. ""The MUHS doesn't have the right to add or delete from the syllabus. There are seven members from Maharashtra in the Central Council of Ayurveda and all of them are aware of this content,"" he said."
