Wheat edged lower, awaiting estimates of damage caused by snow storms over the weekend in key U.S. growing areas. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active corn contract was flat at $3.74-3/4 a bushel by 0226 GMT, having gained 0.7 percent on Wednesday. Soybeans were also unchanged at $9.75-1/4, having firmed 0.7 percent in the past session. Wheat dipped 0.1 percent to $4.53-3/4 a bushel, after closing little changed on Wednesday. ""Concern about flooding and planting delays in the Midwest will continue to dominate the news flow for at least the next couple of weeks,"" said Madeleine Donlan, an analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""U.S. croppers had made good planting progress but there is now a big question mark over how much has been washed away by weekend storms and how quickly farmers can get back in their fields."" Corn is being underpinned by concerns heavy rains in the Midwest and southern growing areas may have washed away recently sown crops. Wheat is supported by concerns about damage caused by recent cold weather across key U.S. states for the crop. Still, Informa Economics, a private analytics firm, projected 2017 U.S. winter wheat production at 1.326 billion bushels, up 41 million bushels from their forecast in April for 1.285 billion bushels, three trade sources said on Wednesday. Yield prospects for hard red winter wheat in western Kansas were uncertain after a major weekend storm buried some fields under heavy snow, scouts on an annual crop tour said. The European Commission trimmed its forecast for usable production of common wheat in the EU in the upcoming 2017/18 season to 141.9 million tonnes from 142.2 million a month ago. The reduced forecast was still well above last year's estimated output of 134.4 million tonnes. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, wheat and soybeans on Wednesday, traders said. They were also net buyers of soymeal and soyoil.

Srinivas joining the TRS in the presence of IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao in Hyderabad on Tuesday.By Arrangementspecial arrangementThe Telangana Rashtra Samiti has rebutted the charges of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) over its failure to keep the promises made in the election manifesto and said the party had ushered in a welfare State in Telangana since its formation.Information Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao criticised the Marxist party leaders for their charges against the Government and asserted that the schemes launched, by the TRS Government headed by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, were reflective of its commitment to the poor. Our Government is implementing the Communist agenda and working towards the welfare of the poor and marginal sections, he said describing KCR as a true communist leader.Mr. Rama Rao was speaking at a meeting organised at the Telangana Bhavan, the partys headquarters, in connection with joining of CPI (M) leaders along with hundreds of cadre in the TRS.Communist Party State committee member M. Srinivas led the party activists from Warangal district in joining the TRS and Mr. Rama Rao welcomed them for taking the correct decision to join the party of the poor.The IT Minister launched a scathing attack on the CPI (M) State leaders for their tirade against the Government which had taken up a spree of development and welfare programmes.Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was highly appreciative of the schemes launched by the TRS Government during his meeting with Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao on Sunday. We are unable to understand why CPI (M) State secretary T. Veerabhadram is opposing these programmes? he wondered.He recalled how the Government had enhanced the welfare pensions which were Rs. 70 a month during the TDP regime and Rs. 200 during the subsequent Congress Government to Rs. 1,000 a month. In addition, steps had been taken to supply fine rice to people below poverty line and ration card holders while the Government was providing cash of Rs. 75,000 as incentive to poor under Kalyana Lakshmi/Shadi Mubarak schemes.He said that the CPI (M) had vehemently opposed separate Telangana at a time when the movement was at its peak.The party had even created obstacles in Parliament before the passage of the Reorganisation Bill. The manner in which the CPI (M) is criticising the Government is reflective of how the party is opposed to the development of the new State, he said."

The villagers claimed they have become refugees in their own country yet again. This is not the first time that these people, mostly bidi workers and daily wage earners, have been displaced by the mighty river. It has been going on for the last three decades. The 120-km stretch of the right bank of the Ganges -- from Farakka to Jalangi in the district -- is especially prone to erosion.The displacement due to river bank erosion took place mainly in the districts Suti, Raninagar II, Bhagobangola II and Lalgola blocks. Speaking to The Hindu, the locals said that that if river embankments were set up in between the dry season, from March to July, the displacement could have been minimised. But West Bengal irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the protection of river banks was the Centres responsibility.Now we are just refugees in our own country. I had to spend the winter living in a temporary shelter with my family of seven. Even the lives of stray dogs are more valued than us, said Golam Hussain, a labourer and a resident of the Char Krishnapur Bhagobangola II block, who has lost his house for the third time since 1989.Habibur Rehman, a resident of the same village was seething in anger when narrating his ordeal. He said that if the Ganges swallowed his land again, he will have no choice but to squat on others land.About 120 km away, in the Kamalpur area of the districts Samsherganj block, Akhtar Hossain (56), a bidi binder by profession, tried to swat away the flies hovering over a plate of stale rice as one of his neighbours told him about the river bank erosion in other parts of district. The Ganges is yet to strike Kamalpur after the last monsoon. But the river is just within a few hundred metres away from our makeshift huts, he said. His family got displaced seven times in last four decades as the Ganges swallowed their house and land.Speaking to The Hindu , irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that the state government was yet to asses the damage due to the latest river bank erosion. Currently we do not have the figures relating to the number of people who got displaced after the river bank erosion. We are in the process of assessing the damage, he said. Pointing out that the prevention of river bank of erosion came under the Centres jurisdiction, he said the state had written to the Centre several times about the issue, but they are aloof."

The company said this investment was done through internal accruals and has vested over the last seven years.Using this technology, the process-solutions company said, refineries and its clients can produce energy from waste.""The second generation demo plant (near Pune) can produce one million litre of ethanol per year by processing a variety of agri-residue like rice and wheat straw, cotton, bagasse, corn cobs & stover, etc,"" the company said in a statement.One of the primary reasons why ethanol blending has been stuck below 4% is the unavailability of suitable raw materials, as the first generation plants were over-reliant on sugarcane residue.Using a variety of agri-residue, the ethanol blending programme can get more predictability.Praj Industries has signed MoUs with Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd to be their technology partners for certain projects.In the first phase, 10-12 second generation ethanol projects are being planned across the country, each at a capital expenditure of Rs 600 crore and average capacity to 100,000 litre of ethanol per day.The company hopes to get about 40% of the project cost as revenue to provide technology know-how and other services.Pramod Chaudhari, executive chairman, Praj Industries said this technology has great potential to boost to rural economy and create employment.""The menace caused by burning of farm residue can be addressed effectively by converting biomass into ethanol to be used as a transportation fuel,"" said Chaudhari."

Kishan Reddy in the Legislative Assembly here on Monday.The BJP MLA, during Question Hour, said that instances were brought to his notice that if a ration card holder built a house in 60 sq.yards site or paid property tax or electricity bill up to Rs. 1,000 or owned a vehicle, then the ration cards were being withdrawn by the Civil Supplies Department.About 1.22 lakh ration cards were removed in the State and 19,640 were restored when MLAs took up the issue, he said.BJP member K. Laxman said the Central and State governments were contributing Rs. 3,715 crore and Rs. 2,665 crore respectively for the subsidy rice scheme. In fact, the Centre doubled the quantity of subsidy rice under the scheme to 6,335 tonnes.However, the State government was pruning the number of beneficiaries though it started supply of fine rice to them. There were also reports of irregularities and diversion of fine rice into the open market.Another BJP member Ch. Ramachandra Reddy said only a few hundred ration cards were given in the State though there were many poor and the elderly who were not getting social security pensions.Civil Supplies Minister Eatala Rajender refuted the allegations and said that on the contrary, Telangana government increased the quantity of rice from 5 to 6 kg per person and increased the income limit for the beneficiaries in rural and urban areas to bring 82 lakh families additionally under the subsidy rice scheme.The government had no intention of removing ration cards and 2.7 crore people were given subsidy rice in the State. The printing of ration cards was delayed due to reorganisation of districts and the names of districts had to be changed on the cards, he explained. The scheme would be further streamlined, he added.Strengthening PHCsHealth Minister Laxma Reddy, replying to TRS MLA V. Srinivas Goud, said that the government was taking several steps to strengthen primary health centres by recruiting staff, providing infrastructure and medical equipment. Each PHC should have minimum of nine staff including a doctor.The redundant posts in the health department would be identified and shifted to the PHCs. Mr. Goud suggested that multi-purpose health workers should also be included among the PHC staff.Central and State governments are contributing Rs. 3,715 crore and Rs. 2,665 crore respectively as their share for the implementation of the subsidy rice scheme.K.

The leaders chose Tumakuru to join hands to create an impression that all is well within the party.BJP state president B S Yeddyurappa, his detractor K S Eshwarappa, Union Ministers Ananth Kumar and D V Sadananda Gowda, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Jagadish Shettar and BJP general secretary in-charge of Karnataka P Muralidhar Rao, assembled at the Siddaganga Mutt on Thursday morning and took the blessings of Shivakumar Swami. Later, they began their drought study tour under the banner Jansamparka Abhiyana.The BJP leaders visited a Dalit colony in Tumakuru. They had thatte idli for breakfast at the residence of party worker Hanumanthappa, at the Dalit colony. While addressing the party workers, the leaders criticised the Siddaramaiah government with the choicest words.Yeddyurappa said, The Siddaramaiah government is the Number One corrupt government in the country. Law and order situation has deteriorated in the state. As many as 6,524 murders have taken place in the state in the last four years and nearly 4,000 farmers have committed suicide. The chief minister is unaware of the prevailing drought situation.He said the Centre has released funds for taking up drought relief work in Karnataka. But the same has not reached the beneficiaries. The state is not distributing even rice and wheat supplied by the Centre under the public distribution system, he added.Eshwarappa said There are some minor differences among us. We will set them right. The party would face the next Assembly elections under the leadership of Yeddyurappa and he would be the next chief minister.Siddaramaiah became chief minister accidentally, because the BJP had split.Ananth Kumar claimed that there is crisis in the Congress and the JD(S) but unity in the BJP. The BJP is in power in 15 states. Karnataka too would become free of the Congress in 2018. The Narendra Modi government has released sufficient funds to handle drought in Karnataka. Siddaramaiah should come out with the facts, he said.Shettar said the Siddaramaiah government, which has completed four years, has just secured pass marks. Later, the BJP team moved to Gubbi where a public rally was organised. As in Tumakuru, here too the BJP leaders continued their attack on Siddaramaiah. Eshwarappa said, The Congress cant tolerate me and Yeddyurappa working together.In the evening, the leaders again addressed the party workers in Tumakuru city. Yeddyurappa said the BJP president Amit Shah is conducting a secret survey in Karnataka to find winnable candidates for the next Assembly elections. The team would move to Chitradurga on Friday to hold public meetings."

The Sangh would also suggest naming the scheme after its ideologue Nanaji Deshmukh.The RSS wants the government to recognise Nanajis contribution to society. And this it wants to achieve by persuading the government to pair the ideologues name with the concept of thali, just as the Central government and the BJP adopted Sangh Parivar philosopher Deendayal Upadhyayas construct on integral humanism to empower the most deprived sections of society.Some of the central schemes and programmes named after him are  Deen Dayal Upadhyaya GrameenKaushalya Yojana, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana and Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana. An RSS think tank has held three workshops to draft a concept note on offering food, which are staple diets of different regions so that the food items could be integrated, for instance, in the midday meal menu.RSSs Deendayal Research Institute (DRI) secretary general Atul Jain said his think tank will prepare a proposal and submit it to the Centre after their two-day workshop starting on June 23 in Shillong. It is for the government to decide how to utilise our suggestion which is backed by agricultural scientists and experts from the field. We will also request the government to name the nutrition thali after Nanaji, Jain said.He said the idea came from Nanaji's original work on 1.5-acre model and 2.5-acre model for rural self-reliance. It was meant to encourage villagers to grow different grains on small patches of fields, he explained. Citing an example of flawed interpretation, he said an international agency, in its survey, had declared people of Satna district of Madhya Pradesh malnourished.But the ground report gave a contrary result. The international agency had measured consumption pattern of wheat and rice while the local populations staple diet was coarse grain and millet, he noted."

Wheat and soybean edged higher on bargain buying. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active corn contract rose 0.2 percent to $3.67-1/2 a bushel by 0257 GMT, having closed down 1.3 percent in the previous session. Soybeans climbed 0.2 percent to $9.58-3/4 a bushel, having closed down 0.9 percent on Wednesday, and wheat gained 0.2 percent to $4.27-1/2 a bushel, having closed down 0.1 percent in the previous session. The corn market is likely to struggle to rally as U.S. weather improves for planting the crop. ""Meteorologists removed some of the rain in their extended forecasts for the U.S. Midwest, which prompted traders to also remove some of their weather premium,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""We suspect a media blitz yesterday regarding U.S. trade policy was probably also a contributor to the day's falls."" Corn was pressured on Wednesday by jitters about U.S. exports to Mexico after a senior Trump administration official said a draft executive order to withdraw the United States from NAFTA, a U.S., Mexico and Canada trade pact, is under consideration. Soybeans faced additional pressure from weakness in Brazil's currency, the real, which could prompt Brazilian farmers to sell more of their record-large soybean harvest. Wheat drew some support from concerns about unfavourable weather expected in the southern Plains this weekend that could damage developing winter wheat.

He also busted a cheap cigarette manufacturing unit in Auto Nagar, earning the appreciation of senior officials.The QRT has our whole hearted support and has ended many illegal activities in the town. We urge people to bring to our notice any unlawful activity in their neighbourhood, Mr. Tripathi told The Hindu on Thursday.Recently, Mr. Srihari got a message from a senior officer about the smuggling of rice meant for Public Distribution System from a rice mill on Palakaluru Road. Clad in a lungi and a shirt, he gained entry into the mill as a daily labourer. He noticed that the bags of rice were being brought to the mill from fair price shops and later recycled to be sold at higher prices.I was asked to carry the rice bags and load them into the lorry. About 470 bags were loaded into a 10-wheel truck and just when it was leaving the mill, our team intercepted the vehicle and seized the stocks, Mr. Srihari said.In the past, the QRT cracked the ganja smuggling racket and Mr. Srihari, that time, masqueraded himself as an auto driver.I hired an autorickshaw and waited for days to track down the culprits. The smugglers are also clever as they chose the most innocuous looking people, like minors and beggars. I caught two offenders on the Inner Ring Road while they were receiving the stocks from the smugglers, said Mr. Srihari.When asked if he fears for his safety, Mr. Srihari said he takes precautions and always informs senior officers of his plan and movements.People ask me why I am so intent on curbing these activities. I can say that only the policeman can do these things and I feel I am doing my job, he rounds off."

(Right) The logo of the canteen.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday finalised modalities to launch the ambitious Indira Canteen project offering subsidised breakfast and meals to the urban poor in Bengaluru.At a meeting at his official residence, Siddaramaiah directed starting the project from August 15.The state government is pumping in Rs 100 crore for the project while the BBMP will be the nodal agency for its implementation.Mayor G Padmavathi told reporters after the meeting that canteens will be made up of pre-cast structures manufactured by KEF Infra at their Tamil Nadu facility.The firm has quoted Rs 32 lakh for constructing each canteen with a carpet area of 860 sq ft. She said Siddaramaiah has directed officials to negotiate with KEF Infra to reduce the construction cost.Padmavathi said, There will be 199 canteens including the one at the BBMP head office and 28 kitchens, one each in every Assembly constituency in the city. These canteens can accommodate 70 to 80 people at a time. There will be a coupon system offering meals and tiffin to a maximum of 250 people in one slot.The Mayor said each canteen will have two toilets, a CCTV camera and food a distribution court. The utensils will belong to the state government so that services are not hampered in case food supply contract is terminated and transferred to another agency.The contracts will be finalised by May 30 and work would commence from June 1. By August 1, these canteens will be completely ready to start the programme from August 15, said Padmavathi.Regarding the menu, she said beaten rice bath, uppittu (upma) and idli will be offered for breakfast while the meal will consist of sambar, rasam, rice and pickle.On Sundays, there will be one special item like tomato rice, jeera rice, puliyogare and lemon rice. BBMP commissioner N Manjunatha Prasad said locations for setting up the canteens have been identified. He said the canteens have been designed by different architects.Stree Shakti Sanghas to cook mealsThe government will rope in Stree Shakti Sanghas (SSS) for preparing meals, said Mayor Padmavathi. At least 33% of these canteens and their kitchens will be managed by the SSS, said the Mayor adding that the idea is to empower these SSS."

Photo credit: AP.Some areas of this South Kashmir district have been virtually turned out of bounds for the security forces by the terrorists who are bolstered by a strong network of supporters, absence of mainstream political activity and the low morale of the police force there.Pulwama sits strategically along the national highway that connects the Kashmir Valley with the rest of country.The heightened militancy this year here is receiving ground support with the local people posing maximum resistance to the forces, especially during counter-insurgency operations.Often referred to as the rice bowl of the Valley, Pulwama, with eight tehsils of Pulwama, Pampore, Rajpora, Kakapora, Tral, Shahoora, Awantipora, Aripal, has earned the notorious distinction of becoming a hub of militant activities and some major security operations have been carried out here.Some of the deadly encounters, including the gunning down of Lashker-e-Taiba chief for Kashmir Abu Qassim, who was a Pakistani national, have taken place here triggering immediate reaction from thousands of people who took to the streets and pelted stones on security forces.""This symbolises the amount of support that the militants are getting from the local populace. Be it fear or lack of political activity, the fact is that militancy has been ruling the roost in this region and I fear it is unchecked so far,"" says a senior politician from the area, who preferred to remain anonymous due to threats from various terror groups.Divided into two police districts - Pulwama and Awantipora, the area has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Pulwama has been hitting the headlines due to a range of terror attacks including bank robberies, snatching of weapons, ransacking of an army camp or targeted killing of security forces especially CRPF.According to a senior security official, places like Kamrai Pora, Karimabad, Sambura, Lelhar, Tahab, Aglar, Litter, Bamnu and Koil have virtually become 'no-go' areas for law enforcement agencies and the security forces because of the hostility from the locals.""I won't say any parallel government is running at these places but they are not been frequented (by security forces) often. If need be, security forces move in only after carrying out area-domination at these places,"" the official said.After the killing of Burhan Wani, the poster boy of Hizbul Mujahideen militant outfit, on July 8 last year, the district has accounted for the disappearance of over 90 youths who are believed to have joined various militant outfits.The public support to militant groups can be gauged from the fact that police had advance information about the bank robbery committed in the area, the politician averred. Despite laying a trap, the police could not avert it as the militants managed to decamp with the cash, he claimed.The district has also emerged as a 'reception area' for foreign militants who sneak into South Kashmir via Pakharpora of Budgam district only to disperse. The dense forests of Yarwan in the region provides natural cover to the militants and several efforts of the army and other security forces were thwarted on a number of occasions by the locals, the police official conceded.He said that overground workers of terror groups forewarn the militants about troop movements, helping them to easily slip into adjoining regions like Shopian, Budgam or Anantnag.There is a strong presence of militants in Pulwama town as well but post-March this year, all anti-terror operations were halted due to the announcement of the Lok Sabha bypoll here as the district falls under the Anantnag parliamentary seat which felt vacant after Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti resigned last July."

The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"

To get Kohima, the male Himalayan bear at the city zoo, acclimatised to his enclosure, he was released out into the open for a couple of hours every day, to be brought back inside after lunch.But like any other young one, Kohima too has a petulant side to him. Since Monday, when he was released in the morning, he has been hugging the treetops, refusing to come down and even forgoing food and water.Monday morning was when Kohima had some watermelon and went up the trees. He did not come down for lunch, nor drink any water. All attempts to tempt him with fruits and honey failed. He had been climbing higher and higher over the past few days, but on Monday, he refused to come down, says zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander.It was no different on Tuesday, leaving the zoo authorities on tenterhooks.Watermelon treatAfter the comforts of the animal house, without food and water, by Wednesday afternoon, he was panting. Taking a calculated risk, Dr. Alexander entered the enclosure with watermelon slathered with honey, and moved away after placing it. Soon, the bear was on terra firma, eating the fruit.But as it neared the animal house, Dr. Alexander was warned by the keepers against staying put in the enclosure, and he stepped out. Kohima went back up the tree.Triggering anguishHe is very young and it would have been fine if he drank some water, especially in this heat, Dr. Alexander said.On Thursday afternoon, two keepers  Sabeer and Sajan  entered the enclosure with rice, boiled eggs, and honey. Kohima was given pieces of watermelon, which he made a grab for.Once the keepers were reasonably sure that they would not be attacked, they put the rice and honey in a small basin and extended it to the bear, which he grabbed and licked clean. He drank some water too.We were wondering if the Fire and Rescue Services would have to be summoned. We could not dart Kohima as he was very dehydrated. And there was the danger of him nodding off after darting, and falling down from a height, he said. Of course, with Kohima back up the tree, the zoo authorities have their work cut out. The immediate issue was its life and health, but that problem has been solved. Next is gaining its trust, Dr. Alexander said.Entry of DimapurThe zoo authorities also plan to release the female bear, Dimapur, into the enclosure to see if it will bring Kohima down. They havent been put together in the same enclosure yet. But without Kohima around, she is also a bit agitated."

DH PHOTO/ KISHOR KUMAR BOLARIn the world of sports, there are a few who need no introduction. Stephanie Rice is one among them.It was at the 2008 Beijing Olympics the then 19-year-old swimmer set the pool ablaze by winning three gold medals in world record times. Its been nine years since that day at the Beijing National Aquatics Centre. But for Rice, its still as fresh as it can get.Looking back, it feels unreal, said Rice, who is in Bengaluru as the international event ambassador for the TCS World 10K.The first medal was the 400M individual medley. It was the first day of the Games and it was my first race at an Olympics. So to win that medal was a huge achievement. This was my dream since I was just a young girl. So I just achieved my biggest dream in my first race.Before the second race (200M individual medley) I caught a flu. I was potentially not going to race. Then I told myself Im here in China and just need to give it a try. If I come last it would have been an embarrassment or else you wouldnt have another chance. So when I won that race, it gave me more confidence. Third was the relay and it was really great to win as part of a team and do it with friends, she recalled.The Beijing success put Rice instantly under the limelight. She soon became the face of Australian swimming and as the next Olympics in London came along 2012, many thought Rice would at least repeat her show in Bejing, if not take it a notch higher.But things didnt unfold that way as the Australian finished fourth in the 200M individual medley and a joint sixth in the 400M individual medley  events she had dominated four year ago.I dont think it was a matter of focus or being passionate, she said. The big difference between my preparation for London and my preparation for Beijing was that, in London I was the reigning champion, whereas going into Beijing I was just another person in the team who would hopefully do well. Things were a lot more relaxed, less pressure.Leading into London, it was lot more expectations, having to balance the media commitments, the sponsorship commitments, it was pretty much a full-time business.There was a lot of distractions. But I wouldnt say that I lost focus, it was a balancing act that I had to pull off. Before London, I had my third shoulder surgery, and four months before the Games, I had a torn tendon in my shoulder, then food poisoning a few weeks before the Games. Everything just seemed to go wrong.Like many other sporting disciplines, swimming has had its fair share of doping cases. South Korean Park Tae-Hwan, Chinas Sun Yang and Jessica Hardy of the US have even made the headlines. Rice, who has maintained a clean profile throughout her career, admitted there were moments when she felt that the field was not clean.Yes. Somehow you can sense it. There are many ways people can cheat today. But having said this, you cant generalise and say a country is a drug-cheating nation.I think, thats just the nature of sport. I dont thing we can ever get rid of drug-cheating in sport.I think the cheats will always be a step ahead. Thats because they (the anti-doping agencies) test for something that they know about. And you always have something new coming up in the market that can help the athletes. There will always be something that will not be on the list."

The state government is, however, considering giving insurance cover to crops against fire under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY). The matter is expected to come up for discussion in the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday.According to the government's own data, wheat crop has been destroyed due to fire on around 2,800 acres across the state in this season. The PMFBY implemented in Haryana last year offers cover against natural calamities, including lightning.""Once the PMFBY has been implemented by the state, there is no question of compensation by the government to the farmers,"" said Haryana's food and civil supplies minister Karan Dev Kamboj Admitting that during his visit to grain markets in around 12 districts in the last four days, a number of farmers had raised the compensation issue with him, Kamboj said, ""On Tuesday we have a meeting of cabinet ministers and the issue of including the crop loss due to fire under the PMFBY shall also be taken up.""Asked as to what measures have been taken by the government to save the wheat crop from electric fire destruction, Kamboj replied, ""We are not providing agriculture power supply during day time, especially these days."" The minister said that sparks in overhead power lines passing over fields cannot be considered the only reason for crops catching fire, since many a times, farmers leave back lighted bidis or matchsticks near fields.To overcome the problem of produce often getting spoiled, Kamboj told that the state government was going to set up six modern grain storage silos of six lakh metric tonnes of capacity in public-private partnership (PPP) for which the tenders would be released in May. ""Such things are best maintained in PPP mode as various sugar mills and rice mills being run by the government had earlier suffered losses,"" the minister said.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) had given a green signal to the state for setting up of silos with a total capacity of 9.50 lakh tonnes capacity. Out of this, FCI would be constructing silos with capacity of 3.50 lakh tonnes. Silos with modern technology, including temperature control, moisture check and elevators to pick the stock, would be established railway lines in the areas where there is shortage of storage facility."

The iffy thing was, they said, they hadn't made any purchases or even visited their local ration shops for a long time.Kovilambakkam resident D Govardan said he received an SMS from the ration shop in the neighbourhood informing him that he'd purchased 2kg of sugar, 20kg of boiled rice and 1kg of tur dal.""I haven't been to the ration shop in months,"" he said. ""When I questioned the shopkeepers, they casually told me that it was routine practice for them to identify 'idle' PDS cards - whose holders have not used them for long periods of time - and make large purchases in the name of the card-holders.""""The staff sell the subsidised goods to retail outlets and make big profits,"" Govardan said, visibly vexed at the scam. ""Now I will not be able to make any purchases myself because they've used my PDS quota for everything from rice and dal to palm oil and kerosene shops."" He said it is blatant looting of people most of whom, because they are economically underprivileged, need subsidies on essential commodities.In Thiruvanmiyur, Rajesh Chandran received an SMS from his Besant Nagar PDS shop stating that he had purchased a packet of palm oil for `25 when he did not even go to the outlet.Chandran said he was very surprised when he first got these messages, but soon figured out that the shopkeepers were up to no good.An employee of a PDS shop in Kodambakkam, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted that he and his fellow-workers were also part of the racket and sold essential commodities from PDS shops to small restaurants and eateries for a good profit.Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation officials said they have received complaints about such cases and are making efforts to sort out the issue and put an end to the racket."

5922f9377be9e01fc0070a54,Food on its own terms,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/food-on-its-own-terms/article17390696.ece,2017-03-02,"A picture, they say, is worth a hundred words. Two pictures related to Kerala, though separated by decades and differing in content, speak to us strongly of how we may secure its future. Thus, a photo in a leading Malayalam newspaper shows the Chief Minister of the State meeting the Prime Minister of India. An amiable Pinarayi Vijayan is seen extending flowers to Narendra Modi, who accepts it betraying no emotion. The power equation is astutely conveyed by the caption Ariyetra meaning How much rice in Malayalam. The Chief Minister was in the national capital in January seeking a greater allocation of rice to the State. Then there is a painting by Anjolie Ela Menon. Titled Malabar, it is a canvas smeared with green paint bearing no detail. Presumably it was the artists impression of the paddy-filled landscape of Kerala when she first encountered it decades ago. How is it possible that a State once identified by the wealth of its agriculture has been brought to the sorry state whereby its Chief Minister must travel to Delhi to ensure that his people are properly fed? It can only reflect the failure of public policy.Changed agrarian scenarioIn the early seventies, following the boom in the Arabian Gulf region, the State saw a new form of emigration. While Kerala had long witnessed the migration of the educated for want of opportunities domestically, for the first time there was a significant outflow of manual labour, some of it from agriculture. While it was only the men who migrated, the higher incomes transformed the households socially, and the women too withdrew from the labour market. This hit paddy cultivation most as, in an age-old sexual division of labour, women were disproportionately represented in the planting and harvesting of paddy. The sector began to face severe labour shortage. Naturally, the wage rose and the cultivation of paddy was no longer viable as cheaper rice came in from the rest of India.The rise in the wage may not have had the impact it did if the ownership of land was vested with the tiller. The temptations of migration overseas may have been held at bay had the tiller also owned the land. But the latter was not the case despite the much-vaunted land reforms of the State. In abolishing tenancy the land reforms had extinguished the traditional landlords but did not inevitably transfer land to those who actually laboured on the field. This is reflected in the current agitation for land by the Adivasi community.Stunted land reformsKerala is rare among the worlds economies, barring Zimbabwe, where agricultural production actually declined after land reforms. Land reforms in China after Mao led to a surge in food production, which in turn led to its rise to global prominence. In theory, one form of reorganisation possible even at this stage in Kerala is for those in ownership of land but not wishing to cultivate to lease it out. But leasing was made unlawful by the land reform Act.At the time of its legislation, tenancy had been a symbol of the exploitation of the peasantry who were held down by the possibility of eviction at will. But now, close to half a century later, when the economic position of owners of small parcels of land pales beside the owners of urban property in the State, to hold on to an archaic law for its symbolic value is mere sentimentality. It is unimaginative of a public policy to not remove all barriers to the leasing of land so that smaller portions can be pooled to form larger operational holdings and paddy production becomes viable again. It is interesting that the law discourages tenancy as unlawful but is sanguine about the alienation of agricultural land to other purposes. Actually, there is legislation meant to address this but its implementation is hostage to party politics at the village level, and the alienation of Keralas precious agricultural land continues.It is quite extraordinary that public policy in Kerala has not addressed the problem of a declining production of its staple food, a trend in evidence for nearly half a century by now. At the time of Mr. Vijayans trip to Delhi, an editorial in another leading Malayalam daily reported that the State produced only one-eighth of its consumption requirement. This figure needs to be vetted, but surely the situation may be judged to be critical if a region were unable to produce even half of it?A leaf out of Delhis bookAn obvious question emerging from the Chief Ministers much-publicised visit to Delhi is why Kerala cannot jettison its dependent status. At least here Keralas political leadership may take a leaf out of the record of the Central government. In the mid-sixties, smarting under Lyndon Johnsons directive that food be sent to India by the shipload so that she may be kept on a short leash, Indira Gandhi moved frenetically to increase food production in India. The Green Revolution followed and, despite its negative ecological fallout, India has never looked back. Earlier Nehru had cautioned his fellow citizens how India could not live permanently on handouts from the rich countries and needed to grow her own food. There is a lesson in this for those in charge of public policy in Kerala.If the State is to remain an autonomous entity, it must reduce all forms of one-way dependence, even vis--vis the Indian Union. A far firmer base of food production would be one aspect of this. In a world of creeping climate change, the global supply of food is set to shrink.There is a factor other than the legal architecture discouraging the leasing of land that works against agricultural prosperity. This is the natural environment, which in Kerala today is less hospitable to agriculture of any kind, let alone paddy cultivation. This has come about due to the depletion of groundwater and sand mining of the riverbeds to provide material for luxury house construction. There has also been the alienation of agricultural land already referred to. Land need not be turned into real estate to lose its fertility. Using fallow paddy fields as exhibition grounds or for shopping festivals, even when the structures made are temporary, could degrade the land permanently. Kerala needs a land use policy that conserves every bit of its natural capital. As part of this, the State could consider acquiring all unused paddy land and making it available to the Adivasis on long-term lease. This would ensure its preservation, saving Kerala from the hardship that is assured if the present situation of more plastic than grain clogging the rice paddies continues.Kerala needs a new politics if its economy is to adjust to the emerging scenario of rising food prices and a shrinking Gulf economy which is sure to impact livelihoods. Public policy is likely to adapt only if political parties are pressurised by a citizenry alerted to the limits to distributivism. An instance of how this can work is the return of paddy cultivation to vast tracts of the Aranmula Puncha, an iconic agricultural landscape in central Kerala, after citizen action prevented its diversion to build an airport. The regeneration has been made possible by active support from the government machinery. When such synergy is replicated across the State, its future Chief Ministers need not travel to Delhi seeking food.Pulapre Balakrishnan is Professor of Economics, Ashoka University, Sonipat and Senior Fellow, Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode"

Indiscriminate use of fertilizer materials can only aggravate the problems, they said.According to M C Narayanan Kutty, associate director at the Regional Agriculture Research Station (RARS), Pattambi, the nutrient formulations were able to jack up the productivity of rice by 30%, and that of banana by 15%. In the case of vegetables, the productivity shot up by 20 to 25%.Multi nutrient mixtures which can provide essential nutrients in required proportions are the first batch of innovative products. While the RARS, Pattambi, has formulated a nutrient mixture with soluble materials suitable for foliage spray, the research station at Pilicode has come up with nutrient sticks and micro nutrient liquid mixtures for plantains and vegetables.According to KAU vice-chancellor P Rajendran, administering nutrients applied through foliage give immediate and better results than other modes of application. Farmers need not go for large quantities beyond their requirement.

Better price for the produce and marketing opportunities are equally important,"" he told .Stating that one should not think monsoon in isolation, he said: ""You have to think monsoon with market together. Farmers try to manage even during bad monsoon if they get good price for their produce.""Swaminathan, regarded as father of India's Green Revolution, said more efforts need to be put to ensure farmers get good price during a normal monsoon.He said that farmers have reduced basmati rice acreage this year due to falling prices. ""So, farmers' faith is determined by both monsoon and marketing.""Stating that normal monsoon forecast bodes well for the country, Agriculture Secretary Shobhana Pattanayak said that the government hopes for ""a successive good foodgrain production"" in 2017-18.A lot of efforts are being put into implementing certain agri-schemes like crop insurance and e-marketing, among others.""The schemes will show better results with good monsoon forecast,"" he said.The government is hoping a record foodgrain output of over 272 million tonnes this year.

Hope the prices will not collapse the way they have this year.""ICRA Ltd Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the volume, timing and dispersion of monsoon rainfall in 2017 would be quite crucial.Higher rainfall in the early part of the monsoon may support sowing. However, adequate rainfall in the second half would be important for yields.""Although reservoir storage exceeds the level in 2016, it may not prove to be adequate to shield the crop sector, if monsoon rainfall turns out to be appreciably weaker than the IMD's initial forecast,"" he said.Reservoir storage is currently at around 31 per cent of full capacity, in line with the level in 2015.""Notwithstanding the modest contribution of agriculture to the overall GDP, the monsoon outlook would have some impact on consumption sentiment.""The impact of monsoon dynamics, as well as other inflation risks such as goods and services tax won't be clear for at least a few more months, which suggests a high likelihood of a prolonged pause for the policy rate. The RBI is likely to focus on liquidity management measures in the next few policies,"" he said in a statement.Industry body Assocham said that the IMD forecast of monsoon this year is a relief as doubts were cast on whether the country would get normal rains for the second year in succession or not.""In case the IMD forecast turns out to be correct, which it should, India would witness a robust agriculture growth continuously for two years, reaping a record 272 million tonnes of foodgrains (second advance estimates) during 2016-17.

The State of Global Air 2017 study, conducted jointly by the Health Effects Institute and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, quantifies further what has been reported for some time now: that the concentration of the most significant inhalable pollutant, fine particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less (PM2.5), has been growing in India. The rise in average annual population-weighted PM2.5 levels indicates that the Centres initiatives to help States reduce the burning of agricultural biomass and coal in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi have failed. The directions of the National Green Tribunal to Delhi, which were reviewed last year, could not end open burning of garbage and straw, or curb the urban use of diesel-powered vehicles. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the weighted national PM2.5 level estimated in the international report rose from 60 micrograms per cubic metre in 1990 (the acceptable limit) to 74 in 2015, with a steady rise since 2011. Weak policy on pollution is leading to the premature death of an estimated 1.1 million Indians annually, and the number is growing, in contrast to Chinas record of reducing such mortality.Several studies show long-term evidence of a steady deterioration in air quality in many countries, and South Asia, dominated by India, is today among the worst places to live. Although the central role played by burning of crop residues in causing pollution is well-known, and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute proposed steps to convert the waste into useful products such as enriched fodder, biogas, biofuel, compost and so on, little progress has been made. Last year, helpless farmers in the northern States who wanted to quickly switch from rice to wheat burnt the waste in the fields, in some cases defying local prohibitory orders. The government has no one to blame but itself, since it has not been able to supply affordable seeder machinery in sufficient numbers to eliminate the need to remove the straw. In a country producing about 500 million tonnes of crop residues annually, the issue needs to be addressed in mission mode. Easy access to cheap solar cookers and biogas plants will also cut open burning, and help the rural economy. Yet, there is no reliable distribution mechanism for these. On the health front, it is a matter of concern that in the most polluted cities, even moderate physical activity could prove harmful, rather than be beneficial, as new research indicates. Indias clean-up priorities need to shift gear urgently, covering both farm and city."

Soybeans ticked higher, recouping the previous session's decline, although slowing demand for U.S. shipments kept a lid on the market while corn edged up after dropping more than 1 percent on Thursday. For the week, the July wheat contract has given up almost 5 percent, the biggest weekly decline in eight months. Corn has lost 3.7 percent after gaining almost 3 percent last week, and soybeans are down 0.7 percent, giving up some of last week's gains. The wheat market on Thursday suffered its biggest daily loss since late August. Large export surpluses in key global suppliers are shackling Chicago wheat futures. The market absorbed weather forecasts for the U.S. Plains and Midwest that were largely favourable for winter wheat crops as they near maturity. ""The U.S. winter wheat crop is looking really good. Weather concerns had been overplayed earlier,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. ""We are looking at another great year for wheat supplies even though U.S. acreage is down. Yields are looking really good."" The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday said weekly export sales of soybeans fell to 225,000 tonnes (old-crop and new-crop combined), below trade forecasts for 400,000 to 800,000 tonnes. Corn export sales came in at 848,200 tonnes, near the low end of expectations. Export sales of wheat were 551,100 tonnes. Brazilian farmers should produce a record 2016-17 corn crop of 93.2 million tonnes this year, a Reuters poll indicated on Thursday, topping the 89.6 million tonnes expected in a previous survey. Corn output will be boosted by a record second corn crop (winter crop), seen by market analysts surveyed by Reuters at 63 million tonnes.

The petitioners alleged that none of the officials visited their households or locality during the survey to assess whether they should be classified as priority households (PHH) or NPHH. They said that of the 300-odd households in the village, 200 had been classified as NPHH.The survey, intended to be an elaborate door-to-door verification exercise to identify PHH, was carried out across Tamil Nadu by Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection department as part of the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the State.State government had maintained that though the exercise was carried out as per the mandatory guidelines of the Act, there will be no reduction in supply of rice and other items being given. However, according to the villagers, the employees at the ration shops informed them that their rice and other supplies would be reduced henceforth. Some of us were given less amount of rice and sugar even this month, said V. Vetrivel, a resident of the village. S. Selvi, another resident, said that even some elderly people living alone or with their spouses without any source of income had been classified as NPHH. My husband works as a construction labourer. Apart from a small house, we do not have any property. Our family is also now an NPHH, she said. CSCP department had given elaborate guidelines for identifying a household as NPHH, which included households with annual family income of more than Rs. one lakh, at least one income tax payer in the family, owning an air-conditioner or four-wheeler and farmers with more than five acres of land.S. Mayandi, Madurai district executive member of Communist Party of India (Marxist), who accompanied the petitioners, said that none of the households would come under NPHH category if the survey criteria were properly followed. He said the officials had assured to carry out a review and correct the classification, if found wrong."

Clearly there is one outlier that needs to be addressed and that is China. As we move through all the other elements of the NSG membership, I think, we're on a good path forward,"" Biswal said.So what remains is to be able to have a very clear understanding on what is the basis of China's reservations and to try to work through those. So that will be something that would move on to the next administration to carry forward, she said in response to a question.""But this is something that the President himself has personally engaged on, the Secretary (of State), (National Security Advisor), Ambassador (Susan) Rice and down the line this has been an area of intense effort by this administration,"" Biswal said.While India not becoming a NSG member is disappointing, Biswal said the Obama Administration is ""very very gratified to see India's entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR)"".China is advocating a two-step ""non-discriminatory"" approach for admission of countries who have not signed nuclear-Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the NSG.As per the new stand announced by Beijing in November, it first wants to find a solution that is applicable to the admission of all non-NPT members followed by discussions to admit specific non-NPT member.China's stand for a non-discriminatory criteria is regarded significant as Pakistan, a close ally of Beijing too has applied for the NSG membership along with India."

Kuppe Gram Panchayat early in February to oppose the store.Subhadra, a protester, said disorderly drunken behaviour was common. Visitors from Kerala, often drink to their last rupee and lie inebriated in the area, embarrassing women, she said. The river from where we fetch water for our daily needs may become out of bounds for women as they fear drunken men, she said.The gram panchayat has withheld a formal permission to the store for the time being in view of the protests."

Pasta that is conventionally made with plain flour, will now be made available with millets as the main ingredient.At the four-day 13th Agricultural Congress, a good number of stalls selling varieties of millets and an array of millet-based products were set up.Pasta is among the other ready-to-cook millet products available. From ragi spaghetti to shell pasta made of foxtail millet, a variety of innovative products were made available.Among the other products made with millets were biscuits, a protein health mix, dosa and idli batter, puliyogare mix and vermicelli. Most of these products were only on display at the stalls and not for sale, leaving visitors disappointed.Satish Kumar, senior research fellow, University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, said the grain is gaining prominence as several families have begun replacing rice with it. From March, the university will also begin to train farmers on preparation of millet products. Dr Chandrakala, assistant professor, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Chamarajnagar said farmers across Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Kollegal, parts of north Karnataka and Ramanagaram district have shown interest in cultivating the crop.However, the need for a separate processing unit for millets is a deterrent for production. Millets, except ragi, have a hard husk. These need specially designed mills, she said.A team headed by Dayakara Rao from the Indian Institute of Millets Research also had a stall at the university.Lakshmi Balaganoormath, senior research fellow told DH that ready-to-eat and ready-to-cook foods are fast gaining popularity. We have tied up with a leading biscuit manufacturer and a retail chain now, she said.Balaganoormath said that with diabetes and obesity cases on the rise, many families are including millets in their diet in good proportion. However, the production has to be increased to meet the demand."

A security guard and another student from the Vidyavaridhi International School in Huliyar town are in a critical condition at the district hospital, police said.Of the 28 students present in the school hostel on Wednesday night, 24 who ate chapattis later that night were unaffected, police said. Huliyar police have registered a case of criminal negligence against the school and hostel management based on a complaint filed by the parent of an affected student.Police have identified the students who died as Y Shreyas (14), a class VIII student; L Akanksh Pallakki (16), a class X student; and, K Shantharaju (16), also a class X student. Shreyas and Pallakki were from Thimmanahalli village in Tumakuru while Shantharaju was a resident of Srirampur village in the neighbouring Chitradurga district. A fourth student, Sudarshan (14) of class VIII, and the hostel guard Ramesh (50) were fighting for their lives at the Tumakuru district hospital, police said.Police said the school was owned by K S Kiran Kumar, a former BJP MLA, and his wife Kavitha Kiran under the aegis of a family trust called the Shri Basappa and Marulappa Seva Trust.Tumakuru SP Isha Pant said the incident occurred around 9 pm on Wednesday at the hostel in Ballakatte village attached to Huliyar town. The four students and the guard, who had come to the dining room before the others, started vomiting soon after eating the rice and sambar, and fell unconscious, she said. They were taken to the private Siddashree hospital in Huliyar but did not respond to treatment and were shifted to the district hospital. Three students died on the way, said Pant. At the hostel, the students who came to eat later were advised by a teacher to eat chapattis instead, police said.Parents of the affected students were informed about the incident only on Thursday morning after the three children had died, said police. The management of the hostel did not provide proper treatment and this lead to the death of three students. The hostel authorities failed to assess the seriousness of the condition of the students. They shifted them to the Tumakuru district hospital only at 3 am after their condition had completely deteriorated. The children would have been alive if they had received proper treatment soon after they fell ill, alleged Pallakis uncle Ranga Swamy.Pallakki and Shreyas were relatives and their parents are agriculturists. There were around 28 students in the hostel on Wednesday and most of them are class X students. They were staying in the hostel to attend special classes to prepare for the public examinations, which will commence at the end of this month, said Swamy. Police said they would also be investigating a conspiracy angle to the poisoning incident as well since the previous principal had been sacked three months ago by Kumar following allegations of his involvement in a relationship with a female member of the school board.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Since then, we have handled thousands of events, mostly weddings. Our team goes to the wedding venue and cooks  we serve between 300 and 500 people at each of these events. Last December, we got an order to cater to thousand people at a Noida wedding. That was our biggest order.What is the most popular dish on your menu?We only serve vegetarian. Chaat is what everyone wants  golgappa, aloo tikki, bhelpuri, chana chaat. Besides, malai kofta and kulfi are very popular.Do you end up with a lot of extra food?Yes, a lot. Mostly, rice and daal makhni. People usually first head to the chaat stalls and then go for paneer and roti. After every event, I am left with food for at least 40 people.What do you do with all that extra food?We usually give it to our cooks and waiters and they take it back home. Sometimes the clients also ask us to pack the food for them. Sometimes though very rarely  we have had to throw away food.What do you think of the ministers suggestion?I hadnt heard about it until now. If the government thinks this (specifying food portions) is going to help, then everybody should comply. But I think we might end up with losses because we will not have food to feed our staff and theyll ask for a salary hike. Also, how can you control food portions? What if the guests go hungry? We cant let that happen. That will be embarrassing for us and for our clients.

59239c8f7be9e01fd59aebff,"In threat to food security, Bangladesh moves to burn grain for fuel",http://indianexpress.com/article/world/in-threat-to-food-security-bangladesh-moves-to-burn-grain-for-fuel-4635043/,2017-05-01,"Bangladesh plans to begin turning some of the grain it produces into ethanol to make its fuel greener  but economists and experts warn the move could hurt food security in a country that is already a grain importer. Energy ministry officials said in a gazette notification early this year that the country will begin using maize, broken rice grains and molasses to produce ethanol to mix with petrol fuel at a 5 percent ratio.But in a heavily populated country that produces relatively little in the way of climate-changing emissions and that already relies on imports of maize and other grains, the result could be rising food prices, especially for the poor, economists, business leaders and environmental experts warned.Moshiur Rahman, who convenes the Bangladesh Poultry Industries Coordination Committee, called the move to begin using grain for fuel suicidal. Much of Bangaldeshs maize is used to feed animals, including chickens. But the country grows only half of the maize it needs, importing the rest from the United States and Brazil, he said, which means rising demand could mean rising prices.Maize prices will go up if it is used for ethanol production. The price of eggs and chicken will go beyond the reach of common people, Rahman warned. He said growing concerns about food security have led other countries  including China  to stop giving permission for new biofuel projects.FOOD TO FUELAccording to a study by Bangladeshs energy ministry, the country could produce 18 million liters of ethanol a year, or about 75,000 liters each working day. That would require 60,000 tonnes of broken rice each year  about 3.5 percent of the countrys total production. Alternately the county could produce the ethanol with 62,000 tonnes of maize (2.8 percent of production) or 97,000 tonnes of molasses (nearly all of the countrys production).The study warned that if the government scales up ethanol production beyond those levels, it will raise demand for grain to the point that it could hurt food security. But junior energy minister Nasrul Hamid told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone that Bangladesh needs to go for greener and more varied fuels in the future, like other nations.So, we are exploring the possibility of using bio-ethanol with other fuels. You cant remain out from the global trend of energy use, he said. He confirmed the ministry plans to give permission for ethanol production, and then would judge from early experience whether to scale up the experiment.Yes, we are going to give permission for bio-fuel soon. Lets see what happens first. Its impact on food security will be considered than, Hamid said. But others warn that Bangladesh has decided to burn food grains to produce ethanol without taking into consideration the food security of its 160 million people.That is a particular worry in a low-lying country that faces severe climate change threats, including loss of crops and crop land to worsening salt-water intrusion, droughts, floods, storms, sea level rise and erosion. Already many people face daily hunger and can manage meals only once or twice a day, experts say. Last year, Bangladesh ranked in the top 25 percent of the worlds most hungry countries, according to the Global Hunger Index of the International Food Policy Research Institute.Bangladesh today produces about 1.8 million tonnes of broken rice, about 100,000 tonnes of molasses and less than half the 6 million tonnes of maize it needs each year, according to the countrys Energy Ministry. Besides being used as livestock food, maize is eaten by poorer people, mixed with flour as a cereal or made into biscuits. Lower-income people also eat broken rice for breakfast and make it into cakes.But prices for the grains are rising. A kilogram of coarse rice is now being sold at 42 taka (50 cents) in Dhaka, up 25 percent in price from a year ago, according to the government Trading Corporation of Bangladesh. Rising food prices are a major concern, with a growing portion of peoples earnings now being spent on food. The countrys food inflation rate in February was 6.8 percent, up from a record low of 3.8 percent a year ago.About 13 percent of Bangladeshs people fall below the national poverty line of $2 per day, according to World Bank data. The country produces about enough rice to meet demand but imported 4.5 million tonnes of wheat last year to meet demand for that grain, according to the countrys food ministry.WRONG-HEADED DECISION?Despite rising demand for food, Khan Md Aftabuddin, managing director of Sunipun Organics Ltd.  the company that first applied for government permission for ethanol production  said turning grain into fuel would not pose any threat to food security for Bangladesh. He said the byproducts of ethanol production could be used as poultry or fish food, and that more maize could be grown on delta islands if demand for it rises.If needed, we will produce maize in char lands of the country as raw material for our plant, Aftabuddin said. Bangladesh needs to turn to renewable energy to keep its environment clean, he said. But Mohammad Moinuddin Abdullah, secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, said creating fuel using maize  which is increasingly being imported to make up for rice and wheat shortfalls  doesnt seem to make sense. I do not see any valid reason for using maize and broken rice for ethanol production, he said.M. Asaduzzaman, a fellow of the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies and a member of the countrys climate change negotiations team, said he also disagreed with the move toward producing ethanol from grain. We have tremendous difficulties in livestock nutrition. If maize is now used to produce ethanol, the cost of livestock production will go further up causing further animal protein deficiency, said Asaduzzaman, also a former vice chairman of the International Commission on Sustainable Agriculture and Climate Change.This is a wrong-headed decision, he said. Bangladeshs per capita carbon emissions are tiny compared to those of more developed countries, and should not be as great a concern as protecting food security, he said. When we cant meet basic nutritional need, we dont need to go for clean energy, he said.Khondaker Golam Moazzem, a research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue, a Dhaka-based think tank, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he is concerned that ethanol production, once started, could be scaled up in the future, particularly if oil prices eventually rise. That could lead to more demand for maize and for land to grow it. Then, staple food production will be hampered since Bangladesh suffers from acute farmland scarcity, he warned.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Express Photo By Bhupendra Rana BR20-WTNS1: Vannama (left) Alakar (center) and Singkamuthhu (right) with other worker in a factory of Suputvar. Express Photo By Bhupendra RanaRamar Thangraj Thevar, 32, came to Naswadi in Gujarats Chhota Udepur district four months ago, carrying only a bag with a few clothes. On April 10 when he was killed, the man who travelled more than 1,900 km from home in Tamil Nadu to earn a living, had on him a paper chit with the landline number of his village house and Rs 10. For three days, his body lay in the bushes. Then, with not enough money to send his body home to his parents, wife and children, he was cremated by his co-workers and employer.Thevar was headed back to his village, Ramakrishnapuram in Theni district, that evening, his first visit since migrating to Naswadi. There were four of them, including Thevars co-workers Alakar (21), Vannama (25) and Singkamuthhu (20). They were hoping to hitch a ride on a truck till the closest town, and were trying to hail down one at the Kaladiya railway crossing on the Bodeli-Naswadi highway, when a car driver who was passing by suspected they were thieves and raised an alarm.Local villagers Ramdas Kalu Bhil and Kamlesh Katni Bhil, who live on a farm nearby, allegedly came rushing and attacked the four with stones and sticks. Thevar was hit on his head while the others managed to flee. At the factory where Thevar worked, there has been no work since his death. His co-workers, all from Tamil Nadu, are in a state of shock.The factory, where snacks are made from rice flour and cornflour, is run by Supu Thevar, who also belongs to Ramakrishnapuram in Tamil Nadu. The 58-year-old settled down in Naswadi 40 years ago with his family, and always gets workers from back home, most of whom are his distant relatives. Thevar was among Supus most recent hires and had joined a staff of seven.The workers live on the factory premises  the size of three halls  amidst a snacks mixer, a machine that does the packaging, and large stoves. Supu pays them around Rs 5,000 a month. Sometimes we directly pay the money to their families. My brother lives in the village, I tell him to send over the money.Supus son Dinakaran says there are very few job opportunities in Ramakrishna-puram, forcing most to either work as daily wagers or take up jobs such as in the snack factory. The 35-year-old is the only one at the factory who can speak Hindi, a language he picked up over the years selling snacks in nearby villages.Supu says they make around Rs 50,000- Rs 60,000 a month, with the sales rising during festivals and the wedding season. Dinakaran also helps translate when the workers want to talk to the locals. Except he wasnt around with Thevar on the evening of April 10.None of our workers know Gujarati or Hindi. If they were aware of the meaning of the word chor, they could have explained to the people who rushed to beat them, suspecting them to be thieves, that it was not the case, he says. There have been several thefts of water motors in the area, putting nearby villages on the edge, Dinakaran adds.Alakar, who speaks only Tamil, conveys with Dinakarans help, When the people rushed towards us, we ran away. Ramu (as Thevar was called) ran in the other direction. We came back to the factory and went to bed. We thought Ramu may have got on to a truck, and we didnt tell Supu about the incident because of fear that he might scold us.Police have failed to trace the car driver who raised the alarm calling Thevar and the others thieves. Ramdas and Kamlesh, who belong to Anandpuri village of Naswadi taluka, were arrested for beating up Thevar, but not taken on remand because they confessed to the crime, police said. They are now in Sankheda sub-jail.The two have reportedly admitted that they suspected that Thevar and his friends were trying to steal a water pump installed in Kamleshs farm. After Thevar sustained severe injuries and fainted, Ramdas and Kamlesh reportedly dragged him and threw him into bushes near the Bodeli highway.V S Gavit, the inspector in-charge at Naswadi police station, says that after they found Thevars body on April 13, and discovered the note with the phone number, We contacted other Tamil natives staying in Naswadi for help and were able to make the identification. His family was informed.Sub-Inspector A S Vadavi, who is investigating the case, says they have recovered the stones and sticks used in the crime. However, police are yet to record the statements of Vannama, Alakar, and Singkamuthhu, who were with Thevar when the incident happened.The killing has shaken Naswadi residents such as Raffiq Daniwala. Many workers from other states come here for seasonal summer business such as selling ice-cream and mango juice. Workers who come to Supus factory are very kind and never enter into any altercation with others. They spend most of their time on the premises, he says.Shailesh Tadvi, who owns a flour mill near Supus factory, adds, We dont have any interaction with the workers at the factory, but they are good people. Everyone knows Supu in Naswadi, we also invite him to our social functions. Supu says Thevars family wanted to come and claim his body. But we explained that his body was not in a good condition since police had found it three days after he was killed. They are my relatives and they trust me and understood the situation.Plus, there was no money to send the body home  it would have cost around Rs 12,000. The last rites were eventually performed by Supu and Thevars co-workers, in the presence of other members of the Tamil community.Supu adds that they have closed the factory for a while as we all are in pain. We will resume after offering prayers and cleaning the factory. Thevar was like a brother to me. He was very hardworking and wanted to earn money for his two children and wife. Says Dinakaran, All of us are like family. We cook together, eat together and enjoy together after work. Ramu liked cricket; in the evening, we would play cricket.Dinakaran says what he cant understand is why Thevar left like he did, without informing Supu. They did not wait to tell me either, otherwise we could have arranged a train ticket for them from Vadodara, which we generally do. The Vadodara Railway Station is around 103 km from Naswadi. The day after Thevar was found missing, the workers said he had gone to his village, says Supu. I thought he might call me after reaching there.

Express photo by Abhinav SahaMARCH 11, 2017, Bhejji. April 24, 2017, Burkapal. The two images could be superimposed. The roads are dust, yet to be laid. On them are reminders that this is work in progress  a diversion for a bridge and construction material piled up next to the security camps that line the dirt track. About 200 metres to the right of both roads are forests. Thirteen died in Bhejji, 25 in Burkapal. The governments response to these Naxal attacks on the CRPFs road opening parties  men who provide security cover to roads under construction  has been to point at the motive behind them. The attacks, they say, are an effort to stop Bastars infrastructure development, which has been put on priority. They also say that its these highways of development that are pushing Maoists into a corner. State data for this year shows that investment worth Rs 3,270 crore is being pumped in to construct roads and bridges in Bastar.And yet, there are constant dangers. With the focus now turning to roads that lead to Maoist-controlled areas, the administration and security forces have been met with a violent response, such as the attacks in Bhejji and Burkapal. Over the past three years, the 56-km Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch, on which Burkapal falls, has seen 12 encounters, that have killed 32 security personnel, and 18 improvised explosive device (IED) blasts. The Injeram-Bhejji stretch, targeted on March 11, has seen 10 exchanges of fire, 43 IEDs have been recovered and 13 jawans have been killed.In a video response after the Burkapal attack, Maoist spokesperson Vikalp, while terming the incident a response to Maoists being killed, said, Through the excuse of giving benefits (to citizens), to the purpose of exploitation and increase in militarisation, the construction of roads, bridges, mobile towers and rail lines is being done. From arterial roads such as the Sukma-Konta stretch of National Highway 30, to a bridge across the Shabri river at Dornapal, to roads that seek to cover the security vacuum in areas such as Jagargunda and Pamed, the government is attempting this infrastructure push. Sukma and Bijapur, worst affected by Naxal violence, are districts that rank high in government plans.Also in the pipeline, say officials, is a steel plant, and a superspeciality hospital in Jagdalpur. A bridge, much like the one at Dornapal, is proposed at Konta, connecting it to Motu in Odisha. Work has finally begun on National Highway 63, on a stretch between Tarlaguda and Bhopalapatnam in Bijapur. The Railways has also pulled in. Besides a new night train from Jagdalpur to Vishakhapatnam, the line from Jagdalpur to Kirandul is being doubled.Neeraj Bansod, Collector of Sukma district in Bastar, says development in the area, especially south Sukma, is the biggest challenge facing the government. There is no doubt that it is the worst-affected region, especially Konta block, which has both Bhejji and Burkapal. But our primary focus is on the construction of roads and on developing clusters around camps. It is these bridges and roads such as Dornapal-Jagarargunda, Injeram-Bhejji and the National Highway between Sukma and Konta that will bring further progress in the area, he says. The roads he speaks about are in various stages of construction. If you build a road, you can then build schools, hospitals, bring electricity, generate livelihood opportunities. Without the roads, which can only be built through security, there is nothing. And despite the attacks, we are pushing forward, he says.Ten days after the Bhejji attack, The Sunday Express returned to the 20-km road to find that work had begun after a hiatus of a week. A supervisor urged his workers, all from Andhra Pradesh, to churn the cement quickly. Night would fall in two hours. There is fear after the attack, but the road must be built. We returned in a week and our only focus now is to complete this 3-km stretch as quickly as possible, said a worker, refusing to be identified. With the Injeram CRPF camp 3 km away, the road itself has no personnel. Asked where their security was, the supervisor said, They are there. Sitting inside the forest, waiting for the Maoists. Fifty kilometres away, on National Highway 30, between Sukma and Konta, even the night is no restriction. Under bright lights, 30 workers continue working. We have been asked to push the work, said one.Ayyaz Tamboli, Collector of Bijapur, another sensitive district in south Bastar, says, Better roads means freedom of movement and better connectivity for traders. It brings down local market prices, gives people more amenities. It also ensures that we can convince doctors and teachers to come and do their jobs in interior areas where they would refuse to go otherwise. We are doing everything to fill up gaps that cut Bijapur off. For instance, every year for a week, the water from the Mriganchal river covers the road and cuts us off. But now, we are building it. Officials in Bastar point to how the roads bring people closer to development and thus wean them away from the Maoist narrative of a people left by the wayside.CRPF security during the construction of the Mingachal River bridge on the Mingachal chennor Jagdalpur highway On Sunday,April16, 2017. Express photo by Abhinav Saha CRPF security during the construction of the Mingachal River bridge on the Mingachal chennor Jagdalpur highway On Sunday,April16, 2017. Express photo by Abhinav SahaFour years ago, the road from Chinnakodepal to Avapalli in Bijapur district, to be built further to the sensitive Jagargunda, was a dirt track. With 46.5 of the 70 km road to Jagargunda now ready, Avapalli now has a metalled road that runs through the heart of the village. Residents say Avapalli has grown exponentially in the last two years, with people coming closer and closer to the road. The one unmistakable sign of change stands on the rooftop of nearly every home here: the satellite dish. Sitting under one such roof, in his small, one-room barber shop that is the extension of his home, a 30-year-old is busy attending to his client.The road has changed everything. The Maoists are still around. Go 4 km into the jungles and you will find them, but they dont come to Avapalli anymore. My relatives now want to visit me and I can go to them. When my wife falls ill, I can take her to Bijapur without worrying about the bumps on the road. And then, there is this, he says, pointing to a white electric massager in his hand with Made in China written on it. I went to Jagdalpur and bought this. Now people come for massages as well as haircuts, he laughs.On National Highway 30 is Bodli. At the Sunday haat here, mahua and other local forest produce is on display. Yet, one of the most popular stalls is the one selling slippers, brought by traders from Andhra Pradesh and Geedam in Dantewada. Madvi, a tribal, has travelled 10 km to Bodli barefoot as she always does. Haggling with the hawker, she says, Give me the slippers, brother. The rains are coming maybe the snakes wont bite if I have slippers on my feet.Officials in Bastar point to these changes to talk about a perception problem, of the impression that the entire area is violence-prone. D M Awasthi, Special DG, Anti Naxal Operations, says, If you zoom out and look at the entire picture, it is much better than before. People forget that once, all of Bastar, which has seven districts, was badly affected. But in the last decade, in places such as Kanker, Kondagaon, Dantewada and Jagdalpur, the Naxals have been pushed back massively. Of course, Sukma, Bijapur and Narayanpur are still vacuum areas, but things have to be looked at holistically.In Bastar district, for instance, collector Amit Kataria points to the doubling of tourists from 50,000 in 2015 to over a lakh in 2016, with sites such as the Chitrakote waterfalls and Kotumsar caves popular destinations. Bastar district is more or less free from violence An airport is now coming up  its a Rs 25-crore project  and things are moving at a pace which will ensure that it is ready by the end of May, Kataria says, going on to talk about the new night train from Jagdalpur to Vishakhapatnam and the new railway line being laid between Jagdalpur and Kirandul.The local tribal vendors at the weekly market of Bijapur, On Sunday, April 16, 2017. Express photo by Abhinav Saha The local tribal vendors at the weekly market of Bijapur, On Sunday, April 16, 2017. Express photo by Abhinav SahaThe other rail project, to be built in four years at an estimated cost of Rs 3,500 crore, aims to connect Jagdalpur to Raipur via Raoghat and Bhanupratapur in Kanker. This line, however, has come in for criticism, with activists alleging that its real purpose is to aid mining in the Raoghat hills. Yet, as the administration pushes the development narrative, there are many questions for a state that came into being 17 years ago and has been ruled by the same government for 14 of those. The stories of the most crucial roads are also those of inconceivable delays and other problems.District officials admit that on the Sukma-Konta National Highway, often called the artery for anti-Naxal operations, work has been slow  only 22 of 70 km has been made. The road was put on priority since 2009, but construction failed to take off, with contractors failing to turn up for security reasons. Till date, only Rs 80 crore of the Rs 255 crore allocated for the project has been spent.In the aftermath of the Burkapal attack, CRPF DIG, Operations, D P Upadhyaya, had expressed anguish, saying that at several meetings with the state government, he had asked for the roads to be built at a quicker pace, pointing out that even after three years, the presence of many camps and everyday patrolling by the CRPF, only 8 km of the 56-km Dornapal-Jagargunda road had been completed.Then, there are stories of corruption and inefficiency, recounted with ironic laughter by the security forces personnel The Sunday Express spoke to. Last year, during his Lok Suraj Abhiyan, the Chief Minister (Raman Singh) came to Bhejji A big deal was made of it. There was a security cordon and he travelled on a motorcycle to a patch he was told had been built in the most difficult of circumstances. But when he got there, it was found that the road had broken. A re-tender had to be ordered, says a senior CRPF officer.Subodh Singh, Secretary, Chief Ministers Secratariat, Mines and PWD, said these delays and other issues were due to security problems. Earlier, when we asked contractors to work, they would refuse because of the security problems. Only when the security camps increased did contractors begin to show an interest. In some places, there was financial trouble with the contractors like on the Sukma-Konta road. The coordination between different agencies is now working effectively, he said.These delays, however, have come at a cost, testified by the lives lost in Bhejji and Burkapal. Bijapur CRPF DIG Dhiraj Kumar speaks of the under-construction Avapalli road and the IEDs that emerge on almost a daily basis. Once in 2015, there was a web of IEDs in a 20-metre radius of the road. Somehow, we managed to defuse them all, he says, highlighting the constant risk the CRPFs road opening parties are exposed to.In an operation, there is flexibility to choose when the team leaves, what route will be taken, how many men will go. In a road opening party, where we are providing security to a road or a bridge, we are essentially sitting ducks. We can use one path one day and another one more day, but by and large, you will always have to be close to the road and the construction site. The element of surprise, crucial to jungle warfare, is completely taken away, explains a CRPF official.In both Sukma and Bijapur, officials hesitantly admit that there are vast swathes, even up to 30 per cent each in both districts, where the government has no reach at all, with Maoists the only form of government. In some other areas, they concede, the access is limited to anganwadi centres, some primary schools, and a few failing primary health centres.And yet, just across the southern border of the state, for instance, things are very different. A running joke in Konta is that travellers crossing into Andhra Pradesh need no board to announce the border. In a matter of metres, they say, everything changes: the roads widen, the surroundings change from fallow land to lush fields of rice and red chillies. Also, the military camps, which make an appearance every few kilometres on the Chhattisgarh side, disappear. In the 70 km distance from Konta on the Chhattisgarh border to Bhadrachalam in Andhra Pradesh, there is only one police camp.An Andhra Police official said all of this was possible because of a focus on people, on agriculture, and on intelligence. No development can happen when people arent with you, because in these environments, they are then with the Maoists. In our state, the people are with us, and the Maoists have informers. In Chhattisgarh, it is the other way round, he said.Activist and Bela Bhatia says the only solution possible is a political one and that the ever-increasing militarisation in the area was creating a sense of siege. All lives lost are condemnable, whether of jawans or Adivasis. Roads must be built for the people, to make their lives better in terms of basic needs such as schools and health. But we must also look at why they are being built, if they are being made for other purposes like mining. The Maoists must also look at what they are doing, for they are picking soft targets. Any solution to this can only be political, keeping in mind that laws such as UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) and CSPSA (Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act) cannot continue to exist, she says.On the banks of the Shabri river, to the west of Dornapal, a new bridge built at a cost of Rs 11 crore stands, the fresh white paint on its railing gleaming in the sun. The bridge connects Dornapal in Chhattisgarh to Podia in Odisha, bringing down the 110-km distance between Dornapal and Kalimela, the nearest Odisha town, to 28 km.Under the bridge, on the banks of the river, a boat has been pulled ashore. Before the bridge opened a month ago, it was this that was used to traverse the distance, a boatman earning Rs 10 for every man, woman or motorcycle that crossed over. And yet, obsolete as it is for now, it must remain. For, as one villager on the banks says, In Bastar, what remains today, may not exist tomorrow. And the people will suffer again.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
5923ba4c7be9e01fcef0572a,Focus on comparative edge,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/602839/focus-comparative-edge.html,2017-03-23,"Focus on comparative edgeRanajoy Sen, March 24, 2017 23:56 ISTINDIA-US BILATERAL TRADE: There is a need for both countries to identify areas where they enjoy or develop comparative advantage in international tradWhen two countries confabulate for greater inter-state trade, they continuously seek to improve upon the scale and quality of it, endeavour for avenues for increased cooperation and symbiotic arrangements, paper out solutions from potential logjams where disagreements and acquiescence are interspersed  the former usually lesser than the latter  and emphasise on its respective areas of expertise.The scale and extent of international trade between India and the USA is inching toward such state of things. Both countries seem to look forward to strengthen the area of bilateral trade. Bilateral trade between India and the US was about $4.8 billion in 1980. It increased to about $9 b in 2015. Thereafter, former American president Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target to increase volume of trade between the two countries to about $500 b.Despite hollering against reportedly unjustified acts against America, real and imaginary, that its President Donald Trump has made and is making intermittently, he has appropriately given no indication or insinuations that he wishes to revisit or decelerate progress towards that ambitiously valued Indo-American trade level.Flow of goods and services between two or more countries as also among certain regional economic blocs still adheres to, in notable ways, to the application from the insightful economic theory of Comparative Advantage propounded by the British economist David Ricardo during early 19th century. It has since then been a crucial constituent of the foundation of international trade theory and policies. To the extent that political and economic situations evolve and other concepts have been relegated or revisited, and new ones have emanated, comparative advantage continues to retain and reinforce its relevance.The central perspective of this advantage states how mutually beneficial trade can take place even if a country is in certain ways or wholly less efficient than or reflects an absolute disadvantage with respect to another country in the production of all commodities or services.In such a scenario, the potentially less efficient nation should specialise in and concentrate upon the production and export of that commodity or commodities in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller  those commodities of its comparative advantage  and should import those commodities in which it is disadvantageously positioned to produce and export.India, which was mired in controls and an inward looking economic approach even when it smacked of outright irrationality, has in the past 25 years or so, gradually, yet steadily, oriented itself for increased international trade with other countries. Today, it is in an enviable position to increase the level of mutually beneficial trade with other countries, notably with the US.Its internal economic reforms are currently proceeding apace. It would allow organised and vibrant bona fide trade; greater flexibility would be possible for Indians as regards the array of goods and services available while giving more scope to the country to utilise its areas of comparative advantage to export to other countries without the undesirable attributes of excessive high tariffs and avoidable import quotas for Indian goods and services.The annual trade report of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has appreciatively noted the ongoing economic reforms in India and the countrys resolve to create a common market within the country internally, thereby giving scope for the relative reduction of transaction costs.It would relatively ease the path for exports of American goods to India. What is inherent in such aspects is that India could also be significantly hopeful that the US would also be more receptive to Indian products without palpable bias and decide according to the merit of a particular situation.Highly noteworthy to the future of Indo-American trade is the aspersion-laced statement of the American trade representative-select, Robert Lighthizer, during his confirmation hearing procedure of the Senate finance committee. He told members that he is inclined to take a rather aggressive position with India regarding Intellectual Property protection in international trade, should the situation call for. He raised concerns regarding slow and inefficient patent protection, theft of intellectual property and insufficient property protection.If such issues are raised and solved fruitfully in Indo-American trade, then India would undoubtedly be at an advantage alongside potential American satisfaction. While India should look into earnestly at lapses in these areas, it could also pull up potential American unscrupulousness in these realms.The attempts at unfair patenting of the Indian Basmati rice in America in the 1990s was a major source of New Delhis displeasure, which got resolved satisfactorily after some avoidable donnybrooks.Trade deficitsIndian has a clear comparative advantage notably in the services and pharmaceutical sectors. America enjoys the same in various sectors across the board. Nevertheless, both countries are running trade deficits. While trade deficits are an outcome of factors other than trade and need not always cause apprehension, narrowing its extent is always desirable for a stronger national economic position.Exports from India to the global market have increased by 17.48% lately. But imports have also increased to 21%, thereby dampening the enthusiasm from high exports. The countrys trade deficit has spread to about $8.8 b. The principal reasons for it are an equal import of various services and a high import of gold and jewellery items.The American treasury is committed to building on the progress it has made in cooperating with emerging-market countries, of whom India is a notable entity.Trump has also somewhat watered down his aggressive statements on that score. Skilled products would need to be traded globally for ultimate national expediency.Furthermore, the USTR report has noted that the trump administration is optimistic of Indian economic reforms and is keen for greater economic diplomacy with the country. While efforts for a more dynamic Indo-USA trade would surely be undertaken, both countries would need to identify areas where they enjoy or could develop comparative advantage in international trade.The process would definitely bring to the fore the attendant necessity to improve human resources development, as required in either country. Finger-wagging or expressing unwarranted scepticism on benefits of free trade would be self defeating.(The writer is an analyst on international finance)"
5923bd457be9e01fcef058f8,Our language crisis,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596592/our-language-crisis.html,2017-02-15,"Our language crisisBy Vikas Kumar, Feb 16, 2017, 0:12 ISTThe post-colonial elite of India favoured English in the educational and economic spheres, while the state and politicians were nominally committed to Indian languages. As a result, more than seven decades after independence, the question of the medium of instruction in educational institutions remains unresolved. And, we continue to struggle with poor learning outcomes, high drop-out rates, and the lack of inclusion of the masses in higher education because of, among other things, our inability to provide quality education through mother tongues.The association of English with material success in the popular imagination and the neglect of intellectual activity in Indian languages have not only allowed the former to thrive at the expense of our languages, it has also made millions believe that our languages (as well as the knowledge ingrained in them) are worthless. I am reminded of a young student leader, whom I met in a remote town of Nagaland. Without any prompting, he told me that his grandparents were backward because they did not know English (I asked him if Europeans should be considered backward because they do not know Naga languages).Nagaland was the first state to adopt English as its official language and the medium of instruction in schools. However, five decades after Nagaland aligned its state policy with the elite preference, a majority of its people are not proficient in English even as their own languages remain neglected. The condition of other states, where private institutions took the lead in introducing English in schools, is not better.In fact, irrespective of their states language policy, people have been going out of their way to learn English. An acquaintance of mine in Etawah (Uttar Pradesh) approached a chemistry teacher, who was barely conversant with English. He was given to believe that the teacher, who could effortlessly pronounce names of chemical compounds, was best suited to help him pick up spoken English.Phas Gaye Re Obama, a 2010 Hindi film, takes us through the world of spoken English courses exemplified by Tyagi English Coaching Class. The photos of US presidents, sportsmen, entrepreneurs and film stars adorned the Coaching Class, whose tagline was English seekho amerikaa jaao (Learn English, go to America). The English teacher warned the students against using Hindi in the class in the following words: This English coaching, not a local language... You together thinking, English speaking like a rice plate eating. No. Never. Not. English speaking not a children play. English speaking like a undertaker play.I was reminded of this film while travelling through Jammu and Kashmir, where I found thousands of posters advertising English medium schools with names such as YES Dubai Grand School International, Ever Onn Public School, KLM International School, JK Montessorie British School, and DRS Kids.I came across only one advertisement listlessly calling attention to the existence of some Urdu academy that nobody seemed to care for and also a poster meekly inviting students to learn Arabic. Eighth Schedule languages such as Kashmiri and Dogri seemed to be entirely absent from the advertisement space.Chasing the mirageThe decline of non-English media schools and the growth of strangely-named English medium schools, is not restricted to Jammu and Kashmir though. Until the 1990s, there used to be good Hindi medium schools in Kanpur that ranked ahead of English medium schools. Today, none of them commands the same respect. They did not lose patrons because of a decline in teaching standards. They just failed to fulfil the demand for English.People are chasing the mirage of English because those who do not know the language are denied both voice and space in (urban) India. A recent Hindi film, English Vinglish (2012), poignantly captured this. In this film, the lack of acquaintance with English affected the standing of a housewife, both in the society and sadly even within her family. Her daughter, who studied at an English medium school, and husband treated her with contempt. She redeemed herself by learning English. The director could not imagine other means of redemption.The reel and real life characters mentioned above stand for millions who cannot speak English. Those who somehow manage to learn the language feel on cloud nine. Parents feel proud of their children, when they get better grades in English than in Indian languages. The children innocently proclaim that they hate Indian languages (qua subjects, I hope).However, even in the best case, most first generation English learners belatedly realise that they have picked up the wrong English, namely, British or Indian one, whereas the elite has moved on to American English. These people constitute a large and growing part of our society that is neither India nor Bharat.English, which was retained after independence to avoid linguistic conflict within the country, has introduced a new linguistic divide that is aligned with, and thus reinforces, the class divide. But, our self-absorbed Anglophone elite continue to be oblivious of the damage English has done to the society.A decade ago, then prime minister Manmohan Singh proudly informed his audience at the Oxford University: Of all the legacies of the Raj, none is more important than the English language Today, English in India is seen as just another Indian language. English is not just another language. It is, as Ram Manohar Lohia warned as early as the 1950s, a key marker as well as determinant of socio-economic privilege in post-colonial India.It is time we paid attention to the language problem, which is at the heart of our education system. An education system based on the neglect or hatred of ones own languages cannot promote the pursuit of knowledge. Unfortunately, instead of confronting the problem we have abandoned ourselves to market forces that are steering us into an ever tighter embrace of English and compounding the language crisis.(The writer teaches at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru)"

In fact, the poor and the vulnerable have wide range of skills to earn with self-respect.A group of blind men in Bidar, Karnataka formed a Self Help Group to learn music.

Diversity of culture creates demand for different kinds of eatables, fruit, flowers, dress material, ornaments, artefact etc for a variety of services.The Koya tribe of Khamam district make delicious bamboo chicken. They stuff chicken pieces mixed with spices inside a piece of bamboo and bake it on fire. Once it is baked, chicken is served to tourists. The Koyas in around 300 habitats collect honey, gum, custard apple, medicinal plants and make bamboo craft.Many of the Koyas live near Panashala, an exotic tourist spot on the bank of the Godavari river. Their origin dates back to the Ramayana age. Here, the governments job is to provide safety to tourists and protect the Koyas from exploitation by the traders and middlemen.Thousands of villagers in Madurai district collect herbs for agents who supply bulk quantity herbs to big companies. The villagers who collect herbs live in penury. An Exim Bank report says the global herbal industry is likely to reach $6 trillion by 2050. The government can ensure the villagers get the price they deserve and prevent over-exploitation of herbs.The agriculture labour charge per day is Rs 800 in Kerala  one of the main reasons why local farmers quit farming. Thousands of coconut trees were abandoned and converted into rubber plantation in the past decade. Subsequently, the entry of synthetic rubber has made rubber plantation unviable.Rationalisation of labour cost, marketing facility for coconut, banana products and inclusive employment opportunities in spices, tourism and horticulture sector will add to villagers income.The Centre wants to double farmers income in the next five years and has increased budget allocation by 24% in 2017-18. It will happen if government prevents aggressive conversion of fertile agriculture land into non-agriculture purposes. Agriculture scientists representing various research institutions told a joint Parliamentary panel that 1.3 lakh hectares of land are being taken out of cultivation every year.Gene corruptionLack of understanding of crop diversity, gene corruption and poor research output has let many export quality crops disappear. Ten years ago, the tiny jeera-size Katrani rice of Jagdishpur block of Bhagalpur district cost Rs 300 per kg. Today, it is facing extinction. Water is the lifeline of the village.Over the years, thousands of rivers across the country have lost their stream, disappeared in the maze of unplanned realty sector growth and aggressive deforestation. Millions of fishermen across the country lost their jobs and villages lost their productivity. According to the Ministry of Water Resources, a total of 85,807 water bodies in the country are not in use, out of which 8,152 have totally dried up. Give the farmers their water bodies and they will double their income within three years.Baispur of Puri district was a vegetable belt where farmers produced variety of vegetables with organic fertiliser. Vegetable traders in order to have monopoly over the local producers, marketed vegetables from West Bengal, Ranchi and Chhattisgarh at a cheaper rate which had made vegetable farming in Baispur unsustainable.When the villagers left vegetable farming, the traders increased the price again. Here the role of the state government was to check the unscrupulous practices. Over 800 years, the Muslim artisans of Pipli have been making applique umbrellas, banners, fans and flags for Lord Jagannath temple of Puri. Thirty years ago, those artisans used to make more than 60 intricate stitching patterns on clothes.Today, one can come across a few artisans who can create such artistry. This is the main reason why applique work loses its popularity in global craft bazaar. There is need for a proper environment to turn enthusiasm and skill into income generating activities."

They sacrifice very much, and often their personal lives entirely in order to provide as much of their time and resources for their children. DH met two such single mothers who have sacrificed their careers and dreams to give their children the best of life.As a single mother, Saroja Reddy cooks for a living. She has been the sole breadwinner for her family that constitutes of her daughter and son. For the last 15 years, Saroja cooks at various homes to provide for her family. An independent and strong woman, she strives hard to educate and provide for her children. Saroja's day begins as early as six in the morning when she leaves to cook at various homes in her society . She returns in the afternoon to cook lunch for her children and rest for a while.She is back on her feet again at 5 to cook dinner for her clients and returns home only by night. My mother is my greatest gift in life. I have seen her struggle to make ends meet but she would ensure that we never had to go hungry. Many a time she would sacrifice her meal to provide for us. I remember there were some occasions when there was no food at home apart from broken rice and she would make delicious dosas out of the rice and feed us while she would go hungry herself,"" said Amrutha Reddy , her daughter.Every mother will do this for her children. I have not done anything great. I cook at four to five houses but my greatest satisfaction is cooking for my children,"" says Saroja who has never been to a school but is fluent in various languages.Strongest womanI am very proud of my mother for what she is. She is the most independent and strongest woman I know. She did not seek any help from our relatives and friends during the struggling days. One of the greatest things that she has taught is happiness doubles by sharing and I do so by helping people in every way I can,"" says Amrutha, a student of KSIT college.Our father left us when I was eight years old, since them my mother is taking care of us all by herself. She provides us with everything we need. In spite of having faced so many difficulties, she is one of the most positive people you can ever meet,"" says Amrutha. Mothers play many roles in childrens lives and are the women who will have the biggest influence on our lives. Another daughter describes her single mother as a movement.She believed everyone had value. And she believed in giving back when sometimes, sure she didnt have a lot of energy to give. But she was there, volunteering her time with seniors, children, and those with disabilities she made this world better.I realise what I do today is a reflection of the values she showed me. she saysSingle mothers carry the baggage of blames of the world upon their backs and upon the overhead of what we see, they look strong, confident and furious. I was confused about how to handle her alone but never thought that she will grow taller than me and stand by my side in all difficulties. Today I can proudly say that I am her mother, says a single mother."

Shashikala (42) and her son Sanjay (21) murdered Shashikalas mother Shanthakumari (69) over a petty issue, DCP (West) M N Anucheth told DH. Sanjay is doing his third semester in Aeronautical Engineering at a private college in Kengeri. The suspects and the victim hail from Shivamogga.Shashikala and Sanjay murdered Shanthakumari in the third week of August 2016. She and her son plastered her body in a cupboard. They lived in the same house till February 2, 2017. They fled the city after they couldnt prevent the foul smell from emanating from inside the cemented cupboard.The murder came to light on May 7 when the house owner Naveen opened the door with a duplicate key and entered the house. He suspected something fishy due to the foul smell coming from inside the cemented cupboard. He informed the police who rushed to the spot and recovered a human skeleton.Sanjay had brought rice for her mother from an eatery and offered it to Shashikala. Her mother refused to consume it saying it was not home cooked. An irked Shashikala repeatedly hit her mother on the head with a rolling pin, the DCP said.Shashikala told Sanjay about the incident after he returned home. They did not shift the victim to the hospital fearing the neighbours would learn about the incident. After Shanthakumari died the following day due to excessive bleeding, the duo decided to dispose of the body with help from Sanjays friend Nandish, Anucheth said.Nandish and Sanjay bought a large plastic container and charcoal. They also brought five gunny bags of red soil from a nearby construction site. They tried to stuff the body inside the plastic container, but failed.Finally, they pushed the body inside the cupboard, poured charcoal and the soil over it and cemented it. They stuffed all her clothes in the plastic container and taped it. They also taped all the windows to prevent foul smell from emanating from inside the cupboard. A few days later, Sanjay cemented the cupboard, said the police.The suspects cooked up a story saying their relative had met with an accident in Shivamogga and left the house on February 2, 2017. Based on Sanjays request, Naveen deposited Rs 50,000 to the formers account for his relatives treatment.The police registered a case based on Naveens complaint on May 7. We are questioning Sanjays relatives and friends, including Nandish (21), a resident of Kumbalgod. Nandish and Sanjay had been studying in the same college since 2014, the DCP added. The mother and son are at large and will be arrested soon, said the police."

Tehsildar Sanjay Kumar at the field.All his life, 43-year old Singhraj has seen agricultural stubble being burnt by his fellow farmers in the Greater Noida village where he lives. For years, farmers in my village have been doing this, especially after rice harvest. This is because while wheat stubble is used for fodder, this is not the case with rice. Moreover, the soil after a rice harvest has a lot of water content. Burning the residue is an easier and inexpensive way that farmers have traditionally practised, he said.But on Monday, he woke up to newspaper reports of a case being registered against him by the district administration and came to know that stubble burning is banned.In Gautam Buddha Nagar district, officials said it was the first case of a government official lodging a police complaint against a farmer for stubble burning. Crop stubble burning is believed to be a major reason for increase in particulate matter and air pollution. The complaint was filed by the administration. No sections of the IPC can be invoked in the case. There is likely to be a penalty levied on the farmer as per guidelines of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), said Akhilesh Tripathi, SHO, Knowledge Park, Greater Noida.The incident was reported in Noida Sector 150s Momnathal village near the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. According to district officials, the act of crop burning can result in a penalty ranging from Rs 2,500 to Rs 15,000. It depends on the quantity. If the crop burning relates to two acres, Rs 2,500 is charged while Rs 5,000 is charged as penalty for 2 to 5 acres. In cases pertaining to more than five acres, Rs 15,000 is charged, said Rajesh Kumar Singh, SDM, Gautam Buddha Nagar.While he claimed he had not burnt the stubble, Singhraj said he was willing to pay the penalty. I did not burn the stubble. Some harvesting had been done and the rest was to be used as animal fodder. It seems that someone threw a matchstick or a beedi there. I have a tractor; I hire manual labourers and rent a combine to harvest the produce I went to the district administration. I have been asked to pay a fine of Rs 5,000. Since the incident happened on my fields, I will pay the penalty, Singhraj said.Confirming that Singhraj had approached the administration, officials elaborated on the manner in which the incident came to light. A tip-off was given to the DM office over crop stubble burning in the village, which is a violation of NGT rules. Following this, our team reached the village to investigate the case. We found that Singhraj, son of Rajpal, was burning crop stubble in farm number 40 which is around 2.3590 hectares. Since NGT norms were being violated, a case was registered at Knowledge Park police station. The farmer apologised for the incident, and is ready to pay the fine, Singh said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

File/Express Photo/Tashi Tobgyal A woman walks past a ruined home from the recent earthquake in Charikot in Nepal. File/Express Photo/Tashi TobgyalThe paved alleys are still lined by the skeletons of homes once filled with families. Shop shelves are empty, and the water well in the center of town remains clogged by fallen debris. Children carefully side-step piles of broken brick on their way to school.This is life today in the tiny Nepalese farming town of Sankhu, once famed for its lively Hindu temple festivals and rich produce markets just outside the capital of Kathmandu. Nearly everything was lost on April 25, 2015, when a terrifying earthquake shook the Himalayan nation, killing more than 9,000 people and toppling nearly a million homes nationwide. Little progress has been made in the two years since, raising questions about the governments commitment to the recovery effort as well as the fate of billions of dollars in foreign aid.In Sankhu, where the quake claimed 98 lives and toppled 800 homes, most of the remaining residents have struggled to restore what they once had. Many say they have yet to receive any help from the government despite pledges of aid money and help with bank loans.Our town was once one of the best known towns in the country, said 70-year-old Komal Nath Shrestha. Now all we have is ruins and no hope. Shrestha spent four hours after the quake buried in the rubble of his ruined four-story home before family members pulled him out. Now, he is among hundreds in Sankhu living in tin sheds and tarpaulin tents that have popped up in fields and along roadsides as meager protection from winter cold and summer rains.The violence and devastation wrought by the earthquake dominated newspaper headlines worldwide and triggered an outpouring of foreign concern. Aid pledges totaling $4.2 billion poured in about half what the government estimates it will cost to rebuild homes and infrastructure.The government is still collecting that foreign aid, with agreements signed already for $3.1 billion. But to date, it has spent only $330,000. Thats allowed Nepal to rebuild just 3.5 percent of 626,694 homes so far counted as having been destroyed in the quake. And even that count is incomplete, including only homes in the 14 worst-hit districts. There are still another 17 districts to survey.Meanwhile, the vast majority of Nepalese left homeless by the quake are preparing to spend a third rainy season hunkered down in temporary shelters, often flooded and exposed to the elements, relying on handouts of one-time sales for cash to get by. We are refugees in our home town, said Ram Shahi, who was Sankhus butcher until the quake put him out of business. We have bugs and even snakes crawling inside the tin sheds when it rains. We cannot cook because the floor is flooded and clothes get all soaked.The government has been criticized for moving slowly in dispersing funds that would allow people to rebuild on their own. It has said those who need to rebuild would be offered a first aid installment of 50,000 rupees, or $485, followed by second $1,455 payment and a third worth $970. If families needed more, it said they would be offered low-interest loans for up to $24,270.But only first installments have been given so far to 87 percent of families that have qualified for aid. For the rice farming families of Shree Krishna Singh and his brother, that $485 payment falls far short of the $72,800 its cost them to rebuild their shattered home.That money was peanuts, not even enough to dig and lay the foundation, Singh said. Still, they consider themselves among the lucky in that they could sell their rice field to build a new, white concrete home. Now, though, theyre out of work.Others have been far less fortunate. The tin roofs are leaking, retired teacher Satya Narayan said of the makeshift shelter hes occupied since the quake. We get water all over the ground. It gets cold at night, and like an oven in the day.But Narayan hasnt even qualified for earthquake assistance, because like many in Nepal, where records are haphazard, he doesnt have the documents to prove he owns his land. A report by the rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday accused Nepal of failing to help some of the most marginalized among its quake victims, with tens of thousands locked out of the reconstruction program because they cant prove land ownership.Officials with the National Reconstruction Authority acknowledge their efforts are falling short. The grant is not enough, but it is meant to help people get started rebuilding their homes, said Govind Raj Pokharel, who heads the National Reconstruction Authority.He said the government hopes people will follow earthquake safety standards in their construction, but admits the aid wont cover most of the costs. He said the government was trying to persuade the central bank to work on the loans, but so far terms have yet to be finalized. A bigger challenge, Pokharel said, is that the agency does not have control over the aid money, but has to rely on government ministries to send out needed funds. The result is bureaucratic delay.Bank orders from the National Reconstruction Authority often go ignored, according to Mona Sherpa of the Swiss nonprofit agency Helvetas. Their work helping victims with reconstruction has been frustrating, she admitted. We wanted to start work, but then as we got into this process we realized that the process itself is really lengthy, she said, blaming bureaucracy and a lack of coordination between construction agencies and authorities for chronic delays.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The main accused in the case, Mandeep Singh Brar, owner of Avtar Rice and General Mills located in Rajeana village, is still absconding. He is the son of SAD leader Jagtar Singh Rajeana, and also the chairman of Punjab Agricultural Development Bank (Baghapurana branch).Watch What Else Is Making NewsA SIT, constituted in February 2012 after an FIR was filed against four persons by the Moga police, completed its probe and submitted its enquiry report, following which the arrests have been made. The SIT of crime branch was led by Sushil Kumar, AIG crime Patiala.The FIR was registered on the statement of Harpinder Singh Dhaliwal, then district manager MARKFED Moga. A case was registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant)and 120 B (conspiracy) of IPC.The SIT enquiry report stated that Brar, in connivance with MARKFED employees, embezzled paddy worth Rs 18 crore. The report adds that embezzlement of such a huge extent was not possible without involvement of MARKFED employees. The report, nailing all four persons initially named in FIR along with two others nominated in the case, has ordered Moga police to immediately arrest all the accused.The rice mill owned by Brar was allotted to The Punjab State Co-operative Supply & Marketing Federation Ltd (MARKFED)- one of the government agencies procuring foodgrain from farmers for custom milling of paddy and delivery of rice to Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 2010-11. 5.49 lakh bags of paddy weighing 19,241 MT were allotted to the said rice mill but they milled 5,632 MT only and a remaining of 13,609 MT that is 3.88 lakh bags worth Rs 18 crore was found missing. The remaining stock never reached FCI godowns and police filed FIR against Brar and three others in 2012.The arrested includes Amarjit Singh Sandhu, the then district manager MARKFED, Sham Lal, then salesman MARKFED Baghapurana, Vakeel Chand alias Vicky, the accountant of Avtar Mills and Makhan Singh Langeana, another rice mill owner.Sham Lal and Sandhu were named in FIR in 2012 while two others were nominated later in case by SIT. Another MARKFED employee Kamal Kumar named in FIR died during the probe period.SAD leaders son abroad, police unsure of countryBrar absconded soon after FIR was registered in 2012. He reportedly flew to Canada. However, on December 4, 2016, he was spotted at Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, from where he even managed to take a flight to Amsterdam. He managed the flight despite the fact that the Punjab police had issued a Look Out Circular (LOC) against him. It was later found that he used a forged passport to get a boarding card. He was consequently booked in another FIR for cheating, impersonation and forgery by Delhi police.Sukhdev Singh, DSP Baghapurana said, Of four persons named in FIR two are arrested while one died. Brar is absconding. Two others nominated by SIT are also arrested. He added, We suspect that Brar is in Canada currently but now with SIT report finally with us, we will find his exact location. We are yet to enquire if he is Amsterdam or Canada but he is abroad.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
59284b7f7be9e0137c77c937,Beef export: unethical slaughter for money,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612138/beef-export-unethical-slaughter-money.html,2017-05-17,"Ritwick Dutta, May 17 2017, 23:51 ISTThe massive growth of the meat export industry in India in the last few years has ushered in what is infamously called the Pink Revolution. This revolution has today become the centre of public debate and political discourse, principally because of the crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses in Uttar Pradesh and other parts of India.Viewing the ongoing controversy over slaughterhouses only from the lens of the right of the people to decide what they want to eat or of religious intolerance, overlooks many fundamental questions.Should a country like India promote the export of meat? Have we really considered the environmental, social and ethical issues while focussing on the export earning and jobs provided by slaughterhouses? At a time when even rivers, lakes and glaciers have been considered as legal and living entities by a high court, should animals continue to be treated as inanimate sources of protein and revenue?The fact is that we must make a distinction between meat for domestic consumption and meat for export. The irony is, today India is the worlds largest exporter of beef; its total export is valued at Rs 26,000 crore and is slated to grow further.Indias legal beef export consists essentially of buffalo meat called carabeef. As of now, beef has surpassed Basmati rice as India's top agricultural export. India's buffaloes are being largely slaughtered not to add protein or satisfy the taste buds of its citizens, but of the people of 65 countries where it is exported.The country has been eager to tap the Chinese meat market; the worlds largest. China had, till recently, not allowed the direct import of Indias beef due to the prevalence of the foot and mouth disease here. It was only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China in 2015, that the Chinese government decided to send inspectors to visit India's abattoir to ascertain their conditions. In January, 2017, China finally allowed the import of Indian beef.India sees buffalo meat export as a means to reduce its massive trade deficit with China. Thus, while the ruling BJP actively advocates against the Pink Revolution, the Union government under the leadership of the same party has succeeded in opening a direct export channel for beef with China.Legal or illegal, slaughterhouses and the promotion of meat industry for export have serious environmental and social consequences. From an environmental standpoint, large-scale export of meat itself is a precious drain on the countrys natural resources.Meat industry is highly water-intensive: for producing just a kilo of meat, roughly 15,000 litres of water is required (UN World Water Development report, 2012). Thus, when India exports meat, it is not just exporting meat, but also large quantities of scarce water. Thus, a virtual trade in water takes place. Lax regulations and low wages make Indian meat far cheaper than other competing countries.Cruel industryThe export of meat raises an important question: do we have the moral and ethical right to kill in the most brutal and cruel manner to meet our foreign exchange requirement? Buffaloes are reared, transported and slaughtered in the most unthinkable manner. In a slaughter house, every effort is made to ensure that the animal suffers unimaginable pain. In the whole process of meat export, a live animal with emotions is reduced to an inanimate lifeless resource.Just because an animal is not the holy cow, does it legitimise it being subjected to excruciating pain and torture? It would not be amiss to say that the torture we inflict on meek and helpless animals in slaughterhouses is akin to the sufferings of people in the concentration camps under the Nazi regime.As a countrys living standards improve, activities that are hazardous and promote pollution are increasingly resisted by the local people; a classic example of Not in My Backyard syndrome. As quality of life and liveability index become important yardsticks in peoples lives, slaughterhouses, with their high polluting nature, have no place in the urban and rural landscape.A few years ago, the Sup-reme Court prohibited the export of iron ore from Goa and Karnataka. The export earnings from mining did not, according to the court, reflect the true social and environmental impact. Indias meat export is no different. It is an extractive industry given the nature of natural resources it uses.Slaughter houses, despite their high pollution load, are not subject to any Environmental Impact Assessment. The impact on the ecology as well as the people are never ascertained scientifically. No cost benefit analysis is done. No public hearing takes place. The public has no say in deciding whether slaughter houses should be allowed or not.We need an impartial debate on whether India should continue in its path as a global giant in meat export. India has many skills it can use to its optimal capacity to earn a place as a global economic giant. It will be sad indeed if the worlds largest democracy is one day known globally for its skill in raising and killing animals for consumption.(The writer is an environmental lawyer)"
59284eac7be9e0137c77cb69,Getting a business to taste 'organic' growth,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/610378/getting-business-taste-organic-growth.html,2017-05-07,"Hrithik Kiran Bagade, May 8 2017, 0:14 ISTBusinesses are harvesting plans to reap the resurgence of organic farming, making humble crops like millets relevant in today's plateAgriculture, the primary economic activity in India employing the largest workforce in the country, dates back to the early stages of civilisational growth. Since time immemorial, Indian farmers have tamed the lands soil, tapped her fertility, and perfected the cultivation of myriad crops, using improvised techniques where animals were the source of energy for tilling, irrigation, and when natural manures played a pivotal role.But the Green Revolution in the early 1960s, backed by the introduction of high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilisers, led to a hike in production and paved the way for economic independence of farmers. But, while the natural strength of the soil was getting lost in the long run, the Green Revolution brought in a new set of crops against conventional ones like pearl millet (bajra), foxtail millet (navane akki), finger millet (ragi), and sorghum (jowar). Since dramatic climatic changes brought drought, leading to drastic reduction in the agricultural yields, policymakers, agri-scientists and farmers began thinking of going back to environment-friendly modes of cultivation  simply put, organic farming.Karnataka, which recently conducted the Organics & Millets National Trade Fair in Bengaluru, is the first state to draft an Organic Farming Policy in 2004, which will be reformed into a new policy this year.According to Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda, The Karnataka Organic Farming Policy 2017 aims to bring organic farming into the mainstream and transform the states agriculture into a sustainable and remunerative occupation, enabling production of safe and nutritious food by promoting eco-friendly and holistic organic farming and marketing systems.This has been heard as a sort of clarion call by startups and businesses alike which not only wish for higher yields in their own fortunes, but also want to build perception.Startup seedlingsIt was six months ago that Namu Kini co-founded HappyHealthyMe Organics in Bengaluru, which today boasts of over 300 SKUs under its brand, including cold pressed oils, ghee, staples, spices, masalas, grains, and unusual flours, among others.Namu, who is also the CEO, says, We want people to reconnect with food and enjoy every meal. We dont want them to view healthy food as deprivation and punishment. A lack of finding authentic organic brands in the market, led to the founding of HappyHealthyMe, which will be launching its website soon, and eventually going pan-India. Organic food is tastier, but its also difficult to source many of its products. Theres a lot of misinformation out there on what is organic and what isnt, and procuring everything becomes inconvenient. A lot of brands claim to be organic, but are not, she says, adding that the organic switch is to be made not when one is sick, but rather when one is healthy and wants to remain that way.The global organic food market, which was estimated at $90 billion in 2015, has been growing at a CAGR of around 12% over the last 14 years. Interestingly, India has the largest number of organic producers in the world at 5,85,000 active cultivators, who produce around 1.35 MT of certified organic products namely sugar cane, oil seeds, cereals and millets, pulses, tea, coffee, fruits, spices, dry fruits, vegetables, and so on (as part of edible crops), annually. In Karnataka, meanwhile, the certified organic area increased to a mammoth 93,963 hectares in 2015-16, from 2,500 hectares in 2004.It must be noted that certified organic means that every single products supply chain must be audited by a number of different agencies/certification bodies around the country. Once something is certified, it means that the farm should have gone through a three-year conversion period, during which neither chemicals nor fertilisers should have been used  only then can it be claimed as organic.Besides organic farming as a means, what one is eating in the end must also be known. Millets, often dubbed as poor mans food, are being popularised as hardy crops requiring a tenth of water consumed by mainstream crops, and even less fertiliser, to become an integral part of ones balanced diet.Soulfull, the health food brand of Kottaram Agro Foods, is blending innovation to make millets relevant in the 21st century. In the mainstream perspective, millet is an underdog among food crops. Still, what we are seeing is a lot of interest coming for these ancient grains from urban pockets. But there is a long way to go, and there is more exposure needed. One must understand that unlike rice which has different varieties, millets constitute a family of different types, Prashant Parameswaram, MD (Soulfull) at Kottaram Agro Foods, tells DH.Millet consumption, compared with mainstream rice or wheat consumption, is very small, in the 1-2% range of total staples consumed every year.Awareness is on the rise, and the next stage is increasing consumption to 10-20%. The role for companies like ours is to innovate the right product and bring it into the market in a way that is relevant and resonates with consumers, he says, elaborating with an example: One is aware that ragi is good for health, and is more nutritious than other mainstream grains like rice and wheat, but how do I get a child to eat it? How do I provide it in a more attractive form? Todays children are choosier about what they eat.A drive towards fitness due to rising lifestyle disorders and hectic job profiles has led many, especially in urban areas, to embrace an organic and millet-filled lifestyle. With a surge in foreign ideas, Indians have taken to eating oats, muesli, and quinoa as major dietary additions, while there is a need to make them see the beauty of home produce. For instance, foxtail millets and quinoa are nutritionally the same, with the latter also having been classified as a super food. But, why run after a crop which is grown in South America, when a similar indigenous ingredient like foxtail millet provides the same applications? questions Parameswaram.Hence, we are trying to bring millets back into the mainstream. Were not telling people to give up rice, wheat or oats, but supplement a healthier alternative in their meals with millets, he adds.Conquering challengesA point in question is about organic food being expensive when compared with regular FMCG food products.A major reason might be the amount of time, methods and risk involved in the cultivation process. While cheap petrochemical pesticides artificially enhance growth of crops, the amount of harvest will also increase, getting more people to use them. Eventually though, they kill the soil quality, and there will be no crop after several cycles. On the other hand, organic agriculture will not give that much of a harvest, with some yield also being lost to pests since no pesticide is used.However, once demand increases, price will go down as more farmers would be encouraged, believes Namu. But a big challenge is forecasting that demand, and one has to maintain quality and authenticity, she says, adding that with government support, it will be accessible to everybody, and even farmers would gain confidence to grow such crops.Even bigger companies are keenly eyeing this nascent space.

When the vehicle was being reversed to unload rice bags, it dashed against a wall. As a result, the tempo and the wall fell on the two kids and they were buried alive in the debris.The claimants advocate, S Y Tawde, informed MACT that both the deceased were students, and lodged a claim of Rs 10 lakh for each of them against tempo owner Gopal Sitaram Gharat and Reliance General Insurance Company Limited.The insurance firms advocate, Alka Phadtare, told the MACT that the vehicle owner fabricated the policy period in the cover note showing it to be from March 22, 2014, to March 21, 2015, while it was actually signed on April 21, 2014.She said the vehicle owner did this to establish that the policy period was covering the date of the accident.She also contended that the tempo owner did not produce all documents pertaining to the policy. Also, the vehicle owner did not come in the witness box to face cross-examination by the advocates of the insurance company and the applicants, Phadtare argued.The applicants counsel submitted that the future of his clients is ruined with the death of their children. Therefore, he sought compensation which may be sufficient for the applicants to pass their remaining lives.The judge, in a recent order, observed that the policy filed is fake. Thus, the insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation as the claim of the applicants legally does not stand against it.While disposing of two separate claims (one for each kid, the judge said the tempo owner is liable to pay Rs 6.6 lakh for each of the child to the applicants.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: REUTERS/File) An illustration picture shows the logo of the US National Security Agency on the display of an iPhone, June 7, 2013. (Source: REUTERS/File)The US National Security Agency collected more than 151 million records of Americans phone calls last year, even after Congress limited its ability to collect bulk phone records, according to an annual report issued on Tuesday by the top US intelligence officer. The report from the office of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats was the first measure of the effects of the 2015 USA Freedom Act, which limited the NSA to collecting phone records and contacts of people US and allied intelligence agencies suspect may have ties to terrorism.It found that the NSA collected the 151 million records even though it had warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court to spy on only 42 terrorism suspects in 2016, in addition to a handful identified the previous year.The NSA has been gathering a vast quantity of telephone metadata, records of callers and recipients phone numbers and the times and durations of the calls  but not their content  since the September 11, 2001, attacks.The report came as Congress faced a decision on whether to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which permits the NSA to collect foreign intelligence information on non-US persons outside the United States, and is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Privacy advocates have argued that Section 702 permits the NSA to spy on Internet and telephone communications of Americans without warrants from the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and that foreign intelligence could be used for domestic law enforcement purposes in a way that evades traditional legal requirements.The report said that on one occasion in 2016, the FBI obtained information about an American in response to a search of Section 702 data intended to produce evidence of a crime not related to foreign intelligence.The report did not address how frequently the FBI obtained information about Americans while investigating a foreign intelligence matter, however.On Friday, the NSA said it had stopped a form of surveillance that allowed it to collect the digital communications of Americans who mentioned a foreign intelligence target in their messages without a warrant.TRUMPS ALLEGATIONSThe new report also came amid allegations, recently repeated by US President Donald Trump, that former President Barack Obama ordered warrantless surveillance of his communications and that former national security adviser Susan Rice asked the NSA to unmask the names of US persons caught in the surveillance.Both Republican and Democratic members of the congressional intelligence committees have said that so far they have found no evidence to support either allegation.Officials on Tuesday argued that the 151 million records collected last year were tiny compared with the number collected under procedures that were stopped after former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the surveillance program in 2013.Because the 151 million would include multiple calls made to or from the same phone numbers, the number of people whose records were collected also would be much smaller, the officials said. They said they had no breakdown of how many individuals phone records were among those collected.In all, according to the report, US officials unmasked the names of fewer Americans in NSA eavesdropping reports in 2016 than they did the previous year, the top US intelligence officer reported on Tuesday.The report said the names of 1,934 US persons were unmasked last year in response to specific requests, compared with 2,232 in 2015, but it did not identify who requested the names or on what grounds.Officials said in the report that US intelligence agencies had gone out of their way to make public more information about US electronic eavesdropping.This years report continues our trajectory toward greater transparency, providing additional statistics beyond what is required by law, said Office of the Director of National Intelligence spokesman Timothy Barrett.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Tenders have been floated for E-pos to be installed in Public Distribution System shops and once the entire process was completed, all irregularities in PDS would be contained, Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman informed the assembly today.He was replying to a notice for an adjournment motion moved by the Congress led UDF Opposition, which alleged that the PDS in Kerala has come to standstill and government has failed to check the price rise of essential commodities.Stating that Kerala has started distributing food grains under NFS Act, he said a pilot project started in April to provide essential commodities directly to ration shops, avoiding middlemen and to check diversion has been expanded this month to six more districts,including Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode. The system will be introduced across the state by June, he said.Under PDS supply, 1.54 crore people are entitled to four kg rice and one kg wheat free of cost, 1.24 crore people to two kg of rice at Rs two per kg and 65 lakh people, one kg of rice at Rs 8.90 and wheat at Rs 7.The Minister denied the Opposition charge that government had failed to check price rise of essential commodities and claimed that effective intervention of the State Civil supplies Corporation in the open market had resulted in price of rice and other essential food items coming down.Thilothaman also said there was no justification for the Centre to cut the states share of rice and wheat under PDS and demanded that the Centre restore the states quota of food items.Attacking the government, Opposition leader in the assembly Ramesh Chennithala said PDS had come to standstill.

All it took was eight months for members of SayTrees to turn this no-man's land in Krishnarajapuram into a beautiful, lungspace.A pilot project of city-based SayTrees, an organisation comprising like-minded people, the initiative started in September 2016 with the planting of around 2,000 saplings on the plot measuring 600 sq metres. The land, located near the diesel locomotive shed close to the ITI campus in Krishnarajapuram, belongs to Indian Railways.""The objective of our project was to create an urban mini forest in Bengaluru to increase green cover. On September 24, 2016 we planted saplings of more than 40 tree species like neem, jamun, mango, banyan and others. The saplings have grown upto 10 feet now. In the next two years, we aim to make this forest more dense. We have named this forest Miyawaki,"" said head of partnerships and projects, SayTrees, Durgesh Agrahari.The team members chose the name since they adopted the Miyawaki plantation technique where saplings of different species are planted close together in a small pit with organic rice husk and coco peat to boost cultivation. Agrahari added that the plot was handed over to them by the railways as they were not using them. Authorities also provided support.Kapil Sharma, the founder of the organisation said they plan to create similar mini forests near Yeshwantpur railway station and near Bommasandra Industrial Area, soon. ""We are also in the process of creating a mini forest in Hyderabad wherein saplings will be planted on three acres of land,"" he said.Around 50,000 saplings have been planted so far by SayTrees near waterbodies, army/railway land and available vacant spaces across the city.

(AP Photo)US President Donald Trumps senior adviser Kellyanne Conway has come under fire after a picture of her casually kneeling on a couch in the Oval Office was widely shared on social media. In an image captured by an AFP photographer, Conway appears on the couch with her shoes on as Trump poses for a photo with leaders of historically black colleges and universities. Wall Street Journal columnist Bret Stephens was among those taking aim at Conway, suggesting that aides under previous administrations would have elicited even greater outcry.Watch what else is making news:If Rice or Jarrett had sat like this in Oval Office, conservatives would have screamed themselves hoarse for weeks. Now we own trashy, he wrote, referring to previous presidential aides. Trumps predecessor Barack Obama repeatedly took flak for photos in which he appeared to be relaxing. Critics also chastised Obama for unbuttoning the previous Oval Office dress code that called for a suit jacket and a tie.The image of Conway trended widely on social media, with several Twitter users berating her for what they described as a lack of respect in the Oval Office. This is not the first time Conway has found herself at the centre of a storm. She recently came under fire for plugging the fashion brand of the presidents daughter. The head of the US Office of Government Ethics urged the White House to investigate Conway after the incident, saying she should face disciplinary action.She also famously coined the term alternative facts and referred to a Bowling Green massacre  which never happened  during an interview. Conway later tweeted that she meant to say Bowling Green terrorists  referring to two Iraqi men who were indicted in 2011 for trying to send money and weapons to Al-Qaeda, and using improvised explosive devices against US soldiers in Iraq.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

(AP Photo/File) Then-National Security Adviser Susan Rice. (AP Photo/File)Former President Barack Obamas national security adviser, Susan Rice declined an invitation to testify at an upcoming Senate hearing on Russias interference in the 2016 election. Rices lawyer notified the senators chairing the hearing of her decision not to attend in a letter. Two other former Obama administration officials are scheduled to testify before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Monday. The subcommittee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russias role in the 2016 election.Rices refusal to testify is the latest twist in the congressional investigations into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign and the ongoing debate over whether the probes are truly independent and bipartisan. Rice was invited to testify only by the Republican chairman of the subcommittee, and not by the top Democrat on the panel, her lawyer said. CNN first reported Rices decision.Rice became a central part of the Russia investigation when President Donald Trump said she may have committed a crime when she asked intelligence analysts to disclose the name of a Trump associate mentioned in an intelligence report. Rice has said she did nothing improper. But she has become a key former Obama administration official in a position to answer questions from lawmakers.Rices attorney, Kathryn Ruemmler, said Rice is supportive of the committees investigation, but it is rare for Congress to ask for testimony from a former presidents national security adviser. The request for Rices testimony also stood out, Ruemmler wrote in the letter, because it came after the hearing was announced and well after the other two witnesses former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former national intelligence Director James Clapper had agreed to appear. But unlike invitations extended to Yates and Clapper, Rice was invited to testify solely by subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C, not jointly with the panels top Democrat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Ruemmler said.Ruemmler said in the letter that Whitehouse notified Rice in writing that he did not agree with Grahams invitation, which Ruemmler described as a significant departure from the bipartisan invitations extended to other witnesses. Spokespersons for Graham and Whitehouse did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Yates and Clappers upcoming public testimony is much-anticipated, as they were both scheduled to speak before the House intelligence committee in March. But that hearing was cancelled, some Democrats believe, because the White House wanted to limit what Yates could say. The House intelligence committee has yet to reschedule the public hearing.Yates is expected to give senators details about her Jan. 26 conversation with the White House counsel about Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The Justice Department has decided not to charge two white Baton Rouge police officers in the shooting death of Alton Sterling. (The Advocate via AP) Acting U.S Attorney Corey Amundson, center, speaks, during a news conference in Baton Rouge, La. The Justice Department has decided not to charge two white Baton Rouge police officers in the shooting death of Alton Sterling. (The Advocate via AP)Two white Louisiana police officers were spared federal charges on Wednesday in the fatal shooting of a black man last summer but still face a state criminal investigation, as the victims family angrily demanded justice. The death of Alton Sterling, 37, in Baton Rouge, the state capital, was one in a series of racially charged police killings that inflamed a national debate over treatment of minorities by law enforcement. The decision not to charge the two officer by the U.S. Department of Justice came amid scrutiny of how aggressively Republican President Donald Trumps administration will seek to hold officers accountable. Both Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have criticized the Obama administration, saying it targeted police unfairly in civil rights investigations.Sessions is still responsible for deciding whether to bring charges in other high-profile police killings, including the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner in New York and the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland that same year.U.S. Attorney Corey Amundson in Baton Rouge told reporters on Wednesday there was insufficient evidence to charge the officers with civil rights violations, in part because investigators could not determine whether Sterling was reaching for a gun at the time he was shot.Sterlings family held a simultaneous news conference to call on Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry to pursue state criminal charges.Open up your heart, your eyes, and give us the justice that we deserve, Quinyetta McMillon, said the mother of Sterlings oldest son, fighting back tears.Landry warned that a state investigation into the actions of the officers, Blane Salamoni and Howie Lake, which was delayed to allow the federal probe to proceed, could take a considerable amount of time.Lawyers for the family said U.S. officials told them Salamoni was recorded on video threatening to kill Sterling less than 90 seconds before firing the fatal shots.A lengthy summary of the Justice Departments findings released on Wednesday did not include that detail.The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Unions state chapter, Marjorie Esman, said the decision was consistent with the Obama administrations approach in similar cases, given the high legal standard in federal civil rights cases.Wednesdays events came a day after a white former South Carolina officer pleaded guilty in the 2015 shooting of an unarmed black man and a Texas officer was fired for shooting an unarmed 15-year-old boy on Saturday.Sterling was killed on July 5, 2016, outside a convenience store, after a resident reported he had been threatened by a black man selling CDs.In statements, the officers said that Sterling was attempting to pull a loaded gun out of his pocket when Salamoni opened fire, according to the Justice Department summary.Videos of the incident did not conclusively show Sterlings hand when the first shot was fired, making it impossible to prove the officers account was untrue, the department said. Two witnesses who said his hand was not in his pocket gave accounts that were inconsistent in other details.The two officers are on paid administrative leave pending an internal police investigation.Salamonis attorney, John McLindon, said he expects the state will come to the same conclusion as the federal probe.Theres not going to be any finding of any criminal conduct, McLindon said by phone Wednesday evening. Lakes lawyer, Fred Crifasi, said the officer was relieved by the Justice Departments decision but would not comment further.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The administration is now conducting special camps for children in the 0-5 age group. (Debabrata Mohanty) Priti Bisoyi, 4, refuses to get photographed at a camp in Papadahandi block. The administration is now conducting special camps for children in the 0-5 age group. (Debabrata Mohanty)The ceiling fan rests motionless  someone had forgotten to turn the switch on. The only sign of electricity in this sultry room at the Chikili upper primary school in Dabugaon block of Nabarangpur district, where an Aadhaar enrolment camp is underway, is the glow from the fingerprint scanner. Just as 20-something Arabati Majhi puts her right palm on the fingerprint scanner, the light goes off  its a power outage.Oh gone again, groans Gupta Prasad Subudhi, district coordinator of the Hyderabad-based Karvy Data Management Services Limited, one of the private enrolment agencies tasked by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to prepare Aadhaar cards. This is the fifth outage since morning. How will I ever finish my work this way? And this heat I have been sweating buckets, he says, staring angrily at the laptop screen as a dozen tribal men and women stifle their giggles.Majhi keeps standing before a blank flex-poster, clutching her 4-year-old son Simanchalas palm. In one corner of the room, her year-old son Dakuchhi lies on a grubby rug on the cemented floor. A few hours earlier, the two children had been enrolled under Aadhaar. Dakuchhi now lies deep in sleep, unmindful that he will soon be a 12-digit identification number, part of a database of 112 crore Indians who have enrolled for the unique identification programme.A few minutes later, the scanner beeps to life, and Subudhi is visibly relieved. Over the next few minutes, Subudhi scans Majhis iris and fingerprints and hands her a printed sheet indicating that her biometric scans have been successfully completed.On March 27, the Supreme Court observed that Aadhaar cannot be pressed for welfare schemes. For benefits, it (Aadhaar) cannot be pressedfor non-benefits, it can be done, said a bench headed by Chief Justice of India J S Khehar.Here in Nabarangpur  the Odisha district thats arguably Indias poorest and which was part of a year-long assignment in 2015-16 by The Indian Express to track poverty and transformation  benefit versus non-benefit is not what officials are rushing to decipher; instead, its enrolment thats occupying their minds. Until March 30, over 87 per cent of the districts 12.89 lakh people had been enrolled under Aadhaar, a little under the states tally (88 per cent of 4.4 crore population).The administration is now conducting special camps for children in the 0-5 age group, with over 46 per cent of the 94,911 children in this category getting enrolled.In a district such as Nabarangpur, where there is poor mobile connectivity and difficulties in electricity supply in some areas, Aadhaar enrolment is a daunting task, says district collector Rashmita Panda.Though Nabarangpur needs about 20 MW of daily power, it gets only 17-18 MW from its three grids, which draw electricity from the Balimela Hydroelectric project in neighbouring Malkangiri district.Patchy electricity isnt Nabarangpurs only challenge. About 20 km from Chikili village, at an enrolment camp for children thats being held at an anganwadi centre in Betajharan village, Papadahandi block, Aadhaar operator Nabaghana Amatya looks hot and harried. Its the first day of the camp and Amatya has been told to take photographs of the children  not biometrics as they tend to change as the children grow up, he says.Every time he aims the camera of his tablet at four-year-old Priti Bisoyi, the child kicks and screams. Amatya tries his best, even standing up to aim right, but the girl continues bawling. Her mother hands her a biscuit, but Priti would have none of it. Cant have a crying baby as Aadhaar photo, he tells the mother, asking her to take the child away and angrily deleting the blurry photos.Next in the queue is Namita Rana with her two-year-old son Subham. The child poses without a fuss but Amatyas problems have just begun. The 2G net connection, through which Amatya has to upload the childs data to the Aadhaar database, gives up. After several failed attempts, during which the queue of restless children grows, Amatya finally uploads the photograph.Officials complain that while enrolment for those in the 18-and-above age group is almost complete  98 per cent of the 7.98 lakh population in that category  it is the children who have dragged down the enrolment rate.We have allocated 13 tablets to the district, of which eight are now being used to enroll children, says Soubhagya Nayak, the districts e-governance manager, a position that makes him the man in charge of Aadhaar enrolment. We could have completed the enrolment by June this year, if only the Internet connection had been a little more reliable.Arabati Majhi (Top) gets her fingerprints scanned in Chikili village; Ayush Harijan, (Down) 7, at an enrollment camp. (Debabrata Mohanty) Arabati Majhi (Top) gets her fingerprints scanned in Chikili village; Ayush Harijan, (Down) 7, at an enrollment camp. (Debabrata Mohanty)Reliability is usually too much to ask for in these parts. So while state utility BSNL has had a presence in the district for years, its 2G network usually moves at a crawl. Private networks such as Airtel and Jio offer 4G connections in some areas, but much of the district falls in network shadow areas.Officials claim that until 2016, the rate of enrolment was about 60 per cent, but the pace quickened after the state governments IT arm, Odisha Computer Application Centre, took charge in August last year. That brought in more private agencies on board and the Centre held camps in far-flung areas of the district.So far, the district administration has managed to seed the 12-digit Aadhaar numbers with the personal details of the beneficiaries of welfare and social security schemes such as the National Food Security Scheme, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension, Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension and Indira Gandhi National Disability Pension. Aadhaar seeding is a process by which UIDs of residents are included in the service delivery database to enable Aadhaar-based authentication during delivery of services such as pension and ration.For NFSA, as part of which beneficiaries get 5 kg of rice or wheat at Rs 1 a kg and half a litre of kerosene at Rs 18-20/litre, the district officials have so far seeded the NFSA cards of 15,785 of the 17,332 priority households. Similarly, of the 3,778 beneficiary families of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (the poorest among BPL), who get 35 kg of rice at Rs 1 a kg, the officials have seeded 3,498 families.Once the Aadhaar seeding is done in the NFSA scheme, it will be easy for us to weed out anyone who has more than two NFSA cards. We are integrating the Aadhaar numbers in the E-Bitaran software programmed into the Point of Sale machines at the ration shops  that will ensure only real beneficiaries get the wheat and rice, says A Geeta Rani, marketing inspector in the food and consumer welfare department.For social security schemes such as the old-age, widow and disability pensions, where the beneficiaries get Rs 300 a month, officials say more than 71 per cent of the 70,000-odd beneficiaries have been Aadhaar-seeded. Nabarangpurs 63,852 beneficiaries of the state-sponsored social security programme, the Madhu Babu Pension Yojana, are also getting Aadhar-seeded, they say.However, not everyone is optimistic about the seeding. Mary Nag, a 65-year-old widow who lives all by herself in D Beheraguda village of Nabarangpur block, says the sarpanch told her about Aadhaar and that she would get her pension money in her bank account. We have no bank in our village. I have one in Nabarangpur town, 10 km away, but I hardly use it. I used to go to the gram panchayat office near our village and collect the pension in cash at the beginning of every month. Now I will have to hire an autorickshaw and go all the way to the town, she says.With 61 bank branches and 141 bank kiosks for a population of 12.9 lakh, Nabarangpur remains woefully underbanked. Of the 2.5 lakh MGNREGA cardholders who are active, 67 per cent have had their Aadhaar data seeded into their cards.Project Director of the District Rural Development Agency, Poma Tudu, says Aadhaar-seeding of MGNREGA workers would ensure a lot of associated benefits for beneficiaries and their family members. Besides weeding out bogus cards, Aadhaar will also ensure that an MGNREGA worker gets all the benefits of a Nirman Shramik (construction worker) such as loans for building a pucca house and financial help for their daughters wedding. Once an MGNREGA worker completes 90 days of work, we will register him or her as a Nirman Shramik under the labour department, says Tudu, whose DRDA is the nodal agency for implementation of MGNREGA in the district.But Dandapani Nayak is not so optimistic. The 21-year-old from Majhiguda village in Junapani grampanchayat of Dabugaon block is among several MGNREGA workers who havent been paid their dues since April last year. Nayak, who worked on a road construction work last year, says he is yet to get his wages for three weeks of work. Every time we go to the post office to withdraw money, we are told there is a technical problem in our accounts, says Nayak.Tudu blames the delay on technical glitches in the postal departments attempt last year to migrate from a 7-digit accounting system to a 10-digit one.These glitches, it seems, do little to shake peoples faith in the system. So at another enrolment camp, this time at the Permanent Enrolment Centre near the Nabarangpur municipality, Lalita Harijan comes with her seven-year-old nephew Ayush Harijan. As the enrolment operator asks Harijan to pose for the camera, he stiffens up and purses his lips. Hey, you are very good-looking. You dont have to be so stiff, says the operator as the crowd in the room breaks into laughter.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Express Photo) The school at Huliyar in Tumakuru district. (Express Photo)A day after three students of Vidyavaridhi International School at Huliyar in Karnatakas Tumakuru district died of food poisoning, the school wore a deserted look on Friday. The school management sent messages to the phones of parents on Thursday night, saying that the school would be closed till the next week. The only sign of life was policemen in a van stationed on the deserted campus as a security measure.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe chairman of the school Kiran Kumar, a former BJP MLA from the region, and his wife Kavitha Kiran Kumar, have gone underground after being roughed up by some parents at the Tumakuru government hospital mortuary on Thursday, said police.The father of one of the victims, Class X student Akanksh Pallaki (16), filed a police complaint in Tumakuru on Friday, alleging that his son was deliberately killed by someone in the school. In his complaint, K Lakshmikanthaiah has alleged that a dispute between the former school principal T S Ravi, who was sacked three months ago, and the school chairman Kiran Kumar lies at the root of the tragedy. He has alleged that the sambar served for dinner at the hostel on Wednesday night was deliberately poisoned by someone.Besides Akanksh, Class VIII student Y Shreyas (14) and Class X student K Shantharaju (16) died in the tragedy. Another Class X student Sudarshan (14) and security guard Ramesh (50) are undergoing treatment at the district hospital. Four staff members of the school, who had been arrested, were produced before a magistrate and released on bail.A senior police officer supervising the probe into the incident said preliminary findings indicate that a conspiracy could be behind the poisoning. The probe has suggested that the sambar served at dinner was poisoned around 9 pm when the first of the 28 students in the hostel came to the dining hall, he said. The police have found that those who consumed the sambar served before 9 pm did not face any problems. Among them are the assistant cook Rangalakshmi, who ate around 8.30 pm, and the family of Kiran Kumar, who were sent the food at 7 pm.Police have also found that the CCTV system in the school had been disconnected on January 13 and no one had noticed it till Thursday. While conditions under which the food was prepared in the hostel kitchen were unhygienic, the cause of the food poisoning appears to be a pesticide, police sources said.Coming to an official conclusion at this stage is not fair. We will wait for forensic and autopsy reports. If it is proven that someone mixed poison in the food, we will question all suspects, including the former principal, the senior police officer said.According to S R Darshan, a Class X student at the school who witnessed the events on Wednesday night, the three victims warned their hostel mates about the food after they ate it.Shreyas, Akanksh and Shantha Murthy were the first to eat that night. They ate rice and sambar. After eating, they told others to avoid rice and sambar, citing bad taste and smell. Shreyas then went to sleep in his room, Shantha Murthy collapsed on the way to his room and Akanksh collapsed in the dining hall. Sudarshan stopped eating midway, saying the food was not good, Darshan said.Most students at the CBSE -affiliated school are from well-off agricultural families in the region bordering the districts of Tumakuru and Chitradurga. Parents pay about Rs 30,000 a year as fees and an additional Rs 40,000 annually if their wards are boarders at the hostel.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

To Muslims  including those victimized by or fighting against ISIS (Islamic State)  it will send a message that reinforces the propaganda that falsely claim the United States is at war with Islam, read the letter by former government officials and experts. Welcoming Muslim refugees and travelers, by contrast, exposes the lies of terrorists and counters their warped vision, added the document dated Friday. Among the 134 signatories were some who served in either or both Republican and Democratic administrations were former senior diplomat Nicholas Burns, ex-National Security Council counter-terrorism director Richard Clarke and ex-undersecretary of defense Michele Flournoy.Watch what else is making news:Most served under Democratic presidents, including former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, former Homeland Security secretary Janet Napolitano, ex-national security advisor Susan Rice and ex-National Counterterrorism director Matthew Olsen.Their comments echo those being made in court by US states claiming the modified measures discriminate against Muslims and are detrimental to US interests.Bans like those included in this order are harmful to US national security and beneath the dignity of our great nation, the letter read. The executive order weakens this countrys ability to provide global leadership and jeopardizes our national security interests by failing to support the stability of our allies that are struggling to host large numbers of refugees, it added.The letter was also sent to Trumps Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Homeland Security chief John Kelly and Acting Director of National Intelligence Michael Dempsey.The revised directive temporarily closes US borders to all refugees and citizens from six mainly-Muslim countries. It denies US entry to all refugees for 120 days and halts for 90 days the granting of visas to nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The new order, unveiled Monday, is due to go into effect March 16 and replaces the previous Trump directive that was blocked in federal court.The blocked order included an indefinite Syrian refugee travel ban and its blacklist of barred countries included Iraq.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Express File Photo Indian Agricultural Research Institutes library building in New Delhi. Express File PhotoIn about a months time, Indian farmers are going to harvest their wheat crop that will mark the 50th year of the Green Revolution. The 1966-67 rabi season was when they first undertook large-scale planting of the new miracle high-yielding varieties on some 2,40,000 hectares. Key to the revolution was the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), whose scientists developed the package of practices for cultivation of the semi-dwarf wheat lines, initially imported from Mexico before breeding their own improved varieties, starting with Sonalika and Kalyan Sona in 1967. That very IARI today is without a regular director. It has, in fact, been without one for a good part of over two-and-a-half years. The last director to have served a full term,H S Gupta, retired on August 7, 2014. It took more than a year to appoint a successor. But even the new director Trilochan Mohapatra, who joined on August 28, 2015  he previously headed the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack, Odisha  was around for barely six months. On February 22, 2016, Mohapatra became director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). IARI has been headless since then.It reflects the neglect by the authorities of an institution that has contributed so much to our farmers. That this is happening when we are celebrating the golden jubilee of the Green Revolution makes it even more unfortunate, says Vijay Pal Singh, former programme leader (rice) at IARI and breeder of Pusa-1121, the blockbuster basmati variety that generates around $3 billion in annual export revenues for the country.From Kalyan Sona and Sonalika in the mid-sixties, IARI scientists went on to develop similarly successful wheat varieties such as HD-2285 (released for commercial cultivation in 1982), HD-2329 (1985), HD-2967 (2011) and HD-3086 (2014). While Kalyan Sona and Sonalika raised the wheat yield potential that many farmers harvested from 10-15 quintals to 45-50 quintals per hectare, these rose further to over 70 quintals with HD-2967 and HD-3086. The last two varieties would cover an estimated 14 million hectares or nearly half of the total area planted to wheat in India this year!But wheat apart, IARIs research fields have produced a host of widely-cultivated varieties also in rice (Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-44, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509), mustard (Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Pusa Mustard-25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30), chana (BG-256 and BG-362), vegetables (Pusa Ruby tomato, Pusa Purple Long brinjal and Pusa Sawani okra), and mango (Mallika and Amrapali). More recent breakthroughs include Pusa Double Zero Mustard-31 (the first ever canola-grade mustard containing low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates) and Pusa Arhar-16 (a promising early-maturing pigeon-pea that can yield 20 quintals per hectare in just 120 days and is, moreover, amenable to mechanical combine harvesting).Significantly, all this is from an institution with an annual budget of just over Rs 400 crore, which also covers salaries and other establishment expenses. There arent many research organisations in India that have had such a tangible impact on the ground with so little investment, claims Singh, whose breeding accomplishments in basmati rice won him the Padma Shri award in 2012. IARIs bane has been the overbearing control  on everything from administration and appointments to funding, travel and research collaboration approvals  imposed by ministers, bureaucrats and scientist-administrators sitting in Krishi Bhawan. Such direct involvement from the Agriculture Ministry may not have mattered during the Green Revolution period, when the person at the helm, Chidambaram Subramaniam, was somebody who knew the subject well and, equally important, had a direct line with the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.We were living ship-to-mouth those days and everybody recognised the importance of investing in agricultural research. A lot of attention was, therefore, paid to institutions such as IARI and it continued even in the decades that followed. No wonder, we had such illustrious directors, be it B P Pal, M S Swaminathan, A B Joshi, H K Jain and S K Sinha or R B Singh and S Nagarajan, notes Singh.According to him, things have changed in the last few years, when agriculture itself has ceased to be a priority amongst policymakers and we think we have become self-sufficient. That has bred not just complacency, but even negligence, manifested in Indias premier national institute for agricultural research and education not having a full-time director. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute currently has Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general (crop science) of ICAR, holding additional charge as its director. Prior to him, the officiating director was Ravinder Kaur, an agricultural physicist who heads IARIs water technology centre.The director of IARI should be someone with a good understanding of soil and water, besides biochemistry, genetics and breeding, plant pathology and entomology. I hope the government make the right choice and it is done soon. The present situation is sending a negative message to the younger generation of scientists, adds Singh.Many eminent farm scientists, both past and serving, The Indian Express spoke to felt that the time had come to insulate both IARI and its parent organisation ICAR from political/bureaucratic interference by bringing them under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. This is the case with the Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Atomic Energy, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Transferring administrative authority from Krishi Bhawan to the Prime Ministers office will make ICAR/IARI less vulnerable to ministerial whims and day-to-day interference. Moreover, it will help raise the profile of agricultural research to the level of space and atomic energy, while protecting the autonomy of institutions like IARI, they point out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
