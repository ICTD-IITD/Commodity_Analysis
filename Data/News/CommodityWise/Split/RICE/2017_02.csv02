The collectors were addressing a workshop organised for Warangal district seeds, fertilisers and pesticides dealers association members here on Wednesday.Batch number must in billsWarangal rural collector Prashanth Jeevan Patil made it clear that seeds, fertilisers and pesticides dealers would not be allowed to sell products without mentioning batch number in the bill. Every dealer has to mention the batch number of the product in the bill. If we come across violation, action will be taken, he warned.The government understands that seeds, fertilizers and pesticides are manufactured by companies and the dealers only sell them but the latter needs to enquire about the quality and credentials of the manufacturers, he said. Erstwhile Warangal district never faced this spurious seed problem, Patil said.Vendors may face tough time if they indulge in selling spurious fertilizers and seeds to farmers during sowing season. We should create confidence among the farmers that whatever they are getting is a genuine product, he said.Warangal urban collector Amrapali Kata said there was need for dealers to act responsibly and supply quality products to farmers. The collector said all the seeds, fertilisers and pesticides dealers have to sell through point of sale (PoS) as the Centre had made it mandatory.Warangal district seeds, fertilisers and pesticides dealers association president N Venkateshwar assured that his association members would follow all the norms strictly and supply quality products.Paddy farmers stage protest against delay in procurement of paddy in Nirmal, MancherialShortage of gunny bags and transportation vehicles from paddy procurement centres to rice millers in Nirmal and Mancherial districts is delaying the procurement process causing hardship to farmers.The farmers are forced to spend more than three days in the market yard to sell their paddy as the officials are delaying the procurement process in the name of gunny bag shortage.Last night, due to unseasonal rains in Khanapur mandal, all the paddy brought to market yard was damaged causing huge losses to farmers. The Sarjapur farmers staged rasta roko against the delay in procurement. They alleged that due to delay by the officials, their paddy got damaged in the rain."

There should be a control over the price rise,"" K Radhika, a housewife at Sivajipalem, said.K Varahalu, estate officer of MVP Rythu Bazaar told TOI, the rise in prices is due to a spike in demand due to increase in urban population.Visakhapatnam civil supplies officer Ch Ananda Kumar said, ""Rice millers usually less at a cheaper rate. But they do not have direct counters or rice mills in the city. Some of them have opened counters at Rythu Bazaars. The prices are higher in the city as compared with Visakhapatnam rural region.""Jangareddy Gudem in West Godavari reported the lowest price of superfine rice in the state.

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade were down 0.2 percent at $3.67 a bushel, after earlier touching their weakest since May 10 at $3.66-1/2 a bushel. Corn closed down 0.9 percent in the previous session. * The most active soybean futures rose 0.1 percent to $9.66 a bushel, having firmed 0.2 percent on Monday. * The most active wheat futures fell 0.35 percent to 4.21-3/4 a bushel, near the session low of $4.21-1/4 a bushel - the weakest since April 25. Wheat closed down 2.2 percent in the previous session. * The USDA said the U.S. corn crop was 71 percent planted, just ahead of the five-year average of 70 percent and above the average analyst estimate in a Reuters poll of 68 percent. * Improved U.S. weather in recent days helped corn planting in the Midwest, although showers will return this week. * The USDA said soybean planting was 32 percent complete, matching the five-year average and above the average expectation of 28 percent in the Reuters poll. * Wheat prices were pressured by abundant global supplies. MARKET NEWS * The dollar traded near a one-week low versus a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, having come under pressure after a surprisingly soft U.S. manufacturing report. * Oil jumped 2 percent to its highest in more than three weeks on Monday, topping $52 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia said that supply cuts need to last into 2018, a step towards extending an OPEC-led deal to support prices for longer than first agreed. * The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq notched record closing highs on Monday, powered by demand for technology stocks after a global cyber attack and by rising oil prices.

City cops said they had arrested only Mahesh, while the others including Mahesh's father were called for interrogation. City police commissioner T Yoganand told media persons here on Monday that according to income tax department officials, over Rs 800 crore was funnelled out of the country from a single account in a public sector bank in Kolkata in 2016 before the demonetisation drive. After the demonetisation, small amounts were transacted from 30 accounts in various banks under the name of 12 shell companies. The case was handed over to the AP CID as the city cops do not have the required machinery to investigate the case.""In view of various events that will be held in the next three months and also the lack of an economic offences wing in the city, we have handed over the case to the AP CID,"" the CP said.The case also involves coordinating with other national and international investigating agencies including the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence. The case was unearthed by I-T department led by income tax joint director (investigations) MVN Seshu Bhavanarayana.Yoganand said after interrogating Mahesh for a day, it came to light that a few businessmen from north India were also involved in the scam. During interrogation, Mahesh reportedly claimed that the companies were under invoicing prices of imported rice cookers, alcohol and cigarettes to evade customs duty, Yoganand said.The FIR filed by the I-T department stated that Mahesh and others had opened 12 shell companies and were operating 30 dubious accounts that remitted about Rs 1,300 crore since 2013 to five foreign companies in China, Singapore and Hong Kong to purchase customised software with the help of forged documents. As per the IT department's preliminary investigation, Mahesh has opened many proprietary concerns or partnership firms in the names of his employees to facilitate transfer of funds and reported turnovers. The analysis of the bank accounts pertaining to the accused indicates total inward domestic remittance of Rs 680.94 crore. Of this, Rs 569.93 crore was remitted to five foreign companies for the purchase of customised software. But no software was ever purchased from these companies."

Known for his pioneering work in developing wheat varieties from the Mexican strains brought to India in the 1960s, he worked closely with other stalwart farm scientists like Nobel laureate Norman Ernest Borlaug, Professor M S Swaminathan, former director general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Prof Khem Singh Gill.Prof Athwal was the founder and head of department of plant breeding at Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). He is known for contributions to the genetics and breeding of pearl millet, wheat, gram and tobacco.Prof Khem Singh said, ""I met him in 1951 in Jalandhar in the department of cereals, cotton and oil seeds as at that time the PAU was not established. Athwal came from Australia and joined as an assistant researcher. I was already working in the department as an assistant researcher. He was a very good researcher and also a very good human being. Both of us later joined PAU when it was established in 1962.""Remembering him as a rare breed of dedicated farm scientists who led by example, another former V-C of PAU Prof Kirpal Singh Aulakh said, ""We don't get such men today. He was intelligent and extremely hard working at the same time. I remember Prof Athwal visiting the research farms on a bicycle without caring about anything from 1962 to 1964 when I was pursuing M Sc from PAU. His focus was really inspiring for young agriculture science students like us, back then.""In a press release issued by the PAU, V-C B S Dhillon stated, ""Athwal developed world's first grain pearl millet hybrid 'Hybrid Bajra 1' in 1965 that heralded a new era in cultivation of this important crop,"" he said.Prof Athwal was instrumental in developing 'PV 18' in 1966 and the most popular amber grained wheat variety 'Kalyansona' in 1967, named after the village 'Kalyanpur' in Punjab where Athwal was born in 1928.A large number of genetic stocks developed by him made a significant contribution to future research on bajra breeding and genetics. He joined the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Manila (Philippines) in 1967, and served as its first deputy director general. At IRRI, he introduced many innovations in rice breeding."

On Monday, dumping of meat near Bamhni village in the range caused flutter among local residents.Sources said panic gripped villagers when a section of them found six sacks filled with meat dumped in bushes on the roadside nullah. The spot is 4km away from where Srinivas (T10) was electrocuted. Electrocution of wild animals is rampant in the rice belt.""Initially, we suspected it to be a case of murder, but after opening one of the bags, it was found to be animal meat,"" said villagers.The meat, around 250kg, was filled in empty plastic sacks of fertilizers. ""Villagers suspect it to be meat of some wild animal and must have been dumped by poachers,"" forest department sources said.Nagbhid RFO RM Talande denied that the meat was of wild animals. ""We had sent our men at the spot and found that the meat was basically intestines of some domestic animal,"" said Talande.However, villagers said it was meat as dogs were feasting on it. The policemen who visited the spot too did not collect any samples to verify the facts.Villagers said forest officials, who should have collected samples for forensic tests, left the matter to police and did not take any cognisance.Nagbhid PI BD Madavi did not respond to the repeated calls made to him.

FUNDAMENTALS * The most active soybean futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade fell 0.1 percent to $9.75 a bushel, having firmed 1.1 percent on Tuesday when prices hit a high of $9.77-1/4 a bushel - the highest since May 10. * The most active corn futures fell 0.1 percent to $3.67-1/4 a bushel, having closed unchanged in the previous session. * The most active wheat futures fell 0.5 percent to $4.22 a bushel, having closed up 0.2 percent on Tuesday. * The USDA said on Tuesday that private exporters reported the sale of 132,000 tonnes of soybeans for delivery to unknown destinations during the 2016/17 marketing year. * The USDA said on Monday that the U.S. corn crop was 71 percent planted as of May 15, up from only 47 percent the previous week and above analysts' estimates of 68 percent in a Reuters poll. MARKET NEWS * The dollar nursed its losses on Wednesday after taking a combination of punches - solid eurozone economic data, a fall in U.S. yields on heightened turmoil in Washington and downbeat housing data that reduced expectations of a Federal Reserve rate hike next month. * Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after data showed an increase in U.S. crude inventories, stoking concerns that markets remain oversupplied despite efforts by top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut output. * The S&P 500 and the Dow ended Tuesday's session flat after mixed economic data and retail earnings, while the Nasdaq had another record close with help from technology stocks.

Corn and wheat also eased on plentiful supplies, with additional pressure from investors cutting risk exposure as the U.S. political crisis appeared to deepen. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active soybean contract fell 1 percent to $9.65-3/4 a bushel by 0319 GMT after closing marginally lower on Wednesday. Corn lost 0.7 percent to $3.68-3/4 a bushel, having gained 1 percent in the previous session. Wheat gave up 0.4 percent to $4.25-1/2 a bushel, having closed up 0.6 percent the day before. ""The Brazilian crop is getting bigger, we hear everyday people increasing their estimates. The top-end of the estimate is around 113 million tonnes, which is huge,"" said one agricultural commodities analyst. ""There is no reason for soybeans to rally. We also have risk-off trade because of the U.S. political crisis."" Asian stocks fell on Thursday and the dollar was stuck near six-month lows against a basket of currencies as uncertainty mounted over U.S. President Donald Trump's future following reports that he allegedly tried to interfere with a federal investigation. Soybeans were weighed down by a weaker Brazilian real, which is expected encourage farmers to sell their ample supplies. The currency eased after a six-session advance that had discouraged growers from selling their dollar-denominated stocks. On the physical front, trade news supported U.S. wheat. Egypt's main state wheat buyer purchased two cargoes of U.S. hard red winter wheat in an international tender along with cargoes from Romania, Ukraine and Russia. Egypt's General Authority for Supply Commodities said it bought a total of 295,000 tonnes of wheat. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn and wheat futures contracts on Wednesday and small net sellers in soybeans, traders said.

The reason is that the conditions a crop is grown in are, for the most part, far from optimum for it.Comparative data shows that the average per-hectare yield for major crops is substantially lower than their genetic potential , or the productivity that a crop is programmed for by nature when the conditions are just right for it.Data shows that the difference in productivity between parts of the state that have the highest yield for a particular crop and the ones with the lowest yield is very high, indicating a need to have a re-look at the cropping pattern in the state.Take rice, the genetic potential of which is 4,000 kg per hectare while the state average is 1,867 kg. The highest yield of 3,572 kg is recorded in traditional rice belts like the Konkan but the lowest stands at 641 kg, a yawning gap.Such a high difference in the productivity of a major crop shows that its cultivation in many parts of the state is done in conditions that are not favourable for it.Experts say that the key reasons for the gap between the productivity on the ground and the full potential of a crop are a lack of research-based inputs for farmers, old and redundant practices, absence of innovation, unavailability of assured irrigation facilities, small land holdings and non-adoption of a cropping pattern that is best suited to the geographical parameters of a particular area.The average yield of tur in the state is 695 kg per hectare when the genetic potential is 5,000 kg. Yet, the state remains one of the largest tur producers, enough to cause a glut this year and send prices crashing.The tur phenomenon is an illustration of low-productivity practices employed on a large scale to increase production  a waste of resources  instead of raising yield to achieve the same.Even the water-guzzling sugarcane , which caused a lot of debate during the 2015 drought, suffers from low productivity  though it remains popular as a cash crop with near-assured returns.The state has an average of 7.5 lakh hectares under sugarcane at an average productivity of 830 quintals per hectare against the genetic potential of 3,500 quintals.Experts say low yield is one of the key reasons why most farms are loss-making in the state.""It is unfortunate that research in the agricultural sector in the state has been completely neglected for years now,"" a retired vice-chancellor of an agricultural university said. ""None of the four agriculture universities in the state have a research director. More than 40% seats in these universities are vacant. There is a need to look at the cropping pattern of the state. There are many regions which are wasting time and money in growing crops that will not have much yield there due to geographical and weather-related parameters, but none of the universities give any such research-based inputs to the farmers.""Officials from the agriculture department said they had chalked out a detailed working plan to increase production.""The idea is to reduce the farm input costs by providing subsidies for everything that a farmer needs,"" an official said."

An offence has been registered at Wadi police station.Police said Betibai was approached by the unidentified woman when she was alone at home. The woman, claiming to possess spiritual power, wanted Betibai to hand her over some rice grains. Posing as if uttering some prayers, the stranger voiced a so-called prophecy stating that Betibai's son would land in trouble soon. In order to dodge the ill-luck, the woman claimed that she has to perform some rituals for which Betibai's silver ornaments would be required. After performing some tricks in the name of the rituals, the woman also charged Rs400 as donation for her efforts from Betibai before sneaking away.Betibai, left bamboozled, had stayed mum for couple of days before her landlord, a doctor, came to know about the incident.

Corn faced a weekly decline after closing almost unchanged last week, although losses were limited by concerns over excessive moisture in parts of the U.S. Midwest. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active soybean contract has given up 1.4 percent this week, the biggest weekly decline since the end of March. Corn is down almost 1 percent, the first weekly slide in a month, and wheat has lost about 1 percent, taking two-week losses to about 3.2 percent. On Friday, all three markets were trading around half a percent higher. ""The Brazilian real's fall precipitated the fall (in prices) as it directly cuts the competitiveness of U.S. soybeans against those from Brazil,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""Brazilian farmers have reportedly jumped at the chance to sell their soybeans at somewhat higher prices."" Soybeans were under pressure as the Brazilian real slumped following corruption allegations against the country's President Michael Temer. A weaker real may encourage farmers to accelerate sales to earn more money for their crop. Brazil just completed its largest-ever soy harvest, estimated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at 111.6 million tonnes. But farmers had sold only about half of it by early May, compared with the five-year average of 65 percent. On Thursday, farmers were selling beans that had been locked up in storage bins for weeks because the currency's strength had weighed on prices. The sales will likely shift the attention of global soybean importers away from the United States. There was some supportive news for the soybean market from Argentina. Rains expected in the coming week in Argentina could delay soybean harvesting in some areas and threaten to reduce yields, the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange said in a report on Thursday. The USDA reported export sales of U.S. wheat in the latest reporting week at 640,600 tonnes, including old and new marketing years combined, topping a range of trade expectations.

In the localised version, JD(S) will host `rotti and mudde pe charcha' in the state. Another idea is to run Namma Appaji canteens, named after JD(S) leader Deve Gowda and similar to the subsidised Karnataka state government's Indira canteens and Tamil Nadu 's Amma canteens for the urban poor.""Admittedly, the euphoria created by Modi's chai pe char cha cannot be ignored. We are keen to emulate the successful model by serving piping hot afternoon meals while debating the relevance of regional parties and the failures or successes of national parties,"" JD(S) deputy floor leader YSV Datta told TOI.Datta said the programme will be called `Karnataka's pride: rotti and mudde pe charcha on regional parties' relevance' (Karnataka asmithe: rotti mathu mudde mele pradeshika pakshagala mele charche). The programme will take off from June, with the sessions to be held at the village, taluk and town levels. Local MLAs, leaders and JD(S) chiefs H D Kumaraswamy and Deve Gowda will participate.""Anyone can participate.We expect it to be a debate and not jingoism. They can be for or against JD(S) and regional parties,"" said Datta. The gathering will have 50 people and mudde and rotti will be sponsored by local JD(S) leaders.In honour of his mentor Deve Gowda, JD(S) MLC and businessman T A Saravana has plans to set up canteens serving subsidized food similar to the Indira canteens in Karnataka.""The first of the Appaji canteens will be opened in Basavanagudi in a month.The canteen will operate between 8am and 3pm, and serve idli-vada and khali dosa at Rs 5 per plate. Lunch will cost Rs 10 per plate of variety rice and mudde with soppukalu saar,"" said Saravana."

But, seeing people waiting in long queues for darshan, I have given strict instructions to regulate tourists' inflow in Rishikesh itself.""As religious gurus Murari Bapu and Swami Avdeshanand having their discourses lined up at Kedarnath, the minister asked them to make their own arrangements for tents and food.""Murari Bapu and Swami Avdeshanand have huge following, and thousands of people will come along with them, but there is an arrangement for lodging of only 4,000 pilgrims at Kedarnath. So, I have asked the gurus to make arrangements for food and accommodations on their own, whereas the state government will be able to provide just little.""He said, soon arrangements would be made for disabled people to get inside Char Dham temples.

Its managing director Sudhir Kumar Dhingra termed Thursday's ceremony a significant day for the textile industry in eastern India.""When we met the chief minister last year, he wanted a labour intensive industrial sector which can stop the migration of state's unemployed youth,"" Dhingra said. Drawing comparison to the textile industry of Bangladesh, Dhingra said the industry, if nurtured well, can give competition to Bangladesh.The Medicant Group of Hospital (Bokaro Sewa Trust) got land to set up a 500-bed hospital in Bokaro at a net worth of Rs 150 crore. Its managing director Majid said, ""We have hospitals in New Delhi, NCR and Jammu & Kashmir. But unlike other states we got everything here on a single plate. What surprised us was the pace at which roads were built here to improve connectivity between cities.""Entrepreneurs from the food processing sector also sounded upbeat. Uttar Pradesh-based rice bran oil manufacturer Chandra Prakash Agarwal said, ""Investors with smaller capitals are always looked down in other states. However in Jharkhand, the chief minister himself took the initiative of laying the foundation stone of our plant (in Ranchi). In other states, CMs only lay foundation stones of public-sector projects.""The positive feedback from the entrepreneurs will help the state government to build on its new image of an investor-friendly state in future, officers of the state industries department said. ""The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted with the objective of assuring investors that the government is committed to promises it made at the summit,"" an officer said.The ground-breaking ceremony was envisaged by the Das government as a confidence building measure among the investors who inked memoranda of understanding (MOU) worth Rs 3.1 lakh crore. The Das government went into overdrive soon after completion of the summit. The CM directed senior officers of the department to provide land and environmental clearances to several projects within six months. Senior officers went around hunting for land in the outskirts of Ranchi and zeroed in on 150 acres of land in Oremanjhi, Nagri and Tupudana areas."

By pillaigal, she refers to the 250 dogs at her shelter at Selvapuram, Veerapandi Panchayat in the outskirts of the city. Meet the dog lady of Coimbatore, who has been instrumental in rescuing and protecting dogs for over a decade. They say dogs are a man's best friend, but at this shelter perhaps, Geetha Rani is the best friend of the canines. Her story was recently captured in a documentary titled Kaani Nilam Vendum by a Coimbatore-based filmmaker.Sharing her journey, Geetha Rani tells CT, ""I had an unhappy childhood. My parents belonged to two different castes and their families didn't accept them. I grew up devoid of love and affection. It was the dogs in the family that showered their love on me. I spent a lot of time playing with them and soon, developed an intense liking for them. I had decided then that when I grew up, I would do something for them.""Geetha stuck to her promise and began this shelter for abandoned, rescued and injured dogs. ""To begin with, I had only 30 dogs. I found this vacant land in the outskirts of the city and moved in with my 'children'. The number of dogs gradually began to increase. When the number crossed 100, my well-wishers asked to me to approach the government for help to run the shelter. My one-acre shelter is a rented property and hence, I have been approaching government officials to provide me a piece of land where I can take care of the animals.""Her day begins with cleaning the premises after which she prepares food for them. ""I cook around 60 kg of rice every day. Their food predominantly comprises rice, bread and biscuits. I feed them by 10 am after which they go to sleep. I then step out to shop for groceries. I feed the same food in the evening. The dogs are regularly cleaned, de-wormed and kept free of ticks and fleas.""Geetha Rani has a small team that helps run the chores at her shelter. ""Right from rescuing a dog, to feeding, vaccinating and sterilizing them, we do everything on our own. As soon as we receive a rescue call, we rush to the location, irrespective of the time. We have a van for the rescue act. If the dog has severe injuries, we take it to the vet for treatment, after which we bring it the shelter. But sadly, the number of rescued dogs has only been increasing. We try to give away the dogs for adoption but there are still few takers for female dogs and native breeds. They continue to stay with me.""She adds, ""When people come to me with a rescued dog, I ask them for a small donation that can aid in the welfare of the dog and most of the times, they are happy to help. I take care of the rest from my own pocket. We ensure that all dogs are neutered and vaccinated."" But what irks Geetha Rani is the way certain people treat dogs. ""I do not understand why would anyone pelt stones at a dog or beat it? Why can't we just co-exist?"""

This could be a threat to the nation's food security , according to the experts, Hari K Nagarajan, professor RBI chair in Rural Economics, IRMA, G Pazhanithurai, Rajiv Gandhi Chair for Panchayati Raj Studies, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Anirudh Tagat, senior researcher, Monk Prayogshala, Mumbai, who conducted the study .The scheme is implemented in all the districts in states and union territories. Official statistics reveal that MGNREGS has a cumulative generation of 2235.93 crore person days and a total expenditure of `3,70,667 crore.As on date 67,33,214 workers are expected to be working in 4,42,385 sites across the country .The study took into account 48,000 households and 100,000 individuals belonging to 104 villages in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan for their study.They found that the adverse impacts of the scheme would include decrease in agriculture and decline in crop incomes by 15 per cent in these states. Already , there is a decline in the availability of skilled farm labour.The data showed that the workers of this scheme were likely to opt for skilled work, which would have a significant adverse implication on the employment generation in rural India. The probability of an average farmer in Tamil Nadu finding skilled labour to work in paddy fields was as high as 85 per cent, as skill levels had declined in places where MGNREGS was implemented.Also, panchayats spend more time on implementing the MGNREGS with the result that the time spent on core functions like planning and service provision had de clined by 75 per cent in the past six to eight years. Hence it was affecting the concept of panchayat raj.Women, however, have seen the positive impact of the scheme. Financial inclusion has significantly strengthened with women opening their own bank accounts without relying on their male counterparts, leading to relaxation in their budget constraints.Women have also spearheaded efforts to create common property resources like fruit orchards in villages using the income from the scheme. There are also seeking information about market price and acquiring gold and silver more.In Tamil Nadu where the government has provided free goats, the scheme has resulted in the animals becoming herds and all families owning them.Herd owners have withdrawn from agriculture and are ready to participate in agricultural activities only for a premium wage. Hence, given the current status, the far mers would have no option but to reduce the acreage or leave the land fallow, which could seriously affect food security and impact prices.Even as the MGNREGS is here to stay the state governments are adopting various strategies to keep the voters interested. They have suggested that the policy makers and bureaucrats ensure that failure in coordination is removed and that incentives and capacity building be given greater focus. The model agriculture produce market committee (APMC) act had to be implemented so that farmers could innovate. Panchayat raj institutions had to be strengthened, the states say."

The academic session for state board schools in city, where MDM is served, will begin from either June 26 or 27. The task for Waghmare will definitely be tough because there are over 2,000 schools in district serving MDM and the staff dedicated for this task is less than a dozen. As per MDM guidelines, the primary responsibility for checking the food lies with the school's principal.Waghmare said, ""Safety of children is our main goal and we will ensure that they get good quality food as per the guidelines. Nagpur district has lakhs of students benefiting from the MDM scheme and it is a huge responsibility. I am drawing up plans to ensure that random checks will be held in schools on a regular basis.""In city, schools get raw rice in bulk quantity from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns based on requisition sent to Waghmare's office. The rice is delivered directly to school campus by contracted transporter. But other items like pulses, vegetables, oil and spices have to be purchased by schools and then the bill is reimbursed by ZP.In the last two years there have been only two cases of food poisoning reported in the district. Waghmare said, ""Starting surprise checks does not mean that we are accusing anybody in particular. It's just a method of double checking how things are being implemented at the ground level. We will act both on information received from public and random geographical selection of schools.""He added that neglecting to adhere to guidelines is considered a serious problem. Waghmare said, ""This puts the lives of hundreds of kids in danger, so we are looking at a major problem. In food poisoning cases anyway the police get involved and we also conduct a separate inquiry into the incident."""

Some other terrestrial animals, which are endangered or vulnerable and rarely spotted include scaly ant-eaters or pangolin, a nocturnal primate called Slow Loris, Indian mouse deer, snakes like the King Cobra and species of the felidae family such as fishing cats and rusty spotted cats,"" said wildlife conservationist and president of Eastern Ghats Wildlife Society Kantimahanti Murthy.Adding to the list of near-extinct species, curator of Indira Gandhi Zoo Park Vijaya Kumar said, ""The bison (Indian Gaur), salt water crocodile, water monitor lizard, palm civets, Asiatic wild dogs, barking deer, hog deer and chausinga are some of the animals facing extinction.""It's not just the mammals, reptiles and birds, but the marine fauna too has shown signs of becoming extinct. AU professor of zoology DE Babu said, ""Since the last two decades, two species of commercially valued fish have gone totally extinct. These are saw-headed fish and another of the hilsa category called Tenualosa Toli. Over-exploitation and offshore oil exploration in the East and West Godavari basin might have led the juveniles to migrate. Even horse shoe crab are nearing extinction.""There are other marine creatures like white shark, striped tiger shark, rice paddy eel, electric ray, soft corals like zoanthus, which are highly endangered as well. ""Some of these have dwindled by more than 80% from the river ecosystem of Vizag, Srikakulam, East and West Godavari,"" added the zoologist."

The number will be accessed by a state-level officer. The complaints will be forwarded to the designated officer (DO) of the food safety department in respective districts. Thereafter, the food safety officer (FSO) of the taluk will receive the complaints on his smart phone and will start an inquiry.Though the number was officially released by the district administration on Monday, it had already received a few complaints from Trichy. A complaint about inferior quality biscuits was one of the complaints received recently on the number.The purpose of introducing a dedicated WhatsApp number for receiving complaints is to reduce the time gap between the date of filing the complaint and the action taken on it, said officials.They said the volume of complaints received is likely to increase as people become familiar with the number. People can lodge complaints about inferior quality of the food and food products, use of carbide stones for ripening mangoes, sale of commodities beyond the expiry date, and manufacturing date or expiry date missing on the label, among others.Officials said that adulteration of edible oil is a worrying trend in the district. This involves mixing of rice bran oil or palm oil with gingelly oil.Meanwhile, designated officers in all districts in the state have been ordered to submit a compiled report on action taken on complaints received on the number."

Wheat rose to a two-week high as strong demand and forecast of heavy rains in U.S. crop growing areas underpinned the market. The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active corn contract was up 0.3 percent at $3.73-3/4 a bushel as of 0323 GMT, after climbing to its highest since May 10 at $3.74 a bushel. Soybeans gained 0.5 percent to $9.58 a bushel, having firmed 0.9 percent on Friday. Wheat added 0.7 percent to $4.38-1/4 a bushel, near the session high of $4.39-1/4 a bushel - the highest since May 8. Wheat closed up 2.2 percent on Friday. ""Bad weather is continuing to delay U.S. planting of corn and soybeans,"" said Kaname Gokon from Tokyo brokerage Okato Shoji. ""There is lot of rain and cold weather in the Midwest."" Corn in some areas of the Midwest will need reseeding due to flooding and poor crop emergence, but farmers are running out of time. Corn planted after mid-May begins to lose yield potential. Soybeans and corn were under pressure last week amid a slump in the Brazilian real, which saw farmers rush to sell their record supplies. Wheat draws support as forecasts for rains across the United States stoke fears of production losses. Export sales of U.S. wheat in a weekly U.S. government report on Thursday topped trade expectations, and Egypt's main state grain buyer purchased U.S. wheat. Still, the Egyptian government's first purchase of U.S. wheat in more than two years was a stopgap measure to ensure it had enough supplies until offerings from its favoured sources in the Black Sea region were more readily available. The condition of French soft wheat declined slightly last week, with 75 percent of crops rated good or excellent as of May 15, down from 76 percent a week earlier, farm office FranceAgriMer said on Friday.

With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"

But, until few decades ago, the jackfruit tree in the backyard was the family's prized possession, and ripening of the fruit was much awaited.In Goa, a number of traditional delicacies are prepared from jackfruits. The flesh of this fruit is a good source of dietary fiber, which makes it easily digestible. It is considered to be an instant source of energy due to presence of electrolytes, besides being a source of various other nutrients.That is why, people in various parts of India use jackfruits while preparing chips, dessert, dosas, pancakes, puddings, idlis, appams, jams, even, tea-time snacks.In Goa, jackfruit is used to prepare the still-popular 'phanasache dhonas' (steamed rice cake flavoured with jackfruit pulp), and the phanasachi god bhakari is a delicacy popular even today in rural areas.Goa produces two popular varieties of jackfruit  a slightly hard inner flesh of the ripe fruit, which is known as 'kapo phanas', and the other variety; when the inner flesh of the ripe fruit is very soft is called 'rasal phanas'.To prepare 'godachi bhakar', one needs the flesh from 'rasal phanas'. After applying coconut oil on the hands to protect against the gummy sap inside the jackfruit, one has to cut the ripe jackfruit into two halves and separate the flesh of the fruit. This edible part is ground into pulp and roasted with par-boiled rice and palm jaggery until there's a thick paste left. To this mixture, grated coconut, pieces of roasted groundnut, and cardamom are added. This entire concoction is then steamed for about half hour in pot or a cooker.After cooling the 'godachi bhakar' for a short time, it is ready to be served. Sangeeta Sutar from Hankhane, Pernem, says, ""We still relish the delicious 'phansachi god-bhakar', as a seasonal delicacy prepared as relief from the hot and humid climate."""
59355d327be9e061b17371d9,The summer vacations are here again,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/the-summer-vacations-are-here-again/articleshow/58772094.cms,2017-05-21,"By- Partha Sarthi Sen SharmaSummer days are here again. For anybody who has spent his childhood in the North Indian plains, the two abiding memories of his summer perhaps would be the deliciously awaited mangoes and summer vacations.In the peak of summer afternoons, when going out was prohibited by the grown-ups, one remembers the greedy, slurpy helpings of delicious Dussehries and Langdas, all floating in a bucket of water, in verandas that were cocooned with 'chiks'. Just like now, there was a short span of a few weeks when the fruit vendors and bazaars were overwhelmed with a virtual glut of delicious and soft yellow Dussehries and greenish yellow Langdas. Yes, there were others, the Alphonsoes and the Totaparis and a couple of weeks later the Ratauls but delicious as they were, they had their niche fans-like the Talat Mahmoods and Hemant Kumars but the Dussehries and Langdas were the Rafi and Kishore--the bread and butter delicacies of everyday. Nothing could beat the sheer pleasure of sucking on a mango and then peeling and devouring its insides with sticky fingers.Cutting them into pieces and using spoon and fork was reserved only for the occasional guests. An mango shake was a delicacy alright but it lacked the easy spontaneity of eating a mango in its natural form.The other memory of those distant summers is that of the much awaited school vacations. I still remember that due to some strange reason, my government school had a vacation of 50 days, till the last week of June, while all the other schools used to enjoy vacation till early July. The pain of going to school in those last weeks of June, year after year, when my sister could still enjoy 10 more days of summer vacation, rankles to this day! Mostly, most of my friends and we would stay in our homes for large parts of those vacations, even when none of us had ever heard of terms like `staycation'. This was partly because the father didn't have summer vacation, unless he was a school teacher himself, and also because of the money that was required to go for an extended holiday anywhere. In those days, going on vacation usually meant going to a grandparent's house, maternal or paternal, sure in the belief that the grandchildren would always be welcomed with open arms.So, we would be travelling on the Delhi-Howrah Rajdhani Express chair-car to Kolkata. In those days, the Rajdhani Express ran only to Kolkata and Mumbai.They were, unlike today, the acknowledged pride of the Indian Railways and had a chair-car for an 18-hour journey. The plush coaches with piped music and covered tube lights, attendants in sharp uniforms, tea served in thermos, foil-wrapped chapatis and rice and chicken curry were a class apart. I can still feel the tingle of excitement, re membering how we used to await the journey, standing at the platform of New Delhi railway station, amid the din and heat and dust, waiting for the coaches to arrive. The thought of discomfort of sitting through an 18-hour journey never crossed our tiny minds. We just couldn't imagine anything more in those days and you can't miss what you can't even imagine! Today, too, the summer vacations have started, not for me, but for my daughter and perhaps one would go for a short trip in air-conditioned vehicles to one of the overrated hill stations, stay for a few days in an overpriced hotel and perhaps even enjoy it but the excitement of those childhood summer vacations, with their mango-filled aroma, long train journeys and chik-covered verandas would always remain with me as the most cherished of memories!(The writer is a Lucknow enthusiast and an IAS officer.

The raths are fitted with audio systems.The raths would cover all the 42,378 revenue villages of the state. The function, 'Kharif Mahaabhiyan-cum-Mahotsav 2017' was held on the premises of Samvad at CM Secretariat. Agriculture minister Ram Vichar Rai , department's principal secretary Sudhir Kumar and other senior officials gave company to the CM.Every rath has plywood boards which display the written details of the schemes, which the farmers can make use of during the 2017-18 Kharif cropping season. The raths are backed by audio systems which play songs and also present a narrative about the agriculture department's schemes, apart from CM Nitish Kumar's stress on use of improved farming techniques, high-yield variety of seeds and his appeal to farmers to enlist themselves to grow seeds for various Kharif crops with an eye on increased productivity of land and overall augmented production of foodgrain.The motorised raths, which will stop at nodal points in the districts concerned, will cover all the 533 blocks and over 8,700 panchayats. Besides, the training of select farmers in Kharif crop cultivation would be held at camps in two to four blocks in every district. Agriculture seed kits and equipment would also be distributed among the farmers.Overall, the state government has fixed the target of 34.45 lakh hectare paddy coverage, which is expected to yield 106.30 lakh metric tonne of rice at 30.86 quintal per hectare productivity during the 2017-18 Kharif season. The expected rice production during the last season was round 80 lakh MT.Similarly, the maize coverage target during 2017-18 has been kept at 4.46 lakh hectare with the expected yield of 15.26 lakh MT at 34.6 quintal per hectare productivity. The target for pulses coverage is 1.5 lakh hectare with the expected production of 1.79 lakh MT and 11.31 quintal per hectare productivity."

The accused shopkeepers not only assaulted and humiliated the two children, but also recorded their acts on mobile phones.Shockingly, the incident took place in front of a crowd, but none came forward to stop them. Acting on a complaint by the mother of one of the boys, the Hill Line police in the suburb later arrested Mehmood Pathan (62), and his sons Irfan, 26, and Salim, 22. The trio was booked under Indian Penal Code sections 355 for assault, 500 for defamation and 323 for injury, and also under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. They were produced before a court in Kalyan on Sunday which remanded them to a day's police custody till Monday.The incident took place when the boys were playing near their home in Prem Nagar area in Ulhasnagar. They walked up to the neighbourhood sweet shop owned by Mehmood and stole a packet of 'chaklis', a pretzel-like snack made of rice flour, and fled.Police said Mehmood who saw them shoplifting, asked his sons to teach them a lesson. Irfan and Salim caught both children and dragged them towards the shop. The duo shaved a part of their heads and then took their footwear and strung it around them. Finally they stripped the children and paraded them on the street.Salim recorded the acts on his phone while Irfan slapped both several times . The clip went viral on social media.Police said when the mother of one of the minors, who works as a domestic help in Ghatkopar, returned in the evening, she was shocked to see the child in such a state.Along with the parent of the other child, who was initially reluctant to press charges, she filed a complaint.Mohan Waghmare, senior police inspector of Hill Line station, said, ""Late Saturday night, our team arrested them and on Sunday, they were produced before a holiday court which gave one day's police custody.""Speaking to TOI, Rajesh's mother lamented that, ""when the two children were paraded on the street, there were many people on the road, but no one stopped them.""

Neighbours say the tribal couple and their children haven't been around for the past week. Among the poorest families in Dakhin Kotia Jote village, the Mahalis seem to have been caught in a political crossfire ever since they hosted BJP president Amit Shah for lunch last month.Within a few days, they joined the Trinamool Congress , to much controversy. Now they are being protected, much like prized footballers by overzealous club officials in 1980s Calcutta. Two men in uniform stand guard 24x7, and within minutes of TOI reaching the spot, an assistant sub-inspector arrives on the scene. Interestingly, this game of one-upmanship is being played by two political parties who have no claim to Naxalbari's fiery history or indelible memory.Shah's choice of Naxalbari as the launchpad of BJP's ambitious expansion plan is not random. Exactly 50 years ago in the summer of 1967, these picturesque parts of Darjeeling district became an open-air theatre for the struggle of peasants and tea garden workers against the oppression of jotedars (rich peasants). Even today, the name Naxalbari endures in the collective imagination as the motherlode of radical Red politics in India. An entire lexicon (Naxal, Naxalite, Naxalism) has been coined around it.A lot has changed in Naxalbari since that heady summer of discontent. The statue that welcomes a visitor isn't of Charu Mazumdar, Kanu Sanyal or Jangal Santhal, the trio who led that movement, but of Suresh Chhetri, a Kargil braveheart martyred in the Dras sector in 1999.The bazaar, the kasbah's bustling heart, reflects Naxalbari's new aspirations. Apart from shops selling mobiles and talk-time, there's a liquor store that stocks premium brands such as Teachers, Antiquity, Signature, and that favourite of '70s Bollywood villains, Vat 69. ""We also sell Sula wine,"" says shop owner Joginder Prasad. The popular bakery outlet Mio Amore offers black forest pastries, chocolate dollops and chicken croissants. There's even a tattoo parlour, 'A Touch of Ink, where you can get 3D or Japanese tattoos.But nothing reveals the changing Naxalbari better than the spiraling land rates. NH-31, which runs parallel to the kasbah, is being widened. Rice mills and petrol pumps are being set up. ""New well-heeled settlers from Manipur and other parts of North-East are buying land.Not long ago you could buy one bigha (1,333 sqm) of land for Rs 3 lakh. Now you get only one katha (67 sqm) for the same price,"" says Bhimraj Chhetri, who runs a small restaurant. One bigha is 20 kathas.The new Naxalbari, it seems, is in the midst of a torrid affair with materialism.And it isn't of the dialectical kind.The area's demographics have changed and, consequently, its politics. Locals say that in the 1960s, the surrounding villages mainly had adivasis, Rajbonshis (a scheduled caste), and Nepalis who collectively formed the spine of the radical Left struggle. The relatively better-off Bangladeshis and Manipuris are the new settlers, with a smattering of Biharis.""They didn't shift homes to partici pate in radical politics,"" says a shop keeper from Prasadojot village.Electorally, the far-Left is a token presence in the SC-re served Matigara-Naxalbari as sembly seat. In 2016, they didn't even put up a candidate. To get a rough idea, in adjacent Phan sidewa, a reserved seat for STs, CPI (ML-Liberation) candidate Lalu Oraon got 1,596 or.88% of the votes. In Matigara-Naxalbari, Congressman Sankar Malakar (backed by CPM) retained the seat polling 41% votes. TMC got 32% while BJP's vote share leapfrogged to 21%, almost a 500% jump from its 2011 tally of 4.4%. Overall, BJP got 10.2% votes in Bengal . The saffron party holds one of 26 panchayat seats in Naxalbari. Dakhin Kotia Jote, where Shah came to lunch with the Mahalis. In other words, the saffron party has carved out a space in what was once the beating heart of the Radical Red movement.Ganesh Dey, a senior RSS man in these parts, says that his organisation has marked its presence in every gram panchayat of Naxalbari. ""We hold everyday shakhas in some villages. In other places, we have weekly (saptahik milan) or fortnightly meetings (pakshik milan). Earlier it was tough finding volunteers to celebrate Dr Hedgewar's birthday or Rakhi Purnima. Now we don't have a problem.In the next panchayat elections, we will get more seats,"" he says. A recent Ramnavami shobha yatra saw about 5,000 people turn up.The radical Reds , locals say, are having a hard time recruiting young members. Electronic goods salesman Pijush Das remembers the days when rallies with peasants and tea garden workers holding Charu Mazumdar banners used to be half a kilometre long. ""Now there are hardly 20 people,"" he says. TMC's Prithwish Roy is dismissive about the ultra-Left presence in the region. ""It is minimal. They have as many groups as cadres,"" he jokes.However, the ultra-Left -CPI (ML) Red Star, PCC CPI (ML) and several other groups - has claimed the walls through graffiti and posters. In the coming days, every hue of the radical Reds will celebrate 50 years of the Naxalbari struggle with meetings in Siliguri and elsewhere hoping to draw inspiration.Abhijit Majumdar, son of Charu Majumdar and Darjeeling district secretary of CPI (ML) Liberation, firmly believes that they are still relevant. He says, ""There's a reason why Amit Shah came to Naxalbari. He knows it is a signpost of radical Leftism. The BJP can co-opt or wean away TMC in the future. But it knows that in the war against the ultraRight, only the radical Left will be the last men standing."""
59355fb17be9e061b17373bc,Of flowers and fertility,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/of-flowers-and-fertility/articleshow/58771325.cms,2017-05-21,"By-Anuradha DasASays Dr Shami Kamat from Vasco, ""When I think back to my 'Fulam' all I can remember is being very happy and feeling very blessed,"" which, Ajana Amonkar from Porvorim happily agrees to. Suman Shirodkar, a grandmother and businesswoman from Panaji, in the wisdom born of age, is also of a similar opinion. ""The flowers, fruits, sweets and gifts, the woman being made the center of everyone's focus and showered with much love and blessing, is all meant to keep the first-time expectant mother happy. There is also the indirect purpose of wanting to keep the unborn child happy,"" Shirodkar says.Says folklorist with the Goa Konkani Akademi, Jayanti Kamat, ""At its foundation, 'Fulam' is a fertility ritual and everything associated with the tradition is symbolic of fertility."" She explains that even the etymology of the name 'Fulam', which means flowers, draws comparison between the flowering of trees and plants that is followed by the bearing of fruits. ""In the case of the woman, she will bear a child.""Overlooking the frills, Naik has an opinion on the choice of months and the colour green. ""First, green is the colour of fertility - and hence its usage. The woman, irrespective of the month, wears green bangles for this reason."" Going on to explain the choice of month, she says the seventh month is chosen because by then it is assured that the foetus will survive. The ninth month, Naik says, is even better because the pregnancy is now full term and birth is assured. ""Very few chose to celebrate 'Fulam' in the fifth month as the possibility of a miscarriage is still there and those who do, keep the affair low key,"" she adds.Naik brings up an interesting aspect of the 'votti bharop' ritual associated with 'pasadi' and 'Fulam', which traces the sub-continent's obsession with a male child, back to the beginning. ""During 'pasadi' the woman's saree is filled with a ladoo (sweet), besides the prerequisite fertility symbols of coconut, rice and flowers. The ladoo, being an expression of the hope that she may bear a boy,"" she says and adds that the 'pasadi' is not carried out if the woman is already pregnant.ncient traditions celebrated Mother Nature as the womb from where life sprung and, in an analogy to human life, it was the female form that was regarded as mother goddess. After all, it was the woman who blossomed to bear new life, and those early traditions developed into rituals centered on various stages in her life.These celebrations continue till date, albeit in more modern guises, and the modern day baby shower or 'Fulam' as it is known in Goa among the Hindus, is one such practice that is a salute to procreation and new life.'Fulam' is a happy occasion, one that has at its center the expectant mother, heavy with her child, decked out in flowers and splendidly costumed in a traditional saree to represent the Hindu goddess Lakshmi or Saraswati, and being showered with sweets. The woman, her family and well-wishers gather around to bless her and whisper advice about motherhood into her ears, all wrapped in a feeling of joyous anticipation.In all of this, the roots of the festival have mostly been forgotten. Most associate the celebration with the simplistic marking of a woman's transition to motherhood, and, in keeping with that momentous milestone in her life, believe it to be nothing more than a celebratory affair designed to keep the mother-to-be happy.The knowledge related to the exotic foundation of this tradition, is however known only to those few who have made it their business to study the philosophy behind such modern-day practices, tracing back to the time when life was in sync with nature and, as such, to the cycle of birth life and death.Researcher Pandurang Phaldesai extends the mother goddess ideology to encompass the tradition of the cycle of life. ""The Hindu tradition,"" he says, ""has various 'sanskars' related to major lifecycle milestones from birth to death covering, in between, puberty, marriage and conception (Fulam).""Phaldesai draws attention to another minor version of the 'Fulam' that is held during the woman's first Gudi Padwa (spring festival) after marriage. ""Called 'pasadi' this small scale version of Fulam is held in the mother's house and it is symbolic of the anticipation of new life, for the woman to step into a new phase - motherhood,"" he says adding that the 'votti bharop' ritual is performed. This ritual is a literal manifestation of the blessing that the woman's womb may always be blessed, and full and warm.During 'Fulam', the coconut is left out of the 'votti', ""as it is symbolic of the male seed"" and the woman is considered ""full and in no need of it"", Naik says. ""Instead, a ladoo or a large coconut barfi is placed in the 'pallu' of the saree,"" she adds, and explains that here the barfi is symbolic of the desire for a girl child.Sweets, an integral and auspicious part of the event, allude to the needs and sex of the unborn child. As part of the ceremony, the woman is asked to choose between a laddo and a barfi (locally called 'kaap') and if she chooses the barfi it is believed that she will bear a girl.So, it is understood that no matter how much we wrap our traditions in gaiety and the superficial adaptations, an informed look at the practices, reveals an exciting history of a past bringing a better understanding of social customs and psychologies."

The ungodly hour on the second Sunday of May does not deter them from singing and sharing jokes as they prepare for one of Goa's quaint tribute to seafood and the tradition of fishing.Nerul is a small fishing hamlet famous for being surrounded by the Sinquerim river and the beautiful palm -fringed Coco beach. Situated opposite the state capital Panaji on the northern bank of River Mandovi, Nerul shares borders with the historic village of Verem-Reis Magos, where the famed Tisreachem Fest is also celebrated, albeit in a smaller way.Tisreachem Fest or the feast of clams is a community celebration that is held once a year at the tiny chapel of St Anthony in Bhattier vaddo of Nerul. Interestingly, the feast is also celebrated at Dandadi vaddo and Fortavaddo, indicating that the culinary celebration has nothing to do with a specific date.As the village wakes up, each home pulsates with activity. Residents scramble to open clams and prepare the ingredients as fast as possible so that the Sunday Eucharist at the Our Lady of Remedies Church is not missed.""There is no specific day for the feast and Tisreachem fest is not associated with any Christian or religious feast. There is no religious significance to it. It is just a chance for the community to come together,"" Nerul parish priest Fr Bolmax Fidelis Pereira says.While there is no religious significance behind the tradition, Nerul's idyllic surroundings have a lot to do with the feast. The nearby creek and the cove at the mouth of the River Mandovi was a thriving location for clams and mussels and the villagers, most of whom were fisherfolk, soon took to collecting the tisreos (clams), and shinaneo (mussels) and the village soon gained popularity in Bardez.Tisreos used to be collected in large numbers and distributedin the early days. ""This is a tradition that pre-dates the Portuguese rule. Nerul and Verem were known for a rich harvest of Tisreo and since the locals were mainly fishermen they decided to dedicate a day of thanksgiving for the abundance of tisreo,"" heritage activist and historian Prajal Sakhardande explains.Another unique facet of the Tisreachem Fest is that it showcases the communitarian and secular fabric of Goa. This age-old tradition, over centuries, continues to be celebrated with equal gusto by both Hindus and Christians.Once the Eucharist is over, the Catholics join their village brethren at a common place to continue the cooking. And cooking for Tisreachem Fest translates into the sambaracheo tisreo (a tasty delicacy prepared from tisreo) or tisreo xacuti.While the women busy themselves with large quantities of shellfish and coconut grating, the men chip in by chopping large quantities of onions, chillies and tomatoes. The kids are left to run errands or to purchase missed out ingredients.Apart from the few mansions and resorts built in Nerul, the village still retains its original charm, relatively untouched by modern tourism. There is still a strong fishing community and the villagers also grow watermelons, ground nut, rice and vegetables.""This feast is celebrated in other villages also, but not on as big a scale as in Nerul. It was started by the village forefathers and we continue this tradition. One of the reasons why this festival is celebrated in May is because many people used to come down to the coast for the summer and this became a celebration,"" Nerul sarpanch Shashikala Govekar explains.According to the local tradition, each feast has an appointed president in whose house the sambaracheo tisreo curry is prepared. Continuing the age-old tradition of giving thanks for God's blessings, the president or host of the feast offers the banquet of clams as a personal thanksgiving.""The feast has to be booked one-year in advance. The tradition of this feast has been going on for generations. In the olden days, the tisreo were served in bowls made out of banyan leaves, but we have switched over to ready made silver foil bowls. There is also a tradition of serving mangoes or jackfruit along with the tisreo,"" local resident David D'Souza, who hosted the Tisreachem Fest last May said."

It was only later that she learned that impalement devices, just like the crucifix, were used for executions in the olden days and now rest as objects of veneration in temples. When she dug deeper, Abhinaya found that the spears have been an intrinsic part of folk religion and temples in southern Tamil Nadu, with impalement being the state punishment during the 6th and 7th centuries AD in Madurai.In those days, the condemned persons body was pierced lengthwise through a sharp stake and the victim was left to die a slow and painful death.Abhinaya found that the stone impalement devices in the Govindhankoil temple had engravings of the images of village deities like Muniasamy and Oorvalsamy. Villagers pay obeisance to these deities by making them an offering of millets, rice, fruits and coconut. During festivals pongal mixed with goat blood is offered to the eagles, says Abhinaya, a student of Suresh Sudha Alagan Memorial Government Higher Secondary School, who wrote a report on the tradition for her schools historical conservation centre.The ritual of offering rice and blood to eagles shows that the impaled persons were offered to the eagles, says V Rajaguru, founder of Ramanathapuram Archaeological and Historical Conservation Centre and teacher of the school.On studying the worship of impalement devices across Ramanathapuram district, the conservation centre found that the ritual has a strong Madurai connection. The centre members came across many stone spears in temples situated between Madurai and Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram district. While engravings of impalement were found in Kazhuvanpottal near Mandalamanickam, village temples in Kannankudi, Govindanenthal and Mandalamanickam had one stone impalement device each on their premises. Another device was found in the sanctum sanctorum in the temple in Kalari village too.Considering the amount of agony involved in the punishment, there is a popular belief that lives lost on an impalement device become part of its divinity, says Rajaguru.The impalement devices were earlier made of wood, usually sharpened to the length of the condemned person. Historians say impalement was prevalent till the 18th century and vanished after the arrival of the British. Impalement devices thereafter became objects of veneration. As wooden devices rotted in the course of time, people carved out stone spears for worship. Many of these stone impalement devices have engravings of the victims, who are worshipped by their descendants, he says.Folklorist A Sivasubramanian says impalement is a characteristic ritual of folk religion. In many folk religion temples, birds like cock offered to deities are impaled on sticks, he said.T Lajapathi Roy, author of the book Madurai  Mathirai that chronicles the history of Madurai, says impalement was a state punishment in ancient Madurai. Legend has it that Koon Pandiyan of the Pandya Dynasty (7th century AD) ordered impalement of 8000 Jains. Although the legend is still being debated, Madurai temples had customs that indicate a similar massacre. During the annual festival of Meenakshi temple, effigies were impaled on sticks and taken around as part of a ritual called `Samanar Madam Adakkal. The ritual was stopped in 1974. Temples also had murals on the legend which were whitewashed during renovations, Roy said."

But when I actually thought about it, it occurred to me that this was hardly an alien subject. Even films are being made on the subject, Toilet- ek prem katha, Piku and Dehli belly The over use or under use of the toilet is always an issue.Constipation, havent we all gone through this horrible feeling sometime or the other and somehow it happens on a holiday. Have you ever wondered why? Well, not a topic that one eases our mind into thinking but its important to know why so that it can be avoided.Constipation occurs where the food in the stomach and intestine is taking an inconsistently long time to be digested. The contractions that push the food forward is called the peristalsis movement. When the chyme (semi-digested food) is not pushed forward but remains in the intestine it starts fermenting, causing gases and bloating to occur. The water content has all been absorbed so it becomes dry and peristalsis becomes even more difficult and even painful at times.When we stop the urge to go we end up putting pressure on the intestines as we bring this movement from the large intestine to the rectum come to a halt. The nutrients by then have been absorbed along with the water in the colon and the food has already become just a ball of insoluable dietry fiber. When this remains and is not expelled in time it can cause tears in the delicate rectal muscle fibers leading to hemorrhoids or even fissures.When we travel our eating, sleeping habits become irregular, bringing with it changes in our digestive system which can sometimes cause constipation. When that happens we must increase our water intake immediately so as to keep the colon well hydrated to make sure that the chime doesnt dry out.Another reason could also be a sedentary lifestyle. It is important to keep up with moderate activity as we grow older as the our metabolism gradually slows down and with it the digestive process. Our body is like a machine that we need to keep well-oiled in all departments to keep working properly.So though constipation is a common occurrence, it is something that has to be addressed and solved. Simple solutions that can help areIncreasing fiber intake so that there is sufficient fiber for bile to mix with and digest the food. Eg Legumes, Oats, rice bran, whole fruits, green vegetables,figs etc Increase your water intake, making it possible for the insoluable fiber in the colon to move forward more effectively. Mild diuretics can be take but only as advised by a doctor as many a times excess use of laxatives itself cause constipation. Use the bathroom as and when needed. Do not hold back. Regularize lifestyle and eating and sleeping patterns.We have all experienced the discomfort and the relief that follows so, do care to shit."
593565887be9e061b17377cf,What is more healthy-rice or chapati?.,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/myth-0-logic/what-is-more-healthy-rice-or-chapati/,2017-04-23,"Nowadays people think that rice or chapati is sole reason for obesity. This article will make sure that both are important if taken correctly.Rice vs chapati (wheat roti) is a very common and controversial topic; both these grains being the staple food in many parts of the globe. People blame rice for causing obesity, diabetes and related conditions. Is it really true?Basically, we most commonly use polished / white rice, which looks white due to the removal of fiber-rich outer covering (husk and bran). During this process, most of the micro-nutrients (vitamins and minerals) are washed away. Thus white rice is devoid of B complex vitamins, iron, calcium etc.Whole wheat flour, the main ingredient in chapatis, is high in fiber (unless sieved) , protein and minerals like iron, calcium, selenium, potassium and magnesium.Some other important considerations are-1. Chapatis are higher in sodium and potassium content. Rice doesnt contain any sodium (unless salt is added) and contains very little potassium. Thus for people on sodium & potassium restricted diets, rice could be a better choice than chapati.2. Rice is easy to digest as it is low in fibers. Thus for people with loose stools / diarrhea, indigestion etc. rice is a good choice.3. For people who manage their diabetes & diet plan, eating whole wheat chapati is a better alternative. White rice has a higher glycemic index than chapati , which means, it increases blood sugar more rapidly. Thus chapati is always a preferred option for diabetic individuals.4. For those who are overweight & obese, chapati is a better choice as it contains more fibers. Eating rice more often, more in quantity and especially at dinner can lead to weight and fat gain.Thus, nutrient content-wise, chapatis are healthier than rice. Brown or unpolished rice could be a good replacement for white one which retains almost all micro-nutrients."

Source: Gurmeet Singh A farmer taking bags of PR-126 paddy seeds purchased from the Punjab Agricultural Universitys Kisan Mela at Ludhiana. Source: Gurmeet SinghA new variety maturing within 125 days, yet yielding nearly as much as those now grown over 135-160 days, could provide the ultimate solution to Punjabs woes stemming from farming of water-guzzling paddy.Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has released a paddy variety PR-126 that gives an average of 30 quintals per acre. This is only marginally below the 30.5 quintals from PR-121 and PR-124 or the 32 quintals of the other popular variety Pusa-44.But the real difference is in the duration, from the time of sowing seeds in the paddy nursery to harvesting of the ripened grain. This ranges from 135 days for PR-124 and 140 days for PR-121 to 160 days in the case of Pusa-44. PR-126 matures in just 123-125 days, including 30 days of nursery raising and 93-95 days after transplantation of seedlings.The average yield per day from the new variety, at about 24 kg per acre, is more than the 20 kg of Pusa-44 or 22 kg for PR-121 and PR-124. The shorter duration also means less water consumption. If farmers have to give, say, 26 irrigations for Pusa-44, this would be only 21-22 in PR-121/PR-124 and 17-18 in PR-126, claims G S Mangat, head of PAUs rice improvement programme.PR-121 and PR-124 were released for commercial cultivation in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The PR-126 variety was officially released for planting in the coming 2017 kharif season at last weeks PAU Kisan Mela here. Last year, about 400 quintals of seeds was made available on trial basis to select farmers. This time, we are distributing another 1,000 quintals. At 8 kg planting per acre, it will again cover only a limited area, adds Mangat.PR-121 has, within a span of three years, become Punjabs most widely-cultivated paddy variety. Last year, it covered over 7.7 lakh hectares (lh) or 30.7 per cent of the states total non-basmati paddy area, with PR-124 accounting for another 9.8 per cent. In the process, Pusa-44s share, which was 39 per cent in 2012, fell to 20.3 per cent.We have not recommended cultivation of Pusa-44 (developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi) in Punjab mainly due to its long duration. The nursery sowing has to be before April last week and transplanting by mid-May, to enable harvesting from October and timely planting of the next wheat crop. The water requirement will obviously be high during this peak summer period. Secondly, Pusa-44 is susceptible to bacterial blight. There is no chemical control available against the Xanthomonas oryzae pathogen causing this disease that can result in significant grain yield loss, explains Mangat.Released in 1993, Pusa-44s main attraction was its yields. At 32 quintals per quintal, this exceeded the average 26 quintals of PR-106, a 145-day PAU variety that was till then Punjabs workhorse paddy following its introduction in 1976. Being a medium-slender (fine) grain giving higher head rice recovery than PR-106, which produced long-slender or superfine grains, also made Pusa-44 a favourite with millers. The Union governments decision merging fine and superfine paddy into a single Grade A category from October 1997  entitling Pusa-44 to the same minimum support price (MSP) as PR-106  further tilted the advantage in favour of the former.The last straw came from the Punjab governments policy of supplying free power to farmers. When water could be freely pumped out to allow transplanting even in May, the farmer had reason to grow a long-duration variety that gave him extra yield. But it came at the cost of the stateswater table, points out Satinder Singh Brar, a retired senior extension specialist with PAU, who has advocated a ban on Pusa-44 cultivation.According to latest official data for 2010-11, groundwater resources in 110 out of Punjabs 138 blocks were overexploited, with average extraction rates from aquifers exceeding recharge levels. Underground water being overdrawn has been attributed to paddy cultivation area in the state rising from under 3 lh to over 30 lh between 1965 and 2016. It has led to the enactment of the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act in 2009, barring any nursery sowing and transplanting of paddy before May 15 and June 15, respectively.PAU vice-chancellor B S Dhillon believes that weaning the Punjab farmer away from paddy is impractical, as it is a crop entailing less production risk and with an assured market based on MSP procurement. The more sustainable solution is in breeding short-duration, but high-yielding, varieties that require less water. The new PAU varieties, from PR-121 to PR-126, can be comfortably transplanted after mid-June 15 or even towards the month-end with the monsoons arrival.We bred these mainly by crossing PR-106 and PR-116 (a high head rice recovery variety released in 2000). Further, the PR-106 parent itself incorporated three bacterial blight resistant genes Xa4, xa13 and Xa21 (sourced from traditional landrace cultivars and wild relatives of paddy).The transfer of these genes in pyramided combination lines (to confer durable resistance) involved use of molecular breeding and marker assisted selection techniques, informs Mangat. The end-result has been reduced-duration paddy varieties having bacterial blight-resistance, and with yields and head rice recoveries comparable to Pusa-44.Last year, I sowed PR-126 on 20 acres and harvested 33 quintals per acre, despite undertaking transplanting only on June 27. This time, I plan to increase my area under the new variety to 25 acres, says Kulwinder Singh, a 30-acre farmer from Mardanpur village in Patiala districts Rajpura tehsil.For over a decade, we grew Pusa-44 because yields could even go to 35 quintals per acre. But with PR-126, I am getting around 31 quintals, while also saving money on running my diesel generator to ensure standing water for the transplanted paddy, notes P P S Pangli, a progressive farmer from Ludhianas Panglian village, who grew PR-126 on 22 out of his 82 acres.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Monocrotophos was meant for use on sugarcane crop.The Bihar Police was put under tremendous pressure to establish foul play in the deaths of 23 schoolchildren in the Gandaman primary school midday meal tragedy, but its investigations showed only criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, the officer in charge of the probe told The Indian Express.The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police exculpated the husband of the principal, who had bought the pesticide that made its way into the childrens meal.Read |Bihar midday meal tragedy: Everything you need to know about the incidentAccepting the CIDs supervision note, an additional district judge in Chhapra, Saran, in August 2016 convicted the principal, Meena Devi, and sentenced her to two jail terms of 10 years and seven years, to run consecutively rather than concurrently, adding up to a total sentence of 17 years.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court acquitted Meenas husband, Arjun Rai alias Arjun Yadav, of all charges.This is how Vinay Kumar, additional director-general of police, CID, reconstructed the events of July 16, 2013  the day of the tragedy  in an exclusive interview to The Indian Express.Read | In Bihar primary school where mid-day meal killed 23, children go hungryThat day, Meena Devi, the principal of Gandaman primary school in Bihars Saran district, had planned to distribute free government textbooks to about 100 children studying in Classes 1 to 5. The school was running in a community hall measuring 30 ft by 20 ft. An open part of the verandah was being used as the midday meal kitchen.Meenas husband, Arjun Rai, had announced to the children and their parents that books would be distributed, and almost three times the usual number of 30-40 students had turned up. The midday meal menu, according to a chart prepared by the government, was rice and soybean curry.Rai, a farmer, had decided to grow sugarcane that year, and had purchased monocrotophos, a cheap but acutely toxic organophosphate agricultural insecticide. He had kept the container on the verandah of their house, some 600 metres from the school.Meena asked one of the two school cooks to bring the container of mustard oil from the verandah, which had no separately marked space for the midday meals groceries.The cook saw two similar containers. Arjun Rai had brought two litres of monocrotophos, an agricultural pesticide, from the neighbouring Sidhwalia Sugar Mill for his sugarcane crop. Monocrotophos resembles mustard oil. Instead of picking up the container of mustard oil, the cook picked up the one containing monocrotophos, ADGP Kumar said.Once on the fire, the pesticide turned black. The two cooks and some students brought this unusual behaviour of the mustard oil to the notice of the principal. Meena Devi, however, dismissed their concerns, saying old mustard oil can turn black with heat.Around 1.30 pm, the first batch of 60-odd students were ready to have lunch. Some, like Laxmi Sah, daughter of confectioner Raju Sah, went back home because they did not want to eat what was being served, but others like her brother Krishna stayed because they liked soybean. By 2.30 pm, there was complete chaos: parents were rushing their children to Masrakh hospital with complaints of giddiness, vomiting and breathlessness.In the end, 23 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 12 years had died of poisoning.CID officers picked up the residue of the cooked soyabean from utensils and put it through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), a chemistry technique to identify the amount and types of chemicals in a sample, and were able to establish the presence of the pesticide. It was known that Arjun Rai had procured monocrotophos for his sugarcane crop; what the CID now needed to find out was whether he had a motive for murder.We were under tremendous pressure to prove foul play. Rai could have added monocrotophos to the container of mustard oil. But his only mistake was to keep the pesticide container in the vicinity of the mustard oil container, ADGP Kumar said.It was criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, who should have responded to the complaints of the cooks and the students, said the officer. Naming Arjun Rai would have been poor padding for a conspiracy theory. Rai had no motive to conspire to kill students. The school principal was solely responsible for the tragedy, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

One is increasing foodgrains allocation under NFSA, Paswan told reporters after the meeting.In the meeting, sources said that the Kerala Chief Minister demanded that state should get foodgrains for PDS supply that it used to get before implementing the NFSA.Under the NFSA, the state is getting 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrains annually, lower than 16.25 lakh tonnes earlier.To this, the the Food Minister said that an uniform formula has been applied to all states while allocating foodgrains to each state under the food security law.Allocation under the NFSA is being made taking into account last three years average foodgrains lifting of the state. And the average was 10 lakh tonnes per annum for Kerala. But more is being given to protect poor people, a senior Food Ministry official said.Kerala is asking for more allocation under the NFSA as it wants to cover the entire population.Among other demands, the Kerala government has asked more subsidy support as the state wants to sell subsidised sugar to entire population under the PDS. At present, sugar is supplied to only families of below poverty line (BPL).It has also asked for paraboiled rice and additional foodgrains allocation of about 50,000 tonnes per month to meet the demand of 10-15 lakh migrant workers in the state.The state has also demanded up foodgrains allocatin to 550 tonnes per month for welfare institutions from existing monthly allocation of 212 tonnes , while it has also sought central support to make extra payment to state-run FCI labourers.That apart, the Kerala government has asked the Centre to extend rice procurement period for three months.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express photo by Subham DuttaChief Minister Mamata Banerjees protests against note ban continued to echo on the opening day of Bengal Global Business Meet, where hundreds of potential investors, including senior industrialists, and representatives from 29 countries gathered to discuss the possibility of investing in the state.At the summit, R P Sanjiv Goenka Group and Bharti Enterprises announced a commitment of Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 crore respectively over the next few years.In stark contrast to last years summit, in which Mamatas selling points were under control law and order situation, the chief minister was silent on the topic this year. Apart from the Bhangar protests, several incidents of communal riots have been reported from across the state since September.Watch what else is making newsMamata instead spoke of the hardhips faced by industries. Due to note ban, industries are now facing a lot of hardships. Especially smaller ones which are unable to make cash transactions. Economic growth has slowed down. Despite demonetisation, I invite you to come to Bengal and we will give you all the support that you need, she said.The chief minister reiterated many of the points she had mentioned in last years summit  industry output having doubled from 67 billion to 140 billion in a five-year span, tax revenue having doubled in four years, industrial growth rate having increased to 10.59 per cent in the year 2015-16 as opposed to the national industrial growth rate of 7.30 per cent, the service sector growing one and a half times faster in the state and the agricultural sector recording growth five times more than before.When we first came to power in the state, infant mortality rate was 32 per cent, now it is 26 per cent in Bengal. Even in Gujarat, it still stands at 33 per cent. National institutional delivery rate is 65 per cent, while ours is 93.4 per cent. We are providing rice at Rs 2 per kg to at least eight crore people in the state. Free medical treatment is being provided. Sixteen new universities have come up, and 300 ITI polytechnics.

China, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, Iran, UK, Norway, Belgium, Switzerland, USA, Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, they are all here, she said, urging investors to look at Bengal as the gateway to the eight north eastern states.She further said Bengals proximity to Bangladesh, Nepal, South East Asia, Bhutan, Thailand and China makes it geographically advantageous.On improved work culture, she said that not a single man day was lost since her party came to power six years ago. In the earlier Left regime, a staggering 78 lakh man days were lost, she said.We do not allow strikes or lockouts. We try to sort out issues in 24 hours, she added. She also highlighted the measures taken by the government to improve the social sector of the state.Notable industry leaders like Sanjeev Goenka of RP-Sanjiv Goenka group, Rajan Bharti Mittal of Airtel, Pankaj Munjal of Hero Motocorp and Kishore Biyani of Future group among others were present at the meet.I am committing an investment of Rs 10,000 crore in the FMCG sector in the state over the next few years, Goenka said at the inauguration. Stating that West Bengal is an investor-friendly state, he said: There is transparency in deals. There is no hitch, no delay West Bengal means business.Mittal said that the Bharti Group has pumped around Rs 30,000 crore in the state so far.We want to partner with the state government further. The Bharti Group will invest about Rs 3,000-4,000 crore in the state in the next 2-3 years, he said.

59371c717be9e015d564a027,Japan cool to inviting China into TPP as Shinzo Abe repeats free trade mantra,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/japan-cool-to-inviting-china-into-tpp-as-shinzo-abe-repeats-free-trade-mantra-4490927/,2017-01-25,"Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (File Photo) Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. (File Photo)Japan is cool to the notion of inviting China to join a pan-Pacific trade pact abandoned by US President Donald Trump, fearing such a step would boost Beijings clout and water down what was meant to be the gold standard for rules of trade. Nor are government officials eager to begin two-way trade talks with Washington, despite Trumps stated preference for bilateral deals as part of his America First economic plans, although some said such negotiations could not be ruled out.For now, that has left Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the unenviable position of pledging yet again to persuade Trump that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is in the interests of both the United States and the global economy. The new president signed an executive order withdrawing from the TPP on Monday.The free trade system based on free and fair common rules is the source of growth for the world economy, Abe told parliaments upper house on Wednesday.WATCH| US President Donald Trump Expected To Order Temporary Ban On RefugeesI think President Trump also understands the importance of free and fair trade, and I want to steadfastly seek his understanding of the strategic and economic significance of the TPP agreement.Asked about talks on a U.S.-Japan trade deal, Abe said he would refrain from speculating about Trumps trade policy until his cabinet line-up was approved and policies became clearer.Australia and New Zealand said on Tuesday they hoped to salvage the TPP by encouraging China and other Asian countries to join. Chile has invited ministers from other TPP countries and China and South Korea to a summit in March to discuss how to proceed. The TPP cannot take effect without U.S. participation unless rules are changed, so the deal is now in deep freeze.Japan had hoped the TPP would help anchor security ally Washington in Asia and create a rule-based regime that would eventually draw in China. Abe also touted the 12-nation pact as an engine of domestic economic reform and growth.WATERING DOWN?But inviting China to the TPP table now risks boosting Beijings clout while weakening the partnerships rules of trade on matters from intellectual property protection and principles for currency management to support for state-owned enterprises.China has not made clear whether it would be interested in joining the TPP. But Beijing is pushing a proposed 16-nation Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that has less ambitious goals on trade rules. Progress so far has been slow.If TPP is diluted by bringing in China, it will not be worth while investing energy to achieve that, said a Japanese source familiar with government thinking.WATCH VIDEO | PM Narendra Modi Invites US President Donald Trump To Visit IndiaNegotiating with China with possibility of changing what was signed is not wise. It will take years and the result may be watering down of ambitions, the source said.Su Xiaohui, a senior researcher at the Chinese foreign ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in an article published on Wednesday in the Peoples Daily Overseas Edition that Abe was still unable to accept reality even after Trumps executive order.The reason Abe is unable to accept the current situation is because the TPP is of excessive strategic importance to Japan. From Japans perspective, the TPP is a key part of the Japan-U.S. alliance, Su said.Seeing the disputes surrounding the TPP from the US and Japan, China is even more determined to participate and promote integration in the Asia-Pacific region, Su said.China also supports a separate Asia-Pacific pact promoted by Southeast Asian nations.TWO-WAY DEALSTrump has made clear he favours two-way trade deals over multilateral ones, although a Republican-dominated Congress might be able to muster the votes to approve TPP if the President were to have a change of heart.Trump has also attacked Japans auto market as closed in an echo of criticism heard decades ago. Japanese trade minister Hiroshige Seko this week rejected that criticism, saying Japan does not impose tariffs on U.S. auto imports nor put up discriminatory non-tariff barriers.Bilateral U.S.-Japan negotiations would likely put renewed pressure on politically vocal farmers, some of whose products such as rice would remain protected even under TPP.Bilateral talks are possible, said another source familiar with Japanese government thinking. But I think if negotiations began, theyd be very difficult and take a very long time.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Ganesh Bhuiya is among the mine workers on the blasting team who havent received their pay. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)Prem Yadav, 35, a resident of Honhe village, is busy planting explosives into one of the 50-odd boreholes, about 6 metres deep, in a wet coal bed being prepared for blasting. He is among the 40-odd workers tasked with blasting at the Amrapali Open Cast Project (OCP) of Central Coalfields Limited (CCL). The overcast sky is making Yadav worried as blasting is prohibited in the dark. Nearly four hours of rain the previous night has rendered roads leading to the mining pit slippery. As a precautionary measure, dumper trucks and other heavy earthmovers are not working today.Even as he concentrates on the explosives, Yadav cant help but ask a nagging question to a few officials around. Saheb, hum ee kah rahe the ki humko paisa de nahin rahe hain (Sir, I was saying they are not giving us money), says Yadav, complaining about their long-pending salaries.Yadav, who started out as a helper, earns Rs 18,000 a month. However, he and other employees of the Hyderabad-based BGR Private Limited havent been paid in more than two months, since demonetisation began.Halinder Sao, a 30-year-old from Kumrang Khurd, is pedalling to the camp of Mahalaxmi Infra Private Limited (MIPL), carrying his miners helmet, where workers are to take a call on a strike over their wages. I used to work as a mason and now I am part of the blasting team. For my experience, I should be getting Rs 5,000 per month. Sometimes, the salary comes, at other times, they promise us Rs 6,000, as advance, Sao says.At the MIPL camp meeting, around a hundred workers are gathered. The situation is tense. One of the workers shouts,Humko sirf tareekh par tareekh mil raha hai (We are just getting date after date on when we will get the salaries).The camp in-charge, Sanjeev Pandey, says they are trying to find a solution. There are three aspects to the problem, he adds, We have taken over recently. Then came demonetisation, and to top it all, there is the Godda tragedy.Coal bed being prepared for blasting at the Amrapali Open Cast Project, a 100% outsourced mine. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Coal bed being prepared for blasting at the Amrapali Open Cast Project, a 100% outsourced mine. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)In Lalmatia coal mines of Eastern Coalfields Limited in Godda district, nearly two dozen workers were killed in a cave-in on the night of December 29. Officials of MIPL, which is doing work in the Lalmatia mines as well, are busy trying to contain the damage. Only 18 bodies have been retrieved so far, with the accident indicating the dangers of unscientific stacking of overburden (the top soil, stones etc that are removed to reach the coal bed).The Lalmatia toll makes 2016 one of the deadliest years for mine workers in India, in what is one of the most dangerous professions in the country.We are in the process of integrating the workers bank accounts with ours, as we just cannot pay them in cash. There is only so much cash we can withdraw to pay even a portion of their dues, says an exasperated Pandey, adding that he has proposed payment of Rs 6,000 each as stop-gap till things settle down.Located near Tandwa in Naxal-dominated Chatra district of Jharkhand, the Amrapali OCP, a 100 per cent outsourced mine, lies next to Magadh OCP. The total peak coal output of the two OCPs is expected to reach 105 million tonnes a year by 2020, making it the hub of coal production for the entire country.Yadavs company, BGR Private Limited, was contracted to remove the overburden in July 2014, and the work is in its last stages now. He was among the 250-plus workers hired from the villages affected by the mine, including Honhe, Kumrang Kala, Kumrang Khurd, Binglat and Ursu.The father of four says this job is one of the best he could expect given that he is illiterate. Workers such as Yadav also have a provident fund account now, which they treasure. We are surviving on our resources and with the help of family members these days. But how long can we pull along like this? Yadav says.Dumper drivers and operators of other heavy movers point to the nearby camps in which hundreds of workers such as them live, to show how their lives have seen a turn for the better because of the mine.While workers from neighbouring villages go back home after work, those from far-off places stay at these camps in 20 ft by 30 ft dormitories made of corrugated sheets. Electricity, power and the cots are paid for by the companies, and an RO plant ensures clean drinking water. The mattresses, the quilts, the mosquito nets and the occasional TV belong to the camps occupants. There is also a badminton court nearby for the miners.Around 11 am, Shiv Narayan Prajapati, 33, a dumper driver with BGR, is taking a bath at the common tank outside, pouring water using a miners helmet. He is surrounded by drivers and operators who have just woken up, after doing a night shift from 8 pm to 4 am.Prajapati, who is from Balumath area of Latehar district, says he doesnt mind the hours. An eight-hour shift means an eight-hour shift. If my replacement hasnt come, I still return to the camp.Shoaib, 30, who is watching TV in one of the dormitories, is from Hajipur in Bihar and is a bulldozer operator. Sitting on his folding cot, one of seven placed side-by-side in the dormitory, he is making ropes from plastic fibre that he has extracted from bags. A few finished rope bundles lie next to him.This helps us pass time and we take the ropes home and use them, says Shoaib, a father of three.We pooled in money and got this (TV with set-top box). It cost us nearly Rs 6,000. Usually, we watch news, cricket and films, says Ram Vriksh Yadav, speaking from inside his mosquito net.In another dormitory, there is a Telugu film on. Inside are Ramanna, a supervisor, and Praveen, who operates a surface excavator. The roof is re-furbished with thermocol sheets to keep the heat out during summer and manage cold during winter.A Class X dropout, Praveen, 22, who is from Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh, says, I like it here. Wherever the company goes, I will go too.Its lunch time by now, and in the nearby canteen, utensils are mounted on platforms in the middle of a hall. Chairs and tables are fixed along the walls.Krishna, the mess in-charge, says egg curry with rice and sambar is on the menu today, apart from dal and buttermilk. At one point, the canteen served food to around a thousand workers, he adds. Now, with BGRs work coming to an end, it is down to 300-400. We seldom repeated the menu earlier. We had idli-dosa, paranthas, seasonal vegetables Now, of course, we dont have enough hands to care for variety.While the workers are aware of the Godda tragedy, they dont seem worried. Officials say they have prevented the possibility of at least a similar accident. Here, we have started plantation on the top-most point of the overburden, which is nearly 530 metres above mean sea level. A rose garden too is coming up, says OCP Manager Manoj Kumar. At the top grow saplings of karanj, sheesham, amla and mango.At the Amrapali OCP, they are also covering the mined area with top soil to reclaim excavated land. At Piparwar, we achieved 130 per cent forestation from what it was earlier, says a senior CCL official at Ranchi headquarters.Apart from the uncertainty about salaries, what BGR workers are most worried about is the change of guard at the mine to a joint venture including MIPL, Ambey Mining Private Limited and Godavari.Shiv Kumar Rawani from Charhi in Hazaribagh district, who drives dumpers, says, We are hearing that the joint venture guys dont want drivers with Jharkhand driving licences. They are looking for people from outside the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: file) South Africa buckled under pressure as Sachin Tendulkar, bowling the final over with only six runs needed, scripted a memorable victory for his side at the Eden Gardens. (Source: file)Batting great Sachin Tendulkar today recalled how a mongoose proved to be good omen for India in their sensational last-over win in the semifinal of Hero Cup here way back in 1993.South Africa buckled under pressure as Tendulkar, bowling the final over with only six runs needed, scripted a memorable victory for his side at the Eden Gardens.I dont know how many of you have noticed this but because it was the first day and night match, there was a mongoose which kept coming in the second half of the match, Tendulkar, who is the face of IDBI Federal Life Insurance Kolkata Full Marathon, said on the eve of the race.We got some wickets when it came. Then there were some runs and again the mongoose came and we got wickets. So I was waiting for the mongoose to keep coming. The match got rather close and I ended up bowling the last over.Tendulkar had failed with the bat but skipper Mohammad Azharuddin gave him the task to bowl the last over.It was a gamble that paid off and still remembered fondly as Tendulkar bowled three dot balls to Allan Donald preceded by a runout and Brian McMillan failed to get a boundary off the last delivery with the crowd buzzing from behind.When in Kolkata we used to have a joke running around Pehle do wicket lelo, baki ke aath wickets crowd le leta hai (first take the first two wickets, the crowd will look after the rest).Singling out the Hero Cup semi-final on November 24, 1993 as one of his best moments at Eden Gardens, he said: It was quite memorable and completely different, the first day-and-night match where I ended up bowling the last over.The experience to see the entire stadium lit with torches was truly out of this world. They stay with you for the rest of your life.Tendulkar also remembered the epoch-making 1991 series against South Africa that saw their return to international cricket from isolation after two decades. The first match of the three-ODI series saw a sellout crowd of about one lakh.There has been so many memories when it comes to Kolkata. The first big moment for me was when we played against South Africa, who were getting back to the International cricket.We had a spectacular match, Donald had a fiery spell up front but we got a partnership going and ended up winning the game. All in all, the experience was overwhelming not just for South Africa but also for me, Tendulkar, who jointly got the Man-of-the-Match award with Donald for his 73-ball 62 in their three-wicket win on November 10, 1991, said.He also recollected the reception after both the teams landed at the airport.It was incredible, not just inside the stadium but the moment they landed at the airport. On their way to the hotel there were people standing and cheering on both sides of the road.I later spoke to (then captain) Clive Rice who was double my age that time and he still fondly recalled that series, he signed off.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Located about 60 km southwest of state capital Aizawl, Darlawng village in Thingsulthliah block has a population of over 680, majority of whom had earlier, despite a statewide prohibition, depended on producing Rakzu, a kind of rice beer, for their livelihood as agricultural output was low owing to a lack of proper irrigation facilities.WATCH VIDEO | Curfew Imposed In Kohima Following Violence In Nagaland: Find Out What HappenedHowever, in 2012, the village community decided to stop illegal production of liquor. And when the village was looking for alternative livelihood avenues, the North East Rural Livelihood Project (NERLP), run by the Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER) Ministry and funded by the World Bank, made an intervention to ensure economic empowerment of the people.A minor irrigation project was implemented in Darlawng under the Community Development Plan of NERLP, leading to a substantial increase in farm yields and expansion of the area of settled cultivation. Under the project, water was sourced from three nearby streamsSahlam Lui, Darlawng tlang Lui and Cher Chawm Luiand used for agriculture.This made a huge difference to the villagers. Farm yield went up substantially and the area of settled cultivation too increased from 20 hectares to over 36 hectares. About 130 of the 160 households in the village are now involved in agriculture and allied activities, whereas earlier the figure stood at about 70, says Reuben Ranglong, Aizawl District Project Manager of NERLP.In addition, a road to aid the agricultural work was constructed by the community under MGNREGA, orange cultivation grew with assistance from the state horticulture department and several farmers received assistance for starting fisheries with help from the Integrated Watershed Management Programme, he says.These initiatives led to increased production of vegetables, bananas and ginger, thus augmenting the income of the villagers, Reuben adds.Besides the irrigation project under the Community Development Plan, 11 self-help groups (SHGs) of 10 women each were formed in the village under NERLP. With financial assistance from NERLP, SHG members took up various economic activities like farming or running a poultry or piggery.Under NERLP, an SHG is given Rs 1,00,000 in three instalments over a period of one year.Our focus is on training and capacity-building of SHG members and we monitor their progress regularlyWe dont want to give them fish, our aim is to teach them how to fish, says Reuben.There are now many individual success stories in Darlawng village which was once looked down upon for its involvement in illegal liquor production.Take the case of Lalrozami, a 47-year-old SHG member.

(File Photo) Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam. (File Photo)A delegation of 12 farmers associations in Tamil Nadu have met Chief Minister O Panneerselvam on Tuesday demanding to hike the drought relief announced by the state on January 10. Citing an unprecedentedly severe drought that affected the entire state with the failure of both the south-west and north-east monsoons, a memorandum submitted by farmers delegation said the government should revise the drought relief and the compensation towards crop damage, besides waiver of crop loans and stoppage of property attachments.Memorandum urged the government to revise the already announced compensation package of Rs 5,565 per acre for paddy crop, Rs 5,465 per acre for irrigated crop and Rs 7,287 per acre for rain-fed crops and demanded to include farm labourers too in the package, who are largely in a distress and being forced to leave villages to cities and other states in search of jobs. The delegation demanded a compensation of Rs 10,000 and 30kg of rice free of cost per month, per family.The delegation also demanded the state government to immediately start the desalting works on water bodies, for which the government had allocated Rs 3,400 crore. The delegation also demanded the government to expedite measures to resist the Kerala government from constructing check dams across the Bhavani river and speed up linking of intra-state rivers announced in 2011.K Balakrishnan, president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Associations, a body that represent 10 leading farmers associations and farm labourers unions, said the government compensation of Rs 5,565 per acre was not enough when the cost of production per acre alone exceeds Rs 18,000. Moreover, the government scheme did not include farm labourers, who are the worst affected in this crisis without work or any other income. The government said that they will consider the demand, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
59378c5d7be9e015d564bd3a,Donald Trump drops Steve Bannon from National Security Council,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/donald-trump-drops-steve-bannon-from-national-security-council-4601473/,2017-04-06,"White House chief strategist Steve Bannon (Source: AP Photo/File) White House chief strategist Steve Bannon (Source: AP Photo/File)US President Donald Trump removed his chief strategist Steve Bannon from the National Security Council on Wednesday, reversing his controversial decision early this year to give a political adviser an unprecedented role in security discussions. Trumps overhaul of the NSC, confirmed by a White House official, also elevated General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Dan Coats, the director of National Intelligence who heads all 17 US intelligence agencies. The official said the change moves the NSC back to its core function of what its supposed to do.It also appears to mark a victory for national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who had told some national security experts he felt he was in a battle to the death with Bannon and others on the White House staff. Vice President Mike Pence said Bannon would continue to play an important role in policy and played down the shake-up as routine.This is just a natural evolution to ensure the National Security Council is organized in a way that best serves the president in resolving and making those difficult decisions, Pence said on Fox News. Bannon said in a statement he had succeeded in returning the NSC back to its traditional role of coordinating foreign policy rather than running it. He cited President Barack Obamas national security adviser, Susan Rice, for why he advocated a change.Susan Rice operationalized the NSC during the last administration so I was put on NSC to ensure it was de-operationalized. General McMaster has NSC back to its proper function, he said. Trumps White House team has grappled with infighting and intrigue that has hobbled his young presidency. In recent days, several other senior US foreign policy and national security officials have said the mechanisms for shaping the Trump administrations response to pressing challenges such as Syria, North Korea and Iran still were not in place.Critics of Bannons role on the NSC said it gave too much weight in decision-making to someone who lacked foreign policy expertise. Bannon, who was chief executive of Trumps presidential campaign in the months leading to his election in November, in some respects represents Trumps America First nationalistic voice, helping fuel his anti-Washington fervor and pushing for the president to part ways at times with mainstream Republicans. Before joining the Trump administration, Bannon headed Breitbart News, a right-wing website.US Representative Adam Schiff, ranking Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called the shift in the NSC a positive step that will help McMaster gain control over a body that was being politicized by Bannons involvement. As the administrations policy over North Korea, China, Russia and Syria continues to drift, we can only hope this shake-up brings some level of strategic vision to the body, he said.SOURCE: STILL INFLUENTIALBannons removal from the NSC was a potential setback for his sphere of influence in the Trump White House, where he has a voice in most major decisions. But a Trump confidant said Bannon remained as influential as ever. He is still involved in everything and still has the full confidence of the president but to be fair he can only do so much stuff, the confidant said, speaking on condition of anonymity.The White House official said Bannon was no longer needed on the NSC after the departure of Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russias ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, prior to Trump taking office on Jan. 20. The official said Bannon had been placed on the NSC originally as a check on Flynn and had only attended one of the NSCs regular meetings.The official dismissed questions about a power struggle between Bannon and McMaster, saying they shared the same world view. However, two current national security officials rejected the White House explanation, noting that two months have passed since Flynns departure. McMaster, they said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also has dueled with Bannon and others over direct access to Trump; the future of deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News commentator; intelligence director Ezra Cohen-Watnick, a Flynn appointee; and other staffing decisions.Trump is preparing for his first face-to-face meeting on Thursday and Friday with Chinese President Xi Jinping with the threat of North Koreas nuclear and missile programs a key component of their talks. Bannons seat on the NSCs principals committee, a group that includes the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides, was taken by Rick Perry, who as energy secretary is charged with overseeing the US nuclear weapons arsenal.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Reuters/File Photo) US President Donald Trumps unfounded accusation fits a pattern for the president. (Source: Reuters/File Photo)Citing no evidence, President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused his predecessors national security adviser of breaking the law, one month after he accused former President Barack Obama of illegally wiretapping him. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump said Obamas national security adviser, Susan Rice, committed a crime when she asked government analysts to disclose the names of Trump associates documented in intelligence reports. Trump would not say if he reviewed new intelligence to support his claim. He told the Times he would say more at the right time.I think its going to be the biggest story, Trump said. Its such an important story for our country and the world. It is one of the big stories of our time. Rice is the latest target for Trump and his embattled defenders. She has firmly denied that she did anything inappropriate in requesting the identities of Trump associates. As the national security adviser, Rice would have been authorized to seek identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports. Officials typically unmask Americans if it is deemed necessary for understanding the information. Some Trump allies have accused Rice of unmasking officials for political reasons.Absolutely false, Rice declared Tuesday. Trump on Wednesday disagreed. When the Times asked him if Rice broke the law, he said, Do I think? Yes, I think. The president did not specify what law he thinks Rice may have broken. Erin Pelton, a spokeswoman for Rice, said, Im not going to dignify the presidents ludicrous charge with a comment.Trumps unfounded accusation fits a pattern for the president. Last month, he accused Obama of wiretapping his New York skyscraper and later said Obama had spied on his campaign. Neither allegation has been backed up by evidence. Trumps first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, is under FBI scrutiny for his ties to Russia. Two congressional committees are also investigating Flynn as part of larger probes into the Kremlins influence on the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump associates. Last week Trump said that Flynn, who resigned in February, should seek an immunity deal.On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the House intelligence committee investigation looking into Russias role in the 2016 election was back on track after the committees chairman had a secret meeting on White House grounds about intelligence that Trump later said vindicated his Obama wiretapping claims. A congressional aide said the documents are being made available for all committee members to view at the White House.Also, Republicans and Democrats have agreed on the witnesses to be called, Ryan said. Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., a member of the committee, told CNN that Rice is on the witness list. A congressional aide said there were more than a dozen people on the list. According to a U.S. official, Rice asked spy agencies to give her the names of Trump associates who surfaced in intelligence reports she was regularly briefed on. Rices official role would have given her the ability to make those requests for national security purposes.In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Rice acknowledged that she sometimes asked for the names of Americans referenced in reports. She would not say whether she saw intelligence related to Trump associates or whether she asked for their identities, though she did say that reports related to Russia increased in the final months of the presidential election campaign. The Trump White House has been particularly incensed that intercepted conversations between Flynn and Russias ambassador to the U.S. surfaced in news reports before the inauguration. Rice denied that she had leaked details about Flynns call, saying, I leaked nothing to nobody.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

However, Payne refused to be drawn into controversy over golf-loving current US President Donald Trump.A favorite to win the Masters this week, Rory McIlroy, had to defend himself for playing a round of golf with Trump in February. Trumps presidential campaign was nearly derailed last year by sexual harassment charges and his boasts about groping women.In contrast, McIlroy has taken a pro-woman stand in the battle for golf club membership, notably at Muirfield in Scotland, where members voted 80% in favor of admitting women earlier this year.Payne said he was proud of Augustas ties to US presidents over the years but had nothing to say about Trumps comments on issues other than golf.Several presidents, including one who was a member here, have been significant advocates and players of golf, and I think its only natural that someone who loves the game would espouse and be proud of that association, Payne said.Im not the one to judge, whatever, how his (Trumps) other remarks may have some influence on the game of golf, which is where my interest level resides exclusively.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/Andres Kudacki)The word TRUMP accompanied a swastika symbol drawn with a dark coloured chalk at the statue of the founder of a university here in the US state of Texas, in the third act of racist vandalism on the campus this month. The Nazi symbol was drawn on the base of the founder William Marsh Rices 2,000-pound statue in the heart of the Academic Quad lawn at Rice University, the Houston Chronicle reported. It accompanied the word TRUMP, referring to the new US President Donald Trump. The incident was the third act of racist vandalism on the campus this month. Rice was not Jewish although the prestigious university does have a large Jewish student population. I have had it with this behaviour, undergraduate dean John Hutchinson said in a statement released by the university that was also posted on Facebook. The use of the swastika clearly reveals that whoever did this is either ignorant of the history of true evil associated with this emblem of hate or is genuinely motivated by blind hatred.Watch what else is making news:If a student is discovered to have drawn the graffiti, he or she faces expulsion from the university, Hutchinson reportedly said. Meanwhile, similar signs were found in Chicago and New York too.

5937acf87be9e015d564c7a5,US court to hear arguments on Trump’s travel ban today,http://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-court-to-hear-arguments-on-trumps-travel-ban-today-4511494/,2017-02-07,"Republican President, Donald Trump has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism. Republican President, Donald Trump has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism.A US federal appeals court will hear arguments on Tuesday over whether to restore President Donald Trumps temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, the most controversial policy of his two-week old administration. In a brief filed on Monday, the Justice Department said last weeks suspension of Trumps order by a federal judge was too broad and at most should be limited to people who were already granted entry to the country and were temporarily abroad, or to those who want to leave and return to the United States. That language did not appear in the governments opening brief filed at the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, and could represent a softening of its position. Last Fridays ruling by US District Judge James Robart in Seattle suspending the travel ban opened a window for people from the seven affected countries to enter.Watch What Else Is Making News:The 9th Circuit in San Francisco on Monday asked lawyers for the states of Washington and Minnesota and the Justice Department to argue whether the ban should remain shelved. The court set oral argument for 3 pm PST (2300 GMT) on Tuesday.The new Republican president has said the travel measures are to protect the country against the threat of terrorism. Opponents say the 90-day ban is illegal, barring entry for citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen and imposing a 120-day halt to all refugees. National security veterans, major US technology companies and law enforcement officials from more than a dozen states backed a legal effort against the ban. The case may ultimately reach the US Supreme Court.Ten former US national security and foreign policy officials, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, filed a declaration in the court case arguing that the travel ban served no national security purposes.It was signed by former Secretaries of State John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, former national security adviser Susan Rice and former CIA Directors Michael Hayden and Michael Morell. Over the weekend, the San Francisco court denied the administrations request for an immediate suspension of the federal judges temporary restraining order that blocked the implementation of key parts of the travel ban while it considered the governments request in full.The court did say it would consider the governments request after receiving more information. Trump has reacted to challenges to the ban by attacking the federal judge in Seattle and then the wider court system.On a visit on Monday to the militarys Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, Trump defended his order. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11, he said. We need strong programs for people who love our country, Trump said, adding he did not want to allow people who want to destroy us and destroy our country into the United States.STATE OFFICIALS OPPOSE BANAttorneys general from 15 states and Washington, DC, filed a brief on Monday in support of the lawsuit against the travel ban. President Trumps executive order is unconstitutional, unlawful, and fundamentally un-American  and we wont stand by while it undermines our states families, economies, and institutions, said New York Democratic Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.Top technology companies, including Apple Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp were among nearly 100 corporations that filed a similar brief on Sunday with the appeals court, arguing the travel ban inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth.Elon Musks energy products company Tesla Inc and SpaceX joined the brief on Monday. Trump faces an uphill battle in the San Francisco court, which is dominated by liberal-leaning judges. Appeals courts are generally leery of upending the status quo, which in this case is the lower courts suspension of the ban. The appeals court was focusing on the narrow question of whether the district court had grounds to put the order on hold. The bigger legal fight over whether Trump had authority to issue the order will be addressed later in the litigation.Curbing entry to the United States as a national security measure was a central premise of Trumps campaign, originally proposed as a temporary ban on all Muslims. US presidents have in the past claimed sweeping powers to fight terrorism, but individuals, states and civil rights groups challenging the ban said his administration had offered no evidence it answered a threat.The New America think tank said all of the people who had carried out fatal attacks inspired by Islamist militancy in the United States since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks had been US citizens or legal residents. None of those attackers emigrated or came from a family that emigrated from one of the countries listed in the travel ban.A businessman who had never held public office until he assumed the presidency on January 20, Trump has vented his frustration over the legal challenges with a volley of attacks on the judiciary. Trump derided Robart as a so-called judge. On Sunday, he broadened his Twitter attacks on Robart, who was appointed by former Republican President George W Bush, to include the court system.Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril, Trump tweeted. If something happens blame him and court system. It is unusual for a sitting president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the US Constitution designates as a check on the power of the presidency and Congress. Democrats seized on Trumps remarks to raise questions about how independent his Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, might be.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The study was conducted on the request of HSPCB in districts which witnessed large-scale rice stubble burning: Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa, Sonipat and Yamunanagar.STUBBLE BURNING in Haryana was higher in 2016 compared to the previous two years, a new study has found. This has set alarm bells ringing for anti-pollution officials in the state because of its serious implications for air quality in the entire region, including the national capital.The study covered crop burning over four years  from 2013 to 2016. Satellite data for the study was acquired from National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, for the harvest period  early October to end-November, 2016  and has been analysed by scientists of Haryana Space Applications Centre (HarSAC).Watch What Else Is making NewsThe study was conducted on the request of Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( HSPCB) in the districts which witnessed large-scale rice stubble burning: Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa, Sonipat and Yamunanagar. The study was aimed at monitoring changes in the area over the years 2013, 2014, 2015 to assess the effect of campaign against rice stubble burning in open fields. These districts together account for more than 84 per cent of the states rice cultivation area.Paddy stubble was burnt over an area of 202.3 thousand hectares in 2016, 163 thousand hectares in 2015, 168.9 thousand hectares in 2014 and 208.3 thousand hectares in 2013. The area across which stubble was burnt saw a fall in 2014 and 2015. But 2016s data shows a sharp jump of 24.1 per cent.The figures are a cause for concern because it happened despite our intense campaign and increased surveillance against stubble burning, said S Narayanan, secretary, HSPCB.We will make more efforts in coordination with the state agriculture department to curb the problem, he added.Narayanan told The Indian Express that they had only recently received the report from HarSAC and that they would need to study it more before finalising the next course of action.The study indicates that area across which stubble is burnt was high in three northern districts of Karnal, Kaithal and Kurukshetra and the western district of Fatehabad. It has been found to be moderate in Sirsa, Ambala and Jind districts. The same trend was observed in these districts in 2013, 2014 and 2015 except for Jind district, which moved from less to the moderate category in 2016 due to increase in the area.Planting of rice in Haryana takes place in June and July and paddy is harvested from the first fortnight of October to the first fortnight of November. The HarSAC report has pointed out that mechanised combine harvesting, which has become common in the region, leaves behind large quantities of straw in the field. After harvest, the waste rice straw is frequently burned in open fields because there is insufficient time to dispose it of in a more controlled manner before the next crop is planted, the report said.Experts say that besides releasing polluting gases in the atmosphere, burning of stubble kills useful micro flora of the soil causing soil degradation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5937e9467be9e015d564d0d9,The Bull is in the Pen,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/racing-bull-jallikattu-bullock-cart-races-maharashtras-sangli-district-uttam-chavan-4519715/,2017-02-11,"The demo race in Wadgaon Kashimbeg (Express Photo by Atul Horizon) The demo race in Wadgaon Kashimbeg (Express Photo by Atul Horizon)Everyone in the Chavan household dotes on him. Their single-storey residence in Wategaon, a village in Maharashtras Sangli district, is named after him: Lakshya. So is the motorcycle thats parked at the entrance. Inside, his framed photos and trophies adorn the living room. He hasnt lost a single race, and he must have run in over 400. He is the Usain Bolt of bulls, says 55-year-old Uttam Chavan, with a note of pride in his voice.Grey, with white patches, a strong built and big horns painted a celebratory blue, Lakshya stands out among the cattle at the Chavans farm. His handlers  he needs half-a-dozen strong men to rein him in when he isnt tied  scuttle around in reverential unease around him. He charges if I come close or try to pet him, rues Chavans 29-year-old son Hanumant, But he fears my father and eats only if my wife feeds him. Although Lakshya spends at least nine of the 12 months at the Chavans farm, this isnt his permanent residence. Lakshyas owner, Kiran Raut, lives 50 km from Mumbai, in Badlapur, but city weather doesnt suit Lakshya. He loses appetite over there, says Chavan, who sold Lakshya to Raut eight years ago when he was 13 months old.Today, in rural Maharashtra, especially among those who follow the now-banned sport of bullock-cart races, Lakshya is something of a celebrity. Pictures of the bull and videos of his races are widely shared on WhatsApp. A 15-minute documentary, Racing Bull Lakshya, chronicling his accolades, was recently made by a fan. There are many strong bulls around, but none like Lakshya. He injured himself a year ago and had to undergo a surgery on his foreleg, but that hasnt hampered his speed one bit, says Hanumant.Racing Bull Lakshya (Express Photo) Racing Bull Lakshya (Express Photo)However, its now been two years since Lakshya ran a race. The ban on bullock cart races came into effect in 2014 alongside the controversial Jallikattu. While the ban on the latter was lifted by passing a draft ordinance late last month, Maharashtra still prohibits the use of bulls for sport or exhibition. This has caused great displeasure among the states agrarian community, which has held a number of protests over the last year. On January 28 and 29, over 15,000 people came together in Khed to demand a lifting of the ban. The bullock cart races are part of a 300-year-old tradition and an integral part of our jatras (annual village fairs). If the practice is banned forever, it will not only wipe out a tradition but also affect the local economy that revolves around the jatras. Besides, Jallikattu may involve animal cruelty, but the races dont, points out Ram Krishna Takalkar of the Akhil Bharatiya Bailgada Sharyat Sanghatna, the key petitioner demanding the lifting of ban on sports involving the bull.From 300 ft to 3 km, the track lengths for the bullock-cart races vary as do the number of bulls that race together. However, the Sanghatna is batting for the sports revival chiefly on the basis of the format practised in western Maharashtra. Called bailgada, it has the bulls running with a small unmanned cart across a track between 350-450 ft long. A team or cart has four bulls tied together and only one team can run across the track at a time. The set of bulls with the best time wins. It takes them between 10 and 15 seconds to run the distance and the carts arent even manned, so there is no point of animal cruelty, as People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) claims, asserts Takalkar.PETA begs to differ. Poorva Joshipura, India CEO, categorically states: There is no debate. No amount of regulation can eliminate the cruelty inherent in racing bulls, as the Supreme Court has found.Takalkar says, We accept there is five per cent cruelty towards the animal. If the government objects to the distance the bull runs in certain formats, we are willing to cut down to 500 ft. We will even reach out to farmers who organise races where the carts are manned and get them to stop. But a blanket ban isnt a solution. Former MLA and party member of NCP, Dilip Walse Patil, goes a step further: The solution isnt the passing of ordinance by Maharashtra government. That can be challenged in the apex court. Ideally, the ordinance should be signed by the President, or an amendment be made to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, removing bulls from the list, he says.The anger against PETA, a foreign organisation with no understanding of Indian agrarian culture, is palpable in most villages. Those people sit in air-conditioned rooms and make decisions about our lives, assuming that we are cruel. The bull is like a son to a farmer who may not eat himself, but will ensure that the bull gets his daily diet, says Mayur Wable, resident of Mancher village, Pune district, who rears bulls for racing. These bulls arent used for farm work and many farmers have air-conditioned cattle sheds for the summers. They are trained just to race, he says.The average daily expense for a bulls maintenance is between Rs 300 and Rs 500. Lakshyas caretakers spend up to Rs 2,500 feeding him  apart from the usual fare of hay, carrots, groundnuts, grains  a mixture of jaggery, cashews, pistachios, almonds and rice oil, a kilo in the morning and another for dinner. A bull will participate in up to 20 races in a year, with at least a 10-day gap between each race. If it runs for 15 seconds in each, the bull runs for no more than 10 minutes a year. If I take care of my son all his life, do I not have the right to ask him to run for 10 minutes every year? says Chavan.A bull is at its prime for eight to nine years and lives up to 18 years. The rearers say they dont sell them off to the slaughterhouse once theyre old. We take care till their last day and when they die, we perform the last rites the way we would of a family member, says Wable.Agitated bull rearers in Narayangaon (Express Photo) Agitated bull rearers in Narayangaon (Express Photo)Locally bred, the bulls are chosen for their strength and speed when they are five or six months old. The ones that dont fare well in the test are employed for farm work. Most bulls are castrated to ensure their strength. While the association for bull cart racing uses the breeding argument to make a point about preserving local pedigree, it seems like an afterthought. Most of us own tractors. The use of bulls in farm work is declining. If we dont use them for races, the local breeds will die out, says Rahul Banker, a member of the Narayangaon association.The association is also keen to distance itself from the caste aspect (Jallikattu excludes Dalit participation). We have members from all communities participating, be it Dalits or Mohammadens, says Banker. But as political analyst Anand Teltumbde points out, How many Dalit farmers can afford to rear a bull at that cost?In the village of Wadgaon Kashimbeg, there are murmurs of a race at 3 pm on the sly. Its not an uncommon occurrence in the jatra season, between January and May. The word will spread among the bull owners, and those from nearby villages will assemble with their animals on race day. These races are attended by a smaller crowd in order to avoid attention. But at 4 pm, the venue wears a deserted look. It was cancelled as the cops seemed to have found out, one farmer reveals. To make up for the loss, an impromptu demo race is organised nearby. A crowd lines up on both sides of the 350-ft track. Soon, two bulls are dragged to the starting point by half-a-dozen men. The bigger of the two, Raju, is fastened to the cart, locally known as gada, but Arjun is defiant. In a moment of confusion, the men let go of the reins and before anyone realises, Arjun has pushed his handler to the ground, scaled the fencing wall and run off into the wild. There is pandemonium in the crowd. However, before they can leave, the handlers are back with Arjun. He is still defiant but this time, another pair of hands are employed in fastening him to the cart. He is then let loose. The crowd bursts into a roaring applause as the two bulls take flight, leaving behind a cloud of dust.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Another 49 injured in landslides were hospitalised.""Most of the fatalities were due to landslides and only a very few drowned,"" said government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne who is also the health minister.He said nearly 500,000 people were forced from their homes and most of them had moved into temporary shelters.The military led search operations in landslide-hit areas and the airforce deployed five aircraft for rescue operations and another five to transport emergency supplies to villagers who could not be reached by road.At the village of Bulathsinhala, relatives were seen loading coffins of 10 victims onto armoured personnel carriers to transport them across flooded streets to higher ground for burial.The military vehicles also ferried villagers along roads converted into riverways by the rainfall, passing submerged traffic signs and flooded houses.There were similar scenes in the adjoining Ratnapura district, the island's gem capital, which was also flooded. The authorities arranged funerals for dozens of victims.WATCH: Rescue workers intensify search for survivorsThe deluge caused the Nilwala river to burst its banks, threatening to submerge a large number of villages, the DMC said.It warned thousands of villagers living near the Nilwala to evacuate to higher ground.President Maithripala Sirisena, who returned from a state visit to Australia, travelled to Kalutara, one of the worst affected districts south of Colombo, to supervise relief operations.""The government will give new houses to those who lost their houses,"" he tweeted.The authorities dropped thousands of life jackets for marooned people in a bid to protect them until they could be moved to safer ground.International aidAn Indian naval ship equipped with medical supplies docked in Colombo Saturday and a second vessel was expected on Monday, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.The United Nations said it will give water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organisation will support medical teams in affected areas.Save the Children warned of a potential increase in dengue cases in the country.The charity's Sri Lanka country director Chris McIvo said: ""We're particularly worried we could start seeing a further increase in the number of dengue cases because of the stagnant water that the floods will leave in their wake.""Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies. Islamabad recently gave 10,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka to help drought victims.The meterological department said the rains ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydropower generation.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful monsoon, officials said.Monsoon rains last year caused flooding and landslides, killing over 100 people."

As I step back to appreciate the artwork, I realise I am surrounded by colour-tinted glass walls and a mirrored ceiling.The pan Asian restaurant has a promising allure to it with its iron-clad chic interiors comprising high chair seating, glass table that lights up and the vintage mirrors suspended from the ceiling. The art enthusiast in me was already impressed and it was time to find out if my palate felt the same. Their specially curated menu has steamed, fried and wok-tossed food with popular flavours from south eastern countries.The acidity of the lime juice, balanced with the coconut milk, combined with Thai spices, galangal, kaffir and lemon grass makes Misus Tom Yum soup one of the best that I have had so far. The soup is clear, flavourful and the spice hit is just right. If you are a soup afficianado, heres the place for you.The Spicy Pomelo Salad honestly was a beauty to look at. I didnt have the heart to fork in and disturb the beautiful ensemble of pomelo, red chillies and cashew nuts. The fresh juicy burst of pomelo spiced with roasted chilli and the crunch of the cashew nuts give it one of the most unique flavours on the table. The Larb Gai inches towards subtle and fresh flavours of the produce. The Thai minced-chicken salad blends well with roasted rice, lime and mint.Among appetisers, the Soft Shell Crabs with Garlic Pepper absolutely aces in terms of the cooking technique and the spice combination. Are you frowning right now because you are a vegetarian? Well, fret not. The restaurants Turnip Cake has got you covered. The mushroom and turnip cake is cooked well to smoothness and the crunchy bits of garlic will have you salivating for more.The Pla Neung Manao is as healthy and tasty as a fish can get. The steamed red snapper is cooked just right and lays in a pool of curry that has subtle flavours of garlic, chilli and oyster sauce. Of all the appetisers in the non-vegetarian section, the Ikan Pepe was the most popular dish on the table. The Indonesian grilled fish came in with its sense of mystery, wrapped in a banana leaf and tasted of fresh garlic and ginger that had blended really well with the fish.Among dimsums, we went for the chef recommended Rainbow Dumplings. The dimsums are cooked well with a stuffing of mushrooms and bokchoy. I was in love with the Spicy Tofu Avocado Maki. Rolled with sticky rice, spicy tofu, avocado, cucumber and lettuce, the fresh flavours will capture your palate with wonder. The maki is served with slices of picked ginger that sits beautiful in the corner of the plate along with wasabi.Honestly, at this point I was beyond full, but was damned by curiosity on what the chefs main course picks were and thus, fellow foodies, I marched on.The Stir-Fried and Curries with Jasmine Rice looked quite enticing when it came to the table. The jasmine rice is very refreshing, I wouldnt mind having it all day without the curry or sauces, which by the way were cooked to a tee with great flavours. I mixed the rice with a brothy blend of mushroom, bokchoy, chinese cabbage and bamboo shoot. This one scored high on nutrition and subtle flavours.In the Meal In a Bowl section, we had the Khow Suey Chicken. It was quite a package and one that I didnt expect. It is a one-pot meal of noodles cooked in coconut milk along with small bowls of peanuts, egg, fried garlic, lime slice and light soy. The mix of coconut milk and noodles, topped with peanuts and fried garlic is what all of us need in our life right now. It has a smooth texture and taste, with bits of peanut and garlic crunch.From desserts, we had the Singapore Style Ice Cream Sandwich and Crispy Banana Cinnamon Bao with Nuttela. I enjoyed both the desserts, but if you were to force me to pick one, I would say go for the bao. Why? Well, who says no to Nuttela?Cost for two: `1,400"

Everybody is a foul person. Show us the investment proof. Bring in the farmers who received the machines.The NGTs order came on a plea by environmentalist Vikrant Tongad who had sought a ban on burning of agricultural waste and remnants in open fields.The pollution caused by these fires travel to Delhi because of the westerly winds, causing major health concerns among people, say environment experts.Apart from the lungs, the smoke also affects the brain, eyes and the nervous system, say doctors.A study by IIT Kanpur has listed stubble burning as the third highest contributor to Delhis winter air-pollution, after construction dust and vehicular fumes.The green court had earlier fixed the environment compensation amounts per incident of crop burning to be paid by small land owners having less than two acres of land at R 2,500, medium land owners holding over two acres and less than five acres at R 5,000 and those owning over five acres at R 15,000.It had also directed the state governments to take coercive and punitive action against persistent defaulters of crop residue burning and asked them to withdraw the assistance provided to such farmers.It had said that the five states -- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Delhi -- which have issued notifications prohibiting agriculture crop residue burning should ensure that these are enforced rigorously and proper action is taken against the defaulters.The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Prevention and Control Authority (EPCA) in April had also expressed concern over the crop burning gaining pace in the northern region. The EPCA, which has been spearheading crucial anti-pollution measures, warned the state governments of the northern states to stop being in denial and get their act together.According to satellite data, as pointed out by EPCA, the agricultural landscape of Punjab and Haryana is dotted with fires billowing out pollutant-laden smoke as farmers have set fire to the residues of the Rabi crop to usher in the Kharif season."

Questions have been raised whether the polished rice, which reportedly lacks nutrients, supplied through the public distribution system to BPL families in the state is edible at all. However, food and civil supplies minister U T Khader defended the scheme and said the reports by private medical institutes cannot be considered as a final verdict.I don't think the law minister meant to say the rice supplied under the Anna Bhagya scheme was faulty. He may have only meant that the government is trying to balance the diet of people by adding tur dal under the scheme.No. But I will be speaking to the law minister in this regard and cross-check the matter.The rice is provided to us by the central government via the Food Corporation of India (FCI). Till now, all reports suggest that people are healthy and fine.We cannot take all reports by private medical institutes at face value. We have to also look at under what context they have prepared the reports. Today, one report may suggest that the rice is good and the next day, another may say it's bad for health. Some doctors claim wheat is good for diabetes, others say rice is better. So who will you believe? The reports must be authentic.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an individual must consume foods like rice that are rich in carbohydrates to the tune of 14 kg per month. We are providing half of that which is 7 kg per month. We cannot reduce it further. Moreover, we are balancing the diet as per the staple foodgrain in each region like jowar in north Karnataka and ragi in southern parts of the state."

The government has failed to come up with any income generating projects either, he said.The idea mooted under the banner of KIIFB was to source money for infrastructure development through a non-budgetary route. In the two budgets, projects worth `50,000 crore were announced. But no project was started till date, Mani said.Mani said after launching a propaganda the security component of KSFE chits will be transferred to the Kerala Infrastructure and Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), nothing was done to amend Chitty Act or approach the Reserve Bank for permission.Income generating projects mooted by the former government like the Kochi Metro, Kannur airport or the Vizhinjam project have not been piloted. The revenue of the state is bound to go up three-fold once the GST is implemented in the country, he said.Prices of essential commodities have doubled, against a promise that it will be kept at the same level for five years. Middlemen have siphoned off the subsidy amount given to bring rice to the state at a lower price. Ration cards have not been distributed. Mani said the fee for medical courses, which was hiked at the rate of 10 per cent annually for five years under the former government, has been jacked up to 115 per cent in a single year now. Five medical colleges started by the former government have been closed down, he said.Words of praiseMani, however, had a few words of praise. Total electrification in the state is indeed an achievement of the government. Progress in the Life Mission project is a solace to the poor. Decision to continue the Karunya project initiated by me is commendable. Announcement that the income support scheme for rubber growers will continue is a welcome sign, he said."

Farmers of Koraput, Jeypore, Kotpad, Borrigumma and Kundra had cultivated paddy in over 30,000 hectares of land in the rabi season. Crops in 3,000 hectares have been harvested. The Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies would procure 4,000 quintals of paddy from farmers in each mandi. The mandis would operate thrice a week. However, procurement in the mandis would be enhanced only after taking into consideration the flow of paddy.Sources said as only eight millers of Koraput district are eligible for participating in procurement at mandis, the administration has invited millers of Kalahandi to lift stocks from Koraput farmers in the mandis.Rice delivery by millers under custom milling system has been going on at a snails pace in the district due to non-availability of government godowns. About 90 millers have not given 75 per cent of their targeted rice under the system.As a result, they have been disqualified for participation in procurement.On Friday, the administration opened mandis at Kaliagam, Jeypore and Dangar Paunsi villages and procured 3,000 quintals paddy from farmers.Earlier, it was decided to start the mandis from May 20 and the government has targeted to procure about 3.5 lakh quintals paddy from farmers for the rabi season thorough 20 mandis in the district."

Here is my pick of the best dishes and the ones that failed to impress.Whats good?Seegadi Kal Menasu: The prawns have a natural sweetness and it becomes important to retain its essence along with the spices you use. The prawns tossed up in black pepper and curry leaves comes together to delight the diners.Kothimiri Koli Saaru with Akki roti: Again, the rich and intense flavours do the talking here. This chicken in a coriander and coconut gravy was one of the highlights of the evening. I think this was that kind of dish that makes you say wow. I would suggest to have this with Akki roti, one of the best I have ever had.Urida Mamsa: Cooking lamb is challenging when you have diners coming in with different preferences and palates. Some like their lamb to be tender and soft and others prefer it to be a bit chewy. When it comes to lamb chops, I prefer the latter and the chef did a great job here marrying the lamb chops with roast spice masala.Meen Huli: This fresh seer fish cooked with tamarind and tomatoes was so simple, nothing extraordinary yet such that it stands out.Whats bad?Mavinakai Annam (raw mango rice): There was no essence of raw mango in the rice at all, it was bland. This was the only let down and I am sure this will be rectified.Whats Ugly?Absolutely nothing.The Vijayanagara Feast is on until June 4 from 7.30 pm to 11.30 pmCost: D1950 + taxes"

These terrorists are antipeople. We found their bodies while conducting rescue operations (on Saturday),"" regional military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Jo-ar Herrera told AFP.An AFP photographer saw another eight bodies by a road in the outskirts of Marawi today, with local residents identifying them as employees of a rice mill and a medical college.Herrera said the military had yet to investigate the reported deaths.The violence began when dozens of gunmen went on a rampage throughout Marawi after security forces attempted to arrest Isnilon Hapilon, a veteran Filipino militant regarded as the local leader of IS.The gunmen planted black IS flags, took a priest and up to 14 other people hostage from a church, and set fire to buildings.Thirteen soldiers, two policemen and 51 militants have died in the fighting, according to authorities. This brings the combined official death toll to at least 85.Most of the city's residents have fled because of the fighting, which has seen the military heavily bomb residential areas where the militants were believed to be hiding.The military announced on Saturday, the start of the Holy month of Ramadan, that it would intensify the bombing campaign.""In as much as we would like to avoid collateral damage, these rebels are forcing the hand of government by hiding and holding out inside private homes, government buildings and other facilities,"" military spokesman Brigadier-General Restituto Padilla said.""Their refusal to surrender is holding the city captive.Hence, it is now increasingly becoming necessary to use more surgical airstrikes to clear the city and to bring this rebellion to a quicker end.""Duterte and military chiefs have said most of the militants belong to the local Maute group, which they estimate has about 260 armed followers and has declared allegiance to IS.But Duterte has said local criminals are backing the Maute in Marawi."

Another 49 injured in landslides were hospitalised.""Most of the fatalities were due to landslides and only a very few drowned,"" said government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne who is also the health minister.He said nearly 500,000 people were forced from their homes and most of them had moved into temporary shelters.The military led search operations in landslide-hit areas and the airforce deployed five aircraft for rescue operations and another five to transport emergency supplies to villagers who could not be reached by road.At the village of Bulathsinhala, relatives were seen loading coffins of 10 victims onto armoured personnel carriers to transport them across flooded streets to higher ground for burial.The military vehicles also ferried villagers along roads converted into riverways by the rainfall, passing submerged traffic signs and flooded houses.There were similar scenes in the adjoining Ratnapura district, the island's gem capital, which was also flooded. The authorities arranged funerals for dozens of victims.WATCH: Rescue workers intensify search for survivorsThe deluge caused the Nilwala river to burst its banks, threatening to submerge a large number of villages, the DMC said.It warned thousands of villagers living near the Nilwala to evacuate to higher ground.President Maithripala Sirisena, who returned from a state visit to Australia, travelled to Kalutara, one of the worst affected districts south of Colombo, to supervise relief operations.""The government will give new houses to those who lost their houses,"" he tweeted.The authorities dropped thousands of life jackets for marooned people in a bid to protect them until they could be moved to safer ground.International aidAn Indian naval ship equipped with medical supplies docked in Colombo Saturday and a second vessel was expected on Monday, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.The United Nations said it will give water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organisation will support medical teams in affected areas.Save the Children warned of a potential increase in dengue cases in the country.The charity's Sri Lanka country director Chris McIvo said: ""We're particularly worried we could start seeing a further increase in the number of dengue cases because of the stagnant water that the floods will leave in their wake.""Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies. Islamabad recently gave 10,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka to help drought victims.The meterological department said the rains ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydropower generation.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful monsoon, officials said.Monsoon rains last year caused flooding and landslides, killing over 100 people."

This is to ascertain whether the goods had actually changed hands or the money was merely transferred through such transactions.There are suspicions that foreign exchange was transferred or brought in, under the garb of exim deals. The deals have taken place in a single private bank which is also under scanner, said sources in the ED, who preferred not to disclose the bank's name. The investigations are continuing since more than last six months. Each individual concerned is being asked to submit the papers such as invoices and customs documents to prove that their exim transactions were genuine.In some of the cases, the parties have not responded to the ED's query, which is leading to the delay in concluding the probe. However, the agency will now be taking a strict stance against such persons, said a source.In Hawala trade, as it is called in business jargon, money is transferred in and out the country in such deals under the guise of imports or exports. There is no movement of goods but the funds are transferred using a bank channel. The connivance of bank officials is also needed in the racket, said a source.In this case, the products include machinery, scrap, steel, rice apart from a number of other items, said source.The investigation has begun on the basis of list supplied by ministry of finance and is a part of a nation wide exercise. The local offices are scanning each and every suspect case. The transactions are around four years old. The current action comes after a Rs6,500 crore forex transfer that came to fore in Bank of Baroda in 2015.In some of the cases, the concerned businessmen have taken a plea since the transactions are old and the papers have not been preserved. However, papers for at least 3-4 years old deals are expected to be preserved by the business firms, said sources.Post demonetization, entities like cooperative banks and societies have also come under ED's scanner. The agency also recently attached the assets of two companies involved in the coal block allocation scheme."

Four bags of rice, which was their only ration, was left soaking wet | Nagaraja GadekalBENGALURU: The woman of the house, with help from other family members, spent long hours on Friday night emptying the kitchen of four bags of soggy rice. This was the only ration left for her family of four. The scene played out at Anepalya in Neelasandra, one of the worst affected areas on Friday night. Similar was the plight of most residents there.The residents of about 10 houses at one end of Anepalya spent a sleepless night as water entered their homes and they were forced to stay outside till early morning. Rafeeq Khan, one of the residents, said, The drains were partially clogged with garbage and hence water overflowed from them. It took us until morning to clean up everything. This reminded us of a day last year when bicycles were floating outside and we couldnt open our doors because of the water.Amreen Taj, a resident of Anepalya, was among those who had to clear out the water from her house with buckets on Saturday morning. She said, The water began to enter on Friday night and its level increased to this much, she said, pointing to a mark on the leg of a cot. While Amreen managed to sleep in her house, many others had to move to neighbours homes to spend the night.Syed Salim, another resident, worked overnight to help people and was supervising an excavator which was clearing the way for water to flow into the nearby storm water drain (SWD). He said, The reason why water accumulates here is because this SWD hasnt been desilted in a very long time. If that is done, all these problems will end.Salim estimated that water entered about 40-50 houses in Anepalya. The BBMP ward corporator Balakrishnan G said desilting will be carried out on Monday.The extent of the problem was lesser in Bilekahalli, where the streets were filled with water and entered the basements of buildings.At Rupa Purushottams house, a pump was used to clear out water from the basement throughout Saturday. Another resident of the area, referring to the water-logging, said, The nearby SWD is not being desilted.However, the ward corporator K Narayan Raju said desilting had been carried out just four months ago, and added that the water-logging was because some areas were low-lying with respect to the SWD.He said, Weve built a new drain for low-lying areas, so the problem shouldnt occur again. Also, one of the reasons SWDs get clogged is that people throw so much garbage into them."

He crossed the border into India after an epic 15-day journey on foot from the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, over the Himalayan mountains.The Dalai Lama said even in the name of religion and religious systems, there were some feudal practices and ""it should not be there.""Stating that through education caste-related injustice could be wiped out, the Dalai Lama underlined the need for eliminating the feeling of inferiority in certain sections of the people.""...so that there is a sense of equality, so that they can build self-confidence. Through self-confidence, hard work and education one can achieve equality,"" he said.On ancient Indian values and knowledge, the Dalai Lama said it must be revived in the country, as ""it is not ancient, but most relevant.""He said ancient Indian knowledge and values along with modern technology can do great for the country as one can attain mental comfort with ancient knowledge and physical comfort through modern knowledge.""...ancient knowledge and values side-by-side with modern science is worthy for the society,"" he said.Noting that everybody wants to be happy and have that right, he said, ""if we consider rest of the humanity as brothers and sisters, there is no chance for exploitation.""Buddha dharma is Indian dharma as most of its teachings and knowledge came from the country,"" he said, adding that ancient Indian values like karuna and ahimsa had reached millions of people across the world with the spread of Buddhism.He also pointed out out that like in many other religions, Buddhism had also different philosophies originating from different schools of thought.""We need different philosophical views. Wonderful people with great teachings have come form from diverse faith and philosophical backgrounds, but with a common message of love and compassion, as also good 'karma'.""Any activity which brings happiness is a positive karma and what makes uncomfortable is negative karma,"" he added.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and leader of Congress party in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge participated in the seminar organised by the Social Justice Department of Karnataka government to commemorate Ambedkar's 125th birth anniversary."

The local police and intelligence officials were also keeping a tab on Shoaib's close friends and relatives.""Upon learning that he was expected to come to his home town and land at Kozhikode airport, a team of crime branch officials went there and with the help of local police, we arrested him,"" Bhatt said.He will be produced before a court in Ahmedabad today for remand.So far, 79 accused have been arrested in the case and a chargesheet has been filed against them.With Shoaib's arrest, the number of people being held has gone up to 80.The city crime branch had recently brought here Yasin Bhatkal, one of the main operatives of Indian Mujahideen, for questioning in connection with the 2008 city serial blasts case.Bhatkal is presently in the custody of the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Eighteen blasts had rocked the city on July 26, 2008 in which 56 people were killed and over 150 injured."

Due to education and awareness , there are a few attempts at shunning these rituals . A dalit couple, who entered into married life in Gadag on Friday, shunned these rituals and followed the teachings of Buddha, Basava and Ambedkar.The marriage was a different experience as there was no chanting of hymns in Sanskrit but there was prayer of Buddha and reading of Basavanna's vachanas in Kannada. Instead of rice grains, the couple was blessed with flower petals by relatives and well-wishers.Somashekhar Sanninganavar, a postal employee, said it was his dream to get married as per the teachings of Buddha, Basavanna and Ambedkar. ""It it was difficult to convince all my family members but I took the help of a few likeminded ones. I was fortunate to get my fiancee's cooperation,"" he said.Nijalingappa Kale, his paternal uncle and an auditor in the cooperative department, said he got a call from the groom seeking his help to convince his parents ten days ago.""When we said there would be no showering of rice grains, everyone was furious. We formed a network of relatives and friends to work on this so that everyone could be persuaded. After discussions for a week, all the family members agreed to it,"" he said.Mallappa Sanninganavar, the groom's father and a police sub-inspector, said that he was worried about societal reaction. ""We're happy that we have set an example,"" he said.The bride Pratibha Bellad, a diploma holder in education, said she had been thinking about getting married in a progressive way since her college days. ""But my priority was to get married as per my mother's wish. My mother is a widow and I wanted to keep her happy. When Somashekhar expressed his interest in such a marriage, I told my mother about it. She did not agree initially but after several rounds of discussion, she finally agreed to it. She wants me to be happy and said my choice is hers,"" she said.Basavanand Swamiji of Nargund said there was strong resistance for simple and progressive marriages in the 12th century. ""Despite resistance from society and rulers, Basavanna and other sharanas could shun orthodox marriages. Today, there is a need to spread awareness about such marriages.""Veteran writers Allamaprabhu Betadur, SS Harlapur, AB Hiremath, Basavaraj Hugar, DSS leader Venkateshayya and others were present at the marriage.The couple presented copies of the book 'Naanu Hindu Aagi Sayalaare: Dr BR Ambedkar' compiled by Sadashi Marji to all attendees at the wedding. The couple exchanged Vachana Samputa compiled by slain scholar MM Kalburgi as a token of love."

Almost half a million Sri Lankans had been forced from their homes, with most moving into temporary shelters.The charity Save the Children said about a tenth of those displaced were children below the age of five years.It said raised fears of stagnant flood waters becoming breeding grounds for dengue spreading mosquitos and noted that young children were more vulnerable.Medical teams were dispatched to the worst-affected areas to help prevent an outbreak of waterborne diseases.""We have the expertise to deal with this situation,"" Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said, adding cholera and diarrhoea had been successfully prevented in past floods.The government withdrew an evacuation order for thousands of residents in the southern district of Matara as water levels subsided.""The threat of floods around the (river) Nilvala has subsided,"" irrigation department director M. Thuraisingham said.""The flood levels near Colombo have also gone down because we did not have rain in the past 24 hours.""Water levels in Ratnapura, Sri Lanka's gem district east of Colombo, subsided but many villages in Kalutara, south of the capital, were still under water, officials said.- Aid arrives -The military has deployed helicopters, boats as well as amphibious vehicles to distribute aid pouring in from residents in areas unaffected by the floods.The government appealed for bottled water, new clothes and dry rations for those displaced.Sri Lanka has also sought international assistance, with India rushing a naval ship equipped with a medical team and other supplies on Saturday.A second Indian vessel was due to arrive in Colombo on Sunday, with a third expected on Monday, the government said.The United Nations said it will give water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organization will support medical teams in affected areas.Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies. Islamabad recently gave 10,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka to help drought victims.The meteorological department said the rains ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydropower generation.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful monsoon, officials said.Monsoon rains last year caused flooding and landslides, killing more than 100 people."

Another 49 injured in landslides were hospitalised.""Most of the fatalities were due to landslides and only a very few drowned,"" said government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne who is also the health minister.He said nearly 500,000 people were forced from their homes and most of them had moved into temporary shelters.The military led search operations in landslide-hit areas and the airforce deployed five aircraft for rescue operations and another five to transport emergency supplies to villagers who could not be reached by road.At the village of Bulathsinhala, relatives were seen loading coffins of 10 victims onto armoured personnel carriers to transport them across flooded streets to higher ground for burial.The military vehicles also ferried villagers along roads converted into riverways by the rainfall, passing submerged traffic signs and flooded houses.There were similar scenes in the adjoining Ratnapura district, the island's gem capital, which was also flooded. The authorities arranged funerals for dozens of victims.WATCH: Rescue workers intensify search for survivorsThe deluge caused the Nilwala river to burst its banks, threatening to submerge a large number of villages, the DMC said.It warned thousands of villagers living near the Nilwala to evacuate to higher ground.President Maithripala Sirisena, who returned from a state visit to Australia, travelled to Kalutara, one of the worst affected districts south of Colombo, to supervise relief operations.""The government will give new houses to those who lost their houses,"" he tweeted.The authorities dropped thousands of life jackets for marooned people in a bid to protect them until they could be moved to safer ground.International aidAn Indian naval ship equipped with medical supplies docked in Colombo Saturday and a second vessel was expected on Monday, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.The United Nations said it will give water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organisation will support medical teams in affected areas.Save the Children warned of a potential increase in dengue cases in the country.The charity's Sri Lanka country director Chris McIvo said: ""We're particularly worried we could start seeing a further increase in the number of dengue cases because of the stagnant water that the floods will leave in their wake.""Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies.

The firm, identified as MitraSen Rajesh Kumar of Karnal , is a broker for rice shellers and commission agents. The nexus came to light after the a team headed by joint commissioner of income tax (JCIT) Vandana Mohite raided the firm's premises at the new grain market in Karnal.The team, which included three income tax officers, recovered a cash of Rs 1.11 crore from the premises. The investigations wing headed by a deputy director level officer too was rushed to the premises. The entire operations were closely monitored by K S Jain, principal chief commissioner of income tax, Northern Western Region , and chief commissioner of income tax, Haryana, Sunita Puri, principal commissioner, Karnal, P S Tomar supervised the field operations.""The team had gone for a routine survey during which documents like signed blank cheque books of Delhi-based bogus parties were found from whom only bills were taken. It was detected that the proprietary concern was giving fake entries to the tune of several hundreds of crores of rupees of rice purchase and sales to different rice millers and shellers after obtaining a commission from them. This raised an eyebrow and we informed our bosses in Chandigarh,'' said Vandana.The investigation team is on the job and accommodation entries and the number of beneficiaries will be quantified after investigation is over. With the help of accommodation entries, the beneficiary rice millers have reduced taxable income causing huge loss to the state exchequer by evading VAT and Mandi Tax, etc, Vandana added."

Pottanikkal, a Mallapuram resident, is a key accused in the July 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts and in the case pertaining to the planting of 29 bombs in Surat.According to crime branch sources, Pottanikkal had been living in Dubai for nine years. Sources said that Pottanikkal had been recently jailed in Dubai as his passport  bearing the number F 8012606  had expired in 2016. An emergency certificate was issued by the Indian authorities to enable his deportation, sources said. After the initial interrogation by various agencies in Kerala, he was handed over to the Gujarat Police. His arrest is a major breakthrough for the investigating agencies as he could spill the beans on other absconding terrorists including C A M Basheer and Riyaz Bhatkal ""Pottanikkal was with another IM operative in Dubai. We are expecting his arrest soon,"" a senior crime branch official said. His name first figured in the confession of E T Sainuddin alias Sathar Bhai, who was arrested in 2009 for his alleged connection with bomb blasts at various places in India.Deputy commissioner of police, Ahmedabad crime branch, Deepan Bhadran said that a specific tip-off had been received that Pottanikkal would arrive in Kerala. A team led by ACP B C Solanki, inspector S L Chaudhary, and sub-inspector J M Patel was despatched to Kerala.""With the help of central agencies and Kerala Police, we identified Pottanikkal as he approached the immigration counter and picked him up,"" Bhadran said. ""Pottanikkal was flown to Ahmedabad on Wednesday morning. He has been arrested in the serial blasts case.""Investigators said Pottanikkal had put Sainuddin and Surfuddin in touch with the Bhatkals. The brothers wanted Sainuddin, who is an expert in electronics, to devise integrated chips to be used as timer devices in bombs. ""While the 20 bombs placed in Ahmedabad killed 56 and injured more than 240, the bombs in Surat did not explode because of faulty timer chips,"" the senior crime branch official said. ""Sainuddin and Surfuddin had to face the wrath of the Bhatkal brothers for the blunder.""Senior crime branch officials said that Pottanikkal comes from a wealthy family. His father, Abdul Qadar, owns a rice mill in Mallapuram. ""His brother lives abroad. It is learnt through sources that Pottanikkal's main aim was to join the D gang of Dawood Ibrahim and take part in more terrorist activities,"" the official said.A court has granted police remand for Pottanikkal till June 2 for questioning over the Civil hospital blast which killed more than 42 people. Till now, 79 accused have been arrested in the serial blasts case. Eighteen, including Bhatkal brothers and Abdul Subhal alias Tuakeer, are still absconding.Investigators said Pottanikkalwas very close to IM founders, Riyaz and Iqbal Bhatkal, and to Yasin Bhatkal. ""We are probing others who were in touch with Pottenikkal,"" an investigator said."

This rather unthoughtful decision has caused panic and distress among the poor who cannot afford to purchase costly ration, Hridayesh said, demanding the BJP government immediately bring down the prices of the subsidised rice and wheat to the earlier slab.The APL families will have to shell out Rs 8.60 and Rs 15 to buy wheat and rice per kg respectively, for which they used to pay Rs 5 and Rs 9 before the price hike. To add to their woes the government has also banned the supply of subsidised sugar for them.Hridayesh claimed that the previous Congress government introduced the State Food Security Act to ensure that 45 lakh APL families could easily access subsidised ration. The legal provision was introduced for the left-out APL families which couldnt be covered under the National Food Security Act.Former minister Pritam Singh took a dig at the Rawat government, saying doubling the prices of subsidised ration for the poor was its only achievement since it formation a little over a month ago.Parliamentary affairs minister Prakash Pant defended the governments decision to hike prices. The prices were hiked in view of the market situation and the paying capacity of the APL families, he said.Unconvinced by the reply, angry Opposition members trooped into to the well of the House while sloganeering against the anti-poor Rawat government. In the din that followed, Speaker Prem Chandra Aggarwal rejected the oppositions demand for a debate on the issue of price hike of the subsidised ration.Angry opposition members staged a walkout in protest. The House witnessed uproarious scenes during zero hour as well. As soon as it began, BJP legislator Deshraj Karnawal thanked the Chair for accepting his request to put Dalit icon BR Ambedkars portraits on the walls of the Vidhan Sabha Bhawan.His statement evoked a sharp reaction from the opposition members who again trooped into the well of House to protest. An irate Congress legislator GS Kunjwal drew the Houses attention to vandalisation of Ambedkars statues in Pithoragarh and Almora.The former Speaker questioned Karnawal for not raising such a sensitive issue. This led to heated arguments from both sides, forcing Pant and Hridayesh to intervene. The legacy left behind by Babasaheb belongs to all of us. So, no one should try to appropriate that legacy, Hridayesh said.Later, Pant tabled the Uttarakhand Cooperative Committee (Amendment) Bill, 2017 in the House, which was passed by a voice vote. He also tabled the State Goods and Services Tax Bill and the State Contingency Fund Bill. Both the bills are likely to be passed in the House on Tuesday."

Its liquor policy has rendered thousands unemployed and the poor are having a tough time since it hiked the prices of the subsidised ration, Leader of the Opposition Indira Hridayesh told a press conference here.We will raise these issues on the floor of the House, she added.Hridayesh said the Opposition would make a disclosure on a BJP leader threatening a Congress leader and seeking bribe after this years assembly election. We will raise this issue in the House and also handover a copy of the CD, showing the BJP leader asking for bribes, to the Speaker, she said.The Opposition was studying the Draft State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) Bill to be tabled in the assembly during its two-day session, Hridayesh, a former finance minister said.She warned that if the latest provisions incorporated into the SGST Bill were not found to be people friendly or went against the traders interests, the Opposition would vociferously take it up in the assembly.Hridayesh also hit out at the Trivendra Rawat government for its decision to raise prices of the subsidised ration for the Above Poverty Line (APL) families. According to officials more than 10,000 APL families covered under the State Food Security Act (SFSA) would now have to pay more to secure their quota of ration. Another 62 lakh APL families in the state are covered under the National Food Security Act (NFSA).She claimed that the previous Congress government had ensured that the APL families not covered under NFSA got subsidised ration under the SFSA. However, they are having a tough time now as the government doubled the prices of the subsidised rice and wheat, she said, claiming that they have also not been able to access the subsidised sugar after its supply was stopped by the BJP regime.She also alleged that the skewed liquor policy of the current dispensation has rendered thousands of people jobless in the states four districts, where Rawat government has banned liquor. They were hired by restaurateurs and hotel owners to serve liquor to guests at bar counters, Hridayesh claimed.Conversely, this government recently moved the Supreme Court urging it to allow sale and consumption of liquors in the nine hill districts on the lines of the Northeast states, she added.Hridayesh alleged that the BJP governments policy of zero tolerance on corruption has reduced to a mere slogan.That is evident from the fact that the CBI probe the government had recommended into the Rs 500-crore NH-74 scam has got nowhere, she added."

On International Missing Children 's Day, today, we give you a lowdown on what to do if a child goes missing, and moreFor Mini Rajan from Alappuzha, the traumatic experience of losing her seven-year-old son, Rahul, still remains as vivid in her mind as on that fateful day, May 18, 2005. ""I still can't comprehend how he just vanished out of sight,"" she rues. ""It was his vacation time and just another day for us. After returning from his tuition classes, he ate his lunch in a hurry. His favourite food was rice mixed with ghee, but that day, he didn't even bother to see what was served on his plate. He went out to play cricket with his friends. He was last seen at around 3.45 pm.""She adds, ""His friends told us that he had taken a break from the game and gone to get a drink of water. He never came back."" There were recurrent investigations from the part of the police, and several suspects were questioned, all of which proved false, after which the couple handed over the case to the CBI. However, there was no trace of Rahul or even his remains to prove that he was not alive.A recently telecast TV show featured a boy who looked similar to Rahul, and Mini got her hopes up, but to her dismay, she found that it was not her son. 12 years on, Mini still hopes that one day, her son, whom they all adored, would return and hold her in his arms.While Mini's story is just one among many, statistics reveal that more often than not, it is the children themselves who elope from home, mostly for minor or silly reasons. On International Missing Children's Day today, we give you a lowdown on what to do if a child goes missing, how good the system in Kerala is at tracking a lost child, and more.Immediate reporting is the key to reuniting lost children with their family, says Job Zachariah, UNICEF Field Chief, Kerala. ""The first few hours after they go missing, the 'golden hours' are the key to ensure that they don't fall prey to sexual crimes or violence. Even a slight delay might cost a child its life,"" he says.""As soon as a child goes missing, a case has to be registered with the Police, following which the Special Juvenile Police unit (SJP), Child Welfare Commission and Childline organisations will pool in their support to trace the child,"" says Baby K G, Senior Civil Police Officer, SJP Unit, Ernakulam Rural.Any delay in reporting, and the child may either move or be moved to other places, via train or other means of transport, he points out.Fr Joy James, Chairman of Child Welfare Committee and Childline Convener, who has been actively working on child issues, says that academic failure and love affairs are the major reasons why a lot of children run away from home.And it's the culture of abuse in our society which instills fear of parents in them, he adds. ""Parents do not know to deal with anger and frustration within themselves, and vent it on their kids. The kids, in turn, grow up in a pampered atmosphere and are not taught how to face stress or adverse situations,"" he says.In order to deal with the situation, kids need to be given proper life skill orientation by parents, says Fr Joy. ""They should teach the children how to deal with their emotions and frustrations. This training cannot be given from elsewhere."" In addition, the mental state of a child will depend on the peaceful atmosphere of a family, he adds. ""If there is unrest in the family, it will affect the kid.""He also points towards the need for nodal teachers in schools, who will take care of the children's emotional, physical and psychological health. ""The teachers should be given training on where to draw the line between peedanam and shikshanam. While peedanam means abuse, shikshanam means growth. Unfortunately, most homes in Kerala are not conducive for the integral growth of children.""An analysis of the lost and found cases in the State reveals that we have reasons to cheer. The number of reported cases comes to around 1,500 a year, but nearly 1,400 of them are found, here, later. ""The figures are heartening, as in other States, the numbers are between 14,000 and 20,000 a year."" Instances of finding lost children are also less in other States, he says, adding that the number of unsuccessful cases has also substantially shown a decline over the years.Though the online tracking portal is a good initiative, a few changes need to be made in it, as only the Police are informed about the child's whereabouts under it, feels Meena Kuruvilla, project director of the outreach programme, Rajagiri College of Social Sciences. ""More child related institutions should be kept in the loop - like the CWC, adoption agencies, Child Rights Commission, Child Protection Unit (CPU) and other child care institutions. Suppose a child seeks help in any of these institutions, we can easily identify When they spot a lost child, they will be able to provide all the details they have gathered about the kid in it, and speedy recovery can be done.""1, Go to the official website of Kerala Police, and among the predominant icons, you will find Track Child, which takes you to an ambit of options to register that a child has gone missing.2, The Citizen's Corner titled Khoya - Paya is where the information on missing and found children is fed into, and the police database can be found by just typing the child's name in it.3, Guidelines on how to deal with such an issue and file an FIR is also jotted down there, and an online filing of the same could also be done using the provision.1, Parents should either report to the nearest police station or dial100 at the earliest.2, Immediately, a wireless message is passed on to all control rooms.3, Police officers from the lowest ranks to the highest are kept in the loop through the messages.4, If the child uses a phone, it is tracked by the telecommunications department, and the Cyber Cell is also informed about the same.5, Hence, the more the delay from the parents, the less are the chances of tracing the child1, If a child finds him/herself lost, they should dial the helpline toll free number 1098. It will take the child to the Childline India Foundation in Chennai.2, Special Juvenile Police officials will arrive at the spot, and along with the Childline personnel, will check if the child has been subjected to mental or physical abuse.3, They will give the child the needed mental support. Primary investigation is then done by the Police.Information provided by Kerala CM in the assembly on 21 Oct 2016."

593adcca7be9e07e719f29ae,Punjab goes 'Amma' way to feed the hungry,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/613936/punjab-goes-amma-way-feed.html,2017-05-27,"Gautam Dheer, Chandigarh, May 28 2017, 10:28 ISTPopulist measures initiated by governments in the name of food often win hands down. They are an instant hit with masses, especially with the large chunk of poor and deprived who struggle for food.Be it atta-daal schemes run by the state governments or the famous Amma Unavagam (Amma canteens) serving highly subsidised food to about 2.50 lakh people across 300 outlets in Tamil Nadu, politicians in Punjab have realised the benefits of serving good food, not just on health, but on popularity as well.The Capt Amarinder Singh government in Punjab has now got the right recipe with all the perfect ingredients, perhaps, a cue from the popular Amma canteens.The chief minister has chosen the business of food to ride on popularity, but with a philanthropic twist. Several centres under different names like Sasti roti and Sanjhi rasoi have started serving food to the underprivileged through community kitchen.A meal costs just Rs 5 at some centres. And there isnt any compromise on the hygiene or quantity. Sample this: for Rs 5, a poor is served six chapatis, lintel, seasonal vegetables and rice. Thats quite a mouthful for Rs 5 a meal, and clearly a tough competition for Amma canteens where sambar rice is served at Rs 5, besides other options on the menu.Punjabs experiment with the politics of food so far is not entirely submerged in political flavour, unlike in Tamil Nadu where the food canteens branding the name Amma was in unequivocal reference to chief minister the late J Jayalalithaa who introduced the concept for the economically disadvantaged majority in that state.In Punjab, the experiment to offer subsidised food to the poor and the working class began this month in the districts of Bathinda, Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Muktsar and SBS Nagar.At some places it is run entirely by the government under the aegis of the district red cross societies, while the scheme is operated in collaboration with NGOs at other centres. In Bathinda, the facility has been entirely outsourced by the government.The magnitude of the exercise in this border state may not be as elaborate and widespread as in Tamil Nadu or even in Odisha where such arrangements have been named Aahar (food) centres, but officials say the initiative has only begun.The plan is afloat to take the food scheme to a new high where the concept will not be limited to merely serving food to the deprived. Jalandhars Sanjhi Rasoi intends to offer porridge and khichdi as well. The idea is aimed at providing nutritious food to all, especially women and mothers, who may suffer from various deficiencies for want of adequate healthy food.Senior officials in the district administration say nutritious food will add value to the initiative and make it more fulfilling and rewarding to say the least. Chapati-making machines have been set up at one centre in Punjab where the rush is growing by the day.Thousands belonging to the underprivileged section queue up every day to eat subsidised food. In some centres serving community food, a meal costs Rs 10. The authorities make sure the menu doesnt remain staple all the time. Aloo puri and Halwa (dessert) are also on the menu once a week. Subsidised food for the poor was a poll promise of the Amarinder Singh government and one of the early promises to have started taking shape.But the initiative has its limitations. Initially food packets ere prepared in bulk and intended to be distributed at a low cost. But the authorities soon realised its pitfall. A large number of employees walked away with the food meant for the deprived. The practice was discontinued. Food was only made available at the counter and served in plate.A food contractor spends about Rs 15 per meal. The price being charged from people at some places is only Rs 5 and the rest of the deficit money has to be borne by the Red Cross Society. Funds available with societies are limited which is why the government may have to consider a viable option that could sustain the initiative.The government has already promised the moon for the people of Punjab, something that may be a drain on the exchequer. The meal option for the poor is so far limited only once a day for lunch. Round-the-clock kitchens have been entirely ruled out. But the authorities say, they are contemplating extending the facility for dinners as well.Public participation has started to pour in. The authorities are hoping the scheme will catch the attention of non-resident Indians or corporates that will help sustain the initiative. Officials say traders and good Samaritans are offering help. There have been days when the poor dont have to pay a penny and get a scrumptious meal for free.Officials say good Samaritans often buy coupons on some days for Rs 500 or Rs 1,000 and distribute these for free to the people queuing up to have a meal.Community kitchen in Punjab is a way of life as enshrined in the Sikh religious ethos. On weekends on an average, the revered Golden Temple in Amritsar serves free nutritious food to about one lakh devotees."

Another 49 injured in landslides were hospitalised.""Most of the fatalities were due to landslides and only a very few drowned,"" said government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne who is also the health minister.He said nearly 500,000 people were forced from their homes and most of them had moved into temporary shelters.The military led search operations in landslide-hit areas and the airforce deployed five aircraft for rescue operations and another five to transport emergency supplies to villagers who could not be reached by road.At the village of Bulathsinhala, relatives were seen loading coffins of 10 victims onto armoured personnel carriers to transport them across flooded streets to higher ground for burial.The military vehicles also ferried villagers along roads converted into riverways by the rainfall, passing submerged traffic signs and flooded houses.There were similar scenes in the adjoining Ratnapura district, the island's gem capital, which was also flooded. The authorities arranged funerals for dozens of victims.WATCH: Rescue workers intensify search for survivorsThe deluge caused the Nilwala river to burst its banks, threatening to submerge a large number of villages, the DMC said.It warned thousands of villagers living near the Nilwala to evacuate to higher ground.President Maithripala Sirisena, who returned from a state visit to Australia, travelled to Kalutara, one of the worst affected districts south of Colombo, to supervise relief operations.""The government will give new houses to those who lost their houses,"" he tweeted.The authorities dropped thousands of life jackets for marooned people in a bid to protect them until they could be moved to safer ground.International aidAn Indian naval ship equipped with medical supplies docked in Colombo Saturday and a second vessel was expected on Monday, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said.The United Nations said it will give water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organisation will support medical teams in affected areas.Save the Children warned of a potential increase in dengue cases in the country.The charity's Sri Lanka country director Chris McIvo said: ""We're particularly worried we could start seeing a further increase in the number of dengue cases because of the stagnant water that the floods will leave in their wake.""Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies. Islamabad recently gave 10,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka to help drought victims.The meterological department said the rains ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydropower generation.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful monsoon, officials said.Monsoon rains last year caused flooding and landslides, killing over 100 people."

The CGM device consists of a sensor inserted into the subcutaneous tissue, a reader which is worn by the patient and a computer software for generating graphs and reports upon downloading the data from the reader.CSII pumpThe CSII pump represents an attempt to provide insulin in a more physiological manner to patients with diabetes, avoiding the peaks and troughs in insulin levels seen with multiple injections.The CSII pump consists of a subcutaneous cannula inserted into the interstitial space, a connecting tubing and a small pager-sized, battery-operated pump which has the insulin reservoir as well as a microchip that controls insulin delivery according to pre-programmed rates.Artificial pancreas (AP)The artificial pancreas (AP) is an automated system that mimics physiological functioning of the normal endocrine pancreas by using pumps to continuously adapt hormone delivery based on changes in glucose levels which are measured by glucose sensors.The device uses continuous glucose measurements to automatically manage exogenous insulin delivery with or without other hormones in an attempt to restore glucose regulation. Mobile Technology (mHealth)In many developing countries, mobile phone penetrance is high. Transmission of health care messages through short messaging services (SMS) is therefore an attractive and potentially effective means of bringing about behavioral change. The potential for regular and repetitive messaging is particularly attractive in cases of chronic diseases like diabetes, where patients need to monitor their lifestyle on a long-term basis.Advances in food technologyWith developments in food processing technology, most of the rice available in the market is of the highly polished white variety, which contains low amounts of dietary fibre and has a high glycemic index.Brown rice has been shown to have a lower glycemic index, but unfortunately, brown rice suffers from low levels of consumer acceptance.Efforts were therefore made to develop a variety of rice which retains the favorable sensory and cooking properties of white rice, but has higher fibre content and a lower glycemic index. Widespread use of this rice variety can be expected to increase the dietary fibre intake of the population and may help protect against development of diabetes and in better glycemic control in those who already have diabetes.Dr V MohanChairman and Chief of Diabetology, Dr Mohans DiabetesSpecialities Centre"

When he asked why they are not speaking, the kids replied miss will beat us, sending the audience into peels of laughter.Virupaksha, a BPL card holder of Hassan, said, the government should provide free dialysis for the poor in government hospitals.District Health and Family Welfare Officer Dr Venkatesh assured of providing dialysis facility in all taluk hospitals and that the tender process has already been started.

The beneficiaries of Manaswini scheme urged for a hike in the pension amount to a minimum of Rs 1,000. The minister directed Deputy Commissioner Chaitra to submit a proposal to the government in this regard.Krishi BhagyaThe beneficiaries of Krishi Bhagya complained that the Horticulture department officials do not provide any information to farmers and that they do not respond to the queries on the scheme pertaining to the polyhouses, they alleged.The DC said, Krishi Abhiyan is being conducted in every taluk, town and hobli from June 2 and the farmers should make use of the opportunity.Radha from Belur brought to the ministers notice that the BPL card holders are not getting palm oil and salt in the fair price shops. A resident of Alur taluk said, around 20 families at his village are yet to get ration cards and most of them are being denied rice under Anna Bhagya scheme.Manju said, rice is being distributed to make Karnataka hunger-free. But, people should not misuse it."

It raised the price of wheat from Rs 4 per kg during the Congress rule to Rs 8.60 per kilogram and the price of rice from Rs 7 to Rs 15 per kg. Its amply clear that the BJP governments have no concern for the poor and downtrodden section of the society, Rawat said to Congress workers at Gandhi Park near the party headquarters.We, the Congress led UPA government, provided cheapest food grain to the people while this government is doing opposite.Rawat said the BJP government in Uttarakhand has treaded the path shown by Modi government in Delhi. They have burdened the people of Uttarakhand by increasing water and power prices. We will keep fighting against it. The Congress workers will have to fight non-stop for victory but unlike BJP, ours will be by democratic means and not by hook or by crook. They have tampered EVMs for winning elections, but we will defeat their machinations, he said.The former chief minister also requested Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay to launch a statewide campaign against the PDS foodgrains price rise."

Let me give you a blow-by-blow account. I was made in-charge of Goa sometime in late 2013. The party was in a disarray. As far as this election goes, I as general secretary had strategised that we should have an anti-communal front. There were these two people, Babush Monserrate and Vijai Sardesai Babush was a sitting Congress MLA, but he had walked out. Sardesai was also in the Congress earlier, he wanted to contest the 2012 election, but was denied a ticket.I touched base with him (Sardesai). I was in constant touch with Babush also, and as a strategy they said let us have a secular front, with the Congress in the lead. So, Babush, Sardesai and the NCP, were invited to discuss a pre-poll alliance. We went for the elections, we ran a very low key campaign and attacked AAP more than the BJP, because they were encroaching on our votes.We were successful in reducing the AAP to zero. Their CM candidate lost, he got only 1,400 votes, and the party was decimated. BJP came down from 24 to 13. We got 17 plus one, 18 seats. Churchill Alemao of the NCP won. I was there since the evening of March 10. We wanted to have a CLP meeting on March 11 itself at 6pm. But I dont know what they did with the counting. It is such a small state with each constituency having no more than 25-30,000 votes. Counting only finished at 7.30 in the evening. After that there were rallies etc and the Congress MLAs could not reach the PCC office even till 9.30 pm. They called me and said we are very tired, lets meet tomorrow. I said, fine, lets meet tomorrow.Then, we went to meet Sardesai late in the night, sometime around 12.30 am. He was angry that my party had put up a candidate against him. But we convinced him and promised to meet all his demands. He said that my primary demand is that X should not be the chief minister. We agreed.We returned from his place around 1.30 am, without realising that things will change again. Next day I found out that Brij Bhushan Singh, the MP from Gonda, who is the All India Wrestling Federation president, had accompanied Nitin Gadkari to Goa. Now, Vijai Sardesai is the state level wrestling federation president of Goa. So, Brij Bhushan Singh walked in after we left, and the wrestling started. He took Sardesai to Gadkari, and they were together between 4 am and 7 am.I came to know much later that this was done. I trusted him. Around 10 am the next day I started calling Rohan Khaunte and Vijai Sardesai, but there was no contact. I called his PA, security, no reaction.We called our CLP meeting at 11 and by 3.30-4 PM the exercise was over. Sardesai wanted Digambar Kamat to be the CM, so we decided to elect him. We called Digambar Kamat and told him that please make us talk to Sardesai so that we can tell him that you are our leader. He kept on calling, again no response.Then the press informed me that Sardesai was with Nitin Gadkari, since 4.30-5 pm. So then I called up Sardesais mentor, who said there is no question of GFP going with the BJP. Then, GFP president, Prabhakar Timble, he also said there was no question of allying with the BJP.Suddenly there was a phone call, and they said, Sir sorry, they are going to the Governor.See, my basic objection is that in Parliamentary democracy of course numbers count, but it has to be on the basis of the mandate received. Any political party if it gets the majority, they are invited to form the government. In case of a fractured mandate, the single largest party has the largest mandate. This was not followed in Goa. The Governor should have waited. By doing this she has contravened constitutional provisions.See, the letter to the Governor only goes once the leader is elected . When we called the Governors office we were told there is no one here today because it is a Sunday, so you leave the letter at the gate.We have also now moved a substantive motion against the Governor, which will be discussed on Monday, asking for a recall.P Vaidyanathan Iyer: Do you feel completely outsmarted by the BJP, given the pace with which they moved in Goa?The new government is fragile and I dont think it will last.Let me give you some background. In 94 there was a fractured mandate in Goa. Congress was in power at the Centre, and the party formed the government in the state as well. In 1999 Congress got the majority, Congress formed the government. In 2002, there was a fractured mandate, there was a BJP government in Delhi, BJP formed the government (in Goa). In 2007, again fractured mandate, Congress was in power in Delhi, Congress formed the government. In 2012, BJP got the majority, and in 2017 again when we have a fractured mandate, BJP is in power in Delhi and they formed the government. This is history.Vandita Mishra: You pointed out the history of Goa, and said that in times of a fractured mandate in the state, the party that is in power at the Centre forms the government in the state. So what you are saying, in other words, is that the Congress has been as responsible for flouting the constitutional principles in government formation in Goa, as the BJP is being accused of now.No. What I am saying is that every time there has been a regional party which doesnt have a mandate, we have seen that the single largest party has been given the opportunity. It has never been the case that the party with the lesser number of MLAs has got the opportunity, overlooking the rights of the single largest party.Anand Mishra: As a senior leader of the Congress, what, in your opinion, is ailing the party?Nothing. The issue is that Congress is not a cadre-based party. We have not been able to build up enough regional leadership, which is necessary in todays times. Leaders such as Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi had a larger than life presence, because of which we could ignore the regional leadership. Post the Narasimha Rao period, regional leaders have emerged, even in the BJP. Now the Congress party has to basically look into building regional leaders more aggressively.Anand Mishra: But there are several states, such as Maharashtra and Haryana, where the BJP has won the elections without a state face. Dont you think the problem is at the national level?Rahul Gandhi is now our vice president, and by and large, Soniaji (Gandhi) has abdicated in favour of Rahul Ganhiji. He is the person we are all reporting to. He is calling the shots now. As far as he is concerned, I think he has got a raw deal from the media. Whenever the party wins, he doesnt get credit for it, but when the party loses, he is blamed. We have won in Punjab, but the credit has been given to Amarinder Singh. If we had lost the state, the discredit would have come to Rahul Gandhi.We have beaten the BJP in Manipur and Goa, but no one gives him credit for it. At the same time, there should be a fresh move to rejuvenate the Congress.Coomi Kapoor: In UP, do you think it was a mistake to go along with the SP?What is the basic strength of the Samajwadi Party? It is a party of Yadavs. What is the strength of the Yadavs? Lathi. Without the lathi, the strength of the Yadavs goes away. So, when this break up took place in the family Akhilesh is a softer face of the Yadavs, Shivpal is the lathi face of the Yadavs. So because of this (family feud) they did not even do well in their home grounds. Break-up of the family just before the polls went against them. Rahulji and Akhilesh, they make a great pair, but BJP very successfully polarised the voters, which sort of went against us.Liz Mathew: Who do you hold responsible for the lack of a regional leadership in the Congress?Every Congress leader is responsible, but at the same time there are certain basic issues on which we need to work on, such as bringing up a new leadership. There is no dearth of new leaders in the Congress, it is just a question of giving them opportunity. In 2005 I told Sonia Gandhi that we have to bring out a new Congress. A committee headed by Veerappa Moily was formed. Unfortunately, we could not act on the ideas we discussed then.The demographic profile of this country is changing. We cannot attract Dalits, tribals, anymore by giving them rice for Rs 1/kg, and wheat. Their aspirations have changed. Dalits and the tribals have moved into a middle class society and they are different from the Scheduled Castes of the 70s and 60s. We need to take that into account and formulate strategies according to that.Krishn Kaushik: The Congress has lost some important leaders in the recent past who say the high command was not willing to listen to them  Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, N Biren Singh in Manipur.Himanta Biswa Sarma is an amazing fellow. I have been in-charge of Assam for seven years. He is a political animal par excellence. He is also a great operator and manipulator. We shouldnt have lost him. As far as our friend, the new CM of Manipur is concerned, he was the Himanta Biswa Sarma of Okram Ibobi. So, they must have fallen apart.Krishn Kaushik: These leaders claim that the Congress party rewards loyalty to the family over talent.I dont agree with that. This is a family which has political instinct, a political heritage and acceptability among the Congressmen. This family binds the Congress together. That is their strength.Liz Mathew: The BJP and Narendra Modi have managed to successfully project the Gujarat model in their campaigns in other states. When it comes to the Congress, is there any state that can be projected as a governance or development model?I admire the marketing skills of Narendra Modi. Gujarat has always been a developed state, it is not because of Modi. Also, the Gujarat development model is totally centralised, whereas the Congress believes in decentralised functioning of the government.Karnataka has empowered its elected representatives, and the state government has done exceedingly well on all fronts, but it has failed to market itself. I am in-charge of Karnataka, I have been telling Siddaramaiahji, if Narendra Modi, without anything, can market himself on the national, international scene, why cant you market Karnataka.Liz Mathew: You said that the Gandhi family is the binding factor of the party. There are three members of the Gandhi family, would the Congress consider a change in the leadership?Thats a family affair, I dont want to get involved in it. Let them decide. But I can tell you one thing, Congressmen throughout the country will be very happy if Priyanka Gandhi joined active politics.P Vaidyanathan Iyer: One thing that the Congress appears to be failing at is providing a counter-narrative to the politics of the BJP.Yes, that sums up the weakness of the Congress party. A clear distinction between the ideology of the BJP and Congress has to be made and conveyed aggressively to the public. I have been saying this for a long time. Sometimes, I feel, the Congress party holds itself back when there is need for a punch. BJPs ideology is that of hate and violence. Congress is a party of love, compassion and non-violence. We are Gandhians, Nehruvians.We cannot have some form of soft Hindutva, there is no such thing. Mahatma Gandhi understood India. India is not a communal country, it has a secular mindset. We have absorbed Islam. Sufism came here. We have absorbed Christianity.The problem with Islam now is that the Wahhabis are getting more acceptance in the Muslim world. Wahhabism and the RSS are basically two sides of the same coin. We have to drill into the minds of people that this country will not take religious fundamentalism of any kind, Hindu or Muslim. Jawaharlal Nehru had rightly said that majority communalism is more dangerous than minority communalism.This is the country of Gautam Budh, Bhagwan Mahavir, Mahatma Gandhi, love, compassion, non-violence. Our country cannot see this violence. War is always the last option. Here we have people shouting about why we should go to war with Pakistan. Is it good for the country? Who suffers in a war? The entire nation suffers. Narendra Modi is a warmonger. He will take this country into a limited war before the 2019 elections. Mark my words.The Congress party has to aggressively take up Gandhian-Nehruvian socialism against the religious fundamentalism of the Sangh.Sanchari Bhattacharya: Why has there been no action on the observations of the AK Antony Committee report?I would say that we want a new Congress, a new charter, a new road map, a new style of campaigning A new Congress has to be built and there is no other person who can do it better than Rahul Gandhi. He has to act. My complaint against Rahul Gandhi is that he is not acting decisively. I have told him this a number of times. Sometimes he gets angry when I keep repeating the same thing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

593addd87be9e07a5a19f8d5,Goa Heritage takes on social media avatar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/goaheritage-takes-on-social-media-avatar/articleshow/58830984.cms,2017-05-25,"PANAJI: Back in 2005, the Goa Heritage Action Group (GHAG) converted the Latin quarters at Fontainhas Panaji , into a venue of an art festival. In the wake of this exposure, this heritage conservation area went on to feature as the backdrop in many advertisements and movies and the flow of tourists that followed helped some residents maintain their heritage houses.After a period of lying low, the GHAG is back in action - its eyes now set on conserving Goa's intangible heritage, including its language. The organisation will soon launch accounts on social media platforms, where Goans will be able to use the hashtag 'GoaHeritage' to share anything from a fading local fruit, vegetable or cereal, an almost extinct art or craft form or a festival unique to a Goan village.""The entire focus has been on built or natural heritage so far. But, other than galvanising GHAG members and revitalising the group, we now want to focus on our intangible heritage like our agrarian practices or traditional vocations. We want to highlight on 'grow local, buy local and eat local.' For instance, the local variety of rice is far more healthy and by buying it you can help the local farmer continue growing it,"" said the new GHAG honorary secretary Raya Shankhwalker Shankhwalker said that a social media presence will help promote the idea of preservation of heritage among the younger generation, who will be the torchbearers of the conservation mission in the future.GHAG also wants to work towards convincing the government to draw a comprehensive heritage list and guidelines for heritage conservation. ""At present, the focus is only on a small number of historical buildings and a few heritage conservation zones that were declared as early as the 1970s,"" said Shankhwalker.GHAG believes that Goa has a vast built-up heritage, stretching far beyond the currently listed structures, which needs to be assigned grades based on their significance, rather than ignored altogether, like the rapidly vanishing heritage houses in Panaji.""In the absence of such guidelines, routinely buildings are being demolished and changes are taking place to our historic temples and churches. In Europe, for instance, the core of the heritage zone is retained and development takes place around it, which model can be adopted in case of Panaji. In India, demolition of heritage structures is seen as an easy way of carrying out development. In India, conservation is seen as anti-development, which need not be the case,"" said Shankhwalker, and added that the manner in which revenue generating businesses grew within the precincts at Fontainhas, even helping conserve the nature of the houses, is an example that heritage need not be seen as opposed to development and commerce."
593ade017be9e00e1ecd3167,Ravenshaw as educator & administrator,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170412/jsp/odisha/story_145851.jsp,2017-04-12,"Eminent litterateur J.P. Das, in an article in The Telegraph, has called for the renaming of Ravenshaw University. His argument is that it is a colonial legacy and that Ravenshaw, after whom the college, now a university, has been named, was a discredited commissioner of Orissa division and was castigated by the famine commission for mishandling the great Orissa Famine of 1865-66 in which nearly a million people died. I wish to deal with the subject on two premises to enable the reader to judge whether these views are valid and informed - Ravenshaw, the promoter of higher education in Orissa and Ravenshaw, as an administrator handling the famine. From 1805, when Orissa became part of the British empire, till the early 1860s, little was done for the spread of Western education thanks to the White man's contempt and the Bengali apathy. By 1868, there were 63 schools and 4,073 students. One of the priority areas of Ravenshaw was to promote education of the Odias. By 1875, i.e. 10 years into his commissionership, the number had gone up to 539 schools with 10,196 students. What is significant was Ravenshaw's comprehensive perspective that included education for girls, training Odia teachers who were in short supply and starting a medical institution. Yet another facet of Ravenshaw that has been overshadowed by the Odisha intelligentsia's perception of Beams as saviour of the Odia language, which no doubt is true, was his relentless effort to introduce Odia as the medium of instruction in the schools. Schools were opening and the Bengal government made Bengali the medium of instruction on the ground that Odia textbooks and teachers were not available. Inspector of schools R.L. Martin wrote in 1868: ""It would require another 20 years for a Vidyasagar to develop Oorya."" To this Ravenshaw spiritedly replied: ""There will be, if option is permitted a constant leaning towards Bengalee, which will be detrimental to the fundamental point to be kept in view viz the education of Ooryas. So long as Oorya is not recognised as the language of all and every grade of Oorya schools, it is not to be expected that very material improvement be made in Oorya literature. This being once decided on, books will be translated from Bengalee and new works in Oorya prepared and time need not be long before the language will be as rich in literature a in Bengalee. I would leave Bengalee as an extra language if preferred to be taken up in addition to Oorya, but in no case in supercession of it. The Bengalees have usurped the lucrative employment in the country which would have fallen to the indigenous Ooryas had they been afforded an opportunity of advanced education in their own language. So far the Ooryas have not received fair play and have been kept in the background. I think nothing is so likely to encourage the progress of education in Orissa as adoption of its national language in all classes of schools."" Sensing the unhelpful attitude of Martin who was duly supported by the DPI, he sent a proposal to the Bengal government for creation of a separate inspectorate for Orissa that the DPI delayed in spite of support from the secretary. The assistant secretary of education wrote in 1873 that Bengali could be replaced by Odia. Ravenshaw promptly wrote to the collectors: ""Persistent and potent exclusion of the Bengalee language and of teachers who are not familiar with Oorya vernacular is expected for the popularity and progress of education in Orissa"". He also introduced FA class in the Cuttack Zila School and subsequently the Cuttack College the first college in Orissa. Thus his contribution to promotion of Western education in Odisha will remain above any doubt and question. Now let's talk about Ravenshaw's handling of Odisha's famine for which all blame is laid at his door. Ravenshaw succeeded R.N. Shore as commissioner of the Orissa division in July 1865. By then, the monsoon was failing and the collectors, particularly Puri collector Barlow, had sent their reports to Ravenshaw, who in turn, had sent warning letters to the Bengal governor and the board of revenue, which was supreme in matters of revenue administration. The board ignored the letters on the ground that the market would take care of the situation and that the traders and the people must have stored sufficient rice. Governor Sir Cecil Beadon, duly briefed by the board, remained silent. By the end of the year, people were dying by the hundreds and reports were pouring in. Barlow reported that the crop would not be 1/8th of the normal produce in Puri. He also reported to Ravenshaw about the representation of the landlords for remission of land rent seeking his permission to investigate which Ravenshaw gave and kept the board informed. He was reprimanded by the board for giving such permission and was asked to withdraw it. Ravenshaw complied with the order. Sir Cecil, perhaps realising that the board's assessment was incorrect, visited Orissa in February 1866. Strangely, he did not find anything wrong, returned to Calcutta and then to the cooler climes of Simla. In 1866, the situation worsened in Balasore. Ravenshaw wrote that food was the real need. The government finally realised the gravity of the situation and arranged to import 10,000 tons of rice from Burma. In 1866 there were heavy floods that completely dislocated the poor communication facilities. Food did not reach the destinations. Cholera broke out and the famished died without count. The efforts of Ravenshaw to form a Famine Relief Fund were initially cold shouldered by the governor and the board. The famine, which a section of the British press described as ""the most important and calamitous event after the Sepoy Mutiny"" exposing the ""moral and intellectual incapacity"" of the British administration and compelled Her Majesty's government to constitute a commission to look into all aspects of the matter. The commission noted that commissioner Ravenshaw described the calamity in the frankest manner. The commission did not put the entire blame on Ravenshaw but questioned the role played by the governor and the board of revenue. After the discussion of the report in the House of Commons, Sir Stafford Northcote, secretary, India affairs, in his report to the governor general, distributed the blame on the governor, the board of revenue and also the governor general stating that the visit of governor Cecil Beadon ""should have inaugurated a more effective system of action"". In view of the above, it would be a travesty of truth to conclude that Ravenshaw was castigated by the commission and the Imperial Government. Lastly, we come to the issue of changing the name Ravenshaw because of its colonial tag. History shows that Orissa and Ravenshaw were one in the twentieth century. Each grew with the other. Several momentous developments, including the carving of Orissa out of the Bengal Presidency in 1936 as a separate province on a linguistic basis had their roots in Ravenshaw. It is inconceivable for the millions of Ravenshavians to be stripped of that hallowed identity at a time when Ravenshaw is desperate to regain its past glory. It will be more rewarding and satisfying to meet that challenge than debating an inconsequential proposition like changing the name."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, April 11: The state government will soon organise a national seminar in New Delhi demanding Paika revolt of 1817 to be declared as the first war of Independence as it pre-dates the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857. ""We will present facts and a number of other evidences to prove our point before the central government,"" said culture secretary Manoranjan Panigrahy while speaking at a seminar hosted at Odisha State Archives yesterday. The state culture department organised the seminar, which was a part of the weeklong Odia New Year celebrations. A number of meetings will be hosted to document the Paika revolt and bringing historical facts to the fore. Researchers and scholars from across the state demanded the Paika revolt to be declared as the first war of Independence as the event marks its 200th year this year. Paikas (a martial race) had first raised the banner of revolt against the British Raj in 1817 at Barunei near Khurda. ""The Paika struggle of Khurda paved the way for the Independence struggle. It was a mass revolt against the British rule, which continued for many days. It is unfortunate that the Union government is yet to accept Paika revolt as the first war of Independence although if analysed properly one can validate it through the facts,"" said historian Narayan Rao. Speaking at the seminar, academic Chandi Prasad Nanda, researchers Gouranga Chandra Das and Jatadhari Mishra highlighted the various facets of the glorious revolt. Odia New Year Ahead of April 14, which will be celebrated as Maha Vishuba Sankranti, the state government is hosting several cultural events, including dance, musical sessions, competitions, literary festivals, seminars and food festivals. The celebrations were inaugurated at Utkal Mandap on April 8 with hulahuli (a typical sound made by women in chorus during religious ceremonies) as hundreds of women competed with each other to win the competition. They also created beautiful and huge-sized jhotis (floor motifs with rice paste) as part of the competition. ""We want to celebrate unique traditions and heritage of Odisha. The aim is to involve common people, especially youngsters, in these events to create a sense of belonging to the state,"" said culture minister Ashok Panda. Apart from these events, Odisha Lalit Kala Akademi and Odisha Sahitya Akademi hosted a platform where writers and artists came together to showcase their creativity. Fifty writers read out poems referring to the works of art that artists created on the occasion. An exhibition on pattachitra art was also inaugurated at Odisha State Museum on the occasion."

In addition, it has given special facilities to these places.Similary, the Karnataka government is providing special incentives to farmers who grow tur. A policy needs to be framed to encourage this, he added.To provide free tur of 1 kg to each BPL family through the public distribution system, a sum of Rs 1,100 crore is required. This needs to be discussed in the Cabinet meeting, he added. Jayachandra said even villagers are suffering from diabetes and anaemia. People need protein-rich food. Tur can help as a good supplement, he said.The state has witnessed bumper production of tur this year. About 31 lakh quintals of tur has been procured through 191 centres, he said.He said it is better to ban polished rice as it is not good for health. Even under the Anna Bhagya scheme, polished rice is being given. Unpolished rice has good protein content, he added."

Wheat edged down for a second day as the market came under pressure after a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report showed the U.S. winter crop was stable. ""The USDA's survey of winter wheat crop conditions recorded no deterioration despite poor weather in these regions,"" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""We would ordinarily expect producer selling at this time of year to place a cap on price gains."" The Chicago Board Of Trade most-active wheat contract slid 0.1 percent to $4.34 a bushel by 0314 GMT, having closed down 0.2 percent on Tuesday. Corn lost 0.1 percent to $3.74-3/4 a bushel, having gained 0.7 percent in the previous session when prices climbed to $3.77-1/2 a bushel, the highest since May 2. Soybeans were unchanged at $9.56-1/2 a bushel, having firmed 0.4 percent on Tuesday. The USDA rated the U.S. winter wheat crop at 52 percent in good-to-excellent condition as compared with 51 percent a week ago but behind last year's 62 percent. The country's winter wheat growing areas have experienced excessive moisture, leading to concerns of crop damage and yield losses. Forecasts are calling for more unfavourably wet weather in the central Plains hard red wheat zone in the next two weeks, but more limited rain prospects in the southern Plains could help harvesting. Wheat export prices in rival exporter Russia rose last week, supported by a state purchase by Egypt, the largest buyer of Russian wheat, and expectations that the rouble would rise further against the dollar, analysts said on Monday. U.S. corn planting was seen 84 percent complete, slightly behind market expectations. The soybean planting was pegged at 53 percent complete, slightly ahead of market forecasts. Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn, soybean and soymeal contracts on Monday, traders said. They were net sellers of soyoil and wheat futures.

""I have got information from credible sources that Tewari could be a victim of the foodgrain smuggling mafia.This is what middle-level officials in Karnataka are talking,"" she said in the letter.Tewari's family has alleged that he was about to expose a food scam.Speaking to TOI, Karandlaje, who was the food and civil supplies minister from 20102012 in the state's BJP government, said: "" A lot of corruption happens in transportation of rice from the food and civil supplies department godowns to fair price shops. I have some ground-level officers telling me that he was looking into these irregularities.""Karandlaje claimed she had no reasons to suspect that anyone in Uttar Pradesh wanted to kill him. ""I have asked for a CBI probe as the case involves two states and it cannot be investigated by the Special Investigation Team of Uttar Pradesh alone,"" she added. With the CBI commencing probe, the state Congress government's Rs 4,400 crore per annum flagship programme Anna Bhagya, covering 1.08 crore families, may also come under the scanner. T he scheme envisages giving 7 kg rice per person to BPL families at Re 1 per kg.An RTI application filed in 2016 had pointed out to discrepancies in payments regarding procurement of rice for Anna Bhagya during 2013-2014. While the Chhattisgarh government claimed to have supplied rice worth Rs 346 crore to Karnataka which maintained it paid Rs 383 crore. The CBI is likely to look into more such lapses including pilferages during transportation of rice from godowns to ration shops.Officials, however, said that Tewari was barely a month into the food and civil supplies department to understand the public distribution system and associated pilferages to comprehend a scam as claimed by his family .Food and civil supplies secretary Harsh Gupta, who was Tewari's immediate senior, said he's not concerned overtly about the complaint lodged by his family . ""It's a sad situation. The cops will do their job and investigate. The truth will be out there for everyone to see,"" he said.Food and civil supplies minister U T Khader said, ""Our department does not have any opportunity for a Rs 2,000 crore scam as claimed by the officer's family . And even if there was one, he could have brought it to the notice of Governor, CM or me. Where is the evidence for the CBI to probe?""Chief minister Siddaramaiah has welcomed UP government's decision to recommend for a CBI probe in IAS officer Anurag Tewari's death. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, the CM said, ""We had written to UP CM Yogi Adityanath for a thorough probe."" Meanwhile, a section of the bureaucracy feared that the BJP-led Centre could use the CBI to indulge in witch-hunting in Karnataka on the pretext of trying to ascertain if Tewari was about to expose a scam. ""We want the truth but don't want parties to politicize his death,"" a senior IAS officer said. TNNLucknow's Mahanagar forensic science laboratory will not handle viscera and other samples collected from the crime scene and Anurag Tewari's body.Conceding to the demands of Tewari's family, Lucknow SSP Deepak Kumar on Monday assured them that the exhibits will be sent to reputed medical science institutes elsewhere.Tewari's brother Mayank raised doubts on credentials of Mahanagar laboratory, its director and some of his subordinates. ""A joint director-level officer of Mahanagar laboratory tried to influence the panel of doctors who conducted autopsy, so we have apprehensions. The joint director wanted to show Anurag's death as natural and argued with doctors at the KGMU mortuary. Senior administrative officials know about it but have not done anything,"" said Mayank.Kumar said he will write to Institute of Medical Sciences, BHU and AIIMS and get the examination done. ""If need be, I will also approach the Central Forensic Science Laboratory,"" he said."
593adf1d7be9e00e1ecd333d,Ire over fishing ban for turtles,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170419/jsp/odisha/story_147040.jsp,2017-04-19,"Wildlife activist Satyabrata Mishra releases baby olive ridley turtles on Gopalpur sea beach. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, April 18: The nesting season of the olive ridley turtles is drawing to an end but traditional fishermen in the state's coastal belt are still agitated about the fishing ban imposed by the government to protect these endangered species. While the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary is out of bounds for them throughout the year, fishing ban also applies to Rushikulya and Devi river mouth areas for seven months. Restrictions on fishing in the sea extend in these areas from November to May. The state government imposes fishing ban to reduce turtle casualties during this period, but fishermen have denounced it as unfair. ""The ban is unfair on two counts. While seven months is too long a period for traditional fishermen to be kept away from fishing in the sea, the government has done little to compensate for their losses. Small fishermen suffer the most,"" said Odisha Matysyajivi Forum president Narayan Haldar. Haldar said the Kendrapara fishermen were being paid Rs 2,000 as compensation for livelihood loss during the ban period, but they find it too meagre. Besides, the quota of 25kg rice per month for the ban-hit fishermen has now been reduced 5kg after the introduction of the Food Security Act. ""The government must realise that depend solely on fishing for survival. It should either relax the ban or offer a better compensation package,"" he said.

593adf2c7be9e00e1ecd3358, a hit on dining table and social media,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170321/jsp/odisha/story_141677.jsp,2017-03-21,"Pakhala spread at a restaurant in Bhubaneswar. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 20: The state's favourite dish was omnipresent - from the dining table to a top trending topic on social media - as resident and not-resident Odias celebrated Pakhala Divas today. Thousands of people took to various social networking sites to share stories of their attachment with pakhala, while many others shared pictures of feasts over the dish at their homes and outside. The dish was also among the top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter throughout the day with a number of well-known personalities talking about it. Popular television personality and chef Sanjeev Kapoor tweeted: ""I am sure if today I go to any house in Odisha (or an Odia living in any part of the world), I would get freshly made Pakhala."" Writer Ravinder Singh wrote on Twitter: ""Fermented rice to beat the heat. The haves would eat it with fried fish & veges. The have nots with onion & green-chillies."" Artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand art on the theme with a bowl of fermented rice in the middle and a number of popular side-dishes alongside. He posted a picture of his creation on Twitter that was shared by international chefs such as Vikas Khanna and Ranveer Brar and hundreds of people from around the world. Pakhala is an Odia term for cooked rice washed or fermented in water. Depending on the palette, a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian accompaniments are served with it to spice up the taste. It was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath in the Puri temple since it was built in the 12th century. The dish has a number of variations, including jeera pakhala, dahi pakhala, basi pakhala, sajja pakhala and chaiin pakhala. Rourkela resident Monalisa Routray added a twist to her pakhala. She said: ""Instead of rice, I tried rice-stuffed dumplings immersed in curd. As side dishes, I had potato patties and fried drumstick. My family members all appreciated my unique spin to the dish."" Odia film-maker Biswananth Rath, who lives in Chennai, said: ""The day is an attempt to preserve the tradition of this Odia cuisine. The Odia association here got together and had a hearty pakhala meal. We also invited a number of non-Odia people."" Akshaya Mohanty, who lives in Rhode Island, US, said: ""I have invited my non-Odia friends here so that they can get a taste of the popular dish."" Lately, a number of hotels and restaurants have included pakhala in their menus. A vegetarian pakhala meal is available at Rs 350 and a non-vegetarian one comes for a princely Rs 400. There are budget eateries as well, which are offering the dish at Rs 70. ""A dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. We have pakhala at home almost daily during the summer. But today, my friends and I wanted to celebrate the occasion in a special manner,"" said Manisha Dash, who visited the Dalma restaurant here."

Earlier this month, the ministry had estimated foodgrain production for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) at 273.38 million tonnes (MT), which is over 8 MT higher than the previous record, 265.04 MT in 2013-14, and 8.67% higher than last year's foodgrain production. The weatherman has added to the cheer.""The India Meteorological Department has predicted a normal monsoon for this year. If the monsoon is good, I am confident that the foodgrain production will be a new record (in 2017-18). It will boost growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors to more than 4.4% achieved in 2016-17,"" Singh said.The ministry's roadmap for the next three years lists initiatives to the growth of farm sector and ensure that farmers' income doubles by 2022. The new initiatives include use of cutting-edge technology to increase farm productivity, promotion of climate-resilient indigenous breeds of cows and buffaloes, launch of a nationwide programme to harvest the advantages of space technology in agriculture and allied sectors, promotion of deep sea fishing, setting up of seed production and processing units at 'panchayat' level, increase of cropping intensity by 1 million hectares per year through the utilisation of rice fallow areas for pulses and oil-seeds, and consolidation of online trading and inter-market transactions, among others. The minister said, ""The ongoing programmes and new initiatives will definitely double farmers' income by 2022. It will take the country towards the 'evergreen' revolution, as desired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ."" However, the minister evaded a direct response on the issue of commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) mustard, instead focusing on his ministry's performance in the past three years. He said his ministry's role was limited to implement the notified order of the government, whether it was related to GM or non-GM crops. ""Whatever crops are notified once the environment ministry and scientists approve it, then our ministry's mandate is to increase production, productivity, bring down cost of production and ensure right price to farmers,"" he added."

Corn gained more ground while soybeans rose after closing largely unchanged in the previous session. The Chicago Board of Trade most-active wheat contract rose 0.6 percent to $4.35 a bushel by 0332 GMT, having added 0.7 percent on Wednesday. ""I think the wheat market has bottomed out at around $4.30, funds are short on wheat and any short-covering will support prices,"" said Ole Houe, an analyst with brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. ""Buyers are thinking prices are not going to get any cheaper."" Commodity funds were net buyers of CBOT corn and wheat futures contracts on Wednesday, traders said. They were small net sellers of soybeans. Worrisome weather lent support, with excessive moisture in the U.S. Plains and Midwest raising concerns about yield prospects and grain quality for maturing winter wheat crop. Wheat gains were checked though by a slight improvement in weekly winter wheat condition ratings. Soybeans climbed 0.2 percent to $9.50-1/2 a bushel, after ending Wednesday little changed, and corn rose 0.4 percent to $3.72-3/4 a bushel, having gained 0.5 percent the day before.

He was the poor mans CM, and so, I launched this scheme in his name, Reddy told HT.Rajanna Canteen, a mobile van, bedecked with pictures and slogans of YSR, procures food from the kitchen at Tadepalli, run by the MLA and brings it to the Gautama Buddha Centre of Mangalagiri town and supplies it to the poor.The menu comprises sambar rice and curd rice with egg four days a week, and a banana for the rest three days. Besides, the meal also has crunchy papads and chips.Workers enjoy subsidised meal served from Rajanna canteen. (HT PHOTO)The entire expenditure for the subsidised meal is being borne by the MLA.Basically, I am an agriculturist, growing paddy and red gram. That takes care of the meal portion. Besides, I buy eggs and fruits from nearby villages. The overall expenditure for each meal is around Rs 30, but I have decided to supply it for just Rs 4 a plate. I am not a rich man, but I have decided to do my bit for the poor, Reddy said.Canteen staff serve food from the mobile Rajanna canteen. (HT PHOTO)What inspired the MLA was not the NTR Anna Canteen, but a subsidised meal scheme being implemented by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation which supplies meals for Rs 5.The GHMC meal, which comprises rice, sambar, pickle and curd, caters to the needs of 15,000 people daily. The corporation bears a subsidy of Rs 15 on each meal.The van in which Alla Ramakrishna Reddy runs his Rajanna canteen and serves food to the poor. (HT PHOTO)I havent taken anybodys financial support to run Rajanna canteen. That is why I have limited this scheme only to Mangalagiri town, Reddy said.At present, I can feed 500 poor people a day. But, if any voluntary agency comes forward to support my endeavour, I will consider expanding it, he said.Asked whether his scheme was a populist one to counter the TDP governments NTR Anna canteens, the MLA said he took the initiative as the government canteens did not take off.Last year, the Naidu government started just one canteen near Secretariat at Velagapudi as a token measure. Though he said the scheme would be expanded to all over the state, he failed to fulfil the promise, the MLA said."
593adf737be9e009ad91b809,Curbs on cattle trade could spell long-term economic disaster,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/jun/05/curbs-on-cattle-trade-could-spell-long-term-economic-disaster-1612904.html,2017-06-05,"On May 26, the Union environment ministry issued a notification making it mandatory for all buyers at markets of bovine species  cows, bullocks and buffaloes  to give an undertaking that the purchase is not for slaughter. There is enormous paper work that goes with it.Two goals are sought to be achieved: First, buying cattle for slaughter from cow markets, even for legal abattoirs, is now impossible; second, trade and transportation of cows for dairying, too, will become restricted, spelling doom for cow markets.Dairy cycle disruptedThe normal dairy economy assumes the life span of a milch cow to be 8-9 years, after which output tapers off and becomes uneconomical. The farmer thereafter sells his aged stock and uses the money to renew his livestock. In the normal cycle, the ageing stock goes to the abattoirs as meat for exports and skin for the leather industry. However, with a ban on slaughter in most states in place and abattoirs being forced to shut down, the dairy farmer is staring at a huge financial crisis: the resale value of cows has plummeted, and the farmers ability to renew and create a healthy stock is under serious strain; on the other hand, being forced to tend to uneconomical cattle has brought him to the brink of financial collapse.By the blanket ban on slaughter, the once prosperous dairy economy has been fractured. Besides putting thousands of butchers out of work, rearing of cows and bullocks has been on the decline. In Maharashtra, the average price of the milch cow has fallen to less than `50,000 a head compared to `65,000 two years ago. It has also led to abandoned herds of ageing cattle wandering about facing slow starvation and cruel death. With farmers increasingly turning to the buffalo, the recent government measures, far from preserving the cow, may in fact lead to its slow extinction.Exports hitBesides dairying, bovine meat and meat products are central to the countrys food chain and economy. India has the largest bovine  cattle and buffalo  population in the world, accounting for 200 million heads or 14 per cent of the worlds bovine stock. Nearly 80 million people consume beef in the country with domestic consumption touching two million tonnes.Though No 5 in the world in beef consumption, India became the highest exporter of beef (almost entirely buffalo meat) in FY15 trading 2.4 million tonnes (20 per cent of world exports), and dislodging Brazil for the top slot. Export earnings accounted for $4.8 billion in FY15, more than the country got from basmati rice exports! Beef exports dipped in FY16 on account of the lower global orders. Exports could decline further, if anti-beef campaign gains momentum. In Uttar Pradesh, which accounts for nearly 60 per cent of Indias exports, the closure of abattoirs and the general clampdown will have serious implications for export earnings and jobs.For the leather and fashion accessories industry, too, it is now going to be a grim future.Abhishek Waghmare, writing for IndiaSpend.org, estimates that the fall in global demand and short supply of hides, has led to the shutdown of 128 of Kanpurs 400 tanneries. Kanpur district is still a leading producer of leather and leather goods with a quarter or 268 of the countrys footwear factories and 40 per cent of Indias leather exports; but since 2014, leather exports have fallen 11 per cent.Dairying, beef production and exports, and leather and leather goods have been a rapidly growing segment of the farm and industrial economy. Unfortunately, vigilantism and regressive legislation is turning the clock back.(The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com)"

""On March 27, the chief minister will land in Bagdogra and head for Jalpaiguri. In the evening, she will attend a meeting of the council,"" said Sourav Chakraborty, the Alipurduar MLA, who visited Jalpaiguri today to oversee the preparations for the March 27 meeting. ""The chief minister will discuss a number of development projects taken up for the tribal people in north Bengal and elsewhere at the meeting. In her recent visits to the Darjeeling hills, the chief minister had made announcements like creation of new development boards for hill communities and formation of separate Kalimpong district. After such announcements, demands like creation of an autonomous board for tribal people in the Terai and the Dooars arose. The adivasis have been complaining about lack of full-fledged implementation of social welfare schemes, poor quality of rice provided by the state government and absence of employment opportunities,"" said a source in the tribal council. In such a situation, he said, the government intends to give impetus to the progress of adivasis, particularly because the rural polls are scheduled for next year. ""In north Bengal, votes of tribal people are important in rural belts. Along with tea estates of the Dooars and the Terai, there are tribal belts in districts like South Dinajpur and Malda. That is why Trinamul does not want to take any chance and tries to retain its base in tribal belts,"" said an observer. Other issues which are likely to be discussed at the meeting are the longstanding demand of land rights for tea plantation workers and implementation of social welfare schemes by panchayats in tea estates, the source said. The council is headed by Mamata and has state tribal affairs minister James Kuzur and a number of MLAs from north Bengal as its members. Birsa Tirkey, the state president of the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, is also a nominee at the council. Along with them, the chief secretary, officials of tribal affairs departments and MPs from the region will be present at the meeting."
