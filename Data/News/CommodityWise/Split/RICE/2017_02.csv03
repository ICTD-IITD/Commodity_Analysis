In fact, we have lowered our prices and made it affordable for our investors,"" said Animesh Bhattacharya, managing director of Malda Food Park.The Malda park, an initiative of state, is spread across 38.12 acres, of which 29.40 acres can be let out. At present, an acre costs Rs 63 lakh.Similarly, the Jangipur park, spread over a 100-acre land, has not been able to draw much attention even after a price cut of Rs 30 lakh, bringing the rate down to Rs 60 lakh from Rs 90 lakh for an acre.The Centre and the state have a 20 and 7 per cent stake, respectively, in the Jangipur food park. Four private players hold the remaining stake.""As of now, about 40 acres have been used for infrastructure development and 6 and 10 acres have been provided to a rice mill and a management institute, respectively.

The KMSS had also campaigned against the BJP ahead of last year's Assembly polls. ""By linking everything with Hindutva, the BJP and RSS are out to destroy the secular fabric and unity among various communities in our state. The BJP is projecting Lachit Borphukan as a Hindu hero but not mentioning that his close aide, Bagh Hazarika, was a Muslim. They fought together against the Mughals to protect the secular Assamese community. Assamese people have never lived as Hindus, Muslims or Christians. Our identity is Assamese. The BJP is luring student leaders and adding Hindutva elements to our secular culture,"" KMSS leader Akhil Gogoi said. ""We have invited several intellectuals and student leaders to discuss this growing threat and decide how to launch a joint movement to save our unique secular fabric,"" he said. The three-day convention from March 31 to April 2 will be held at Tengani in Golaghat district, from where KMSS was launched in 2002. Student leaders belonging to the Moran, Muttock, Tai Ahom, Mising, Sootea, Sonowal Kachari, tea tribes, Gorkhas, Deori, Rabha, Dimasa, Goria Moria, and Tiwa communities have been invited to the convention. A round-table conference on threats posed by communalism and fascism to liberalism and regionalism has also been planned. Author Jyotirmoy Jana, Dibrugarh University lecturer Chandan Sarma, Gauhati University professor Akhil Ranjan Dutta, IIT Guwahati professor Arup Jyoti Saikia, and Gauhati High Court advocate Shantanu Borthakur are likely to take part. ""The convention will showcase the colourful culture of various ethnic communities irrespective of religion. Each household in Tengani has agreed to donate Rs 200, rice and vegetables for the convention as its purpose is to save the secular Assamese community,"" Akhil said. The KMSS yesterday demanded the withdrawal of the word "" namami"" from Namami Brahmaputra Festival, to be held from March 31, saying it was an attempt by the BJP government to add RSS and Hindutva elements to the festival. Anand Prakash Tiwari, the managing director of Assam State Transport Corporation, who is associated with Namami Brahmaputra Festival, today said namami, a Sanskrit word meaning namaskar (obeisance) was an expression of gratitude and reverence to the mighty son of the Brahma (Brahmaputra)."

Telegraph picture Ranchi's artist couple, Haren and Sharmila Thakur will be displaying their works at Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai from March 28 to April 3. The paintings and sculptures of the duo, depicting important aspects of the tribal life in Chotanagpur, will be displayed at the week-long exhibition, themed on ""Tribal Musings"". Elaborating on the theme, Haren said, ""It's nothing highly intellectual. Nor does it concern socio-economic issues. It's about the simple philosophy of tribal life as depicted in their harmonious relationship with nature and the cosmic shelter."" To this Sharmila added, ""I have tried to capture their frustration arising out of the depletion of natural resources. A caring mother and women's empowerment are other ideas."" Even though they have picked similar themes, their style of work is a lot different. Haren's paintings are mostly mixed media collages on Nepali rice paper, which has an intricate illustrative layout, while Sharmila's paintings are akin to relief work, which gives a three-dimensional impression and are often made of paper (papier) mache. For her short and medium-size sculptures, Sharmila uses both papier mache and plaster of Paris. A preview of some of the exhibits also explained their widely varied colour schemes. In contrast to Haren's light and soothing palette suitable for his stylised paintings, Sharmila uses rustic and vibrant colours to present her eternal theme in a modern way. ""Even though we will get a spacious accommodation at Jehangir Art Gallery, the number of exhibits may vary keeping in mind points such as light fixtures and gaps between paintings and sculptures to allow proper oscillating space, among others,"" Haren hinted. Haren plans to display about 70 paintings while Sharmila will show 35 of her works, besides 20 sculptures. ""Since Jehangir Art Gallery is one of the most prestigious and modern art galleries of the country, it is in great demand. So, we had to book it some 5 years ago,"" Haren said. Though their works have featured fairly regularly in group exhibitions across the country, they haven't held solo or joint exhibitions that often. Haren held a solo exhibition at India International Centre in New Delhi in 2012. Sharmila's last solo exhibition was in the early 90s at Birla Academy in Calcutta. They also had a joint exhibition at another gallery in Mumbai, also in the 1990s. ""It's been a long time since then and we now have a new set of works, which we hope will be appreciated by art lovers and connoisseurs of Mumbai,"" Haren said."

The labourers and their families demonstrated in the Dooars garden, alleging that there were differences in the samples of rice shown to them and the actual stock provided to them. There had been complaints from a number of tea estates over the quality of rice. This is, however, the first time that the workers and their families resorted to demonstration and refused the rice from the ration shop on a tea estate. Bhagatpur Tea Estate has a total of 1,735 workers. Today, family members of the workers reached the ration shop run by Ramesh Sharma to take the rice provided under the state's Khadyasathi scheme - an extension of the National Food Security Scheme of the Centre. They found that mites and insects were crawling out of rice sacks. ""There were different types of mites in the rice. A foul smell was emanating from the sacks as they were opened and the rice weighed,"" Tanuja Majhi, a woman worker, said. As the labourers found that the rice was of inferior quality, they became agitated and demonstrated in the garden for around three hours. None of them took the rice from the shop and returned with empty bags. The workers have threatened to launch a movement if they are not provided with proper quality rice. Under the scheme, each tea garden worker's family is provided with 35kg rice a month at 45 paisa per kg. In Bhagatpur, the workers said they were provided with the entire quota of 35kg in two installments, that is, once in a fortnight. The ration dealer in the garden said he was just authorised to distribute rice. ""Rice is supplied from government godowns. We have nothing to say about it. We only distribute it among workers. I am in no position to comment on the quality,"" Sharma said. The protest has made the garden management react. Shyam Sundar Saha, a garden management representative, said: ""We will inform the district food and supplies department in writing about the issue. It is true that the workers did not take the rice today."" Tea garden trade union leaders have criticised the state government for the poor quality of rice. ""We have received a number of complaints in this regard. The state ministers, including the chief minister, had elaborately talked about inclusion of tea garden workers and their families in the rice distribution scheme. But now, things have become miserable for these people as they are being supplied with inferior quality of rice which none can consume,"" Ramlal Murmu, the vice-president of Citu-backed Cha Bagan Mazdoor Union, said. Mani Kumar Darnal, the joint general secretary of the National Union of Plantation Workers that is affiliated to Intuc, said: ""We have time and again informed officials of the food and supplies department about the inferior quality of the rice. But nothing has changed so far. The state ministers had made big talks about the scheme but there has been absence of a proper monitoring mechanism to ensure that people in tea gardens get rice of proper quality,"" he said. Both the leaders said if such complaints kept on coming, they would launch a movement. Officials of the district food and supplies department here said they were looking into the issue. ""We always keep a close watch over the entire distribution process. If the beneficiaries have made such a complaint, we will surely look into it,"" Rinchen Sherpa, the district food controller of Jalpaiguri, said."

We have the capacity to carry out HADR (Humanitarian Assistance Disaster Relief) operations and our capacity is going to increase with time,"" Lanba told reporters in New Delhi.Cox's Bazar, the longest unbroken sea beach in the world, bore the brunt of the cyclone, with five people dead, over 20,000 houses destroyed and hundreds of trees uprooted, blocking roads all over the district.In Bhola district, an infant died while in Rangamati, a woman and a girl were crushed to death when trees fell on their houses. In Bandarban, a man was killed. At least 10 people were injured.A total of 1,700 tonnes of rice and cash assistance of 13.7 million taka have been allotted for the 16 coastal districts affected in the storm, Mostafa said.Prime Minister Hasina today appreciated her government, saying a quick response mechanism averted severe casualties and damages.""We are well capable of managing fallout from disasters. Cyclones and calamities will come. Our job is to take measures to avoid human losses.""We are lucky as well since the storm hit the land during the ebb tide and as a result the storm surge did not become deadly,"" she said in the Parliament.Hasina said a number of houses and establishments were damaged as well as countless trees were uprooted.She said: ""We are preparing a list of affected people who had lost their houses"" to extend hands in rebuilding their houses and establishments damaged by the cyclone.She also said that two Navy ships have reached Kutubdia and Teknaf which are the worst affected areas to carry out relief operations while helicopters were kept ready to operate in the areas if needed.Mora, packing winds of up to 150 kilometres per hour, made landfall in the country yesterday, tearing through the southwest districts including low-lying areas.Authorities spearheaded a massive evacuation campaign as the meteorological department had issued the ""great danger signal no 10"" in a scale of 10 as the tropical cyclone, brewed in the warm waters of the Bay of Bengal, proceeded towards the country's coastlines.Despite low casualty figure, the storm left behind a trail of destruction as thousands of people lost their houses.Thousands of Rohingya refugees hunkered down in the ruins of their camps waiting for help after a night in the rain with official saying the storm severely ravaged their makeshift shelters in Cox's Bazar which borders Myanamr.Authorities in Cox's Bazar and neighbouring Chittagong district evacuated some 350,000 people from low-lying areas before the storm struck when most Rohingyas remained in their flimsy shelters in the camps.Officials estimated that about 350,000 Rohingyas took refuge in Bangladesh following a new influx last October, when the Myanmar army launched an offensive in response to insurgent attacks.The meteorological department yesterday said that the severe cyclonic storm 'Mora' moved northward over North Bay and started crossing Cox's Bazar-Chittagong coast. It was likely to move in a northerly direction further, it said.All flights were suspended to and from Chittagong international airport and the Cox's Bazar airports yesterday.As many as 300,000 people had been taken to shelters in more than 10 districts most vulnerable to the cyclone.The districts affected with the storm include Cox's Bazar, Chittagong, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Feni, Chandpur, Barguna, Patuakhali, Bhola, Barisal and Pirojpur.By late last night, the cyclone began losing strength.Road Transport Minister Obaidul Quader has said that the government has disbursed cash assistance of 18.7 million taka for the affected areas.Bangladesh is often hit by bad storms between April and December that cause deaths and widespread destruction.Cyclone Roanu hit the southern coast of Bangladesh last year, leaving 20 people dead and forcing half a million to flee their homes.The Mora cyclone formed after heavy rains in Sri Lanka caused floods and landslides killing over 200 people."

Haryana farmer Surjeet Singh, 64, has a strain of high-yield and salt-tolerant rice named after him. Naga musician Moa Subong has created a new bamboo-based wind instrument, the BamHum. The trio are now spending a fortnight with 11 other innovators, artists and authors at Rashtrapati Bhavan under the In-residence Programme, working on projects and receiving ""mentoring and support"" as well as ""linkages"" with institutions that can help them. Manoj, from Hosur, has been promised a patent within a year --- a fifth of the time it normally takes. ""I got to meet several ministers. Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman said she was forming a special committee to take my project forward,"" he said. ""I got a lot of help from the department of biotechnology, which will help manufacture the device."" He added that human resource development minister Pravash Javadekar was ""most interested in my education and wanted to know how he could help"". Manoj is not keen on making too much money out of his device. ""I have been contacted by private firms but that will increase the price. My device costs only Rs 900 now. I have help from the (public-sector unit) Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, so I want it manufactured for the public."" The boy began working on his project two years ago after his grandfather died following a silent heart attack --- a kind that shows few, if any, symptoms such as chest pain or shortness of breath. His device includes a patch that detects the secretion of fatty-acid-binding protein 3, a warning signal. ""It can warn high-risk individuals, with diabetes or high cholesterol, six hours before a silent heart attack,"" he said. ""I like reading medical journals. After the department of biotechnology identified me two years ago, I got full access to the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore (an hour from Hosur). Anil Gupta, a professor at the National Innovation Foundation (NIF), mentored me."" Singh, a farmer from Karnal, said: ""We villagers have been inventing things forever. Every other day I see people developing a new crop or implement. Now, through this programme and government agencies, we are getting recognised and others are benefiting from our inventions."" Singh had lost his entire paddy crop, except one stalk, to sheath blight disease in 2008. He took the single surviving plant and harvested it in a nursery. He continued experiments with seeds spawned by the survivor and developed the Surjeet Basmati-1 strain, which is free from foot-rot disease (Bakanae disease), withstands salinity and gives a high yield. Santosh Pachar, from Sikar in Rajasthan, has developed a high-yield variety of carrot. ""I used to show off my better carrot varieties to neighbours, and the agriculture department officers told everyone about it. The people of my village will be so happy when I tell them about all I have seen here,"" she said. Subong and his wife have a band called Abiogenesis and ""have travelled the world playing folk fusion music"". ""I was a bit uneasy about coming here, thinking I'd be suffocated by protocol and procedure. Now I want to tell people back home that the best human on earth lives here,"" he said."

Picture by UB Photos Nagaon, March 20: Starvation forced a woman to drown her daughter in a river and poison her son at Bamunijan village under Raha police station of Assam's Nagaon district last night. Her subsequent suicide bid, however, was foiled. Homemaker Sadhani Das, 39, threw her five-year-old daughter, Chenimai, into the Kalang river on the village outskirts around 10pm. Her son Ratan, 9, was forced to drink insecticide along with her. Sadhani's husband Ranjit works for a private firm inKerala and has not been home in a long time. ""I cannot deal with our growing financial crisis as my husband is not here. Even a grocery store owner does not want to give rice on credit. This is my last option. I threw my daughter into the Kalang. Ratan and I drank poison,"" she said. The villagers of Bamunijan found the doors of the house closed till 9am. When there was no response to their knocks, they broke the windows and discovered Sadhani and her son lying unconscious on the floor. ""We reported the matter to the police who took the two to Nagaon for treatment. This is a case of suicide and poverty is the reason,"" said Uparjan Das, a villager. Raha police station officer-in-charge Jaswant Nath said a search is on to trace the daughter. ""When we rescued the woman she was unconscious and not in a position to tell us about the girl.

""Ninety per cent of the villagers live below the poverty line here. Frequent floods in the Kopili and Kalang rivers force the villagers to move out in search of jobs as cultivation is not financially viable,"" Uparjan said. Sadhani's husband had to leave for Kerala after repeated floods in the area. ""Ranjit was informed of the tragedy over phone and he is coming home. He will reach Raha within three days,"" said Ananda Das, another villager. Nagaon civil hospital, where Sadhani is admitted, said her condition is stable.

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170327/jsp/northeast/story_142860.jsp,2017-03-27,"An elderly woman dries pepper in a village in West Garo Hills. Picture by Saidul Khan Tura, March 26: People in Meghalaya's Garo hills, who largely depend on jhum (shifting) cultivation, are making efforts to tackle climate change by taking up other activities for sustainable livelihood. Under the North East Region Community Resource Management Society for Upland Areas (NERCORMP), a project funded by the DoNER ministry, the indigenous communities were motivated to form self-help groups and natural resource management group (NaRM-G) for building capacity and initiating development. In 2011, the NERCORMP-II project was launched in West Garo Hills to introduce livelihood and economic activities for the people living on the edge with the potential threat of climate change. ""We were introduced to sustainable farm practice and given revolving funds. We took advantage of the opportunity to carry out plantation of fruit-bearing plants like mango and jackfruit and spices,"" said William D. Sangma, secretary of Damal Onthapara NaRM-G. Damal Onthapara village is under Dalu development block in the West Garo Hills. The Garo community has a vast indigenous conservation knowledge, reflected in its ancient rituals and ceremonies. However, the rampant practice of jhum has led to clearance of green cover. The vast forest area was cleared for jhum, which had a cascading impact. Streams in many places ran almost dry and the age-old belief of protecting the forest had lost its importance. Under the project, beneficiaries were motivated to keep a selected area as a ""community conserve area"". In 2011, Damal Onthapara adopted a resolution to conserve 60 hectares in the village, which accounts to around 30 per cent of the total area. The village has 25 households under NaRM-G. ""We took a decision to conserve the area and that it will not be touched for the next eight years,"" William said. In the conserved area, the villagers, with assistance from society, have undertaken plantation of bamboo and other plants apart from fruit-bearing trees. ""Nobody is allowed to enter the area without NaRM-G's permission. Those violating the rules are penalised,"" he added. William said if anybody enters the conserved area and cuts down a tree or hunts an animal or a bird, they have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000, 100kg rice and a cow. The community reserve forest has reinstated a sense of local governance under the ambit of NaRM-G. It has also aided in the conservation of critical ecosystems, including conservation of animals like hoolock gibbon, slow loris, monkey, deer, rabbit, Himalayan cat, monitor lizard, porcupine and wild boar. In many villages, including Damaldipo, an elephant corridor is being protected. The conserved area has made the villagers resistant to destructive activities and helped them learn the importance and benefits of agro-biodiversity. ""After keeping the conserved area protected for a minimum of eight to 10 years, we will allow the villagers to extract bamboo and timber for construction of houses and sell fruits in the market for sustained income,"" said Nollen Marak, president of Damaldipo NaRM-G. Nollen is the chief of Damaldipo village under Dadenggre sub-division in the West Garo Hills. It has 45 households under NaRM-G. He said they had decided to keep the conserved area back in 2002. However, in 2011, when society adopted the village, the project materialised. ""We have agreed to protect the 60-hectare area. In the past four years, we have not extracted anything. Our people don't even enter the conserved area to collect bamboo shoots,"" Nollen said. He said the area is protected like sacred groves, known as kosi. For most villagers, the conserved area acts as a source of identity, culture, autonomy and freedom. ""It is our wealth. We have the right to protect and conserve it,"" said Debath Marak, secretary of Damaldipo NaRM-G. The concept has helped several villages restore the ecosystem in the face of threats posed by jhum. ""In the past four years, jhum has come down drastically,"" said Changji D. Sangma of Damal Onthapara. ""The barren lands, which were kept abandoned for the past 10 years, have been cultivated. We planted cashew nut, areca nut, oranges and banana,"" he said. It is common practice in villages to abandon jhum land for about 10-12 years. The villagers have taken advantage of the project to undertake plantation. Overall, the approach has closely connected the communities to their surroundings and involved them in the decision-making process through NaRM-G, wherein the nokma (village chief) is a key member. ""The project has been able to touch the lives of the people and reduce poverty. We have supported the beneficiaries with innovative approaches to take advantage of the rich natural resources,"" said Jenifer Khumlo, an NERCORMP official based in Tura."

He had not unearthed any scams as there are no scams at all, Gupta added.About the allegations that there was a scam in the purchase of rice for Anna Bhagya scheme from Chattisgarh, he said rice was purchased from Chattisgarh government in 2013-14 as per norms, after the approval of Karnataka Cabinet.After 2013-14, rice was not purchased from any state as Karnataka procured it from the Union government at a subsidized rate."

We even heard Tewari saying to some seniors over the phone that he will not let go of that file till he takes it to its logical end. We do not know with whom he was talking, but he was very furious.According to sources, Tewari was after the foodgrain purchase mafia.BJP MP and former minister Shobha Karandlaje, who has written letters twice to Adityanath, said soon after Tewari took charge as the commissioner, he started inquiring with the ground level officers on the quantity of rice and wheat that were purchased and transported to ration shops.He had sensed all was not well in the system and he knew about a scam in the foodgrain purchase. Shobha said, Tewari had prepared a report on the same and was about to submit it to CBI. But before he could do that, he was killed. I have learnt that his reports, the files that he kept for inquiry and CCTV footage of a godown have all been destroyed.A senior official from the department denied any scam. We purchase rice from the Food Corporation of India for `3 per kilo. Every month we spend around `145 crore for the same. The FCI is a Union government agency. We do not buy rice or wheat from the open market. Only in 2013, was there a shortage of rice.Then we purchased rice from the Chhattisgarh government. We have not purchased from any private agency. Where does the question of a scam or mafia come from? It is just a rumour that people and the media are spreading, he said.Tewaris brother Mayank Tewari met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday."

Crushed and almost broken, it looks victim to an angry mob. The bright yellow it once was, is now dust-coated, rust infesting its joints.Poes Garden, the area that was abandoned by politicians and cadres after the arrest of AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala, has suddenly come alive in recent days. The walls that were draped in emerald green posters with the face of an iconic woman, is now taking non-uniform shades of purple and grey. The face in highlight is that of a man who rocked Tamil cinema.Thalaiva, Super Star, Baasha or simply Rajinikanth, the icon has once again hinted an interest in politics. This cycle never ends. Once every few years, a political wind blows on this street instead of the neighbouring one. It dies off before you know, assures the inquisitive local driver, who has been working in the neighbourhood for over a decade now. On one day there is some crowd, but when he doesnt speak out, no one really comes here.Tamil Nadu, however, wont be surprised if Rajini plunges into politics as the State has seen several cinema icons make the transition to being political leaders. However, given the actors history of remaining indecisive, even his fans doubt if he will make a successful entry into the arena. While enthusiastic fans have started sticking posters, the more prudent ones wait and watch on their televisions when a crowd forms at his gate. Reality is different though. Except for a couple of police officers, there is nobody with political intent on his street on a Monday noon.Outside Veda Illam, where former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa lived, there are more police officers and even a couple of intelligence officers. Inactivity invades the space and, a police officer droops off his plastic chair; his mouth wide open, beads of sweat dripping from his forehead. Eyes closed, he sleeps with his legs stretched. He loosely holds a walkie-talkie that buzzes in his hanging palm.What crowd? I learnt that there was a crowd only by watching TV after going home, Saraswathi V exclaims. The street vendor has been selling food for the last 27 years in the same spot. She is the longest-standing spectator to all political developments at Poes Garden. Literally.Its 2pm and Saraswathi is busy serving food to a crowd of customers she knows by name. While a series of Rajini posters adorn the wall behind her, the crowd seeks the two apolitical women in front of it. With a wooden table, a few vessels and an umbrella, Saraswathi and her daughter Jaya Lakshmi are sandwiched between the wall and a metal railing. Remembering times when she had to cook 15kg of rice to serve 300 police officers and other political denizens, she sighs at her 3kg pot that is half full at 4pm.I dont think my business will ever pick up again. Unless theres political activity, I do this for the sentiment, she says.The gaps remain open between the railings that run through the roads near Poes Garden. The chains that once helped streamline the exploding crowd, hang loosely ready to become taut when needed. As everything and everyone at Poes Garden await activity, will things reach a crescendo again?"

When I try to get her off it by giving her rice and fish, she simply refuses to eat. What should I do?Hi,For whatever reason, when you want to shift from one type of food to another, it is as difficult as breaking a bad habit or beginning our regular gym workouts. Our beloved pets choose to starve themselves when they dont get the food of their choice and we beat ourselves with guilt as we cannot see them suffer. The trick is to not give in to their tantrums and consistently ease them out of the old habit of while equally slowly introducing the new without them even realizing it.If you look at the back of the commercial food bags, they would usually recommend a gradual shift from the home cooked food to the commercial food by mixing increasing amounts of the kibbles to decreasing amounts of home food until your pet is fully eating the commercial food. You can use a similar reverse approach to change your cats food habits. Add a very small quantity of home cooked food to her current meals so that she eats it up without even noticing it. Over a few days, when you are having repeated success with the initial quantity, increase it marginally and repeat the process. Slowly but surely, your cat will slowly start preferring fresher tastier and variety in your home foods against the commercial food. Voila, one day you can give her all home cooked food and she will gobble it up, much to Mommas satisfaction.In addition, I would advise you to consult your vet to identify beforehand if there are any chances of nutritional deficiencies that could occur and manage using supplements or safe ingredients for your pet. Some human food is not safe for pets.Exercise a lot of caution when preparing food for your pets."

He shared the dais with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and JD(S) leader H D Deve Gowda.If Yeddyurappa is allowed to participate in rallies held under caste banners, then why is Eshwarappa taken to task for associating himself with the Brigade, which is trying to make space for the oppressed classes in politics? The Brigade is only trying to help the BJP consolidate Dalits, minorities and backward classes, he said.He also pointed out that Yeddyurappa was only damaging BJPs prospects among the oppressed classes. Asked whether the Brigade would be a closed chapter with Yeddyurappa on Sunday announcing that Eshwarappa would no more participate in the Brigades programmes, Mukadappa said, The Brigade is not running for the sake of Eshwarappa. We will continue with our programmes. The poor and voiceless people are not interested in just free rice and milk given by the Siddaramaiah government. They want political representation."

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, April 26: Government laxity in giving the green signal has throttled a Rs 128-crore project for redevelopment of the British era Taladanda canal. Officials of the water resources department had completed the ground work and submitted a detailed project report for it nearly a year ago. However, despite chief minister Naveen Patnaik overseeing the department, the government is still to issue orders for its execution. The project envisages restoration of an 11.78km stretch of the 150-year-old canal running in the city between Jobra and Biribati. Decades of neglect has caused silt deposits along the stretch, in turn, damaging and eroding the banks. The 83km canal is Odisha's longest waterway that begins at Jobra and links the Mahanadi river with the Bay of Bengal in Paradip. ""We have drawn up the project under the Canal Lining and System Renovation Programme, which includes work on the canal bed and fortification of eroded banks with sidewalls to restore the stretch to its original look and function as an irrigation channel,"" executive engineer, Mahanadi (south division) irrigation, Prasanta Kumar Das told The Telegraph today. ""We have split the project into two phases. The Rs 58-crore first phase covers a 5.34km stretch, while the remaining 6.44km is estimated to cost Rs 70 crore,"" Das said. An official said a technical advisory committee had approved the project report and it was now up to a high-power committee to decide whether the government would fund the project or go for external funding. The redevelopment plan includes three bridges over the canal aimed to address traffic problems in the respective locations in Cuttack. While one bridge will connect the road on the western boundary of SCB Medical College and Hospital at Ranihat with Jobra on the other side of the canal, another has been planned near Matrubhaban to connect with OMP Square. The third bridge across the canal will connect Matagajpur with the Cuttack-Paradip road near the Central Rice Research Institute at Bidyadharpur. Work to restore the canal to resemble the irrigation channel it used to be more than a century ago had been undertaken in 2011 with long-term loan from the Asian Development Bank for the Odisha Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Project. But, the 11.78km stretch running through the city was dropped because of encroachments lining it. Guidelines of the development bank refused funding in the presence of encroachments, an official said. The East India Company dug up parts of the canal in 1862 for irrigation purposes and creating a waterway. It was taken over by the British government, which completed the project in 1869. Later, the state government made some additional constructions to extend the tail end at Atharbanki near Paradip in 1964. The canal provides irrigation water to six blocks in Cuttack and Jagatsinghpur districts - Sadar Cuttack, Jagasinghpur, Raghunathpur, Balikuda, Tirtol and Ersama."

They had been given tokens to eat in the Konark restaurant at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium after the previous mess suppliers contract ran out on May 31.Devika ML, Assistant Director, DYES, who has been assigned with the task of overseeing the needs of the hostel, said she hoped to ring in changes as soon as possible.The issue of the food contractor has been discussed and we have shortlisted three people who we see as worthy to take up the job. There is no tender process for the same but we have certain guidelines to be followed and the issue will be sorted in another day or two, she added.The athletes who train rigorously twice a day have been given a limited menu for the last week, something that barely satisfies their nutrition needs. We used to have 8-10 chappatis and rice when the food was being supplied in the canteen but now we are allotted just one chappati and a little rice. How are we expected to have enough energy to train then? said an aspiring discus thrower.That being said, we did not go the DYES office to protest or strike yesterday (Tuesday), all we wanted to do was to make the director aware of our plight and speed up the process of getting another caterer.Food was not the only concern at the hostel with athletes being deprived of good drinking water for a couple of days.We have ensured there were arrangements made to have water decanters around the hostel now, said a hostel employee on condition of anonymity.Another issue that is yet to be resolved is how the logistics would work in terms of getting food to the 50-odd boys that are housed at the hockey stadium since the previous contractor used to personally hire a vehicle and have the food delivered there."

Picture by Satananda Bhattacharjee Hailakandi, April 23: The Assam government has launched a three-crop-a-year pilot project with early ahu paddy cultivation in the state to achieve self-sufficiency in rice production under its pilot project, Bringing Green Revolution to Eastern India, a sub-scheme of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. The government has targeted 500 bighas of land in each of the 126 Assembly constituencies of the state for an early ahu season. Generally, two farmers cultivate on one hectare of land to produce as estimated 5 tonnes of paddy. Senior agriculture development officer in Hailakandi, A.R. Ahmed, said for early ahu cultivation, some factors need to be kept in mind, including water source with irrigation facilities. Usually, sali paddy is cultivated in June-July and boro in November-December in the state. The government is trying to encourage the farmers to use their land for early ahu during February to June where the land is cultivable. The government is also providing the seeds and bio-pesticides to the farmers for the purpose. Cachar district agriculture officer Jakir Hussain Choudhury told The Telegraph that Purbashree Farmers' Managing Committee of Khelma has started early ahu plantation in the district. In order to complete a three-crop cycle, ahu cultivation should be started by February-end, he said. It requires120 to 125 days to harvest early ahu crop, and regular sali crop can follow in June and then the ravi crop can be cultivated. He said they have targeted ahu cultivation in each Assembly constituency of the district but some problem or the other has hindered implementation. Choudhury said this is extremely beneficial and the farmers would benefit on a large scale if cultivated properly and would yield much better results than other crops. According to him, the practice should be encouraged, as ahu's yield is much more than other crops. The officer said farmers have been encouraged to cultivate ahu crop on land in south Syedpur under Sonai circle that remained fallow from January to June. Cultivation has started this year. ""Our main target is to utilise the fallow land of farmers throughout the year so that they can benefit financially and also increase food production as desired by the Prime Minister by 2022,"" he said. Choudhury said a series of motivational camps was organised in the villages before starting early ahu cultivation. He said all modern techniques of farming are being utilised for the purpose. Water is the major problem during this time in Barak Valley. Choudhury said without assured irrigation it is impossible to cultivate as the valley is a rain-fed area. The tubewell and deep water sources do not serve irrigation purposes and farmers are dependent on surface water. Of Cachar's total land area of 3,77,610 hectares, cultivable area is 1,83,225 hectares. Mohsin Ali, a farmer in the district, said they are ready to cultivate in all seasons but water is not available during the off-season. Ali alleged that the irrigation schemes are not at all functional here and this is major hurdle in using land throughout the year."

My family phoned me and woke me up from Sri Lanka, he said, his trolley full of nappies for his 18-month-old child.I came because of the crisis.Qatar imports goods such as chicken from Saudi Arabia, and locals quickly took to social media on Monday to complain they would have to eat poultry from Oman instead.Ernest, from Lebanon, said he knew he had to go shopping because others would rush to the shops.Its a cycle of panic and I needed to get pasta, he said, as he shopped with his young family -- pushing not one but two trollies.The story was the same across town at one of the several Monoprix stores, where staff said it had been one of the busiest days at work they had known.In the nearby Al-Meera supermarket, shoppers again packed the store, including Denis from Germany who was convinced that the crisis was just a temporary storm.Just a yellow cardThis is just a yellow card, he said of the country due to host footballs 2022 World Cup.What can they do? It is one of the richest countries in the world.To try to avoid widespread panic-buying, Qatars government issued a statement claiming that shipping routes and airspace will remain open for imports.The Qatari Government will take all necessary measures to... thwart attempts to influence and harm the Qatari society and economy, the statement said.One sector of the economy which could be badly hurt is exports, including goods such as machinery, electronic equipment or livestock transported by road to Saudi Arabia.According to the United Nations, Qatari exports to Saudi Arabia totalled $896 million (796 million euros) in 2015.The severing of ties is also potentially bad news for the service industry, including hotels and cab drivers in Doha.Saudis usually flock to Qatar on holiday during Eid al-Fitr at the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.But with a travel ban now imposed by Riyadh, takings could be down for many south Asian cab drivers who rely heavily on tourists.This is very bad news, very bad news, said Raihan, a driver from India.

Water is sprinkled on it once in a while to keep it cool. The owner of a medicine shop at Nayapalli, who is using khus curtains at his shop, said: Its difficult to use the air-conditioner in an open shop. Besides maintaining a cool environment, the scent of the khus is soothing. G. Ganesh, 40, who has been in the khus business for 20 years, said: The demand for khus has gone up significantly in the city. We are now selling khus at Rs 30 a foot. A standard khus curtain to cover a window will cost around Rs 600. People enjoy watermelon in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. Picture by Ashwinee Pati Summer fruits Fruits also come handy in the heat as people often complain of dehydration. In this season, fruit such as watermelon and sugar palm are in high demand. Sanjay, a roadside vendor at Kalpana Square, said: Watermelons mostly come from west Odisha, particularly Balangir and Sonepur. The sales rise in direct proportion to the soaring mercury. Another fruit that has become extremely popular is the sugar palm or tala saja. Kuni Patra, 39, said: I am selling five to six tala saja at Rs 20. Since it is available for only two months, there is huge demand for it. It also makes you feel cool.Madhumita Pradhan, a private company employee, said: I buy the sugar palm fruit every day. I love it. Like fruits, the demand for fermented rice or water rice (pakhal) has gone up. Almost all eateries, including star hotels, are selling it."

The tax on coal has been fixed at 5%, as against the current 11.69%.There is no increase in taxes on the items considered today. In fact, taxes have come down for many of them, Jaitley said.The Union government is eager to see a seamless transition to the new tax regime, which aims to protect the revenues of the Centre and states without hurting the poor. It is hoped that GST will create a unified market, shore up state and federal tax revenues, cool inflation and accelerate economic growth by 1-2 percentage points in the medium term.The GST Council decided the tax rates for 1,200 goods and 500 services with a majority of the manufactured items and services being kept at 12-18%. It also revised some of the rules on Saturday.Ernst & Young tax partner Divyesh Lapsiwala said the formats of return have been changed significantly. Taxpayers will have to review all the revised requirements in detail to make sure that no new data elements are required. This will mean that taxpayers will need a longer lead time to get ready for compliances, he said.The Council also decided to set up an anti-profiteering body to check companies from over-charging consumers. Detailed rules in this regard will emerge later, said Rajeev Dimri, leader of indirect tax at BMR & Associates."

The injured forester, P Thangaraj, breathed his last at a private hospital on Sunday.While the details still are shrouded in mystery, police said that it all began when M Kirubakaran alias Buvaneswaran (29), a tailor with a private garments unit and a resident of Jothi Nagar in Pollachi, contacted his friend Balan (45), a native of Villupuram, to discuss ways to make some quick money.Balan had the perfect plan laid out for Kirubakaran: the tested and tried rice-pulling iridium scam. However, in this case, it was a Kalasam that possessed the powers to pull grains towards it. His eyes all lit up, Kirubakaran invited Balan to his house. On Wednesday evening, Balan along with friends S Senthil (41) and R Nataraj (50) went landed at Kirubakarans place to discuss business.Even as the discussions were on, two tribal persons walked in carrying a sack with the much-hyped iridium Kalasam in it. The tribals told Balan that they wanted to sell the Kalasam for `6.5 lakh. While the parties were transacting business, in walked P Thangaraj along with a few others. Dressed in police uniform, the imposters seized the sack and reportedly found ganja in the sack the tribals were carrying.However, suspicion of Kirubakaran was aroused on noticing the mannerisms and senility of Thangaraj. Kirubakaran immediately stopped him and began questioning. Sensing that their game was up, Thangarajs accomplices - Krishnamoorthy, Kandhan and Natraj - made good their escape in a car leaving behind Thangaraj.Police claim that Kirubakaran gave a chase to the car and attempted to nab the scampering accomplices of Thangaraj. When Kirubakaran returned, he found Thangaraj all alone, with injuries all over his body. Balan and his two friends had also left the place. At loss as to what his next step ought to be, Kirubakaran decided to take Thangaraj to the Pollachi East police station, where he lodged a complaint and a case was registered under section 120(B) Criminal conspiracy and 420 (Cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Investigations revealed that Balan and his friends were Thangarajs accomplices and the entire plot was hatched by them to con Kirubakaran.While Thangaraj was admitted to a private hospital in Pollachi on Wednesday, he died without responding to treatment on Sunday morning. Police claim that Thangaraj lodged a complaint that he was beaten up by his accomplices after their plan came a cropper. Based on the complaint, the Pollachi East police registered a case against Balan, Senthil and Natraj under section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC.Here is where the details get murky. When Express accessed the police reports about these two cases, in the first incident (cheating case), the report says Thangaraj was handed over to the police personnel. However, the statement in the murder case records that Thangaraj was directly admitted to a private hospital. There is no clarity on who admitted Thangaraj to the private hospital, raising suspicions of foul play. Pollachi East police inspector S Subramaniyam too was not fortcoming on details and only said he did not admit Thangaraj to the hospital.What is rice-pulling iridium scam?It is supposed to be a magical device. Swindlers will have you believe it to be an ancient artefact made of copper and iridium. It allegedly possesses astounding capabilities, which include drawing grains of rice towards it. It is highly valuable as conmen claim its utility in nuclear reactors or aeronautics. Some con artists claim that the metal acquires these properties when lightning strikes it or that it falls on earth when lightning strikes, adding to its mystique. Superstitious businessmen are ensnared, believing it will bring them prosperity, while others buy it for its value and mystery. Rice-pullers price can vary from D5 lakh to D6 cr."

The entire conspiracy was scripted by a driver based in Loni, Ghaziabad, who swapped the 120 rice bags midway while transporting the consignment from Karnal to the inland container depot (ICD) in Loni.According to the police, a Karnal-based rice mill dispatched the consignment to ICD in Loni on March 6. The truck reached the Loni depot around 5.30am on March 7. The rice consignment was later dispatched through rail to a port in Gujarat from where it was shipped to Mauritius on April 11.The consignment was opened in Mauritius on April 12. The importer found that the first two rows of bags contained rice while the remaining rows of bags were filled with sand. The importer sent a communication to the rice mill in Karnal and they sent us an objection along with a penalty of Rs 8 lakh. We traced the swap after the rice mill informed us, said Nitin Gupta, the transporter.According to the police, Gupta had hired the erring container truck and the driver from a third party as his trucks were not available on March 6.#Ghaziabad: Export-quality rice-bags containing sand shipped to Mauritius, Loni police arrest two for goof up @httweets @HTNoidaGzb pic.twitter.com/iHvniA426t  Peeyush Khandelwal (@journopk) June 1, 2017After the goof-up, when Gupta checked the container depot records, he found that the factory seal was different and the weight of the consignment unloaded at the Loni depot was different from what was dispatched from Karnal. He also said generally, the trucks reach inland container depot in Loni by 1am from Karnal, but that particular truck reached the depot around 5.30am on March 7.Suspecting a fraud, Gupta lodged an FIR at the Loni police station for criminal breach of trust and also for cheating against the truck driver.On Thursday, the Loni police arrested truck driver Firoz Ahmad and Majid, his accomplice.They told us that they had unloaded the consignment of rice at Mandola and received a sum of Rs 56,000 in return. Truck driver Firoz received Rs 16,000. They both were arrested. We are also on the lookout for the people who hatched the conspiracy and usurped the export quality rice. More arrests will follow after the accused are questioned in detail, said Srikant Prajapati, circle officer (Loni).The police said they have also received a different complaint earlier about a similar goof-up and will further investigate that matter as well."

They accused Qatar of backing groups such as al-Qaeda, Islamic State and the Muslim Brotherhood and pushing policies that were destabilising the region.Qatar denied the accusations and expressed regret and utter surprise at the coordinated move by the countries that are key players in OPEC and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The foreign ministry criticised the unjustified measures and said there was a smear campaign to harm Qatar.As Saudi Arabia closed its borders and snapped land, air and sea links, residents rushed to supermarkets to stock up on food, Doha News reported. People stocked up on water, milk, meat and rice and photographs of empty shelves in stores circulated on social media, though Qatars foreign ministry said the border closing would not affect normal life.Qatar is home to an estimated 700,000 Indians  whose remittances in 2015 were worth $3.98 billion  and sources said there was no panic in the expatriate community. People are stocking up but theres nothing to worry about, a source said.Indian authorities were keeping a close watch on food supplies and flights in and out Doha against the backdrop of increasing enquiries from Indian nationals about the situation. The sources said they did not expect the spat to last long as such a situation would not benefit Qatar.A similar spat in 2014 was settled in nine months but at that time, only diplomats were withdrawn and borders were not sealed. Qatar gets most of its supplies from Saudi Arabia and it wouldnt make sense to prolong this row, a source said.Map of the Middle East showing countries which have severed diplomatic relations with Qatar. (AFP)However, other sources acknowledged a prolonged crisis could have an impact as Qatar is completely dependent on Saudi Arabia and the UAE for food and other essential supplies.In New Delhi, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said the government was ascertaining the impact of the spat on Indians. There is no challenge arising out of this for us. This is an internal matter of GCC. Our only concern is about Indians there. We are trying to find out if any Indians are stuck there, she told reporters.The spat threatens the prestige of Qatar, which hosts a large US military base and is set to host the 2022 World Cup. Several countries gave Qatari diplomats and nationals between 48 hours and two weeks to leave their soil. Qatars envoy to Egypt was also told to leave in two days.Several airlines, including Etihad Airways, Emirates and Flydubai, said they would cancel flights to and from Doha from Tuesday. The Arab states also closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which suspended all its flights to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemens Houthi rebels also expelled Qatar.Qatar is important to India.

Oil prices rose after the moves against Qatar, the largest supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and a major seller of condensate, a low-density liquid fuel and refining product derived from natural gas.Reza Nourani, chairman of Irans union of exporters of agricultural products, said food can be exported by sea to Qatar, which relies on food trucked in from Saudi Arabia across its sole land border crossing. He said food shipments from Iran could reach Qatar in 12 hours.The current spat had its genesis in reports by Qatars official news agency in late May that purportedly said the Emir, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, had criticised the US, offered backing for Iran, reaffirmed support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and described Qatar-Israel relations as good. Tweets from the news agencys official handle also said Qatar was withdrawing its ambassadors from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE.Qatari officials later denied these reports and said the news agencys website and Twitter account had been hacked.On Monday, Saudi Arabia said in a statement through its SPA state news agency that Qatar embraces multiple terrorist and sectarian groups aimed at disturbing stability in the region, including the Muslim Brotherhood, ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Qaeda.The statement added, Qatar has also supported the activities of the Iranian-backed terrorist groups in the Qatif province of Saudi Arabia and in neighboring Kingdom of Bahrain. It has also financed, adopted and is harboring extremists who seek to destabilise unity at home and abroad.Iran, long at odds with Saudi Arabia, blamed US President Donald Trump for setting the stage during his recent trip to Riyadh. Foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged Qatar and its neighbours to engage in dialogue to resolve their dispute.This April 2014 file photo shows the empty main terminal building of the Hamad International Airport (HIA) in Doha, Qatar. (AP)Neighbours are permanent; geography cant be changed. Coercion is never the solution. Dialogue is imperative, especially during blessed Ramadan, Zarif tweeted. He and his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, discussed the developments in a phone conversation.US secretary of state Rex Tillerson told reporters in Sydney that the spat would not affect the fight against Islamist militants and that Washington has encouraged its Gulf allies to resolve their differences.Turkey called for dialogue and said it was ready to help defuse the row. There could be problems between the countries but dialogue must prevail in all circumstances, said Cavusoglu.The diplomatic rift might cost Qatar and its neighbours billions of dollars by slowing trade and investment and making it more expensive for the region to borrow money as it grapples with low oil prices.However, with an estimated $335 billion of assets in its sovereign wealth fund, Qatar looks able to avoid an economic crisis over the decision by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to cut air, sea and land transport links.The tiny states newly expanded port facilities mean it can continue LNG exports that earned it a trade surplus of $2.7 billion in April, and import by sea goods that used to come over its land border.(with agency inputs)"

Development commissioner Shishir Sinha chaired the meeting attended by industries department principal secretary S. Siddharth and other officials from different departments. The biggest among the investment proposals that got cleared is one related to establishment of a solar energy production unit at Sherghati in Gaya district by a New Delhi-based company. It proposes to invest Rs 81 crore for the unit. Siddharth said all 91 companies have been given stage-I clearance. After SIPB consent, the proposals have to be cleared at the department level within 30 days as the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Act mandates, else they will be deemed as approved. ""We also gave financial clearance to three investment proposals that came previously. One among them is to set up a solar power generation plant worth Rs 30 crore at Baunsi in Banka district. The other two are related to a rice mill and production of salted snacks,"" Siddharth said. Financial clearance decides the amount of VAT (value added tax) reimbursements that a plant could be given after they start production. They have to provide land-related documents, detailed project reports and bank loan approval papers to become eligible for it. This was the fourth SIPB meeting since the Bihar Industrial Investment Promotion Policy (BIIPP) came into effect in December 2016 after notification of its rules. Though no big-ticket investment has come to Bihar so far, as it lacks minerals and availability of land is a problem here, a large number of smaller investment proposals encompassing various sectors are arriving. These proposals are spread across different districts and could help ensure a balanced development of the state. Industries department officials said, so far, 338 such proposals have come after BIIPP came into effect with a potential investment of around Rs 8,000 crore. Egg camps The Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank will organise special camps in 11 districts from April 27 to select entrepreneurs to be given loans for undertaking egg production work. The camps will be held at Patna, Jehanabad, Arwal, Bhojpur, Buxar, Rohtas, Kaimur, Aurangabad, Gaya, Nawada and Nalanda on different dates till May 12, bank chairman A.K. Bhatia said on Monday."

A convincing win by 45 runs (D/L method) over New Zealand and another thumping one over Bangladesh by 240 runs must have give a lot of confidence to the defending champions prior to start of the tournament.One major reason of this Indian sides success is that they are always together and one such instance came when a video featuring Rohit Sharma and other Indian players was uploaded on the official account of the Indian Cricket team. Guys I am Rohit Sharma from Team India. This is our first official team dinner and as you can see the guys are here and we are going to take you somewhere where not many people have been.

It succeeds fairly well.Canto replaces Karma The Liquid Lounge, popular in the early 2000s for filling a gap between nightclub and fine-dining restaurant. In its new avatar, it has a chilled-out, easy vibe. In the midst of families out for a mid-week lunch and noisy kitty-partying women, one does spy the odd office-goer at a quick, solo lunch.Divided up into a voluminous main area on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine level, the sense of space was apparent the moment we walked in. Comfortable tufted couches and wrought-iron-legged tables sit atop black-and-white tiles. Adding a touch of whimsy, two giant paintings of dancers in voluminous skirts dominate one wall. There are pendant lights and wall sconces; and plenty of natural light streaming in from the large windows.The Thai curry bao was disappointing. While the bao was fluffy and perfectly made, the green chicken curry within was criminally salty.

Our next drink, the sour Melodies, was too high on lime juice and too low on gin. We sent it back (and werent charged for it).The slabs of chilly-parmesan polenta, topped with a coconut-redolent Goan green beans foogath, showed us that fusion neednt be all bad. We wish we could have said the same for the Thai curry bao  fluffy, perfectly made baos filled with criminally salty green chicken curry.The mutton sali boti came with caramelised onion rice and was spot on.

The mutton sali boti, though lacking the all-important potato-straw halo, came with caramelised onion rice and was spot on. The suitably straightforward juicy grilled chicken breast with a buttery potato mash on the side was the poster dish for comfort food.The desserts lacked imagination. A competent but boring combination of molten chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice-cream did little to outshine the creamy brilliance of the wobbly blueberry cheesecake with crumbly shortbread base. While Canto may not seem to have any immediate aspirations of being hailed as the hot new place, it does seem to be the kind of restaurant thats happy to stroll along at an unhurried pace.The juicy grilled chicken breast with buttery potato mash was straightforward but well-executed comfort food.

I have to get within the top 500 which can secure me a place in a state-run medical college, Halder told HT.Halder passed plus two level exam in 2000. Since then he has appeared in the medical entrance test every year. (HT Photo)He is also praying that the common medical entrance test does not become mandatory, or even if it, the upper age limit of 30 years for an SC candidate (25 years in the general category) is relaxed. Incidentally, Bengal that does not have any age ceiling. Bengal has got about 2,700 MBBS seats in state-run and private medical colleges.A resident of Pratappur in Krishnaganj of Nadia district in Bengal, a distance of about 125 km from Kolkata, Halder is a poor man. He earns just about Rs 4,000 a month working as an agriculture labourer a month. He has inherited homestead land and does not have any land of his own.When it rains, the walls of bamboo and roof of tin of his house are not even enough to prevent the water from coming in. He could not enroll his name in the BPL list, and therefore, did not get benefits such as cheap rice and a basic house.Halder, whose hairs are graying fast, is not at all perturbed by the jibes that regularly fly at him. Villagers often ridicule me as I prepare and appear for the test every year. But I am not deterred. I will be a doctor one day, he said, the grit apparent in his voice.Read: SC clears common medical entrance test NEET, approves Centres scheduleA resident of a remote Bengal village, where quacks pass off as doctors for the thousands of villagers, Halder is quite an aberration. Why didnt he start practising as a quack, or work as an assistant to a qualified doctor?Halder standing in front of his house. (HT Photo)I dont believe in cheating people. I have confidence in myself and will keep appearing for the entrance test till I qualify, Halder asserted.In 2013, he got in touch with me. I was impressed by his passion, and decided to take him under my wings. His ranks are going up every year. I am really hopeful that he will realise his dream someday, Dr A K Maity told HT. Maity who is a retired government doctor now runs a coaching centre for medical aspirants in Kolkata.Read: Govt bans 32 private medical colleges from admitting students for two yearsSince then every year, Maity brings Halder to Kolkata, puts him up at a shared cheap accommodation for four to six weeks before the entrance examination and helps him prepare for the test. He funds all expenses of Halder during this period.But even he cracks it this time, how will Halder fund his studies? With reference books and hostel expenses, any amount is out of reach of this poor labourer.If I can secure admission, I will fund the studies by some means or the other. There are a lot of kind souls such as Dr Maity who are eager to help me, said Halder. This is the only time the grit in his voice faded and it appeared to be choking a bit.Born in 1969, Halder passed class X from Bengal board in 1986. Then poverty forced him to take a gap. In 2000, he passed plus two level with English, Hindi, physics, chemistry and biology. From that year, began his tryst with the medical entrance exam."

Topping the troubles is the friction between farmers and millers who procured paddy from about 590 villages in the state.Besides, even after the state government introduced a slew of measures to raise paddy production, the Supplyco could procure only 2.28 lakh tonnes of paddy during the January-May period this year. The procurement in the corresponding period stood at 4 lakh tonnes in the previous years.The millers have been forced to procure paddy containing damaged, discoloured, sprouted and weevilled grains, estimating a procurement wastage ranging from 0 to 60 per cent.That is considerably higher than the average of 3-7 per cent provided in the past, leading to the friction between farmers and Supplyco-registered millers in many places.According to farmers bodies, amid the cash crunch and drought, the paddy procurement agencies decision to procure paddy containing immature, shrunken and shrivelled grains with a 0-60 per cent discount per 100 kg has cost the farmers dear. A majority of them were forced to sell their produces at discounted rates following pest attack and plant health issues.Thrissur-based farmer Bijoy V G told Express: I cultivated around three acres of paddy this season and harvested around 7,600 kg. But the millers who procured the paddy provided me a slip for around 7,100 kg. Since there were some shrivelled discoloured paddy, they reduced around 500 kg from my total harvest.Supplyco officers say the maximum discount limit per 100 kg has never been more than seven per cent per 100 kg, except in the 2012-13 season when the limit was raised to 27-30 in Alappuzha following a bund breach and seawater in trusion. This time, in some select pockets, millers procured paddy estimating 60 per cent wastage.This is an unprecedented situation and the millers and farmers have confronted each other over procurement in many places, said Supplyco assistant manager Johny Jose told Express.Most paddy growing areas, especially the 4,000 odd farm clusters (padasekharams), have been experiencing a plethora of plant health issues affecting quality. Such paddy was not found to be conforming to the Fair Average Quality norms prescribed by the government.The millers had no option but to procure paddy estimating wastage in tune with the plant issues in each paddy cluster. The quality norms for procurement of paddy under Minimum Support Price (MSP) cannot be relaxed as the millers used to get 68 kg rice from per 100 kg of procured paddy. The system existing in the dairy sector (farmers fetching a price based on the quality of milk) is worth emulating in the paddy sector as quality is always a matter concern for everyone, he said.The officers also attributed the drop in Supplyco paddy procurement to drought. In many areas, including Palakkad, there is a big drop in the second crop in the wake of the severe drought.A lot of private millers enlisted a procurement process this time buoyed by the good market response for rice in recent times, which might have played a key role in the drop in procurement of paddy by Supplyco, S Leenakumari, director, Rice Research Station (RRS), Mankombu."

Whats wrong if we planned to celebrate the third anniversary in our own traditional way? Bernard N Marak, former West Garo Hills district president of the BJP, questioned.The leader hit the headlines a few days back after he stated that the saffron party would bring down prices of beef in Meghalaya if it comes to power after next years assembly polls.Bernard told the Hindustan Times that the party was to be held in the second week of June in a bid to clear doubts of the local people that BJP was trying to impose a ban on consumption of beef.Meghalaya has a dominant Christian population and consumption of beef is common among the Khasis, Garos and Jaintias - the three major tribes of the northeastern state.The party was growing rapidly in Garo Hills. But now many people are worried and there could be more resignations, Bernard, who plans to contest as an Independent candidate from Tura (South) in 2018, said.The partys North Garo Hills district president Bachu C Marak also posted about holding a beef party with bitchithe local term for rice beeron Facebook on Wednesday.BJPs Meghalaya in-charge Nalin Kohli, who was in Shillong, told HT that the state unit will take steps to remove Bachu or will welcome his resignation.The BJP as a disciplined party will not tolerate any members who, for their personal political gains, digress from Modijis agenda of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas (With Everyone, For Everyones Development), Kohli said.The post announcing a beef party that was uploaded on Facebook by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bachu C Marak. (Photo: Facebook)There are 26 assembly seats in Garo Hills and some party leaders feel the Centres decision to ban the sale of cattle at animal markets for slaughter could affect the partys prospects in the next assembly polls.In a notification announced last week, the government said cows and buffaloes cannot be sold for slaughter at animal markets across India, allowing only farmland owners to trade at animal markets.The notification, which banned the sale of cows, bulls, bullocks, buffaloes, steers, heifers, calves, and camels, has triggered a political storm in India.Kohli, however, feels Bernard and Bachu used the beef row to find a convenient excuse to play the martyr card.None of this will make us digress from the single-minded goal of ousting the corrupt Congress government of Mukul Sangma. More credible leaders and personalities are getting drawn to the BJP on a regular basis, he said.On Wednesday, former legislator Manas Chaudhuri and leader of Federation of Khasi Jaintia and Garo People (FKJGP) Sounder Strong Cajee joined the BJP in Shillong in Kohlis presence."
593ae52a7be9e00e1ecd3d34,Rahul revives bond debate,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170329/jsp/nation/story_143315.jsp,2017-03-29,"Rahul New Delhi, March 28: Rahul Gandhi today re-ignited the debate over electoral bonds by wondering if the BJP government was legalising corruption. Fighting corruption or legalising corruption  what is the BJPs agenda? the Congress vice-president tweeted. Rahul tagged his comment to a news website article on electoral bonds titled Big Corporate Takeover of Political Funding. Sources said the Congress had decided to raise the issue in a big way, alleging a plot to curtail transparency in political funding. The Narendra Modi government had earned goodwill through the inconsequential symbolism of reducing the limit of cash donations to political parties from Rs 20,000 to Rs 2,000 but quickly frittered away the advantage by triggering a controversy over the electoral bonds. Most Opposition parties have decried the electoral bond provision enabled through amendments to income tax laws and the RBI Act that were moved along with the finance bill passed in the Lok Sabha last week. While there is a clamour for bringing political donations under the ambit of the Right to Information Act, a suggestion fiercely opposed by all parties, finance minister Arun Jaitleys decision on electoral bonds has smashed the political consensus. Jaitley responded to the outcry in the Rajya Sabha by asking all parties to offer suggestions on the decision. Notified banks will be able to issue electoral bonds for specified denominations. A person willing to make a donation to a political party can buy the bonds by making payments digitally or through cheque. The bond can then be gifted to a registered political party. The identity of the donor will not be known to the receiver. The party can convert the bonds back into money through their bank accounts. Rahul has asked the Congress leadership to take the lead in the fight against the plan to introduce electoral bonds, portraying it as a retrograde step that nullifies the UPA governments scheme of strengthening the legal framework to ensure transparency. The Congress today raised the issue of non-appointment of a Lokpal and vacancies in institutions that are an integral part of a transparent and accountable regime. The party leadership is anguished at its failure to dent Modis clean image despite the Vyapam, Lalit Modi and Chhattisgarh rice scams and the alleged graft in the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation and the lack of decisive action on the part of the Prime Minister in any of the cases. Despite being in Opposition for three years, the Congress still has not managed to shake off the perceived anti-corruption sentiment among the people against the party. The Congresss desperate attempt to take on the electoral bond issue is being seen against this backdrop. Multiple party spokespersons  Randeep Surjewala, Abhishek Singhvi, Rajeev Gowda, Deepender Hooda  have drawn attention to the subject over the past few days. Surjewala summed up the partys position, saying: On one hand, the BJP government tom-toms transparency of political funding as a primary goal. On the other, the finance bill enables anyone, including a foreign individual/ entity, to donate money to political parties anonymously through the instrument of electoral bonds. He added: The biggest vice is anonymity. There should have been requirements of a declaration as to what is the value of the bond, who is the purchaser and to whom it is donated. All this is absent, leading to complete opaqueness. Earlier, there was a cap on how much donation a company could give to a political party. Surprisingly, that cap has been removed, permitting donations of unlimited amounts. Under the existing laws, a company can contribute up to 7.5 per cent of the average of its net profits in the last three years to political parties. The company is required to disclose the contributions made to parties in its profit-and-loss account along with the names of the recipients. The new scheme removes the limit of 7.5 per cent of net profit and there is no need to disclose the name of the receiver. Though electoral bonds can be purchased by cheque or through electronic money transfer, the transactions will remain a secret. This means, people will have no access to the information on which corporate house has channelled how much money into which political party. Politicians feel the BJP changed the laws because it knows which party is in a position to attract the maximum donations from corporate houses. Congress spokesperson Gaurav Gogoi said today: The BJP government is systematically destroying the pillars of trust built over decades by attacking transparency, accountability and constitutional safeguards. Recalling the delay in the appointment of vigilance commissioners and the chief information commissioner, he rubbished the governments stance in the Supreme Court on the appointment of a Lokpal. Gogoi said: The attorney-general told the court that in the present condition, it is impossible to appoint a Lokpal because there is no leader of Opposition. This is a rude shock. This contradicts his own opinion tendered on July 23, 2014. He had then stated that the provision in the Lokpal and Lokayukata Act of 2013, which provides that vacancies in the selection committee will not invalidate appointments to statutory bodies, covers the situation where leader of Opposition does not exist."""

Muga silk, Assam (orthodox) tea, Karbi Anglong ginger and Tezpur litchi are the other products from Assam with the GI tag. Geographical indication is a mechanism employed to identify agricultural, natural or manufactured goods which possess certain special qualities or characteristics based on climatic or production conditions unique to a geographical location. Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, and Seuj Satirtha, an NGO in Sivasagar, had moved the application for Joha rice. An AAU official said the state government should go all out to promote Joha rice so that it becomes popular like Basmati rice. ""We will have to increase the yield and the productivity of Joha rice,"" the official said, adding that producers of the rice variety need to be encouraged. ""We will have to keep in mind that the attributes for which Joha rice is known is kept intact by the producers,"" the official said. ""The Joha rice varieties are genetically distinct from other classes of rice cultivated in Assam and elsewhere. A study on diversity analysis at DNA-level based on molecular markers clearly showed that Joha rice varieties were distinct from other rice varieties, as reflected in separate grouping from other varieties of Assam rice,"" the report published in the GI journal said. The Joha GI status will be for 43 known varieties of the rice which exist in the region. The report said the uniqueness of Joha rice is attributed to particular climatic conditions prevalent in the area along with varietal characters and system of rice cultivation, adding to the best expression of aroma and flavour in the product. ""The aroma of Joha rice is also considered to be distinctly different from Basmati rice,"" it said. The report said there is a need to protect Joha rice as there is a legitimate concern among the farming community, academics and policy makers that its market potential may be jeopardised by unscrupulous trader/middlemen to sell other small grain aromatic rice developed elsewhere in the name of Joha rice."

This would generate over 21,000 direct employment.The projects are taking ground 90 days after signing memorandum of understanding (MoU) at the states maiden Global Investors Submit (GIS) held from February 16-17 this year, Das said, adding, 30-35 more projects will come up by July this year.The state government had signed 210 MoUs worth Rs 3.10 lakh crore during the GIS, which was participated by 11,000 Indian and 600 foreign delegates. Government officials claimed the MoUs were divided into two categoriesshort term and long term. Over 100 short term MoUs would be implemented within a year, officials claimed.Earlier, Jharkhand was criticised for signing MoUs only but not making them operational.We had signed MoUs with the companies for not making headlines but to end poverty, unemployment and check migration from the state, Das said, adding, the state is ready to achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modis Make in India dream through Make in Jharkhand.He said hundreds of Jharkhand youths migrate to other states for employment and they faced social and economic exploitation.The scenario is changing. Now, they will get job in their home state. We will soon bring back 600 youths, who had migrated to Gurugram for jobs, and they will be employed here, he said.Jharkhands image has improved over the two and half years and it has become more conducive for industrialisation. We worked on 18 different policies and made them industry friendly. Chief minister and bureaucrats are also available 24x7 to listen and help the companies interested to invest in Jharkhand, Das said, adding, there is no land crisis in the state and companies would be provided within a month of their requisition.The state has also given much focus on skill development and provisioned Rs 700 crore in the budget for current fiscal. The investors would not face skilled manpower crisis, Das said. He added around 1,000-1,500 jobs would be created under Start Up India initiative in a couple of weeks.Some of the leading companies who are setting up the projects in the state, are Orient Craft, Shahi Exports, Kaveri Agri Warehousing, Dev Aahar Food Industries, Shaw Pharma, Matrix Clothing, Pragati Beverages and Thriveni Apparels.Orient Craft Limited (OCL) would set up a textile park on 25 acres of land at Hotwar at an investment of Rs 200 crore, which would create 15,000 direct jobs. OCL chairman-cum-managing director Sudhir Dhingra said, I had met Jharkhand chief minister in July last year. He had said the migration rate of youth in Jharhand is high and he wanted their ghar wapsi and job creation for them. This impressed me and prompted me to start textile unit in the state.Dhingra said garment industry is a job intensive sector, which creates 50 times more jobs than the other general industry. Work on the textile park will begin in two weeks and the world class plant will be operational in six to seven months, he said.Amit Oils Private Limiteds, managing director, CP Agarwal, said they would set up units of rice bran oil with 300 tonne per day capacity, edible oil refinery with 100 tonne per day and cattle feed with 200 tonne per day capacity.

The forest staff, with their limited manpower, and police put in relentless efforts to chase the herd away throughout the night and finally managed to push it back.Earlier, the herd destroyed crops in Jakapara and Bakoridoloni, about 8km from Gohpur.Divisional forest officer (East Sonitpur) Rajen Choudhury told The Telegraph that forest personnel had to fire50 rounds in the air during the operation.He said enraged villagers even snatched away guns from the police and forest personnel and the tense situation was only brought under control by the police later.Choudhury said the man-elephant conflict has been a perennial problem in Gohpur. In Biswanath subdivision, the menace is comparatively less because the forest department had erected electric fences along fringes of the forest.In another incident, a wild elephant demolished five houses at Misamari in Sonitpur district last night.Tezpur assistant conservator of forest Jashim Ahmed said an elephant, whom the locals call Laden, strayed out of Sonai-Rupai wildlife sanctuary and destroyed the five houses. Though the occupants were asleep, everybody managed to escape. Later on, forest officials and the villagers managed to push it back to the jungle."

I learned about your death through NE SOS WhatsApp group while on my way to meet a rape victim who is also from Manipur. While I was reading this heartbreaking news, I met one of your nieces wiping her tears and on her way to see you where you were found dead in mysterious circumstances. But without proper investigation, concerned authorities concluded that your death was natural, after all you cannot speak anymore or tell about what happened to you. If I have to count the statistics you are number 11 of NE women found dead in their rented accommodation in Delhi/NCR in 2016. Many women in the past years have also met the same fate. Let this be the last and Im praying for safety and justice for all the women in the world. In life, you may not have fulfilled your dreams but in death you will be fondly remembered by your near and dear ones, they will love you still, and in their hearts you hold a place no one else will ever fill. You are in safe hands now, in Gods hand. Rest in Eternal Peace!Everyone from the North-east who is based in Delhi and other Indian metro cities must face discrimination. I wrote the above letter on Facebook last year to honour a victim of a particularly violent kind of persecution. Since I come from the North-eastern part of India myself and belong to a minority race, I too have suffered from racism, at least in its milder forms. Ive been called chinky, momo, chowmein, and more. If I am thought to be from South Korea, China or Japan, Im treated very well, but once I am identified as a North-easterner, the problems begin.Stereotyping of North-eastern Indians is common. If you are a young man from the North-east India who wears tattoos and sports a certain hairstyle, then you are tagged as an alcoholic or a drug addict. If you are a woman from the North-east wearing shorts and a half-sleeve shirt, then you are automatically considered cheap, which provokes unwanted advances. Even polite smiles from such women are often misunderstood. All sorts of different people from the North-east are also typecast as some sort of insurgent. Yet it is not possible for North-easterners to stand up to discrimination if it means risking their livelihoods; economic opportunity is normally what has brought them to a place like Delhi in the first place.In 2007, I responded to this situation by helping to start the North East Support Centre & Helpline (NESCH), an initiative run by human rights activists, social workers, students, journalists, and lawyers. Our aim is to prevent the harassment, discrimination, and molestation of people from the North-east living in Indian metros. Since this helpline was launched, I have intervened in numerous physical assaults, hate crimes, and even rapes and murders.I face lots of challenges trying to protect human rights. Members of the NESCH support us with money from their own pockets. We do not have pro bono lawyers, but most victims are from poor families and have no money to pay for legal fees. Court procedures are long and tedious; victims frequently have no faith in the system or get discouraged in the process. Thats the reason why 90% of NE victims never get justice. Dealing with the police in Delhi, meanwhile, often requires our team staying awake all night, sometimes without food, to coordinate between officials and victims.While writing this piece, I am recalling many cases I handled in the past. There was Reingamphi, a young woman from Manipur who was suspected to have been raped and brutally murdered at her rented accommodation in Chirag Delhi in 2013. She was the main breadwinner of the family, her parents being rice cultivators with meagre incomes back in her home state. Then there was Mary Ezung from Nagaland, who was found dead in Delhis Safdarjung Enclave. Her post-mortem report clearly stated that she was brutally assaulted and murdered. Julie, a young woman from Mizoram, was murdered in her rented flat nearby in Munirka. One 19-year-old girl from Assam was raped at a guest house where she was working.It has almost become a daily affair to hear of North-eastern women being subjected to such abuse in Delhi and the rest of the National Capital Region. Other women suffer similarly, but these women from the North-east, hundreds of miles away from home, often face the extra burden of fighting their cases alone. Most of the women are hard working, the backbones of their families both financially and emotionally. Losing their daughters shatters a familys dreams: it means life will never be the same again.Stereotyping of North-eastern women continues even after their deaths. Every year, approximately 10 to 15 women from North-east India are found dead in their rented rooms in Delhi-NCR. Unfortunately, for all these cases there is not even a single genuine and proper investigation. Most of these women are not well known and they are not from influential backgrounds, so what does it matter to anyone? Police reports tend to conclude with causes of death like alcohol consumption, suicide, and natural causes.BLOODY TRAIL Men and women from the Northeast are routinely attacked. 10 to 15 women are found dead in their rented rooms every year. 2014JAN29 Nido Taniam, 19, son of a Congress MLA, was beaten to death by shopkeepers in Delhis Lajpat Nagar.

If you guys from Manipur or Nagaland come here, we will kill you.Hate crimes against North-eastern people are being treated as isolated cases by law enforcement and are being ignored by most Indians, but what Im recounting here is only the tip of the iceberg.

After the GVMC stopped renewing their licences a few years ago, the owners moved the court.The court has recently ruled in favour of the GVMC. Many of these traders have been there on the Beach Road since 1991, with the last lease renewal being done in 2008, ending in 2011.

Zone-II assistant city planner K Venkateswara Rao led the team demolishing the New Sukh Sagar Shop. Zone-II Town planning officer K Gopinath took up demolition works of the Sea View Snack Bar shop.

While the official rate is `1,470 per quintal, farmers are being paid `1,000 - `1,200 by these millers.Sources said due to slow flow of paddy stock in Jeypore mandis, middlemen and millers have managed to get the Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS)- listed farmers ID numbers and registered their names at the mandis. The millers then purchase the produce from registered farmers at a low price and sell it in the mandis at Government rate. Even the names of those farmers who have not cultivated rabi crops have been registered for procurement by the unscrupulous millers.Out of 30,000 hectares (ha) of paddy crops cultivated in the district, farmers have harvested only on 5,000 ha. The threshing process is going on slowly due to unfavourable weather. Around 1,000 quintals of paddy are being brought to the mandis by farmers daily while the administration has set the procurement ceiling at 4,000 quintals per day.The district administration had started paddy procurement from May 26 for the rabi season setting a target of 3.5 lakh quintals from about 10,000 farmers.Earlier, the farmers had appealed to the administration to open the mandis in the first week of June as harvesting of paddy was delayed, but to no avail. They alleged that the names of farmers and their paddy stocks are being added in the transaction of mandis without physical verification by the officials concerned. The nexus between procurement officials and rice millers will later lead to distress sale of paddy in the district, the farmers said and demanded strict monitoring of the process by the district level civil supply officials.Meanwhile, members of Koraput Millers Association have urged the farmers not to depend on middlemen and unscrupulous millers.Contacted, district civil supply authorities said paddy procurement is going on as per the Government norms and the field officials are strictly monitoring the process at each mandi point."

Now, the killing of farmers in Mandsaur is the grim reminder to countrys bureaucracy that it cannot address the brute reality of farmers suffering through customary power point presentations. The latest government note meant for internal discussion shows: 468 million or approximately 40 per cent of Indians are dependent for their livelihood on farming that is underperforming and failing to even generate for their needs, consistently driving them to the brink and crushing the present and the future of farm families.The NDA government, which has set a target of doubling farmers income by 2022, has a daunting task at hand. Only innovative solutions and right support prices for produce can revive the agricultural economy. This is not the first time farmers have agitated demanding better support prices. For years, they have been appealing to Central and State governments on the issue.The government says farm loan waivers are not a viable option. Instead, it calls for a mechanism to protect farmers from price fluctuations. A large number of crops and States are facing discrimination in price support policy of Central government as MSP is effective only for three crops. With country moving towards direct benefit transfers, large-scale procurement of rice and wheat will also not be required. This requires new instruments to safeguard farmers against prices dipping very low.As per the government note, 67.10 per cent farmers in the country are marginal and hold less than one hectare land. Those farm families struggle for survival is even greater in states like Bihar, where the figure of marginal farmers is 91 per cent, while it is 79.45 per cent in UP and 77.19 per cent in Tamil Nadu.The successive regimes at the Centre brought the various agriculture policy many times over the last 67 years, but the fortune of farmers hasnt changed even once.The government officials even privately admit that unviable farm size and unfair price are the real cause for farmers woes, pushing them under excessive debt and producing the bitter harvest.

The new tax regime will unify Asias third largest economy into a common market, eliminating a string of central and state levies, and is expected to shore up state and federal tax revenues, cool inflation and accelerate economic growth by 1-2 percentage points in the medium term.While manufactured goods will attract 18% GST, other household items such as sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract 5% levy, senior officials said after a meeting of the powerful GST Council in Srinagar.Luxury cars will be taxed at 28% GST plus a cess of 15%, while small petrol cars will be taxed at 28% GST plus a 1% cess and small diesel cars at 28% plus 3% cess.The council fixed the rates for more than 1,200 items and will discuss on Friday the rates on some other items and services.It might meet one more time if tax rates for all items are not decided by then, finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the first days discussions.There is no increase in overall tax in any of the items, while there is a reduction of tax on many of the items, Jaitley said. On several commodities, we consciously brought down the tax rate.Capital goods, a key asset for the manufacturing sector, will be taxed at 28%.Several daily-use items such as hair oil, toothpaste, and soap have been kept in the 18%-slab instead of at 28%. Aerated drinks too have been put in the 28 per cent bracket.The present tax incidence in excess of 28% on luxury items will be treated as cess after the GST rollout and will go to the corpus for compensating states for any revenue loss.Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said 81% of the items will attract tax of 18% or below. Only 19% of items will be taxed at the highest rate of 28%, he said.The biggest take away from the decision is that food items will become cheaper, Adhia added.The cost of energy generation is likely to come down as the tax incidence on coal will come down to 5% from about 11% now.Jammu and Kashmir, which has a special Constitutional status, will pass separate laws regarding central, state and inter-state GST so that the Himalayan state can roll out the tax reform from July 1, said a senior state official.We cannot delay the implementation of GST as it could affect movement of goods into and out of the state, the official said on the condition of anonymity.Read more | GST Council finalises tax rates on 80-90% goods, services"

He was sentenced on Thursday to 15 years in prison by US district judge Darrin Gayles in Miami.The first scheme involved nearly 100 investors who purchased $30 million worth of promissory notes purported secured by interests in iron ore mining in Chile.The second scheme involved unlawfully obtaining $1.2 million in economic development funds as well as valuable industrial property from the state of South Carolina.Xavier was convicted by guilty plea in January on two counts of wire fraud. One wire fraud count related to the investment fraud scheme and the other count to the South Carolina economic development scheme.According to documents filed in court, from September 2010 through May 2014, Xavier operated Essex Holdings from an office in Miami and raised more than $30 million from nearly 100 investors for supposed investments in sugar transportation and shipping, as well as iron ore mining in Chile.He used false financial statements, forged documents and false promises of fixed rates of return, to induce people to invest in company. Most of the money was used for purposes other than what was promised, including to support lavish spending by Xavier and his wife for expensive jewellery, luxury vehicles, wedding expenses, and cosmetic surgery.Eventually, Xavier used new investor money to pay old investors in a Ponzi-like fashion before the scheme collapsed.Evidence filed in court showed that the actual investor losses from the scheme exceeded $29 million.The second scheme involved Xavier using Essex Holdings to obtain $1.2 million in payments and approximately $1.5 million worth of commercial real estate from the South Carolina Coordinating Council for Economic Development (SCCCED), a division of the South Carolina state government, that was supposed to be used to develop a dilapidated industrial property into a diaper plant and rice packaging facility.According to documents filed in the court, he provided false financial documentation to SCCCED in order to obtain the contract, and later provided fake contractor invoices and fake bank statements in order to get paid under the contract. As with the investment fraud scheme, Xavier spent a significant portion of the development money for his personal expenses, and wired some of it to the same overseas accounts used in the investment fraud."

The morning after she died, the panchayat sent three persons who packed her body in a cloth, loaded it on a bicycle and buried it in a forest three kms from the village.Though she had completely recovered from leprosy, the shackles of dogmatic belief and social taboos proved hard to break for Jagyasini. She was forced to lead a lonely and deprived life cut off from the society. Even after death, she was denied a respectful cremation.Jagyasini was cured of the disease after undergoing multi drug therapy. She was medically relieved from treatment in 1994. A widow without any children, she came back to her village.Scorned by the villagers for the disease in spite of cure, she stayed in a thatched house on the outskirts of the village and led the life on her own. She sustained with rice and Old Age Pension of Rs 300 provided by the gram panchayat. With such meagre sources, she either begged or went to bed without food on many days.After leading the life of a social outcast, she breathed her last on Sunday night. But, none of the villagers came forward to cremate her body which was left in her so-called house for the whole night.Finally, the panchayat sent three persons who wrapped the body in a cloth, put it on a bicycle and buried it in Gunjipali forest, 3 kms from the village. When contacted, Sonepur Collector Dasrathi Satpathy said they were ignorant about the unfortunate incident.But he admitted that carrying the body on a bicycle was inhuman and wrong and assured that steps would be initiated so that similar incidents do not recur.The Collector said it was primarily the responsibility of the gram panchayat to provide all kinds of support to such destitute. But the members of the panchayat concerned failed to bring it to the notice of the district administration. However, the administration has instituted a probe into the incident and action will be initiated against the officials found guilty of dereliction of duty."

(PTI Photo)Kaithi number 9234 was forced to sleep on the floor on her first night at the Parappana Agrahara central jail. AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala began her four-year jail term on Wednesday evening in connection with the disproportionate assets case. She, along with former Tamil Nadu chief minister J Jayalalithaa, was earlier lodged in the same prison on the outskirts of Bengaluru for 21 days in 2015. This time, however, it was different.WATCH VIDEO | 5 Lesser Known Facts About Sasikala NatarajanThe AIADMK workers who lined up outside the prison waiting for Sasikalas arrival from Chennai was far less than it was two years ago. Her request for a class 1 cell was turned down by a judge, forcing Sasikala to share the cell with another inmate. Her demands: designated space for meditating and round-the-clock medical assistance if required. A class 1 cell comes with privileges such as a television, home-cooked food and non-vegetarian meals twice a week. News channel NDTV reported that Sasikala chose tamarind rice with chutney from the breakfast menu Thursday morning and also meditated for a few minutes. A jail official told NDTV yesterday: There will not be any special privileges for Sasikala.

Dinakaran was also appointed as the partys deputy general secretary. He is likely to steer the party in Sasikalas absence.

Picture by Sanjay Choudhary Two relatives of the national president of the JDU youth wing were among six people arrested on Sunday in connection with the seizure of 120 cartons or around 1,036 litres of Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) in Rohtas district. The arrest of the JDU leader's kin is likely to come as a major embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar-led government, which has made war against liquor the cornerstone of its politics. Confirming the arrests and seizure, Rohtas superintendent of police (SP) Manavjit Singh Dhillon said: ""Investigations are going on in the case. We won't be able to provide much details about the case."" However, sources in the police said the people arrested from Kargahar, around 160km southwest of Patna, included Ramchandra Rai and Sadanand Singh, the father-in-law and the brother-in-law of Sanjay Kumar, the national president of Yuva (youth wing) JDU. ""We came to know about their connection only when they started dropping Sanjay's name. We found the relations to be correct. All the arrested are being interrogated and would be produced before a magistrate later on,"" a senior police officer told The Telegraph. The Telegraph could not contact Sanjay despite several attempts. However, JDU spokesperson and Legislative Council member Neeraj Kumar said: ""Sanjay is not involved in the case because he lives in New Delhi. How would he know what his in-laws are doing in Bihar? People can see that the rule of law in the state does not even exempt relatives of top leaders. If they commit wrong, the law will take its own course as in this case."" Manoj Gupta, Shashi Kumar, Chandan Kumar and Rasbihari Yadav were the others arrested in the case. They all belong to different parts of Rohtas district. The police officer said investigations were on to ascertain whether or not Sanjay colluded with those arrested in their operations. All the bottles belong to Royal Style brand and their labels show that they were manufactured and bottled in Chandigarh. Sasaram sub-divisional police officer (SDPO) Alok Ranjan said: ""The seized liquor bottles were hidden in a distributary of Sone river at Karpura village under Kargahar police station area in the district. The distributary (water distributing channel) was dry."" ""The arrests and seizures were done on the basis of our increased surveillance across the district in light of prohibition. We were probing a case related to the seizure of around 900 litres of IMFL from a container truck here by the economic offences unit on January 30 this year, when the involvement of the people arrested today (Sunday) came to light. We were conducting technical surveillance and the mobile numbers of Ramchandra and Sadanand cropped up. They procured IMFL illegally from other states and distributed in Rohtas,"" Alok added. Sunday's seizure was also made on the basis of mobile surveillance of the accused, sources in the police said. Sadanand supplies broken/residual grains of milled rice to distilleries in Punjab and Haryana. The police believe he started dealing in illegal liquor in Bihar by using his connections in those states. Rohtas has seen around six major seizures since total prohibition was implemented in Bihar on April 5, 2016. Its location along Bihar's border with Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand helps bootleggers and liquor mafia, who have opened several channels to smuggle in liquor."

He said the alleged multi-crore scam in Anna Bhagya programme of Karnataka government was probably the reason behind his alleged killing.Vijaykumar said he mentioned these facts in a letter written to the union cabinet secretary on Monday. The letter also had detailed information about the scam and similar attempts on him when he tried to blow the lid off scams involving senior IAS officers in Karnataka, he said.A former principal secretary-level officer, Vijaykumar was penalised with compulsory retirement for indiscipline just three days before his tenure was to end in April 2015.Timeline May 17: Anurag Tewari found dead under mysterious circumstances on the road near the State Guest House at Meera Bai Marg.May 18: SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar constituted a five-member SIT to probe into the case and submit its report within 72 hours after the opposition raised the issue during the assembly session.May 19: SIT collects video footage of a Hazratganj restaurant where Tiwari had his last meal.May 21: The SSP extended the time limit allotted to the SIT to file its report.May 22: The state government recommends the case to CBI after Tewaris family met CM Yogi Adityanath and lodged an FIR of murder against unknown persons with Hazratganj police station.May 23: The special investigation team (SIT) questioned Tiwaris batch mate Prabhu Narain Singh, who was staying with him at the State Guest House.While talking to HT over phone, he said he had approached Tewaris family and suggested that they demand proper preservation of the viscera, blood and other samples collected from the deceaseds body and send them to a reputed international forensic laboratory for detailed examination.Vijaykumar said he suspected that Tiwari was murdered by a drug that induces heart attack or leads to sudden increase of blood pressure. He said a similar attempt was made to eliminate him in December 2007, when he was found unconscious in his office as a result of his medicines being tampered with.He emphasised that the Indian forensic laboratories cannot unearth drug-induced murders, so the examination of samples must be done at some international lab. In the letter, the retired officer mentioned about the alleged scam in Anna Bhagya programme.Tewari, who was posted as the commissioner of food & civil supplies and consumer affairs department in Bengaluru, though reluctant initially after being confronted with some documents related to the anomalies, had informed his junior colleagues about the threat perception to him before he went for mid-career training in Mussoorie, he said.Vijaykumar said many were arguing that Tewari, having worked for less than 40 days in food & civil supplies department, could not have exposed any major scam. But for an IAS officer with integrity and courage, 30 days is more than enough to unearth major scams buried by his predecessors, he emphasised.He said he had shared this information with authentic documentary evidences with the chief secretary, DGP, some IAS and IPS officers of UP with a request to bring the content of the letter to the notice of Tewaris family members.To recall, 2007 batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer Anurag Tewari, a resident of UPs Bahraich district, was found dead under mysterious circumstances on his birthday (May 17) near the State Guest House at Meera Bai Marg in Hazratganj. Anurag and his batchmate Prabhu Narain Singh (posted as vice-chairman of Lucknow Development Authority) had come to Lucknow after attending a mid-career training programme at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie.Read more: IAS officer Anurag Tiwaris family says his honesty proved to be his nemesisBefore Anurags untimely death, they had been staying together in room number 19 of the State Guest House for three days. The Karnataka government launched its much-awaited ambitious Anna Bhagya programme in 2014 to supply 30 kg of rice at 1 per kg to nearly 10 million below poverty line (BPL) families across the state.The scheme cost 4,400 crore to the state exchequer annually.Talking about the alleged Anna Bhagya scam, Vijaykumar said huge money was being looted in rice procurement for the programme in food and civil supplies department using three methods.Firstly, the scamsters procure sub-standard rice and pay higher price to pocket huge commission. Secondly, they procure rotten rice at higher price and replace the good rice with rotten rice and sell the good rice to earn money illegally. Thirdly, the good rice is deliberately allowed to rot to procure funds to purchase fresh rice to get more commission, he explained.Vijaykumar said on August 21, 2014 he had written a letter to the Karnataka chief secretary with copies to other senior officers vested with the responsibility of preventing such scams. He said he had not been informed of any action taken on the complaint.Read more: UP govt recommends CBI probe into IAS officer Anurag Tiwaris mysterious death"

Bishnu Kumar Chhetri, the secretary of Kalimpong Krishak Kalyan Sangathan that filed the PIL against the agricultural marketing department of the state government on March 24, said local farmers were incurring financial losses in the absence of a regulated market here. Chhetri said the proposal for the regulated market had been mooted way back in 1975, but the construction of the complex was completed much later in 2005. ""However, even after the completion of the complex and its subsequent renovation in 2012, it functioned only for a brief period. In November last year, the government constituted a 10-member market committee with GTA secretary as the chairman, but the panel does not have a single local farmer or trader as member, which is against the provision of the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (regulation) Act, 1972,"" he said. Chhetri has prayed for an interim order reconstituting the market committee with proper representation of local stakeholders and early operation of the complex. ""In my PIL, I also challenged the transfer of the market complex to the GTA, which the state government did in November 2012."" ""Local crops like cardamom, ginger, orange, vegetables, broom, rice and millets worth close to Rs 1.5 crore are traded annually. If the regulated market starts functioning, the farmers will get almost double the price by avoiding middlemen,"" he added."

593aebc37be9e00e1ecd4969,Strain on 'buffalo power',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/nation/story_144240.jsp,2017-04-03,"INDIAN EXPORT SHRINKS, PAK SMELLS CHANCE Beef exporters like Priya Sud have started to chicken as meat shops were targeted in Uttar Pradesh in the past week after chief minister Yogi Adityanath promised to crack down on illegal abattoirs. ""There is unease within the industry... our local supplies have been cut off. Our importers want to know what is happening in this country,"" says Sud, a partner at Al-Noor Exports that prides itself as one of the oldest and largest exporters of frozen buffalo meat in the world. India accounts for nearly 56 per cent of the world's buffalo population and racked up exports worth Rs 26,685.44 crore in 2015-16. Exports of carabeef - the meat of the water buffalo - were 17.5 per cent higher than basmati rice exports of Rs 22,718.44 crore. In the first nine months of this year (April-December), carabeef exports topped Rs 20,000 crore, around 1.4 per cent of overall exports from the country. Uttar Pradesh is the epicentre of the country's $4-billion meat export business with 43 of the 79 central government-approved abattoir-cum-meat processing plants located in the most populous state, churning out nearly half of India-labelled meat sold abroad and a fifth of all meat produced in the country. The state has over 300 registered slaughterhouses and 41 export-oriented meat processing plants run by some of the top meat exporters in the country, including Allanasons, HMA, M.K. Overseas, AOV Exports, Al Kabeer, Mirha Exports and the Al-Noor Group. Despite their Arabic-sounding names, many of these companies are owned and operated by Hindus. A sense of fear hovers in the air and everyone involved in the meat business - farmers who rear cattle, middlemen, factory owners and transporters - is uncertain about the future of the industry itself as hotheads scout for targets and the state government comes under pressure to come good on its poll promise to close down the abattoirs. Sources say nine of the 41 export-oriented meat processing plants in Uttar Pradesh have closed down since the new government came to power in the state. The others are operating at barely 10 to 15 per cent of their capacity. The campaign against meat consumption has resonated in other areas with Gujarat tightening its law on Friday by prescribing life imprisonment for those found guilty of slaughtering cows, calves, bulls and bullocks. Although buffalo meat processing is not covered by the legislation, meat factory owners live in fear that they could become soft targets as rabid rhetoric finds violent expression in the northern parts of the country. Already, the Shiv Sena has enforced a ban on meat and fish consumption in Gurgaon, one of north India's largest industrial hubs and home to several technology and financial services giants. ""The crackdown on the meat retailers and the closure of several small units have forced exporters to adopt a wait-and-watch attitude. Nobody is taking fresh orders and many are weighing the option of shifting their units to other states like Punjab,"" said S.P. Sabharwal, secretary-general of the All India Meat and Livestock Exporters' Association. Punjab is emerging as a new centre for the meat trade after Uttar Pradesh and the Andhra-Telangana region. While India's largest meat exporter, the Cdr Satish Subberwal-run Al-Kabeer, is located in Medak in Telangana, Punjab's Derrabassi in Mohali district is fast turning into a new centre for meat processing with the earlier Akali government and the current Congress one supportive of the meat business. Most of Punjab's modern abattoirs are processing buffalo meat but the government is working on a pig meat processing plant with an eye on the market for pork, both within the country and abroad. ""India's Hindi-speaking, north Indian cattle belt is also the country's buffalo belt as well as sheep and goat belt, which is why most of the large, modern factories exporting meat are located in Uttar Pradesh, with a spillover in Haryana and Punjab. ""Direct cargo flights from Delhi to West Asia, which is an important market for us, is another reason why the meat processing industry is located here,"" said Vishal Johri, a merchant banker who advises exporters. Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, along with Andhra and Telangana, have the largest livestock population in the country. The antipathy towards meat consumption in the north has coincided with the electoral fortunes of the BJP, sparking fears of a backlash against those who resist attempts to force people to adopt a lifestyle that doesn't offend Hindu sensibilities. ""The current mahol (atmosphere) against meat-eating is strange because 71 per cent of Indians are non-vegetarians,"" says Hafiz Mohammed Sahid, a Delhi-based meat trader and exporter, quoting a 2014 census of food habits in the country carried out by the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. Data show that Telangana has the highest number of non-vegetarians at almost 99 per cent, followed closely by Bengal (98.55 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (98.25 per cent), Odisha (97.35 per cent) and Kerala (97 per cent). But the rise of Hindu extremism has coincided with the gradual decline in meat exports and the fortunes of the industry as a whole. Meat exports have fallen by 15 per cent from $4.78 billion in 2014-15 to $4.07 billion in 2015-16. Data sourced from the Registrar of Companies show that the turnover of Al-Kabeer Exports declined to Rs 469.75 crore from Rs 761.76 crore in the previous year, largely the result of a decline in exports to Vietnam and Egypt. Net profits of the company also shrank. Indian buffalo meat is preferred because of its competitive cost. It is especially sought after in West Asia and regions with a high Muslim population since many factories use the halal or kosher techniques in their slaughterhouses, which religious Muslims and Jews prefer. While India accounts for 12 per cent of all halal or kosher meat exports worldwide, its next-door neighbour Pakistan accounts for 8 per cent. In the West Asian market, the two are keen rivals. ""Pakistan has always been our rival in the Middle East, but India has wider acceptance globally as a source of hygienically processed, quality meat,"" said Johri. However, Pakistan has been working to increase its livestock to compete. Between 1996 and 2006, it has managed to increase its buffalo population from 20.3 million to 27.3 million. India, of course, remains the bigger ""buffalo power"" with some 108 million buffaloes, up from 83 million in 1992. ""The so-called 'pink revolution' of meat processing and exports has been possible because of our ever-expanding livestock population, which again is a result of our white revolution. If we reduce our exports, competitors like Pakistan and Brazil will weigh in; that's natural,"" Johri said. Older buffaloes, which stop yielding milk, and male buffaloes are the ones that are sold to slaughterhouses as farmers primarily rear cattle, buffaloes as well as goats for milk in India. ""The meat industry is the byproduct of the dairy business. If there is a threat to the meat industry, the dairy trade will also collapse and farmers will be the biggest losers. India is at the top in the dairy business because it tops in meat production,"" said Fauzan Alavi of Allana Group. Alavi, who is also the general secretary of the All India Meat & Live Exporters' Association, said licenced slaughterhouses or export-oriented units have to comply with at least 21 permissions, both from the Centre and the state, to operate and that the government should not ignore the importance of the sector. The meat factories in Uttar Pradesh provide direct jobs to around 5 lakh people. If one plant closes down in the state, 1,500 jobs are at risk. Sources say the government has clarified that it is not against legal slaughterhouses but the word has yet to percolate down to lower-level officers. So, several plants have been shut on flimsy grounds. ""If some minor lacuna is found, the government should give the industry some time to resolve the matter,"" Alavi said."

593ba7467be9e0031cfbe877,A new balance of terror: Why North Korea clings to its nukes,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/a-new-balance-of-terror-why-north-korea-clings-to-its-nukes/articleshow/58923088.cms,2017-05-31,"PYONGYANG, North Korea: Early one winter morning, Kim Jong Un stood at a remote observation post overlooking a valley of rice paddies near the Chinese border.The North Korean leader beamed with delight as he watched four extended range Scud missiles roar off their mobile launchers, comparing the sight to a team of acrobats performing in unison. Minutes later the projectiles splashed into the sea off the Japanese coast, 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from where he was standing.It was an unprecedented event. North Korea had just run its first simulated nuclear attack on an American military base.This scene from March 6, described in government propaganda, shows how the North's seemingly crazy, suicidal nuclear program is neither crazy nor suicidal. Rather, this is North Korea's very deliberate strategy to ensure the survival of its ruling regime.Back in the days of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's ""eternal president"" and Kim Jong Un's grandfather, the ruling regime decided it needed two things to survive: reliable, long-range missiles and small, but potent, nuclear warheads. For a small and relatively poor country, that was, indeed, a distant and ambitious goal. But it detonated its first nuclear device on Oct. 9, 2006.Today, North Korea is testing advanced ballistic missiles faster than ever _ a record 24 last year and three in just the past month. With each missile and each nuclear device, it becomes a better equipped, better trained and better prepared adversary. Some experts believe it might be able to build a missile advanced enough to reach the United States' mainland with a nuclear warhead in two to three years.So forget, for the moment, how erratic Kim Jong Un and his generals may seem. North Korea conducted two nuclear tests last year; one was of the strongest nuclear device it has ever detonated and the other, Pyongyang claims, of its first H-bomb. The US for its part is also escalating _ in an explicit warning to Pyongyang, it successfully shot a target ICBM launched from a Pacific island out of the sky with a California-based interceptor missile on Tuesday.Four extended range Scud missiles lift off from their mobile launchers in Tongchang-ri in North Pyongan Province, North Korea. (AP File Photo)The question is this: if war breaks out and North Korea launches a pre-emptive nuclear strike on an American military base in Japan for real would the US recoil and retreat? Would it strike back, and risk losing Washington DC in a second wave of nuclear attacks?For Pyongyang, forcing Washington to seriously weigh that calamity is a win. And it may become a real-world possibility on President Donald Trump 's watch.The 7:36 a.m. launch on March 6 was conducted in North Pyongan Province near North Korea's Sohae Satellite Launching Center. It sent the four Scuds into the ocean 300 to 350 kilometers (185 to 220 miles) from the coast of Japan.Reporting on it the next day, North Korea's Rodong Sinmun, the ruling party's newspaper, stated it was not a test to see if the missiles would work, but rather a ""drill"" to train the troops who will ""strike the bases of the US imperialist aggressor forces in Japan in a contingency.""To back that up, the North released several photos of Kim in a black overcoat holding a plastic pointer to a map laid out on a wooden table that showed the missiles' flight path and other data. Analyst Jeffrey Lewis and his colleagues at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California, quickly realized the Scuds were on a trajectory that, with a simple southerly tweak, would have sent them raining down on Marine Corps Air Station, Iwakuni.Iwakuni, located 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Hiroshima on the southern tip of Japan's main island, is home to some 10,000 US and Japanese personnel. It was used as a staging area during the 1950-53 Korean War, when it was called the ""Gateway to Korea"" by US and U.N. forces, and continues to be one of the largest and most important US military facilities in Japan.Such an attack wouldn't need to be nuclear to be effective. The deadly Sarin nerve agent or some other chemical weapon could also cause tremendous casualties. But training a nuclear attack on Iwakuni had a special psychological twist for those who follow the ceaseless military game of cat and mouse in the region. North Korea's media stressed Kim was accompanied at the launch by nuclear weapons specialists.""Before the Iwakuni simulation strike, US and South Korean forces were conducting joint military drills, which involved F-35s based out of Iwakuni,"" said analyst David Schmerler, who works with Lewis. ""As the US and South Korea were practicing their military drills in the event of a conflict on the peninsula, the North Koreans, in turn, practiced their strike plans.""The US-South Korea drills reportedly included an F-35 stealth fighter ""decapitation strike"" on Kim Jong Un and his top lieutenants.Kim, apparently, was practicing how to take them out first.Leader Kim Jong Un, center, smiles at an observation post to watch the launching of Scud missiles in Tongchang-ri in North Pyongan Province, North Korea. (AP Photo)The Cold War concept of ""mutually assured destruction"" that kept the United States and the Soviet Union from attacking each other requires a ""balance of terror"" to encourage restraint: Once each side has attained a certain level of destructive power, neither will attack because they are convinced that neither will survive.North Korea doesn't have that assurance. If a war were to break out now, it could very well be destroyed. That's the way things have been for decades.But here's where the urgency comes in for the United States and its allies. If North Korea succeeds in building nuclear-tipped ICBMs that can reach the US mainland, the dynamic in a contingency would be highly volatile.A nuclear-armed North Korea would have a strong incentive to go nuclear quickly and go nuclear first if it believed, correctly or not, that it was about to be attacked. But that also would increase Washington's first-strike incentive, since it doesn't want its strategic advantage taken away by a surprise attack on its own cities or military bases.So both sides have good reason to be trigger happy.Bruce Bennett, a leading North Korea expert and senior defense analyst with the RAND Corporation, offers these possible scenarios:Consider a case in which North Korea has a stockpile of nuclear warheads and the ability to launch them from submarines or remote, hard-to-detect sites on land. Fearing an attack from the US, it launches a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the South Korean port of Busan, then tells the United States that if there is any nuclear retaliation, it will fire nuclear weapons at US cities.Would Donald Trump, or whoever follows him, back away? Would he risk losing Los Angeles, or Chicago, to defend America's allies?Or North Korea tries another ballistic missile launch like the one on March 6. This time, just before the missiles hit the water near Japan, a nuclear weapon on one or more of the missiles detonates, downing a few commercial aircraft or sinking some cargo ships. This would convince the world that Kim Jong Un has a real nuclear arsenal and isn't shy about using it.Would Trump react with a nuclear attack on North Korea?Now, picture war breaking out on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea, to convince the United States not to intervene, launches an ICBM that appears to be coming down short, well west of California. But on the way down it bursts in a nuclear explosion, possibly causing some damage to US territory. Pyongyang then threatens more serious damage to the United States if there is any nuclear retaliation or US intervention in the conflict.Is the US president going to risk millions of people dead and major cities destroyed?""With the weight of history on his shoulders, how would a US president respond?"" Bennett asks. ""How should he respond?""It's mid-morning on April 15, the ""Day of the Sun,"" the 105th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's birth.Some 100,000 North Koreans are amassed in Kim Il Sung square waving plastic bouquets and holding up lettered cards to create designs like the ruling party's hammer, sickle and brush logo when seen from the balcony of the Grand People's Study House. That's where Kim Jong Un is standing.Kim watches as military units from each branch of his million-man armed forces goose-step by in what North Koreans like to call ""single-minded unity."" He then smiles and applauds at the most varied array of missiles and their transport vehicles the North has ever displayed.The message of the parade, held before reporters from all over the world, is clear. North Korea is, or is near to being, able to launch a pre-emptive strike against a regional target. It is preparing to withstand a retaliatory follow-up attack if it does, and it is building the arsenal it needs to then launch a second wave of strikes, this time at the US mainland.Unlike the Soviet Union, North Korea can't annihilate the United States. But if it can clear those three steps, it could conceivably destroy a major US military base in the region or a city on the US mainland.This vision of a new ""balance of terror"" built to its crescendo as six submarine-launched ""Pukguksong"" missiles and their land-based cousin, the ""Pukguksong 2,"" rumbled through the square.Submarines are the ultimate stealth weapon, mobile and notoriously hard to find. North Korea is believed to have one experimental ballistic missile submarine, and this missile would go in its silos. The Pukguksong 2, meanwhile, represents advances on the ground. It uses solid fuel, which means it can be stored and hidden, is ready for rapid launch and fits on a transport vehicle that can be deployed off-road in rough terrain. Kim Jong Un has ordered it be mass produced.The big reveal came next.No one really knew what it was until, in its first flight test a month later on May 14, it was sent an astounding 2,111 kilometers (about 1,240 miles) in altitude _ higher than satellites in low Earth orbit. It remained airborne for 30 minutes before plunging to the Pacific. With great fanfare, the North's media declared it the ""perfect weapon system"" capable of carrying a ""large-size heavy nuclear warhead.""Many analysts believe the missile which the North calls ""Hwasong 12"" _ could be a stepping stone to the ICBM North Korea needs to attack the US mainland. Kim Jong Un was on hand for its early morning launch, too. He hugged his elated rocket scientists and, according to his official media, claimed he can now hit the United States with an ""all-powerful means for retaliatory strike.""That is bravado. For now. The missile's estimated striking range is 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles), give or take.But, put another way, it's halfway to Chicago."

Some days, they dont even need to pay the paltry sum, as one or the other sponsor foots the bill to mark occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries.Known for its infrastructure and facilities, the hospital has the highest number of out-patient turnout  around 2,000 a day  in the State.

Another 49 injured in landslides were hospitalised.Most of the fatalities were due to landslides and only a very few drowned, said government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne who is also the health minister.He said nearly 500,000 people were forced from their homes and most of them had moved into temporary shelters.The military led search operations in landslide-hit areas and the airforce deployed five aircraft for rescue operations and another five to transport emergency supplies to villagers who could not be reached by road.At the village of Bulathsinhala, relatives were seen loading coffins of 10 victims onto armoured personnel carriers to transport them across flooded streets to higher ground for burial.The military vehicles also ferried villagers along roads converted into riverways by the rainfall, passing submerged traffic signs and flooded houses.Sri Lankan villagers load coffins of landslide victims onto an army armoured personnel carrier being used in rescue operations during major flooding in Bulathsinhala in Kalutara district on May 27, 2017.

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Feb. 14: The seven-month fishing ban imposed in the sea to protect the endangered olive ridley turtles has hit the traditional fishermen hard, more so because the state government is yet to adequately compensate them for their losses. While the Gahirmatha marine sanctuary, especially created to conserve the turtles in Kendrapara, remains out of bounds for fishermen round the year, they are prohibited from sea-fishing at the Rushikulya and Devi river mouths - the two other known rookeries of olive ridley turtles - from November 1 to May 31, during which the eco-sensitive turtles mate in the sea waters and then climb up on the beaches to lay eggs. ""The ban is unfair as there is no real compensation for the livelihood loss of the fishermen during this period. Traditional fishermen, whose earnings are small, suffer the most,"" said Odisha Matysyajivi Forum president Narayan Haldar. While he described the compensation of Rs 2,000 being offered to the fishermen in Kendrapara as too meagre, he alleged that the 25kg of rice that the ban-hit fishermen used to get earlier had now come down to 5kg with the introduction of the Food Security Act. ""In Kendrapara, the monetary compensation is Rs 2,000 and not Rs 5,000 as many think it to be. Till 2015, the deprived fishermen used to get 25kg of rice, but since the act came into force, they have been getting only 5kg,"" said Haldar. He admitted that the fishermen were being forced to violate the ban in the sanctuary. ""A fortnight ago, 10 of them were arrested with their boats. But, they have no other option,"" he said. State government officials, however, justify the ban citing large-scale killing of olive ridley turtles along the coast in the past. ""Many are strangulated by the fishing nets while others succumb to injuries caused by the trawlers that violate the ban frequently,"" said an official, adding that turtle casualties had come down in the past few years only because of strict enforcement of the ban. In some of the turtle-breeding areas, the authorities are struggling to enforce the ban for want of properly equipped patrolling boats. Two sophisticated patrolling boats in the Gahirmatha area are lying idle as official formalities to make them operational are yet to be completed."

File picture Jorhat, Jan. 31: Tea planters and workers have moved Dispur for a lasting solution to providing foodgrains at a subsidised rate through joint discussions. ACMS general secretary Dileshwar Tanti told The Telegraph from Dibrugarh that CCPA delegates said it was becoming ""unaffordable"" for the industry to provide ration by buying from the open market at ""very high prices"" and the industry would not be able to sustain itself if the situation continued. He said both the parties decided to approach Dispur for a solution through talks. He said they could explore possibilities like the government convincing the Centre to make special foodgrain quota available through the FCI like in earlier times, or allow the gardens to procure ration from government fair price shops. A letter, jointly signed by the ACMS and the CCPA, has been dispatched to the labour department seeking its intervention, he added. Tea Association of India (Assam branch) secretary J.N. Baruah, who was a part of the CCPA delegation, said the government should intervene as the industry's costs have increased hugely as a result of buying foodgrains from the open market. Tea gardens in Assam have been providing foodgrains to workers at a subsidised rate for the past 60 years. However, since January 2016, they have been buying rice and wheat from the open market at much higher prices after the Centre reportedly withdrew the quota allotted to the industry under which the gardens could procure ration at subsidised rates from local FCI godowns. This considerably increased the financial burden of the gardens. On January 4, the Assam Valley branch of the Consultative Committee of Plantations Associations (CCPA) held a meeting in Guwahati with its constituents and proposed cutting down the quantity of foodgrains provided to workers every month. They offered monetary compensation for the quantity of foodgrains specified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, at the rate specified by the act (Rs 3 per kg) while the rest of the foodgrains traditionally provided to the workers would be paid at the old rate of 50 paise per kg. Demanding continuation of the old system, the Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha (ACMS) organised rallies across Assam on January 19. It said providing ration at subsidised rate was part of the wages of the workers and that NFSA was a separate matter and the scheme did not cover all gardens. The decision to jointly seek state government's intervention to find a solution to the issue came after leaders of both CCPA, Assam Valley branch, and ACMS held talks in Dibrugarh on Saturday. Tea workers get around 35kg foodgrains per month for a ""standard family"" (worker, an adult dependent and two minor dependents), depending on the number of weeks in the particular month. Gardens earlier used to purchase foodgrains from the FCI at a subsidised rate of Rs 8.30 per kg along with the cost of transport and handling amounting to Rs 2.70 per kg. Workers buy foodgrains at 50 paise per kg. The CCPA is the apex body of all tea producers' associations in the country. Its Assam Valley branch is represented by five tea producers' associations of the state - the Assam Tea Planters' Associations, Assam Branch Indian Tea Association, North Eastern Tea Association, Tea Association of India and the Bharatiya Chah Parishad. The ACMS is the oldest and largest tea workers' union in the state."

But officials of the district administration went to all the schools and anganwadi centres. In many schools, it was found that firewood is still being used as there is no LPG connection. Also, self-help groups are cooking food in many of the schools. We have decided to pursue the matter so that each such group gets an LPG connection in its name. It is also safe to use LPG,"" the district magistrate said. Ulganathan also instructed the authorities to put up a menu chart so that students and their guardians know about the food to be served on that day. In Cooch Behar, there are 3,223 schools, ranging from primary to higher secondary, including Madhyamik Siksha Kendras and Sishu Siksha Kendras. There are another 4,000 anganwadi centres. ""There were complaints about the quality of food served in these places. That it why it was decided that the administration would send officials to all these institutions,"" an official said. During the visits, the district magistrate went into the kitchens of all the schools. As he reached Kaljani Sahajuddin High School, he himself took the task of cooking chicken for the students.

The matter will be heard in detail after four weeks. ""The railways have already taken control of the pantry of the Sealdah Rajdhani Express. Considering the interest a large number of travellers have in the said train, this court is not issuing any stay on the decision of the Indian Railways,"" Justice Debangsu Basak said. The judge was hearing a petition moved by RK Associates and Hoteliers challenging the legality of the notice issued by the railways asking it to show cause why their tender would not be cancelled for supplying poor quality food on the train on March 27. Advocate Pratap Chatterjee moved the petition on behalf of the company. Justice Basak, after briefly hearing the matter, adjourned the proceedings by a day. When the case came up for hearing today, advocate Chatterjee submitted that the railways had terminated the tender even while the petition challenging the show-cause notice was being heard. Counsel appearing for the railways, Ashok Chakrabarty, admitted that the tender had been cancelled and his client had taken control of the pantry of the Sealdah Rajdhani. Chatterjee submitted that the railways' decision was arbitrary and the tender had been cancelled without hearing out his client. ""My company had paid the railways Rs 10 crore for the tender, which was valid for five years. On March 27, passengers of a particular compartment had alleged that they had been given rice of poor quality. The manager served them fresh rice.

The same day the railways issued the show-cause notice. How can my client be punished twice for a single fault?"" Chatterjee submitted. The lawyer said the railway minister had on March 27 announced in Parliament that action would be taken against my client. ""To satisfy the minister, the railways had taken hasty and illegal decision and issued the show-cause notice.

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Jan. 18: Assam governor Banwarilal Purohit, who is also the chancellor of Assam Agricultural University (AAU), today said he would ask the government to work in partnership with the university so that research and technology benefit the farmers. Addressing staff and students of the university at the M.C. Das Memorial auditorium on the second day of his visit to the district, Purohit said he was impressed by the vast scale of research being done by the professors and there was need for this to reach the farmers fast. He proposed that the government should work closely with the university, in fact, work out a partnership. He also asked the students not to go for blue-collar jobs and research, though this was important, but to go back to farming to show the villagers the potential in agriculture. Earlier, Jorhat MP Kamakhya Prasad Tasa also proposed that full autonomy should be restored to the university despite the memorandum of understanding it signed in 2006. Tasa said the university should be given a free hand in producing rice seed for the state, which was being procured from outside. ""The university is equipped with this and will promote local varieties as well as those suited to a particular soil type,"" he said. AAU vic e-chancellor K.M. Bujarbaruah described the various achievements of the university, the national and international awards received, the 23 krishi vigyan kendras that were involved in extension work and adoption of more than 900 villages in different districts of Assam. Purohit said agriculture was a culture and even today 68 per cent of India's population was dependent on it. He said earlier, each agriculture-based village economy in India had been self-sufficient but regretted that these villages had now been denuded of youths who were moving out in search of greener pastures. ""We have to bring them back and make agriculture as profitable as any other industry."" He also praised the university for being proactive in# trying to make the state100 per cent organic in the next five years, saying then he would come back and present a sarai and gamosa if AAU succeeds.

""No cheap food grain would be supplied to those who don't have digital ration cards from March 1. Those who have not applied for digital ration cards are requested to submit their application forms by February 20,"" food and supplies minister Jyotipriyo Mullick said today. Officials said the Bengal government supplied cheap food grain to more than 2 crore people who do not figure on the beneficiary list of the Centre's food scheme. The state government spends Rs 5,020 crore on the programme. Of the state's 2 crore beneficiaries, 1.03 crore get 5kg of food grain each at Rs 2 a kg a month. The remaining get 2kg of ration - rice at Rs 13 a kg and wheat at Rs 8 a kg - every month. Officials at Nabanna, the state secretariat, said the move was aimed at reducing the number of bogus cards. ""It has been noticed that ration cards are not returned to the government after the holders are dead. Many people who relocate to other places also do not return the cards. Such cards are used to get cheap food grain illegally. There are fake cards too. These cards cannot be converted to digital ones as the beneficiaries need to submit their biometric data,"" an official said. The sources said the government's move would do away with around 50 lakh bogus cards. ""Right now, 1.37 crore cards have not been digitised despite repeated appeals. It is suspected that a large number of these cards are bogus. As a majority of the non-digitised cards are now being used to withdraw cheap food grain, the move to allow only digital cards will definitely reduce the huge financial burden on the state,"" a food department official said. Some officials gave an estimate of the amount the government would save. ""The move, if implemented, will save the exchequer more than Rs 500 crore.... Given the condition of the exchequer, the amount is huge,"" said a senior Nabanna official, explaining that the Bengal government's revenue collection had taken a substantial hit after demonetisation. A Trinamul leader said though fake ration cards had long been an issue, the government took the step now as there is no election in 2017. ""The decision of giving cheap food grain was taken keeping the 2016 Assembly elections in mind. But the next polls are only in 2018.

593ba9187be9e0066b6f60ac,Fortification plan for food,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170205/jsp/nation/story_134100.jsp,2017-02-05,"New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Centre has proposed making food fortification mandatory for all staples like rice, wheat flour, edible oil and milk to fight malnutrition but some experts have urged a cautious approach, warning of hidden costs and unproven health benefits. The Telegraph had reported in January 2016 that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pushed the idea of universal fortification - addition of key vitamin and minerals to foods to improve their nutritional value and address nutritional gaps in the population - in meetings with top officials of the ministries of agriculture, food and public distribution, commerce, health and women and child development. Since then, the women and child ministry and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) held a series of meetings with experts and have now come up with a draft proposal. Under the proposal, the government will try to push fortified products to counter disorders like stunting, overweight and anaemia - the major causes of maternal and child deaths. About 70 per cent of pre-school children and over 50 per cent of women suffer from anaemia, caused by iron deficiency, National Survey data show. According to the proposal, the cost of fortification, to be undertaken in a phased manner, will range from 10 paise to Rs 3 per kg or litre of food, with no additional packaging and transport costs. In the first phase, the government aims to promote double fortified salt in school midday-meals and in the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) by December 2018, followed by fortified edible oil and wheat flour by December 2019. By 2020, the Centre aims to achieve the target of universal availability of fortified food, supplying such items through the public distribution system and the open market. But some have questioned the Centre's cost estimates. ""How much is the increase in the cost (of food) because of fortification? We must include all costs like the cost of procurement, storage, mixing, infrastructure, distribution, labour, quality control, machinery and equipment,"" said Umesh Kapil, professor of public health nutrition at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. According to Kapil, such estimates often include only the cost of micronutrients but not all the other allied expenses. ""In fact, there is no cost data available which includes all the above parameters."" The fortification drive comes against the backdrop of government estimates which show that intake of micronutrients in daily diet is far from satisfactory and over 70 percent of the population consumes less than 50 per cent of the recommended dietary nutrients for healthy people. At present, 86 countries have mandated fortification of at least one industrially milled grain - wheat flour, maize, or rice. In India, fortification of salt with iodine was started in 1962. Some other steps have been, too. The FSSAI has formulated standards for flour fortification. Food products like wheat and rice are already being fortified in some states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Rice fortified with iron is available and is distributed in 1,450 schools in Odisha's Gajapati district. Many commercial entities sell varieties of fortified wheat flour in the market. But Kapil, the AIIMS professor, and some experts on the Right to Food Act have argued that such interventions should not be undertaken unless there are proven health benefits and pointed out that similar initiatives in some areas in the past have not shown the desired gains. ""We do not have adequate scientific evidence on the health benefits of wheat flour with iron, folic acid, Vitamin B12. Less than 1gm of double fortified salt will be used for ICDS (the child scheme) food. This will provide only 1mg of iron and is unlikely to help prevent or control anaemia. We do not have any evidence, for instance, so far to show the impact of double fortified salt,"" said Kapil. The professor also questioned the wisdom of mass fortification when many people did not get two square meals a day. ""The poor do not consume fats and oil. Around 28 per cent of the population, which is below the poverty line, is unable to buy enough cereals to meet their calorie needs. Fats and oils are last things be purchased by them because of the high costs."""

The 54-year-olds only tryst with charity ended in such a nightmarish way that he feels that he will never try to help anyone in the rest of his life.We begged and pleaded but they continued to thrash us mercilessly. We simply couldnt understand why the villagers were assaulting us, though we had gone there to collect alms for a charitable organization, Singh Told HT.Singh was one of the four Sikh men who were assaulted by a mob at Chainpura village in Ajmer district of Rajasthan on April 24. The matter came to light when a video of the act went viral on the social media, causing national outrage.An electronic equipment repairman and a father of four children, Singh had gone to the village to collect donations.Two of my acquaintances, Harpal and Kuldip Singh, are engaged in charitable work for an organisation called Annakshetra. We went to the village to collect rice from households for being served to the poor. As a general rule, we didnt ask for money, he said.Singh still cant grasp how the behaviour of the villagers changed drastically.During the first few days, the villagers were very helpful and we collected a substantial amount of rice. But suddenly on day 3, we noticed that the general mood was different after going to Chainpura, said Singh.The men were waylaid by the mob that started abusing them before they were thrashed.We heard one of the policemen telling the mob not to hit us on the face and asked them to hit us elsewhere in the body. By the time the cops came and took us to the police station, we were severely injured, said Singh.He says his faith in charity has faltered after the incident.I will never ever try to do charity again. We went to do good to people but what has come out of it? Scriptures tell us to help people; the reality is contrastingly different, Singh said.Singhs family members say they feared the worst when they came to know about the incident.We wont let my father go for charitable work anymore. Once he came back from Ajmer, we were shocked to see his injuries and still fail to understand why would someone try to assault an elderly person trying to help people, said Goldy Singh, his son."

Sukhwant Kaur, 55, arrived to an emotional reunion with her husband, Kulwant Singh, and daughter, Ranjeet Kaur, at the Amritsar airport on Wednesday, five months after she left for Saudi Arabia on a tourist visa only to be sold as a slave by a dubious travel agent.Hindustan Times was the first to highlight Sukhwants plight. Her husband, Kulwant, appealed to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for help on Twitter.Sukhwant arrived at Mumbai from Sharjah at 4.15am before she took a flight to Amritsar. We are happy now that she is finally back, said Kulwant. She had gone for three months. For two months, things appeared normal. After that we learnt that the agent had sold her as a slave. Her captors were demanding money for her release. The agent also went missing. We appeal to the Punjab government to act against such fraudulent travel agents, he said.Sukhwants daughter said, We had lost all hope of seeing her again in this life so you can imagine how grateful we are. I was not able to see my mother before she left for Saudi Arabia but now Im glad I could welcome her back.She was received by former Jalandhar Central BJP MLA Manoranjan Kalia, former local bodies minister Anil Joshi and Amritsar mayor Bakshi Ram Arora. Later, the family left for its native Ajtani village in Nurmahal near Jalandhar.A relieved but tired Sukhwant said: I was only given some rice and meat and rice to eat. I felt like I was living in hell.After reaching Hail city in Saudi Arabia, I was sold as a slave to a family of five members, including three women, who were teachers, said Sukhwant, adding that she was made to do all household works and was beaten up almost every day. The women members of the family also used to lock me up in a room, said Sukhwant.I was admitted to a hospital a month ago after I contracted infection. There, I met a nurse from Kerala with whose help I contacted my husband on May 7. Some 10 days back, a man from the embassy came to visit me in the hospital and assured that I will soon be sent to India, said Sukhwant.She said a debt of Rs 2 lakh forced her to go abroad for work. With no financial support from children, Kulwant and Sukhwant have to fend for themselves. Kulwant works as a daily wage labourer and earns Rs 250 a day.Capt thanks Swaraj for Sukhwants returnPunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh thanked external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj for facilitating Sukhwants safe return from Saudi Arabia. He also promised a time-bound action plan by his government to prevent unscrupulous travel agents from duping innocent people. The CM also urged the external affairs minister to use all political and diplomatic channels to put an end to illegal practice of travel agents, who fraudulently send innocent people abroad, where they are victimised."

Sujata stupa in Gayas Sujatagarh is where an old woman, Sujata, is believed to have offered kheer (a sweet dish prepared from rice and milk) to a frail Buddha, who got an energy boost after having it.READ| Sujatas great gift of madhupayasaIn absence of a motorable road, pilgrims have to now take a circuitous 25 km detour via Gaya-Manpur-Bhusundi, making it practically impossible for them to visit all the three historic Buddhist sites in Gaya and then proceed the same day to Rajgir in Nalanda, part of the Buddhist circuit.In a letter to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on April 26, pilgrims and monks have requested the government to construct a 5 km stretch of modern road, linking Buddhas meditation sites with Sujata Stupa and connecting it with Nalanda. For this, the government would also have to construct a 800-feet (approx) bridge over Niranjana river, the letter said.Connecting the Sujatagarh-Dungeshwari route with Rajgir-Nalanda highway would facilitate international tourists to cover maximum Buddhist sites in the state within a short span of time.At present, the Sujata-Dungeshwari cave route does not have an all-weather road. The one existing now is damaged and unmotorable. Tourists visiting Bodh Gaya take Gaya-Manpur-Bhusundi route to reach Dungeshwari, which is an extra distance of almost 25-28 kms. This wastes a lot of time and money, said Shashikant of International Meditation Centre, Bodh Gaya.International Buddhist monks and tourists, desirous of following Lord Buddhas footprints, trudge on this treacherous route from the Mahabodhi Mahavihara temple in Bodh Gaya to Sujatagarh and then to the Dungeshwari cave. The stretch being sparsely populated is considered unsafe for tourists, with many complaining of robbery and theft on the route, he added.Prajnadeep, general secretary of the All India Bhikshu Sangh, said a survey was undertaken in 2013 to construct the road, but nothing moved thereafter.Founder president of the Asian Buddhist Cultural Centre, Bodh Gaya, Bhante ST Anand, said that several meetings had been convened between the state and the Central governments on the issue in the last 35 years, but to no avail.Bhante Satyanand of Dr BR Ambedkar Buddha Vihar, Agra, who has trudged on this route on many occasions, said, One can perceive the difficulties of a traveller only if one were to walk on this route."

Corn and wheat edged lower after making strong gains in the previous session. The most-active soybean contract on the Chicago Board Of Trade fell 0.3 percent to $9.23-3/4 a bushel by 0209 GMT, near the session low of $9.23-1/4 a bushel - the lowest since April 2016.

""The market is also worried by supply prospects for season 2017. Farmers in many places are switching to oilseeds."" Record South American soybean production weighs on prices, with Brazilian farmers looking to accelerate sales after a drop in the local currency. U.S. farmers are actively planting soybeans and if the weather remains benign, it could further boost supplies and keep a lid on prices. Wheat has been drawing some support from recent wet weather across key growing regions, which may damage maturing crops although ample inventories from previous harvests are weighing on prices. Argentina expects a record 2017/18 wheat crop of about 20 million tonnes thanks to farmers' investment in more and better crop technology, the government's chief of agricultural estimates told Reuters on Monday, a forecast well above private estimates. Argentine wheat is planted mostly in May through July, with harvesting reaching into January. Still, Russian wheat export prices rose last week due to concerns that cold and rainy weather in May could hit the quality of the harvest and also due to a stronger rouble currency, analysts said on Monday. Farmers are becoming more concerned about the new harvest due to excessively wet and cold spring weather, Russian agricultural consultancy SovEcon said. Many farmers still expect a good crop but predict more modest quality.

Nirmal Harindran Hanif Mohammed Qureshi has been working on the footpath near the art gallery in Kala Ghoda for 12 years. Nirmal HarindranHELPING his father at his stall near Jehangir Art Gallery, Hanif Mohammed Qureshi saw a man write on a grain of rice. Qureshi, then a teenager, observed the artist for almost a year before attempting the craft himself. It took me six months to get my first letter right. I kept practising, and ultimately opened my own stall, says the 35-year old, who has been working on the footpath outside the art gallery in Kala Ghoda for the past 12 years.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe self-trained artist dropped out of school after Class VII owing to his familys poor financial condition and began helping his father. While he was enrolled in school, Qureshis interest was in the arts, which continued even after leaving formal education. After I observed the micro-art on the rice grain, I practised it at home by borrowing paint brushes and colours from my two younger siblings, he says.Qureshi says that while the task looks simple, the biggest hurdle initially is to prevent trembling hands. The grain is very small and requires focused attention. If your hands tremble, the paint will smudge the entire grain, he explains. He recalls how the first letter he tried writing was I. The first sentence he wrote was I Love You, which continues to be in demand among most customers, he says.Today, a green placard at his stall announces Name on Rice in Two Minutes, offering inscription on a rice grain in any language. A man from Iraq approaches Qureshi to write the name of his daughter in Arabic. Qureshi asks the name to be written on a notepad. From a small mound of rice grains on his table, he picks a grain, holding it between two ends of a plucker. Qureshi then picks up a fine brush, dipping it in black acrylic paint and begins replicating the design on the rice grain. Once its done, it is checked using a magnifying glass, before being put in a small scroll with oil to prevent damage.Qureshi says most of his customers are tourists, including foreigners, who take his work back to relatives, friends and lovers as souvenirs. I can write in any language since I look at it as a design I have to replicate, he says. On weekends and vacations, he earns upto Rs 1,000-2,000 a day. On weekdays, the earning is around Rs 300-500. Qureshi and other artists are also invited for events, including birthday parties, across the city. There are many youngsters who sit and observe our work, wanting to learn. While there is no time to go teach anyone formally, we tell them to begin practising, he says.When not working at his stall, Qureshi paints on rice grains. Recently, he made a painting of the crown prince of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, who visited the country last month for Republic Day. Qureshi says he has sent the painting to Dubai through an acquaintance two weeks ago, and hopes it will reach the prince. What we do here is an art in itself, but I do not think it is respected as such. I want to eventually be recognised by people for my paintings, he says.Have a comment or suggestion for On The Job?

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he leaves the podium after a news conference at the White House in Washington, U.S., February 16, 2017. REUTERS/Kevin LamarqueThe leaks are real. But the news about them is fake. The White House is a fine-tuned machine. Russia is a ruse. For its stunning moments and memorable one-liners, Donald Trumps first solo news conference as president has no rivals in recent memory. For all the trappings of the White House and traditions of the forum, his performance was one of a swaggering, blustery campaigner, armed with grievances and primed to unload on his favorite targets. In nearly an hour and a half at the podium, Trump bullied reporters, dismissed facts and then cracked a few caustic jokes  a combination that once made the candidate irresistible cable TV fodder. Now in office, he went even further, blaming the media for all but sinking his not-yet-launched attempt to make a deal with Moscow.That matters, Trump said in one of his many improvisational asides, because hed been briefed and I can tell you  nuclear holocaust would be like no other. This was his and his aides attempt to get the boss his groove back. Trump used the event to try to claw his young administration back from the brink after a defeat in court and the forced resignation of his top national security adviser. He taunted reporters and waved away their attempts to fact-check him in real time. He (incorrectly) touted his Electoral College total and repeatedly blasted his November opponent _ somehow mentioning Hillary Clinton more than anyone else in his defense of his administrations early days. He bragged that his White House is a fine-tuned machine and claimed there has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time.If only the news media would give him credit. Over and over, he accused the political press of being dishonest and suggested that any negative coverage of his administration was fake news. He unloaded a torrent of grievances while positioning himself as the stand-in for the everyman, who, he declared, hates and distrusts reporters as much as he does. The press  the public doesnt believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I dont know. But they dont believe you, Trump charged. But youve got to be at least a little bit fair, and thats why the public sees it. They see it. They see its not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred.The hastily called news conference was not on the White Houses original schedule for Thursday, and some of Trumps own aides were surprised when the president let slip at a morning meeting that he would hold the event in the East Room just hours later.The performance was vintage Trump, a throwback to the messy, zinger-filled news conferences he held during the early stages of his campaign. And, when combined with a rally slated for Saturday in Florida, it appeared to be the start of a one-two punch meant to re-energize a president whose White House in recent days has been buffeted by crisis and paralyzed by dysfunction. Yet it was a far cry from the buck stops here mantra popularized by Harry Truman and other presidents who believed that the ultimate responsibility for any White House struggles lay with the president himself. Trump was eager to assign blame elsewhere, ignoring the nations healthy economy and relative peace when he took office to say to be honest, I inherited a mess, a mess, at home and abroad, a mess.He mostly blamed the media for his woes, rebuffing suggestions that he was undermining confidence in the press or threatening the First Amendment by trying to convince the nation that the press honestly is out of control. The press has become so dishonest that if we dont talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people, he said. Tremendous disservice.Never before has a president stood in the White House and so publicly maligned the press or attacked reporters by name, according to presidential historians. Not even Richard Nixon in the days of Watergate. It was bizarre theater, said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. He turned a presidential press conference into a reality TV show in which he can be the star and browbeat anyone who objects to him with the power of his office.But for Trump, it continued a defining theme and amplified his chief strategist Stephen Bannons decree that the media are the opposition party. Trump had put claims of press prejudice at the center of his campaign in an unprecedented way and earlier this month falsely accused the media of refusing to cover terrorist attacks across the world. Though Thursdays news conference was a messy, fact-challenged affair, it may well have been cheered by Trump supporters across the country who had packed arenas last year to jeer reporters and chant tell the truth at the press pen. An Associated Press-GfK poll taken on the eve of the election revealed that 87 percent of Trumps supporters saw the media as biased against him. Trump retains support among Republicans, and solid majorities of Americans say he is following through on his promises and is viewed as a strong leader, according to a Gallup survey. But his overall job approval rating is much lower than those of past presidents at the same point in their administrations. According to a Pew Research Center survey, 39 percent of Americans approve of his job performance while 56 percent disapprove.For all of Trumps complaints, he appeared to delight in sparring with reporters in what was only his second news conference since last July. Several times he extended the event in order to field more questions. Not that he answered them all. He dodged inquiries about his campaigns links to Russia and talked down several reporters before they could finish their questions. On one subject in the news, he did defend the national security adviser he recently fired. But he also made a point of complimenting a softball inquiry about the first lady as a very nice question. He teased CNN reporter Jim Acosta for having the same last name as his new pick for labor secretary _ Alexander Acosta, whose appointment was ostensibly the reason for the news conference  and said he asked his staff to make sure the men werent related.There were startling moments aplenty.He chided a Jewish reporter wearing a kippah for asking a question about anti-Semitism. He asked an African-American reporter whether she could help set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. He displayed a rare moment of introspection when he discussed his love for kids amid his very, very hard decision whether to potentially deport young immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children.But mostly it was Trumps bravado on display, as when he incorrectly asserted that his Electoral College victory had been the largest of any president since Ronald Reagan _ and then simply dismissed a reporters attempt to correct him. Well, I dont know, I was given that information, said Trump. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that?For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Another 95 were in hospital.""Aid is now getting into the remotest areas which remained inaccessible in the past two days,"" Senaratne told reporters, adding there were help lines people could call if they needed assistance.Most victims were killed by landslides, not the flood waters, as their homes on hillsides were buried under torrents of mud and rock.Nearly 2,000 houses were damaged or destroyed. Almost half a million people had been forced from their homes and were sheltering in government buildings or with friends and relatives.The floods and landslides in the south and west of the island were the worst for 14 years.Water levels in Ratnapura, Sri Lanka's gem district east of Colombo, had subsided but many villages in Kalutara south of the capital were still under water, officials said.Residents in the south of the island also face the threat of crocodile attacks after a river known for its dangerous wildlife burst its banks overnight.The charity Save the Children said about a tenth of those displaced were aged below five.It raised fears of stagnant floodwater becoming breeding grounds for dengue-spreading mosquitos and noted that young children were more vulnerable.Medical teams were sent to the worst-hit areas to help prevent an outbreak of waterborne diseases.""We have the expertise to deal with this situation,"" Senaratne said, adding cholera and diarrhoea had been successfully prevented in past floods.The government withdrew an evacuation order for thousands of residents in the southern district of Matara as water levels subsided.The military has deployed helicopters,boats and amphibious vehicles to distribute aid pouring in from residents in areas unaffected by the floods.The government appealed for bottled water, new clothes and dry rations for those displaced.Sri Lanka has also sought international assistance, with India rushing a second naval ship laden with supplies.The navy vessel Shardul called at Colombo on Sunday with a large consignment of medicines, inflatable boats and medical teams to join the relief operations.The United Nations said it would donate water containers, water purification tablets and tarpaulin sheets while the World Health Organization will support medical teams in affected areas.Pakistan said it was in talks with Colombo to send relief supplies. Islamabad recently gave 10,000 tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka to help drought victims.The meteorological department said the rains ended a prolonged drought that had threatened agriculture as well as hydropower generation.The flooding is the worst since May 2003 when 250 people were killed and 10,000 homes destroyed after a similarly powerful monsoon, officials said.Monsoon rains last year caused flooding and landslides, killing more than 100 people."

(AP Photo/Sunday Alamba, File)Aid agencies must get food to close to 3 million people by July to avert a famine in Africas Lake Chad region caused by drought, chronic poverty and Islamist insurgents Boko Haram, the United Nations said on Friday as it launched a funding appeal. International donors at a conference in Oslo pledged $672 million for the next three years, $457 million of which was for 2017, Norways foreign minister said. It was not clear whether that was all new money or had already been earmarked previously. The United Nations says it needs $1.5 billion in humanitarian aid for the region this year.The presence of Boko Haram militants has prevented farmers from planting crops or accessing Lake Chad to water their animals. Fishermen have also been prevented from accessing the lake which is shared between Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria and Chad, aid experts say.Boko Haram militants have killed around 15,000 people and forced more than 2 million from their homes during a seven-year insurgency.Despite having been pushed out of the vast swathes of territory they controlled in 2014, their attacks and the counter operations by Nigerian authorities still disrupt vital economic activity, officials say.The most urgent need is to reach 2.8 million people with rice or sorghum, or cash to buy supplies, by July, the U.N.

(Source: AP) Former US President Barack Obama. (Source: AP)Barack Obama ranks as the 12th best leader in US presidential history, according to a new survey. The survey of 91 presidential historians conducted by C-SPAN placed the 44th president just below Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921) and just above James Monroe (1817-1825), NBC News reported on Friday. This is the third such survey by the organisation, which began polling the panel of presidential experts in 2000. The poll ranks each US president on various issues, including crisis leadership, moral authority, international relations and pursuing equal justice for all. Obama scored particularly high on the equal justice scale, coming in third behind only Abraham Lincoln (1861-1865) and Lyndon Johnson (1963-1969). But Obama ranked fifth from the bottom on relations with Congress, and got a middling 24th best score on international relations, the survey showed.Watch What Else Is Making NewsHistorian Douglas Brinkley of Rice University said that Obamas presidency, despite its weak points, may age well and notch an even higher ranking as time passes. There tends to be kind of an upward mobility, particularly if you are a president who had no major scandals, he said, noting that presidents are also often judged in comparison to their immediate predecessors and successors.If the Trump presidency is problematic, people may judge Obama even higher yet. For the third time in a row, Abraham Lincoln ranked as the nations best presidential leader, according to the panel. George Washington, the first US President (1789-1797), came in second, and Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933-1945) rounded out the podium at third. Others in the top ten are: Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909), Dwight Eisenhower (1953-1961), Harry Truman (1945-1953), Thomas Jefferson (1801-1809), John F. Kennedy (1961-1963), Ronald Reagan (1981-1989) and Lyndon Johnson.George W. Bushs dismal ranking of 36rd in the 2009 survey has improved slightly with time. He is now ranked as the nations 33rd best presidential leader. Andrew Jackson (1829-1837), whose populist movement has been compared by some historians to Donald Trumps unconventional political rise, dropped several pegs in the latest survey, falling from the 13th slot in 2000 and 2009 to 18th.The survey named James Buchanan (1857-1861), as the worst leader whose incompetence to address the onset of the Civil War is noted as one of the greatest leadership failures in American history. Buchanan joins four other presidents  Andrew Johnson (1865-1869), Franklin Pierce (1853-1857), Warren G. Harding (1921-1923) and John Tyler (1841-1845)  at the bottom of the presidential barrel, below even William Henry Harrison (March 4-April 4, 1841), who died after a month in office.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

And weaving baskets is livelihood.Except the tiny tots, almost all family members keep themselves engaged throughout the day weaving baskets. And it is a display of awe inspiring craftsmanship  precision slicing the fronds with specially made knives and rolling the colourful plastic wires. Then there is washing, cooking and baby sitting.A few passersby stop to buy the baskets and a few to place orders. The baskets come in all sizes and shapes with fronds of native date palm tree leaves and plastic wires. They fetch the fronds, the main raw material, from the wild near Uchipulli and buy plastic wires from Bengaluru market.The small baskets made of plastic wires costs Rs. 50, and the bigger ones, meant for rearing chicken, Rs. 200 and 400. They are happy if they make Rs. 500 a day. The families stopped making bamboo baskets as the wood has become expensive.They had earlier camped in Vijayawada before moving out to the neighbouring state for the first time. And they are yet to decide on their next destination. We will be here for a couple of months before moving out and this has been our life for the past three generations, says D. Tirupatiah (57), head of the family and father of seven children - five daughters and two sons.He claims that they move out only during summer vacation to ensure that the childrens education is not disrupted. However, half a dozen children in the two families seem to have dropped out. Surprisingly, the two families have obtained ration and Aadhaar cards for all members including the children.A major portion of their earnings is spent on buying rice, their staple food. They occasionally eat non-vegetarian food and prefer goat intestine, which is cheaper. Pazhaya kanji, the rice porridge made of leftover rice cooked the previous night, invariably serves as breakfast for all. They do not watch television or listen to radio. They lead a simple and monotonous life but look happy."

In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."

Patil has said.Speaking at a Jana Mana programme organised by the Department of Information and Public Relations to receive feedback from beneficiaries of various government schemes here on Friday, Mr. Patil said that while Anna Bhagya has ensured availability of meals for each one of the beneficiaries, the effective implementation of MGNREGA project has ensured regular income to the rural people. As a result, migration from rural areas in search of livelihood has significantly come down this year, he said.In the last fiscal, the State created 10.40 crore man-days exceeding the target of creating six crore man-days set by the Union government. This year, the State government has set a target of creating 12 crore man-days. Besides, guaranteeing jobs for the rural poor, the project has helped creation of assets in villages. Development of playgrounds, agriculture facilities, burial grounds and other such works have improved infrastructure in the rural areas, he said.The governments social security pension has helped large sections of the deprived sections. For first time, the government cleared all new applications seeking pension. Similarly, Ksheera Bhagya [milk for children] too has helped maintain nutrition level among children, he added.Taking a dig at politicians levelling allegations against the Congress government, Mr. Patil said that those who were accusing the government of neglecting the interests of the farmers were not farmers in the real sense. Several farmers taking part in the district level Jana Mana programme praising the State governments schemes such as Krishi Bhagya and Ksheeradhara bore witness to the governments initiatives for strengthening the farm sector yielding results. It is better they go to the villages and do a reality check with real farmers working in the fields, Mr. Patil said.Water supplyReferring to drinking water supply in Gadag town, Mr. Patil said that Chief Minister Siddaramaiah would inaugurate the second phase of a project to supply drinking water from the Tungabhadra to Gadag and the 24 x 7 water supply scheme on June 4."

At 74.77 lakh tonnes, the States production for 2016-17 was barely half of what it had planned (147.8 lakh tonnes).This is in stark contrast to the States all-time record performance of 130.63 lakh tonnes in the previous year (2015-16). Only recently, the Centre had honoured the State with the Krishi Karman award (for its performance in the year 2015-16).Tamil Nadu could draw consolation from the fact that its performance in foodgrains production in 2016-17 was better than what it was four years ago (2012-13), when the State was in the midst of a drought.In 2012-13, the foodgrains production was around 56 lakh tonnes. Even though there was not much variation in rice production (40.92 lakh tonnes) this time compared to the other year, the difference could be attributed to the States impressive performance in the production of millets, which was around 27.8 lakh tonnes.Last year, two factors were primarily behind the States woes: the poor realisation of Cauvery water and the failure of the northeast monsoon (October-December). Against the quantum of 182 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) of Cauvery river water to be released by Karnataka during June-December, Tamil Nadu had received 67.2 tmc ft, leaving a shortfall of 114.8 tmc ft.The rainfall during the northeast monsoon was 16.83 cm, which was 62% short of the average rainfall of 44 cm.State steps inDespite the two factors, the production was facilitated by at least two measures of the State government, which had implemented packages for the short-term Kuruvai crop and long-term Samba crop at a total outlay of around Rs. 120 crore.For the current year, the State Agriculture department has scaled down its target of foodgrains production to around 100 lakh tonnes.Notwithstanding the steep fall in the foodgrains production, the State Civil Supplies authorities say there will be no adverse impact on the availability of rice through the public distribution system (PDS). Their optimism is based on the arrangement of the State getting rice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI), which has stood the test of time and which has been reinforced by the States decision to implement the National Food Security Act.
