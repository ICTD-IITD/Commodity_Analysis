Some senior IAS officers are not happy here. And there seems to be no seriousness in the manner in which the Kamalanathan Committee is distributing the employees (between A.P. and TS).This was the feeling a top official in the A.P. Secretariat at Velagapudi expressed before a Telangana government employee and his friend from Hyderabad.This Telangana employee, during his recent visit to the Interim Government Complex of A.P., was wondering why not many top officials were around.One reason was the Chief Ministers trip to the US. What could be the other reasons is anybodys guess.Dispute overassets sharingThe ongoing dispute between Telangana and AP over sharing of public properties took an ugly turn last week with the locks of the Resident Commissioners bungalow in A.P.-Telangana Bhavan in New Delhi broken and the Telangana government lodging a police complaint.After the A.P. Bhavan in New Delhi was split between the two governments post-bifurcation, a peculiar situation has arisen on the campus as it was to be shared in the ratio of 58:42 between A.P. and Telangana as per the Reorganisation Act.But the Telangana government was aggrieved that only 37% of the property was transferred to it and the remaining was still with Andhra Pradesh.In this backdrop, the bungalow of the Resident Commissioner was with the Telangana government till Shashank Goel held the office. When his successor Arvind Kumar took over in January, the AP government took away its keys, something which is still a mystery, and allegedly let unauthorised persons use it.The Telangana officials locked the house citing security threat to nearby Sabari block where VVIPs were lodged. But the locks were broken reportedly by the A.P. officers.Improving hygienein govt. hospitalsThe supply of new linen and bedsheets to the government hospitals taken up by the Telangana government recently is being seen as another measure to improve hygiene in the public healthcare sector in the State.Several hospitals in Hyderabad were also provided with new medical equipment in the recent months to deliver better services to people. However, it is to be seen whether the new bedsheets for wards, supplied in two colours  pink and white, can improve the hospitals image at least to some extent. A total of about 52,000 bedsheets required for 10,737 beds were supplied to 37 general, speciality, district and area hospitals in the State on May 7.Common menu in all welfare hostelsThe State governments decision to introduce a common menu across all welfare hostels marks another step in providing nutrition to students from economically-backward families. Until a few years ago, the food provided in welfare hostels, including tribal, SC, BC and minority institutions, used to be apportioned in strict quantities as prescribed by the government in grams and often deemed inadequate. The TRS government lifted the restriction on the quantity and even introduced super-fine rice in the hostels. Civil Supplies Minister Eatala Rajender defended the decision then saying it was the endeavour of the government to provide food to students to their satisfaction. Will Education Minister Kadiam Sriharis instructions on common menu do any better remains to be seen.A strict warningA recent warning by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao that he would not tolerate potholes on roads after June 1 has stirred the official machinery out of its slumber. As soon as the warning was issued by Mr. Rao that he would suspend officials if he noticed potholes, they immediately got down to business and prepared estimates for repairs to roads. It was estimated that the work might cost Rs. 28.38 crore. V. Raghavendra, M. Rajeev,B. Chandrashekhar, Rohit P.S.,& N. Rahul"

Packets of the deep red rice would soon be available there.CampaignThe Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the Union Commerce Ministry will initiate a large-scale campaign for Navara in the European Union in the coming days. The campaign is under the Make In India Project and involves promotion of two other food crop varieties which bagged Geographical Indication (GI) tag, said P. Narayanan Unni, chairman of Chittur-based Navara Foundation and the owner of the largest Navara farm.Promotional docuAs part of the campaign, a five-member television crew from Spain spent a month in Chittur to make a 26-minute promotional documentary on Navara for European viewers.The documentary would be formally released at a food festival organised by the Commerce Ministry in Thailand on May 31.It is a big recognition at a time when Navara cultivation is facing severe challenges. There is no possibility of mechanical cultivation and it must be grown only by farm hands. Non-availability of pure seeds, low yield and high production cost are also contributing to the crisis, said Mr. Unni.Enter the hybridsThough Palakkad farmers had been cultivating Navara for more than 2,000 years, it became unpopular in the last 40-50 years due to introduction of several new hybrid varieties. It was after years of strenuous effort that Mr. Unni and his 19 friends collected and segregated enough seeds to initiate cultivation.Now his 12-acre farm is known for its best practices in agri-food innovation. He has been running the farm successfully for the last 20 years. For pest control, he grew tulsi and marigold on the field bunds. Since it is a medicinal rice variety for consumption we decided to adopt only organic methods. We do not want chemical residues on harvested grains, said Mr. Unni.GI statusBecause of his intervention, Navara has also received GI status. Navara is used traditionally to treat rheumatic patients. It is in high demand during the Malayalam month of Karkidakam for Ayurvedic rejuvenation treatments."

Besides, the department was also able to recover maximum quantity of CMR from millers with the help of frequent checks.Against the due of 4,525.701 tonnes of CMR from millers for the 2015-16 kharif season, the due in 2016-17 kharif was only 1,192 tonnes as the recovery rate went up to 99.91%.Commissioner of Civil Supplies C.V. Anand reviewed the performance of the enforcement wing on Sunday. He stated that the task force teams were formed with retired police, revenue, civil supplies and commercial taxes officers to check malpractices and corruption in the distribution of essential commodities was yielding good results.The teams were conducting frequent raids on the mandal-level stock (MLS) points and fair price shops to check irregularities/misuse in PDS and at State borders to prevent illegal transportation of PDS rice to other States, Mr. Anand said. Besides, raids were also being conducted on rice mills, government hostels and schools getting fine quality rice ( sanna biyyam ) from rice millers under the Mid-Day-Meal Scheme, LPG godowns and illegal transportation of rice to other States through rail and road transport, he noted."

The government-supported One paddy, one rice scheme, intended to raise organic paddy varieties and aquaculture alternately in the same crop year, is fudged by vested interests, virtually threatening organic farmers survival.The State had about 25,000 hectares of fields under Pokkali cultivation a quarter century ago. It has declined to less than 5,000 hectares now, says Francis Kalathungal, general convener, Pokkali Samrakashana Samithi. He attributed the situation to the neglect meted out by authorities, coupled with the manipulative actions of a lobby in fisheries. The higher monetary benefits from shrimp farming have enticed farmers to embrace it, discarding paddy.The government envisaged a scheme of organic paddy farming, hand in hand with aquaculture, with a view to protecting wetlands and paving the way for cleaner environment.Pokkali farms do not need fertilizers or pesticides. The government provides pumping subsidy to padasekharams to prepare the fields.Subsidy misusedBut the subsidy is being misused by those farmers who take up farming for namesake. Such farmers are hand in glove with the fisheries lobby and indulge in activities to discourage Pokkali farming so that aquaculture can be taken up for the entire crop year. There is no level-playing field for the paddy farmers, Mr. Francis said.The outer bund of the Pokkali fields at Maruvakkad, bordering Alappuzha, was recently breached. It was a deliberate activity by the fisheries lobby, according to farmers.Alappuzha district has over 900 hectares of Pokkali fields. Farming was taken up last year in about 100 hectares only. The plan is to extend it to 630 hectares this year, says Principal Agricultural Officer A.G. Abdul Karim.The fisheries lobbies were apparently active to denigrate the cause of Pokkali, he said. A committee headed by the District Collector has been set up to facilitate Pokkali farming.One of the issues faced by the farmers is scarcity of seeds. The traditional farmers used to retain the seed for the subsequent crop, but the practice has been discontinued by many under the prevailing distressing situation. The farmers are forced to depend on the Seed Corporation of India for their requirement. But the seeds have reportedly been found to contain a mix of weeds beyond permitted levels, resulting in poor yield.It needs a coordinated activity by various agencies and departments such as Revenue, Police, Fisheries and local bodies to protect the interests of the Pokkali farmers at large to make it a successful practice, according to the farmers."

Lakshmi NarayananE_Lakshmi Narayanan;E_Lakshmi NarayananGone are the days when banana leaves formed part of daily culinary menu in the households. The hotels, both big and small, used only banana leaves to serve food, be it the breakfast or the lunch, as it is not only environmental-friendly but also marked Tamil culture and civilisation.Offering food using broad-sized banana leaves (thalaivazhai ilai) during marriage and other important religious festivals and other family functions is considered to bring about more prosperity.Of late, steep rise in the price of banana leaves has forced the hoteliers and the housewives to give a go-bye to this traditional practice. Many of the hotels in Salem district are now opting for the plates made of arecanut leaves for serving the food.The steep rise in the price is attributed to the scarcity of the banana leaves due to the fall in the production following the severe drought conditions prevailing in the entire western belt.While a price of a banana leaf used for serving full meals is Rs. 8, the price of a small tiffen leaf is between Rs. two and Rs. three. The price further goes up during the festivals and other occasions.Salem, Namakkal, Karur and Tiruchi are the major banana leaf production centres. Due to acute water scarcity, the farmers are struggling to protect the standing banana trees and hence they are not concentrating in planting new saplings. The fall in the production of banana leaves has hit the markets of western districts and also in the neighbouring states.According to banana leaf traders, the uzhavar santhais and the other markets in the district were receiving only 50 per cent of their regular quota of leaves for the past couple of months.The organisers of the festivals and functions have reduced the use of banana leaves to a big extent and have opted for artificial plastic leaves and plates made of arecanut leaves.According to a few hoteliers, many big hotels have started procuring the banana leaves from districts such as Tirunelveli at a much cheaper rate. Other major hotels have reduced the usage of banana leaves, while many small hotels have almost abandoned the banana leaves for the time being.The road side eateries have been using polythene papers for serving the food and also for packing purposes.According to a cross section of the road side eateries, the price of all essential commodities, commercial LPG cylinders etc have increased posing a big burden to them. The hike in the price of banana leaf has only further worsened the situation.The small time hoteliers say that they sell the eatables at a very low rate  a set of idly Rs. 10, poori Rs. 20, dosai Rs. 20; variety rice Rs. 25, and full-fledged meals between Rs. 40 and Rs. 50. Spending Rs. 3  Rs. 8 for a banana leaf is not at all feasible for them.In case of any compulsion on serving the food on banana leaf, they will have no alternative but to increase the price of the eatables. The using of polythene papers has very much reduced the burden on small time hotel owners, they added."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

Kumaraswamy said that if the state government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, had fulfilled all the promises that figured in the Congress party manifesto in 2013, no farmer would have resorted to committing suicide. Kumaraswamys tirade was in context with Siddaramaiahs claims that out of 165 promises, the government had fulfilled 155.All the programmes of Siddaramaiah are bogus. Even Anna Bhagya scheme is old. It was introduced during the tenure of Ramakrishna Hegde as chief minister. Back then, rice was given at Rs 2 per kg and now it is being given for free. The scheme is not the state governments brainchild as the Union government has a big share in it, he said.When the reporters asked about a civic worker in Chamundi Hill Grama Panchayat being forced to get into a manhole to clean it , Kumaraswamy said, the issue was discussed in the Assembly session. There are lapses on the part of the government. If the government had provided the required equipment, why would the civic worker be forced to perform such work, he sought to know.Farm loans not waivedKumaraswamy said that Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra state governments have merely announced farm loan waivers but they have not actually waived them. The Union government has not provided funds to the governments to waive the loans. Instead of waiting for the Unions move to waive off farm loans, Siddaramaiah should announce the states decision. The Union and state governments are neglecting the farmers and the people, he said.Compensation of Re 1Kumaraswamy sought clarification from the government for issuing a cheque for Re 1 to the farmers as drought compensation under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).To tarnish JD(S) imageWith regard to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe against Kumaraswamy for his alleged involvement in permitting illegal mining of iron ore by taking a kickback of Rs 150 crore, he said, The Supreme Court had quashed the case 11 years ago but the state government, led by the Congress and BJP leaders, are trying to tarnish my image.He asked former minister and BJP leader Janardhana Reddy, who had said that he would provide the documents, to contact Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to prepare fake documents. Siddaramaiah would help Reddy through the police for preparing the documents, Kumaraswamy said.In reply to a query about JD(S) partys stand on Presidential elections, he said, the party will take a stand on the basis of the decision taken by the Opposition parties."

This was to encourage them to make fortified food.Around 4.5 lakh children of the 59.5 lakh beneficiaries of the mid-day meal scheme in the state consume fortified rice in seven districts. This rice is packed with multiple micro-nutrients like iron, folic acid and vitamins.The state government was honoured at a recent national summit of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) where early adopters of food fortification were recognised.According to the Food Fortification Resource Centre, an online portal run by FSSAI, the cost of food fortification is miniscule. It costs as much as Rs 30 to Rs 100 per metric tonne which works out to just about 3 to 10 paisa per kg of food, depending on the type and number of micronutrients added and the staple food that is being fortified.Fortified milk with vitamin A and D costs 2 or 3 paisa more per litre. Similarly, rice with folic acid costs 50-80 paisa more per kg and edible oil costs 8 to 10 paise more per litre. Except the initial investment on blenders and feeders, it is not expensive, Srinivas Gowda, in-charge joint commissioner of the state FSSAI, said.He said, A few PDS outlets used to distribute fortified rice they had procured from Tamil Nadu. This was stopped as it led to misconceptions that it changes the colour of rice. In fact, it helps reduce malnutrition and anaemia. The Food Processing Ministry is giving loans at subsidised rates to help those who want to adopt this technology.Yadav said, Unless food fortification is mandated, it cannot be enforced. Food manufacturers raised some concerns. They said if the raw material comes from other countries, it cannot be fortified at the primary processing level. For example, palmolien oil comes from Malaysia and Southeast Asian countries."

It was also reported that plastic rice was sold under the government sponsored Anna Bhagya scheme.The poor are scared to purchase rice. There could be serious health hazards if plastic edible items are being sold and consumed.

Is there any truth in such reports or are they just rumours? he asked.Replying to them, Ramesh Kumar said, I wonder why would anyone come out with plastic egg or rice as manufacturing them would be a costly affair. Is it possible to adulterate the items as reported in the media? We have to find out scientifically about it. I wanted to pay surprise visits to certain shops but could not. We will hold an enquiry and then make a statement by Monday.However, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader argued that there is no adulteration as reported.It is the Food Corporation of India which is supplying rice under the Anna Bhagya scheme.

Vinod Kumar T and Bincy Joseph take a walk In the Footsteps of Rajas & Sultans, organised by Bangalore Running and Walking Tours, to trace the memories they have left. Praveen Singh, founder of the Tours, is the guide.Ranganatha Swamy TempleRanganathaswamy Temple is an ancient and famous Hindu Vaikhanasa temple which is dedicated to lord Vishnu. It was built in 1638, when Kempegowda was attached by the Maratha rulers and had to flee. This temple in Chickpete follows the Vijayanagara style of architecture and has beautifully carved granite pillars with Yali figures, which are part lion, part elephant or part horse. Idol of Vishnu is seen in a sleeping posture here. An inscription in the temple is written in ancient Kannada.The Rice Memorial ChurchThe Canarese Chapel which was in a Greek Roman structure was built by William Campbell in 1834. Later on this Chapel was taken over by the Londonmissionary Rev Benjamin Holt Rice who also was a Canarese scholar and a pioneer of education in the Bangalore Pete region. Then this Chapel was considered unfavourable, so it was destroyed and, in 1917, it was replaced back by another Classical European style structure with Tuscan columns, pediments and keystone-arch windows. The present building, on Avenue Road, is the third version of the Chapel, today it is called the Rice Memorial Church.The Hanuman TempleWe start with the Pete gate, one of the nine in the fort, through which the British entered Bengaluru in 1791. Right outside, now the entrance of Avenue Road, stands the Yelahanka Gate Anjaneya Swamy Temple. It was customary for the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire and their vassals to build a temple for Sri Anjaneya at the entrance of the fort as a protector of the territory. The Hanuman idol here is modelled after warriors.Tipu FortBangalore Fort was built in 1537. Haider Ali replaced the mud fort with a stone fort in 1761. This particular section, which houses an armoury and administrative blocks. The army of the British East India Company, led by Lord Cornwallis on 21 March 1791, captured the fort in the Siege of Bangalore during the Third Mysore War. Now this forts Delhi gate is located at Krishnarajendra Road, and two bastions are the primary remains of the fort.Doddapete SquareIn 1537 A.D Kempe Gowda conducted a ground-breaking ritual and festivities by ploughing the land with four pairs of decorated white bulls in four directions. The centre  presently known as the Doddapet and Chikkapet junction  is from where whole of Bengaluru started. Here Avenue Road and Old Taluk Kacheri Road cross each other.Dargah- E- Hazrat Manik ShahThe wandering Sufi saints, Hazrat Tawakkal Mastan Shah and Hazrat Manik Mastan Shah, migrated to Bengaluru some 300 years ago. It is believed that they came from Andhra Pradesh, during the reign of Hyder Ali.Legend goes that they worked as masons when Hyder Ali was rebuilding the old fort constructed by Kempegowda I and they never took any remuneration for their hard work. Having learnt all about the mystical life of the mastaans who used to do voluntary masonry work at his fort site, Hyder Ali penitently built a mosque as wished for by Hazrath Tawakkal Mastan Baba. This heritage mosque, which has been around since the 1780s, is now situated on the most congested shopping lanes of City Market Krishna Rajendra Market.Sri Krishna Rajendra MarketThis came up in the buffer zone between two forts  the larger fort that held the city and the smaller military citadel. This became a market place in 1790s after the capture of the city by the British in 1791. After the Third Battle of Mysuru some of the Britishers had camped over and then captured the city.They converted that place into a public place, which slowly turned into a market.Tipus ArmouryThe armoury, at the Kalasipalyam New Extn, City Market, was built by Tipu during his reign in Bangalore. There are couple of armouries like this, one at Srirangapatna which was shifted recently in March.Tipus Summer palaceThis structure was built entirely in Malabar teak wood and stands adorned with pillars, arches and balconies. Tipu Sultan used to conduct his durbar (court) from the eastern and western balconies of the upper floor. There are beautiful floral motifs embellishing the walls of the palace. The site also holds a painting of grand throne visualised by Tipu Sultan himself. This is situated at AV Road, Chamrajpet. The rooms in the ground floor have been converted into a small museum showcasing various achievements of Tipu Sultan and his administration.There is a replica of Tipus Tiger, the original is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London."

Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."

They have also alleged that the police are trying to shield two suspects who they say provided a pistol and 20 cartridges to their brother.They also alleged the police are resorting to ways such as approaching an astrologer to find their brothers location through his horoscope.The victim, Ishwar Tyagi, was found shot in the head and his family named his son, Anuj Tyagi alias Dabbu, for the murder. Dabbu, the fourth of five brothers, went absconding with Rs5 lakh in cash and his Fortuner after the incident. He suffers from schizophrenia and is yet to be arrested.My brother Dabbu was provided the weapon and cartridges by his two friends, Rahul and Johnny, who are brothers. Around 20 cartridges were provided to him a day before the murder. The police have failed to arrest or rigorously question the two men, who are politically connected. They have bowed down to pressure and failed to track my brother who is on the run, said Praveen Tyagi, Dabbus elder brother, who runs IIT Pace Academy in Mumbai.Read more: Ishwar Tyagi murder: We were suspicious of him the night before, says brother of suspectHe added that Dabbu was sleeping in his fathers room the night before the incident. Later, he allegedly shot his father dead before escaping in his Toyota Fortuner.He is a schizophrenia patient, but not a criminal. Still, the police have failed to track him. He is not using his mobile phone or anything that could lead to his arrest. There were rumors that he surrendered at Chanakyapuri police station in Delhi a couple of days ago. On Friday, there were reports that he was arrested by the Ghaziabad crime branch. However, the police have failed to arrest him so far. We suspect that he is being shielded by some people and the entire incident was planned, Praveen added.He said that the family had been supporting Dabbu financially for the past several years.Apart from the Fortuner our father gave him, I also gifted him a Mercedes. My father was also going to open a Rs50-crore rice mill in his name in our village. On the morning of the incident, Dabbu escaped from our house around 4.30am. Around 5.30am, when my mother returned from the temple, she found my fathers body on the blood-soaked bed, he added.He also said that a Ghaziabad police officer had asked him for Dabbus date of birth.When I asked why, he said he wanted to visit a pandit who would tell him Dabbus location by looking at his horoscope. This is absurd, he said.I spoke to Rahul and Johnny who said that they arranged for a pistol to be given to Dabbu. The police have failed to rigorously question them as a number of calls from politicians landed in their support, Parveen alleged. He refused to reveal when and where he spoke to the two.However, senior superintendent of police, HN Singh, defended the investigation process and said they have two suspects on their radar.They are being questioned in connection with the incident. Our teams, including the crime branch, are trying hard to trace Dabbu. We are hopeful that he will be nabbed in a day or two. If we find him, he will be questioned. Any persons involved in the conspiracy or who helped him carry out the crime will also be arrested as per law,Singh said."

Nearly 500 people turned up by 8 pm. We expect many more to join us soon, said Bernard N Marak, who was the BJPs West Garo Hills district president until he resigned last week.Soon after, North Garo Hills district president Bachu C Marak also quit the party. This spurred the resignation of nearly 5,000 youth wing workers from the region.The government has banned the sale of cows and buffaloes for slaughter through animal markets, touching a raw nerve in states in the northeast and Kerala where beef is a delicacy. The new rules do not amount to a blanket ban on cattle trade or their slaughter, and license breeding remains legal.Protesters huddle around a jar of bitchi during the beef festival. (HT photo)In Meghalaya, participants had steamed rice with traditional beef delicacies to the accompaniment of music and dance on Saturday. The food was served with bitchi, a local drink.Irked by the notification and the party leaderships refusal to allow a beef party to mark three years of the Narendra Modi government, many more BJP workers in the Garo Hills region are expected to quit in the coming days.Our bitchi-beef fest is intended to warn our leaders against disrespecting our local laws and traditions. Having beef is our right, and it should be respected by others, said Bernard.Beef consumption is common in Christian-dominated Meghalaya unlike other parts of the country, and the Centres notification hasnt gone down well with its residents. I quit the BJP because the party was trying to impose its Hindutva ideology on us. We feel out of place in the party. Eating beef is part of our tradition, and this festival is our way of showing that, the former party leader said.These developments are seen by some as bad news for the BJP ahead of next years assembly polls. The Garo Hills region has 24 of the states total assembly seats, which are crucial for the party to displace the ruling Congress government.However, party leaders in the state as well as the Centre appear unperturbed. They have dubbed the deserters as opportunists who quit because their chances of landing party tickets for the assembly polls were slim. We welcome the resignations. Theres nothing to worry about because this talk of a blanket ban on cow slaughter is fabricated, said state party president Shibun Lyngdoh.A member of the organising team poses with jars of bitchi before the start of the beef festival. (HT Photo)The Centres notification has led to discontent in Nagaland and Mizoram too. Assembly polls are due in both the states next year, and like Meghalaya, they also have dominant Christian populations who thrive on beef consumption.According to data released by the National Sample Survey Organisation in 2015, seven of the eight states in the region  except Tripura  figure among Indias top 10 in consumption of beef and buffalo meat. Meghalaya topped the list, with nearly 81% of its population consuming the meat. The figure was 57% for Nagaland and 23% for Mizoram."

However, officials from the MTC and the Food Safety Department said subsequent tests had proved that the rice was safe for consumption.According to MTC sources, around 12.30 pm, technical staff at the depot went to the canteen run on contract basis to have lunch. But, they found the rice not properly boiled.A few staff rolled the rice into small balls and hit them at walls. They ricocheted, leading some to believe it to be plastic rice, the source said.Following this, the staff refused to eat and drew media attention to the poor quality of rice.When contacted, an MTC official (headquarters) said, Upon receiving reports, a team of MTC officials and those from the Food Safety Department visited the depot. Tests were done and the staff were reassured that the rice was safe.However, Metropolitan Transport Corporation unions were not willing to relent. The rice from at least four other depots was of very bad quality. The staff had been repeatedly complaining. Higher officials must take serious notice of this issue, said an office-bearer belonging to the DMK-affiliated Labour Progressive Front.Over the past few days, Telangana, Karnataka, and Uttarakhand had reported about the presence of plastic rice in the marketTHE COINAGEThe term plastic rice was coined by the online media around 2010, when China reported its use for adulteration of a premium rice called Wuchang, which is known for its aromaGROUND REPORTIn TN, food safety officials have been inspecting rice mills and outlets.

I suspect that it is plastic rice, I want the cash back, she told Gopal. Though he tried his best to convince her, the woman bluntly refused.Queried as to what led to her suspicion, she said, I read it in a WhatsApp update that some popular brands are selling plastic rice and I dont want to take any risk. The shopkeeper told that it was the fifth customer to return the rice. So far, I have returned money to four of my regular customers who recently purchased rice from my shop. The plastic rice issue has become a big headache for us, Gopal told Express.In the wake of allegations in various social media platforms over retailers selling plastic rice, consumers in Visakhapatnam district are returning the stocks, being apprehensive about the quality of rice. The shopkeepers claimed that their business had come down by 80 per cent in the last three days.I have been trading in rice since 2014. But, I never had such bitter experience. The adverse canvassing of plastic rice through social media has taken a toll on our business. Bi-weekly, we import 1 lorry stock (100 tonnes) of fine quality rice from Peddapuram and Ramachandrapuram of East Godavari district. Since last Monday, there has been a drastic fall in the retail market business, says K Annaji Rao, a rice wholesaler from Vepagunta.However, the shopkeepers claim that mixing plastic rice is not a viable affair. As per my knowledge, it is not at all profitable to mix plastic rice with the stock. I strongly believe that it is just a social media hype to scare people for no reason, says Gopal, adding that in the wake of allegations, the traders were unnecessary going through checks by food safety officials.Reiterating the same, district rice dealers association leader Nukaraju said, The rice business in Vizag has come down by 80 pc and the traders have lost sales worth Rs 3 crore in the last three days.There is no adequate rice production in Visakhapatnam district to cater to the needs of a population of nearly 43 lakh (2011 Census) of which 22 lakh lives in GVMC limits.The rice traders procure stocks from neighboring rice producing areas. Around 300 traders in the city procure around 500 tonnes of rice stock daily and transact a business of nearly Rs 1.5 crore.However, GVMC food safety inspector (FI) S Janardhana Rao says that no traces or plastic rice have been found so far from the samples gathered by the wing. In the last two days, we have collected samples from various dealers and sent them to State Food Laboratory in Hyderabad for analysis. No plastic rice has been found, he said.Meanwhile, SV Veerabhadra Rao, Gazetted Food Inspector (Visakhapatnam) said they have seized 73 bags of rice from a wholesaler, after a customer in Pendurthi lodged a complaint. Further, five bags of rice has been seized from Makavaripalem too. We have not found any adulteration so far. In our observation, the social media posts been have creating panic, he said.How to test plastic riceTake handful of grains and add some drops of tincture Iodine to it. If it imparts a dark blue colour, be sure that they are original riceBurn the rice grain. In case of plastic rice, it will give a typical smell which is not the original smell of starchPut rice grains in water. If it is plastic rice, it will float on water"

Weve collected around 35 so far, said Parameswaran, who started off collecting traditional varieties of all garden vegetables before deciding to focus on conserving egg plant varieties since 2015.According to Ananthoo of Safe Food Alliance, the programme was aimed at establishing diversity in seeds and bringing urban youth closer to their roots. Nowadays, the urban youth are increasingly showing interest in reviving traditional farming practices and in ensuring continuity, he said.Farmers across the country, like Parameswaran, brought their stories to the forum, along with their seeds, getting to know traditional agricultural practices of other states and comparing them with their own.Vijay Jardhari of Uttarakhand, one of the founders of Beej Bachao Andolan, was a relatively unknown face to people in the city. However, to farmer-conservers at the exhibition, he was nothing short of a legend.Known as a barefoot conservationist, Vijay, who has been soldiering for seed conservation for over 25 years, walked from village to village to create awareness about seed conservation. Today he has about 350 varieties of paddy varieties in his collection, along with eight varieties of wheat and around 220 varieties of kidney beans.Even several years ago, people had mastered the art of storing several varieties of seeds in dried bottle gourds because they knew that even if they die, the seeds must be saved for those next in line, he said.Some species, according to conservationists like Parameswaram, die with certain lines of work like the magudi sora variety of bottle gourd which was used to make the snake charmers flute. With the dying profession, the species of the gourd also disappear.According to Krishnamurthy, from Puducherry, the seeds for the traditional Poongar, an indigenous rice variety, were available with just three farmers in 2009 before they were conserved and now made considerably available in the market."

Shettar said the government should test these items at the earliest and allay peoples fears, if it reports on it being plastic were not true.Ramesh Kumar said, I can understand about adulteration. But I am hearing about plastic for the first time. It is too costly to do such a thing, so I dont know why anyone would do it, he said. However, he conceded that complaints would not be treated as false and would be investigated.Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader dismissed the idea of plastic rice in the PDS system, saying that it was procured from Food Corporation.Mid-day meal rice certifiedOfficials from the education department have asked parents not to worry as the rice supplied under mid-day meal scheme is certified.

While the rigorous training at culinary school lays the basic foundation for our profession, it is our expeditions through the country and across continents that leads our discovery of new cultures, foods, ingredients, techniques and much more. My travels have been no different!Sojourns across South-east Asia have left an indelible impression, influencing both, my style of cooking and menu planning. Interestingly, South-east Asian cuisine comes with a whole lot of unsuals. Consider the concept of serving in bowls, whereby the bowl serves as a complete meal in itself!By virtue of expediency and exquisiteness, the Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khowsuey and Singaporean Laksa, all bowl meals, have reached tables of leading restaurants across the globe.Another lasting gastronomic influence in my life came from my five year stint in the beautiful Maldivian islands, where I picked up the art of contrasting flavours, textures and temperatures. I had the pleasure of tasting a local specialty - a yellow fish curry served with rice and crisp drumstick leaves. The taste and texture of the meal linger on, and have, in fact, become the basis for a whole lot of innovations.One such dish on our menu, which, in the true sense is a culmination of these learnings, is the Hu-Tieu-Sai-Gon!Hu tieu (spiced noodle soup) is a traditional Vietnamese dish specific to southern Vietnam. This bowl meal is a perfect balance of spiciness from chilies, sweetness from jaggery, sourness from tamarind and the crunch from fried peanuts! To prepare Hu-Tieu- Sai-Gon, make a stock of fresh veggies along with spices such as garlic, star anise, ginger, cinnamon and chopped lemongrass and bring to a boil. Strain the broth and put back on the boil. Add a homogenous mix of coconut milk, peanut butter, mushroom oyster sauce, light soy to the broth.For the toppings, use blanched vegetables and cooked rice vermicelli in boiling water for not more than a minute. To assemble, add boiled rice vermicelli in a soup bowl. Top it up with the blanched vegetables, crispy onion and garlic slices. Pour the boiling broth over this and serve alongside shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts, basil leaves, chilli and lime wedges.Like all my journeys, thus far, I wish to continue the exploration of the myriad nooks in this world that lead me to less travelled culinary havens and ultimately to the discovery of life itself.

Being a homebound person by nature, I spent a lot of time in the kitchen helping my mother. Our food needs a lot of whisking, and she would ask me to stir the curries. She taught me how to make kibbeh, a mixture of finely ground lamb or beef, bulgur, onion, mint and Middle Eastern spices, which we would stuff in fish or lamb and fry, says Alshamali. The 35-year-old chef in the midst of launching a modern Middle Eastern cuisine eatery at the Renaissance Downtown Hotel, Dubai is in Mumbai to helm the ongoing Arabesque food festival at the J.W. Marriott Juhu.When we meet Alshamali, the Lotus Caf is pleasantly enveloped with the pleasing fragrance of zaatar and cinnamon. Middle Eastern food is similar to Indian food as most of the ingredients are similar, shares the chef. The food that Alshamali is dishing up for Arabesque is more home-style making it an authentic Arabic experience on a platter.On the menu is an authentic shawarma station. Alshamali is serving shawarmas with a special red chilli paste he has brought all the way from Syria. From the grill section, we try chicken in harissa sauce, prawns in a green souk sauce made from coriander and chillies. While the ingredients are easily identifiable, they create a completely unique zing on our palates. We quite enjoy the mild chicken cooked in yogurt with saffron.Past the grill section, which also has crunchy baby corns, green chillies and baby aubergines,we take a dollop of kabsa, rice with minced meat and meatball in tomato sauce made with pomegranate molasses, kokum and sumac, which gives the dish a berry-like sourness.The chef, whose earlier stint has been at Qbara, a modern Middle Eastern restaurant that made it to Worlds 50 Best Restaurants this year. He says, My first job in Dubai was in Atmosphere, the highest restaurant in the world housed in Burj Khalifa, where we served authentic French cuisine.He breaks down Arabic cuisine to the basics. Tahina is made from roasted sesame and harissa, a sauce made from Magrebi red chili, Moroccan spices and garlic, are the most commonly used. We also make a fine green zouk sauce which has coriander, green chillies, caraway seeds and lemon juice. We use pomegranate molasses and cumin too in our curries, he adds, sharing a childhood memory of his mother pickling vegetables for winter months. She would put the olives in brine solution for two months before we could eat it, he smiles.Our order of the shawarma is here, and we roll the pita bread that is stuffed with grilled chicken, the Syrian red chilli paste, lemon juice, onions. We dunk it in sour cream and the sweet and tangy red chilli paste pleasantly surprises us. While it is not at all spicy, it is supremely flavourful.Alshamalis version of a bakalava takes us into a food trance. Its freshly made and comes with a twist. It has no pistachio but a filling of walnut with cinnamon. It is flaky and soft and we are likely to crave this version more than the traditional pistachio one.The Arabic Food Festival, Arabesque at JW Marriott, Lotus Caf from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily till April 30"

Now, the killing of farmers in Mandsaur is the grim reminder to countrys bureaucracy that it cannot address the brute reality of farmers suffering through customary power point presentations. The latest government note meant for internal discussion shows: 468 million or approximately 40 per cent of Indians are dependent for their livelihood on farming that is underperforming and failing to even generate for their needs, consistently driving them to the brink and crushing the present and the future of farm families.The NDA government, which has set a target of doubling farmers income by 2022, has a daunting task at hand. Only innovative solutions and right support prices for produce can revive the agricultural economy. This is not the first time farmers have agitated demanding better support prices. For years, they have been appealing to Central and State governments on the issue.The government says farm loan waivers are not a viable option. Instead, it calls for a mechanism to protect farmers from price fluctuations. A large number of crops and States are facing discrimination in price support policy of Central government as MSP is effective only for three crops. With country moving towards direct benefit transfers, large-scale procurement of rice and wheat will also not be required. This requires new instruments to safeguard farmers against prices dipping very low.As per the government note, 67.10 per cent farmers in the country are marginal and hold less than one hectare land. Those farm families struggle for survival is even greater in states like Bihar, where the figure of marginal farmers is 91 per cent, while it is 79.45 per cent in UP and 77.19 per cent in Tamil Nadu.The successive regimes at the Centre brought the various agriculture policy many times over the last 67 years, but the fortune of farmers hasnt changed even once.The government officials even privately admit that unviable farm size and unfair price are the real cause for farmers woes, pushing them under excessive debt and producing the bitter harvest. The government note observed that they require innovative solutions with long-term commitment to bring prosperity in the farm families."

Even as it slows down to stop, frantic men and women jump down from the compartments, lunch boxes in hand, and sprint to the exit.There are motorcycles waiting outside. They belong to brokers or agents of work contractors. A lucky few among these frantic arrivals will get work for the day.Hundreds of passengers arrive in Raichur every morning from the dust bowls of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana: Villages with names like Kosgi, Bichali, Rajolibanda and Matmari and so on. The construction sector is booming in Raichur and these men and women come to find work.Twenty-nine-year-old Mallesh has been doing the early morning commute to Raichur every day for the past two years. My day starts at 5 am, he says. I make my lunch, finish the chores and get out. A friend who lives two houses away joins me and we walk 2km, take a bus or share auto to the station. The train comes at 7.30am and Im in Raichur by 9.30.If they are lucky, they will work and if they dont get work, they will take the next train home | ExpressMallesh and his friend are not the run-of-the-mill drought migrants you see in the rainshadow districts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. They are drought commuters who sleep at home and work abroad.Mahesh himself is the husband of a small patch of land back home. His parents died three years ago, leaving with some debts. Farming has not been an option in these past few years due to the water shortage. But he feels a responsibility to hold on to the ancestral land left to him. So he joined the army of day-trippers to Raichur.I have to pay off the loans, he says. I will work anywhere, do anything. From sweeping floors to constructing buildings. As long as its legal. In the beginning he made about `100 a day. Now he makes `400. On a good day `500. But what happens when theres no motorcycle-borne middleman at the end of the dawn run to Raichur? What happens to the commuters who cant get work? Such commuters can be seen begging for odd jobs in the houses around the Raichur station. Those who cant find even that, hop on the 11.30am train back home.For the middlemen on the motorcycles, the 9.30 am train is a link in a demand-supply system that spans the agrarian world out there in the country and the construction sector in this boom town. Every day at 9.30 am, Lakshmaniah waits outside the station for the Link Express bearing Mahesh and a thousand others to be hired and supplied to contractors at different projects. During the drought season, we have an abundance of manpower. Theres no farming and the people prefer us rather than MGNREGA because it pays less, he says. Raichurs commuter workers are paid Rs 300-350 per day. If someone can paint or plumb, he might make Rs. 400. Women are paid Rs. 200-250 for the same job.The Raichur run is a distress phenomenon but it has its smileys. Mahesh, the debt-burdened man, rather enjoys his two-hour train journeys. It diverts his mind and he has made friends on the Link Express. I forget all my worries for a while. We are like one family on the train. We reserve seats for each other, work together and head back in the same train, he says.Its a brisk life with no margin. Everyone brings his or her own lunch for the wage is too slim for a meal at a hotel. Wrap up time is 5.30 pm and the walk back to the railway station is only a little less frantic than in the morning. Down from the train on the other side, theres still the bus ride back to be essayed, and for most of them, its 10 pm by the time they reach home.Loki, whose return train is at 7.30 pm, says, I just have a little time to spend with my two sons. I put them to bed. Thats all the time I have with my family.He has a 2.4 acre farm. But this has to be done, drought or no drought. I have to work extra hours to save for my childrens future, says Loki.Express logicNanded Express 16594, which starts from Bengaluru and passes through Andhra Pradesh, brings passengers to Raichur early in the morning. It passes through Anantpur (Hindupur, Penukonda, Dharmavaram, Anantpur), Kurnool (Gooty, Guntakal, Adoni), Bellary (Kupgal), Mahbubnagar (Kosgi) and Mantralayam before entering Raichur through Matmari and Raichur town. Besides these travellers, people from Yadgir and Wadi also come to Raichur for work.People travel to bigger towns from surrounding villages during the drought months (February to May) before the rains in June and make Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a month if they are lucky to get work. They are paid Rs 300 to Rs 400 a day depending on their skills.The work is mostly on construction sites, which dot the town centre with many small BPOs and IT companies opening shop here.

The family did not provide me proper education and I did not progress in life. Fed up with the ill-treatment, I decided to kill Ishwar Tyagi and bought weapons from my friends Rahul and Johnny (both brothers). I had told them I need weapons for the murder, Anuj told police.They called up a tantric to improve my mental health but I was furious. They are not my brothers and the deceased is not my father. They all conspired against me, he said.Crime branch officials said Anuj is suffering from acute schizophrenia, a fact admitted by his family. He had been undergoing treatment at a hospital in Delhi. But he had stopped taking medicines and his condition aggravated before he allegedly shot dead his father.Apart from Anuj, two other accused, Rahul and Johnny, have been booked under IPC sections of criminal conspiracy. They had knowledge that Anuj had sought a weapon and cartridges to murder his father and still they provided him arms. They are absconding, said SC Belwal, inspector, crime branch.After his arrest, Anuj said he studied only up to class 11 while three of his brothers did well and completed their engineering from reputed institutions such as IIT. His fourth brother is an IPS officer posted in Auraiya.Anuj claimed his family and brothers did not give him money and property. However, his eldest brother Praveen Tyagi, who runs an IIT coaching academy in Mumbai, said he gifted him a Mercedes and their father had opened a rice mill worth Rs 50 crore for Anuj in Ghaziabad.The crime branch recovered the Fortuner and the 19 leftover cartridges. Anuj allegedly purchased 20 cartridges from Johnny. The police also recovered the .32 caliber pistol used during the crime."

Over 100 farmers have been camping in Jantar Mantar for the last month demanding drought relief measures from the central government.Today we mingled food with the mud.

(Representational Image)Three days after the wheat procurement season commenced in Punjab, the state is yet to receive the Cash Credit Limit (CCL) as the Ministry of Finance now wants it to update its accounts of the previous kharif season. The state government had cleared its dues pertaining to last Rabi season on March 16 after Captain Amarinder Singh, took over as the Chief Minister, and directed the finance department to clear Rs 270 crore to ensure CCL for wheat procurement was sanctioned in time.However, sources in the finance department said the Centre had asked the state to update the accounts of the kharif season as well. The functionaries of the department said it is an harassment by the Centre as the paddy procurement season end in May.After all five agencies procure paddy in September every year, the process of milling and filling of godowns goes on till May as it requires time. There is no way to keep the accounts updated till the entire rice reaches the godowns. Huge amounts of rice are still lying with the millers, said a functionary.As the CCL is caught up in the wranglings between Centre and state, Finance Secretary Anirudh Tewari, who was transferred to the department on Saturday went to Delhi on Monday to get the CCL released.Amarinder has already taken up the matter twice with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Punjab Finance Minister Manpreet Badal too met the Union Finance Secretary three days ago to get the CCL released. It should be released by today or tomorrow. There is no need to panic as the procurement season would start full throttle only around April 9, said Badal.He added they were expecting a yield of 105 lakh MT but they were prepared for lifting 120 lakh MT. Punjab had sought an advance of Rs 20,660 crore from the Centre for the procurement. Sick of the delay, the state government is even mulling following the Harayana way to procure the grains.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) Shapoor Zadran is a fantasy cricketer for a nation that worships aggressive sportsmen. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)Long flowing hair and intimidating pace generated from his 28-stride run-up. Shapoor Zadran is a fantasy cricketer for a nation that worships aggressive sportsmen. As Afghanistan gets an IPL entry and new home in Noida, the countrys most-famous star tells The Indian Express what makes him tick, why he rates Indian players over Pakistanis, and his dream of meeting his Bollywood idol Shah Rukh Khan.Tension simmers under the skin whenever Afghanistan play neighbours Pakistan  mostly its harmless ribbing from the big brother, though at times the chattering can boil over. This one had no words uttered, yet it ended up as an international incident in the blink of an eye. Literally.Because Afghanistans big, strapping quick Shapoor Zadran decided to bowl an outswinger to Pakistan opener Mohammad Hafeez, and followed it with a gesture that mightve simply amused Hafeez, but got the whole of Afghanistan ruffled: Shapoor had just winked at the Professor.Television exploded that day as Kabul networks wretchedly paused the frames of Shapoors follow-through, then zoomed in on his face circling the eye and blew up The Wink. It played on a loop the next 24 hours, and he was summoned home to explain his action.TV zoomed into my eye and it was like all of Afghanistan wanted to know how I couldve done such a thing  Pathan ne aankh maari! I was happy with the outswinger and just like that winked. Jaanbuzh ke nahi kiya tha, par logon ne kuchh aur samazh liya, aur ghar pe ammi ne bulake puchha Yeh tumne kya kar diya? Shapoor recalls of Winkgate.Tall Afghan fast bowlers are expected to glare and scowl, but Shapoor ditched both, and settled for what he thought was a cheeky wink. Its like when talking at a Kandivali hotel in Mumbai after training at the Payyade Club, Shapoor starts vaguely about his early Bollywood heroes  Sunny Deol, Suniel Shetty and Sanjay Dutt, the toughies who growled and beat up the baddies, but forgets about the fist-fighters and instead yaps about his full blown fandom of Shah Rukh Khan  outstretched arms, charming lines, the works.How he wound up with that un-ferocious but merely irreverent wink is evident in his lifelong emulation of Shoaib Akhtar. The Akhtar imitation was more thereabouts than there, in its eventual execution. But more on that later.***On a warm day in Mumbai, with his shoulder-length hair flying as he runs into the light breeze, Shapoor is patching together that glorious run-up which had halted because of a right knee injury six months ago. The left-arm pacer flew down to Mumbai 10 days earlier than his Afghanistan team-mates who will assemble in Noida to start playing their home ties against other Associates, and is keen on hitting the groove and getting used to bowling long spells in the sun.That long run-up doesnt quite culminate in some fiendish pace, though in his third spell, a net batsman lost balance and fell on his backside getting out of the way of a bouncer. But Shapoor clearly likes the drama that bookends his bowling action, and the 28 loping strides turn heads at this cornerpost of Mumbai cricket, a shapeless but decently maintained ground tucked away in one nook of the western suburb.The 31-year-old had got in touch with Umesh Patwal, a maidan cricketer who once served on the Afghanistan coaching staff as batting coach, and these days carries Shapoor on his motorbike through Borivalis zigzag lanes  wind in hair  in what is as much of the Mumbai experience his coach is allowing him right now. The pilgrimage to Mannat has been put off until later by telling Shapoor that Shah Rukh is away shooting in England, and the Afghan buys into the script of his famous Bollywood idol being busy shooting someplace far, rendering the jaunt to Bandstand meaningless. His appetite for drama extends to his Bollywood picks  he cant get over Devdas, and its ostentatious lines.I would like to go but he must be a busy man. Plus, when I reached the airport Umesh told me that I had to bowl as many overs as possible to get back into the groove, he explains. Shapoor has chosen the testing Mumbai hours of 12 noon to 3 pm to train and sweat, and meeting the matinee idol can wait as he tries to bring his career back on track. He has picked a nice stark tan along the way to show for this week of rigour.But its not just the burning sun acclimatisation thats kept him rooted to the hotel-ground-hotel routine with one visit to a nearby mall thrown in. Meeting heroes isnt always fun, Shapoor says, scorched as he is by snubs from before. Wide-eyed and impressionable, he had naturally thought Pashto kinship meant Shahid Afridi would become like an elder brother to the Afghanistan team. He would just wave at us like a celebrity and walk away. Once he was out of the team he started talking nicely and said Eh Shapoor kaisa ho, but at first it was only the hand-wave, he grumps.With idol Shoaib Akhtar, hed been too tongue-tied at first  still a fan who was watching a TV star in flesh. We met 3-4 times but it was just Salaam, Hi, How are you and Bye. Its tough to say anything when you see someone youve only seen on TV, he says earnestly.***Afghanistan pacer Shapoor Zadran is sweating it out in scorching sun and also passing tips to fellow campers. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) Afghanistan pacer Shapoor Zadran is sweating it out in scorching sun and also passing tips to fellow campers. (Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)Its why MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli climbed his personal popularity charts. MS came and told us after a match that we were a promising team and would do well. Kohli came and hugged us after a match. If you are a star, thats what you do  you come and hug a junior, a pat on the back. There are expectations from heroes, and its nice when Indians show us that respect. Yuvraj, Rohit Sharma the Pathan reels off names through the emotional gush. Dil bada hona chahiye  in bowling and when winning, he adds.Its what hes got used to receiving in India  warmth and respect, while equations with the Pakistan team remain taut. Maybe sharing borders always amplifies annoyance of the neighbour anyplace in the world, he muses, but theres a bit of chirpy history to turn Shapoor grouchy when talking about Pakistan in contrast to his experience of Indians.Pakistan ki team hamesha bahot bolte hai, zyada bolte hai, he says flapping his fingers to resemble a gabbing mouth. The Wink put him in the eye of a storm at home comically, but Shapoor has peevish memories of other confrontations. Umar Akmal run se zyada baatein tez karta hai. Hell start  aise marunga, waise marunga. Indians bowler ko respect dete hai, gaali nahi, he says, obviously never having caught Kohli in one of his wild moods.***In company of maidan coach Umesh Patwal, who drives him around in Mumbai.(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza) In company of maidan coach Umesh Patwal, who drives him around in Mumbai.(Express Photo by Kevin DSouza)But theres a good vibe about India for the Afghans, never mind the Pakistan comparison. Its what makes Shapoor happy about their home ground moving from Dubai to Noida. India se bahot dosti hai, Mumbai feels like home, Delhi has lot of Afghans wholl come and fill stadiums to watch us. India mein aasaani hai, he explains. Comfort.Yaha zubaan wohi hai. Waha Dubai mein sab Arabi alag hai, he says, speaking of a stronger cultural affinity with South Asia and a shared passion for cricket thats a massive ice-breaker in the subcontinent. He wont blindly tuck into Indian food, though  too spicy, he says as a lesson in subtle spicing of aromatic Afghan rice follows on a day when Aussie Matt Renshaw fled to the loo mid-inning on a ground across the Expressway in Pune.But having acquired a new penchant for salted lassi and having told his hosting hotel in Mumbai to go easy on the chillies, Shapoor thinks the citys growing on him.Its not what hed expected  Afghan cricketers coming to Mumbai think its all Bollywood, rich people, Ambanis and the IPL  but after having lived the clich during an earlier stint, when the Afghans played World Cup games in posh(er) South Bombay, Shapoor is learning about a gritty city that turns the formerly starry-eyed man philosophical.Theres a small pathway beyond my practice ground. Its just a 20-second pillion ride through that lane, but I stopped one day and found that some 20 people live in a single room in the slum. I didnt sleep that night, he says. Zindagi sakht hoti hai, he says.Sakht. Difficult, if one were to simplify the word. Though Shapoor uses it multiple times. He uses it while talking about the times, when deep into the night, Afghan cricketers woke up startled at every bombing in the distance or when footballers would scrunch their noses at the white flannelled and say, Yeh kya hai?.No one respected cricket then, now the whole country loves it. Theres money, prestige and respect, he says. And IPL contracts too.***Cricket was always 50/50 for Shapoor. That is to say he remained undecided about it. My father was angry when I left my studies, and he wanted me to either join his business (car dealership and real estate) or study. They used to laugh when I used the word international. So when I first came on TV, I went and asked them, Kyun, aaya ya nahi main TV pe?Shapoor loves the cameras, and this love is easily mutual. The 62 pacer with the stylishly long mane is a sight when he  like Shoaib Akhtar  streaks in like a bullet train. He recalls hearing about Manoj Prabhakars spells on crackling radio waves earlier, and getting a head rush everytime stumps were struck.But the Shoaib-influenced career is like a remake gone awry. I used to wake up making plans about what I could do to become like him. But it became tough because he was a rightie and me leftie. So it didnt work out too well, I couldnt just copy everything, he says.The hair was styled well enough, but the bowling was picked in bits and pieces and without early coaching, the whole package never could come together. Lekin shauk aa gaya fast bowling ka. Baal vaal toh kar liye, kyunki wo junoon jism mein utar gaya tha, he says.After meditating each morning about becoming like the Shoaib for 6-7 minutes, Shapoor realised his kinesiology wasnt suited for that action  his was more like quilted into place and held together by the fetish and fervour rather than the precise formula.So, while the speedgun spiked at 150  140  dropping down to 132 and resurging at 145, to the experts it remained an indulgent run-up followed by a slightly under-whelming delivery. Very exciting, but an under-achievement when all was played and done. Wasim Akram would spend some time with Shapoor and goad him for 8 months from 2012-14, to trim that runway  its down from 38 strides to 28 now. Now my coaches tell me if Im happy with the run-up I should stick to it. It gives me a sense of rhythm, he contends.It had started when two Shoaib sprints ended in shattered stumps of Dravid and Tendulkar at Kolkata. Wo dekh ke jism mein jhatka aa jaata tha. Jaiseki bowler bol raha maaro sa^&* batsmen ko, he says, stressing its never a personal grudge but a war, against the batsmen, waged by bowlers playing a sport loaded in favour of the mace wielders.***Shapoor believes a certain degree of madness is necessary to even think of becoming a pace bowler. My madness was 38 strides. Par saare bowler deewane hote hai. Deewane nahi hue toh woh bowler nahi hai, he rationalises, pleased with his theory.It is the Pathani stubbornness that was seen in an infuriating number of Shahid Afridi aborted innings  where hed fail to check his instinct. Par wo junoon hi toh hai meri bowling mein, he says in self-assessment. If I change, I will lose my bowling, he declares  those 10 strides less now, more a decision borne out of a creaking body than a crumbling mind.Hes not vain about his bowling though, the bluster kept at bay with self-awareness. A savage Paul Stirling assault during the Qualifiers T20 final left him in shreds. Bahot maar padi 2 overs mein. And he isnt even the greatest of batsmen, he says flummoxed. I learnt the importance of staying calm in the second spell realising that I can only try experiments when Im cool-headed, he would say.Growing up pangs the entire squad experiences on rough days. Like it was tough to understand why Mohammad Shahzaad (Afghanistans mercurial wicketkeeper), whod hit Imran Tahir and Rabada for long sixes, wasnt picked in IPL. Maybe because India has so many wicketkeepers? And well need to get consistent to be noticed, he says.Shapoor wants to pack in Kohli once though. I admire how his bat comes down straight and sharp, hes the best batsman, he starts. So obviously, Shapoor wants to knock his middle stump off. Ek din tez aake danda udaana hai. Nahi kiya aur balle pe ball aa gaya, toh who bahot marega, he laughs.With Afghanistan scheduled to play four-dayers, Shapoor, the original star, wants to put himself in contention for the longest format. Twenty mein ache balls bhi maare jaate hai, he groans, but in Tests, Ill get to prove that I can last long, bowl 10-20 overs, battle with a batsman. Tests will be like pathology lab tests for Afghanistan. Theyll show whats inside our body, he says, not content with being outwardly appended with adjectives like fearless and proud.Every movie would have that dialogue about how Mumbai is this great city  films, skyscrapers, wealth. But now I need to find the resilience of those 20 people struggling but surviving in that one room of a slum in my cricket, he says. He wants to do well enough to muster courage to talk to Shah Rukh about cricket and beyond a Salaam, hi, how are you, bye. Tongue-tied he might well be at present, but not when Afghanistan takes off from a 28-stride bounding runway into the future as a Test nation. He might even wink without fear.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo by Partha Paul Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. Express Photo by Partha Paul50 years ago, on May 25, an uprising in this North Bengal block changed the politics of the country, and continues to agitate it. But where it all started, the original rebels have little strength left against a new breed of landowners, the land mafia, allowing BJP a foothold in its ideological battle against the Left. Esha Roy goes to the ground.In March 1967, after years of oppression by landlords, the peasants of Naxalbari village in North Bengals Darjeeling district rose up in revolt, in one of the countrys most defining uprisings. Under Charu Majumdar, Kanu Sanyal and Jangal Santhal, the Naxals, as they came to be known, seized land from the jotedars (landlords), grains from their godowns and distributed it among the peasants.The State retaliated by torturing villages, leading to May 24, when thousands gheraoed a police party at Jharujote. Inspector Sonam Wangdi was killed, three officers were injured. The next day, at Bengai Jote, 11 villagers, including eight women and two children, were shot dead by police. The firing would trigger an armed guerrilla resistance that, 50 years later, continues to inspire other such movements in the country, including in neighbouring Nepal and the Maoists. Today, as tea workers pick the First Flush of Darjeeling in Naxalbaris lush tea estates, the blood bath is a distant memory.Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul) Siliguri Cholo: CPIM-Libaration activist is busy working on a wall graffiti in Kolkata. (Source: Express photo by Partha Paul)As the CPI (ML) Liberation and other fractured smaller Left parties prepare for the 50th anniversary of the uprising, the preparations are low-key. The headlines have instead been hijacked by the BJP, after its president Amit Shah chose Naxalbari to begin his tour of the five states where the party is yet to make his mark including, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Odisha and Telangana. Addressing party workers, Shah said, This is the place where violence had started. Now this is the same Naxalbari where Modijis Sabka Saath, Sabka Bikash slogan can be heard. I have full faith that development will defeat the violence.On May 29, says Naxalbari block BJP president Dilip Barui, the party unit will be inducting 220 new members. Asserting that the party presence in the region once dominated by the Left is steadily growing, Barui says, Local leaders and workers from the CPM, Congress and TMC from Naxalbari, Matigara, Bagdogra, Batasi will be joining us.Barui also points out that in the last panchayat elections, held in 2014, the BJP won one or two seats in every panchayat. In the 2016 Assembly polls, its candidate came in third, close on the heels of the TMC. While the Congress-CPM joint candidate won, the BJP leader says the gap is closing. This is a Left-dominated area. But people know there is no point supporting the Left any longer. The BJP is the future.Abhijeet Majumdar, the Darjeeling district secretary of the CPI(ML) Liberation and the son of Charu Majumdar, says there is more to the BJP campaign than the tussle for Naxalbari. Amit Shah knows that there is only one faction that can stand up to the huge Hindutva surge in the country. After the BJPs victory in the Uttar Pradesh elections, he did not celebrate. Instead his statement was that the BJPs golden era would come only when Bengal and Kerala are taken. He knows it is only with the death of the Left that Hindutva can flourish in the country.The six gram panchayats that make up the Naxalbari block are a patchwork of old tea estates, but now there is a new rush in the air. The National Highway that cuts through the area is being widened to a six-lane road, flyovers are being constructed, hotels and flashy malls have sprung up. And once again, real estate is at a premium.However, unlike that time half a century ago, with its call of Langor jaar, jamin taar (land belongs to those who till it), the battle for land today is more insidious. There are no loud protests or gunfire as the new breed of landlords, the land mafia, mops up chunks. Mani Mahatos 22-year-old primary school for tribal children in Jharujote, a stones throw away from where Inspector Wangdi was killed, shut down in 2011. Well-respected in the area, he no longer teaches, instead selling chaat from a small stall.Mahato recalls how they had all got land after the 1967 movement. But several years ago, people claiming to be descendants of our landlords came, propped up by the land mafia. The mafia told us to give up our land in return for compensation. They also said we would have to fight long-drawn battles in court. We were all scared. So most of us gave up our land. I got Rs 2 lakh for my 1.5 bighas, he says.Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Mani Mahato showing Khagen Kundu Math ,the spot where sonam Wangdi was Killed. (Express photo by Partha Paul)He adds that many descendants later turned out to be fake but, when the real ones came, they too struck a deal with the land mafia. The mafia has been selling off land to people from Manipur, Nagaland and Shillong. Nepali families who cant buy land there have come here to settle down. The land grab means that members of the 50-odd tribal families who live in the village and had tilled the land earlier are now daily wagers. Most people have left. They have gone to Kerala, Gujarat and Chennai in search of work, Mahato says.He admits he supported the BJP candidate in the last panchayat polls (he lost by a mere 40 votes). The CPM did nothing for us, nor did the TMC. When they first came to power, I thought maybe this new party will help. We have tried the Congress, the Left, the TMC. Let us give the BJP a chance.Among the early members of the Naxal guerrilla force was Kandra Murmu, 62, who continues to live in Bittan Jote, once a part of the Naxal liberated zone. Like his village, his life is sedate now. Hailing from a family of bhagchashis (share croppers), Murmu tills his one bigha of land. He used to grow paddy, now he grows jute. His son helps. But the battle for land has returned.Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul) Kandra Murmu at his residence at Bittan Jote. Kandra had joined the naxal movement when he was a teenager. He is still a share cropper. (Express photo by Partha Paul)When the andolan was over, Charu Majumdar made sure we all got land. Jotedars were eliminated and we got pattas. But it turns out that in legal government documents, the land still belongs to the landlord. I registered my complaint to the panchayat but nothing changes, he says. After a pause, he adds, Its not possible to take up arms again. That atmosphere is just not conducive.Murmu joined the Naxals when 12, and spent many years underground. He is sad at the fate of the agitation he gave some of his best years to. If it wasnt for Naxalbari, zamindari would still exist in the country. But farmers still dont have land rights. It is a different kind of battle now, more difficult. But the government and the political parties are self-serving.Darjeeling District Magistrate Joyshree Dasgupta admits there have been many cases of land grabbing in the Naxalbari-Matigara-Bagdogra area. We have received reports of this. But the government has issued pattas to tribal families to cultivate these plots and if they are selling these on their own volition, there is nothing we can do, she says, adding their hands are tied without a complaint. We have come to know plots are being sold to outsiders at Rs 3-4 lakh a plot. At some point, we will take action, she adds.Shanti Munda, 74, one of the most well-known faces of the Naxalbari movement, who joined the protests as a young mother with her newborn, says the situation is the same in her Hathighisa village, neighbouring Naxalbari village. There are no jobs here. People cant eat. In order to sustain themselves, they have sold off their land. As many as 16 tea gardens have shut down in the Dooars. In this area alone, four tea gardens have shut down. The government says it is providing rice at Rs 2 a kg for the affected tea garden workers. But you need to be able to earn to even pay that Rs 2, she says.Munda, who unsuccessfully contested the local elections in 1982, winning just 3,500 votes, adds that Modis people keep visiting her. They came one-and-a-half months ago, just before Shahs visit. They said, We will do the work here, what you tried with the bullet, we will bring with the ballot. Another time they came to me and said that they would construct a new village at Hathighisa, make it a model one.Nantu Ghoshs family has owned a Hero cycle dealership for over 35 years in Naxalbari town, which is like any other flourishing Indian town. Rows of shops selling electronics, garments, sweets, furniture jostle for space. The town was never that affected by the Naxals, Ghosh says. There is a BSF camp here, so they mainly steered clear. Nevertheless there was an atmosphere of fear.Now, the 60-year-old believes, the Naxal movement is finished for good. Nothing good can happen in India. There is so much corruption, all parties are the same. If the Naxals couldnt bring about changes, nobody can. We have a Congress MLA here but he won because of the alliance with the CPM. But the Left is waning too. We feel that if there is a party that can compete with Mamata Banerjee now, it is the BJP.Ghosh understands that much of what parties do is petty politics. But adds, The Naxal leaders are all dead Kanu Sanyal died in abject poverty. In this day and age, one has to look after ones family, you have to survive. You cant be a revolutionary.Naxalbari Sharada Shishu Tirtha Vidyalaya was established in 1999 by RSS swayamsevak Sujit Das, who is also the schools Pradhan Acharya (principal). It began as a single rented room in Naxalbari village, but by 2002 had amassed enough funds to buy a two-acre plot in a quieter part of Naxalbari town. The school now caters to 539 students, mostly from Rajbongshi (SC) and Adivasi (ST) communities, and has expanded up to Class VIII. It is one of the largest primary schools in Naxalbari and Das says the aim is to grow up to Class X. He says he has applied for registration with the Education Department. When we started, Naxalbari had just one government higher secondary school and some private primary schools. People wanted to send their children to school. They just didnt have anywhere to send them, says Das.Apart from regular schooling, the students learn yoga, moral science and music, where they are taught patriotic songs. Das says they are encouraged to eat vegetarian food.At shivir camps at the school, children stay for two-three days to learn the correct lifestyle, and are also taken to tribal areas and tea gardens to distribute clothes and food to the underprivileged. We have many such social activities. When Panighata tea garden shut down, we provided food to the 11 tea garden families for a month and a half, says Das.It helps that about 60 per cent of North Bengals votes lie in its tea gardens. Das is also the advisor to the RSS shakha which operates in Naxalbari town. While he does not reveal numbers, he says membership to the RSS is growing. Seventeen of Naxalbaris young swayamsevaks just left for Muslim-dominated Malda district for a camp.The Left realises the danger it is facing. Outside the office of the CPI(ML) Liberation, a large sign says: Resist the onslaught of BJP-RSS combine. As part of the Naxalbari Golden Jubilee Celebrations, the CPI (ML) Liberation has planned marches and a large public event at Siliguri, where Communists from across the country are expected to come. Seventy-five cultural activist troupes from across the country will perform.Sitting inside, beneath photos of Left icons such as Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong, Abhijeet Majumdar, laments that the Left remains disjointed to take on the BJP onslaught. Right after the BJP came to power in 2014, we held a Central Committee meeting in Delhi. We resolved that keeping in mind that the BJP had a corporate-fascist agenda, it was imperative that all the Left parties come together and form a united front. We even invited the Aam Aadmi Party. The first person to respond to this was Prakash Karat. But the initiative remained still-born.The vice-president of the TMCs Darjeeling district unit, Amar Sinha, insists they are not worried about the BJP. In Naxalbari, the BJP is basically the RSS. They are playing their usual dirty communal politics. We conduct awareness campaigns, explain to people what this is. No doubt, some are swayed by the BJP. But many are not.West Bengal Congress general secretary O P Mishra calls Shahs visit nothing more than good optics for the BJP. The Congress-CPM combine is strong here. Mishra also claims that the land mafia in the area is controlled by the TMC. Naxalbari is close to Siliguri and located at the foothills of Darjeeling. So the land prices have been going up. This is being exploited by the land mafia. But when the administration and police are partisan, it becomes difficult for us to do anything. With the tea gardens shutting down, the economic situation has worsened, making people more desperate. Shanti Munda says it may be too early to write the Left obituary. People believe that the Naxals are irrelevant, this is not true. It is not over yet. We will be back.Agrees CPI(ML) general secretary Partha Ghosh. Our numbers may have come down, the Naxals may have been wiped out, but every one who resists is a Naxal  the student in JNU who stood up to Smriti Irani, the Maruti factory worker who resists oppression, those in the movements against POSCO.To read this article in Malayalam, click hereFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We are investigating further to know how many times money was sent to the banned groups earlier. We are also identifying the contractors, who gave money to them under pressure of the naxal groups, he added.

They feasted on bitchi and beef to send across a message to our leaders to not intrude into our areas and try to violate our local laws.The bitchi-beef fest was to highlight to our leaders that in Garo Hills, we have our own laws, culture, traditions and practices.

On the other side is a compulsive activist, who remained so when she donned the khaki as a senior police official, and the khadi when she turned to politics after retirement.It was Bedis activism that put her on a collision course with the territorial government. She convened meetings with officials from various departments and gave them directions bypassing the elected government, conducted inspection trips to review work and upbraided officials and criticised local representatives, organised Janata durbar in her official residence for people to raise issues directly. In just months, she was a power centre running parallel to Narayanasamy's government  many a time perched above it.War at Puducherry: Collision courseHere is a look at the major flare-ups between Narayanasamy and Bedi since the two were pitted against one another...WhatsApp groupsSoon after taking charge, Bedi formed WhatsApp groups with senior officials as members. She passed instructions through this, and sought reports as well. This did have many advantages, but had one key flaw: without being added as members, the ministers, the ones accountable for the performance of their departments, were left in the dark about the agenda and outcome of these meetings. Soon, Narayanasamy directed officials not to use modes like WhatsApp groups to communicate official matters. This immediately led to an exodus from the groups. Though Bedi cancelled the order, officials were not keen on returning.Tighter hold on the purse stringsA Lieutenant Governor has a lot of power when it comes to bureaucratic matters, which Bedi realised in her early days as L-G. She has been using that ever since, alleged ministers and MLAs, who hold her responsible for the delay in taking up many welfare schemes including the ones promised ahead of polls. These include not allowing the distribution of old age pension at the doorsteps, not clearing the request to float tender to procure rice for free-rice programme, granting only one-fourth of the local area development funds, and insisting that the dredging work at Puducherry harbour be done only by the State-run firm which allegedly led to delays. However, according to Bedi, her intention is only to ensure that the cash-strapped UT administration was prudent in spending the available funds for matters that are of priority.Tussle over transferA Swachch Bharat event became a point of confrontation between the L-G and government, after the local MLA from opposition AIADMK complained that he was not invited despite it being mandatory. The MLA entered into an argument with the municipal commissioner, and then raised a breach of privilege complaint with the Speaker, while the official filed a petition with the DGP alleging threat to his life from the MLA. The Speaker referred the matter to Privilege Committee and also directed that the official be put on compulsory wait. The next day, her secretary sent a note to the chief secretary (as directed by Bedi) informing that the transfer order was invalid.MLA performance appraisalAmong all her moves, this was the one that hit local politicians the most. Bedis announcement that MLAs will be ranked on the basis of public feedback riled the MLAs no end. After mooting this in a WhatsApp group first, Bedi went public with the decision. The idea was that all from a particular constituency could vote for their MLAs based on performance, which, she calculated, could prod them into undertaking more cleanliness initiatives under Swachch Bharat. This did not go down well with the MLAs; many pointed out how Bedi, despite being projected as the chief ministerial candidate of the BJP, could not even win the election in her home turf of Delhi when AAP recorded a massive victory against the Modi wave.Medical college admissionFollowing complaints from students and parents, Bedi, in her characteristic style, barged into the office of the Centralised Admission Committee (CENTAC), where she found fault with the administration including ministers for not following proper admission procedure and raised charges of corruption.Narayanasamy responded by saying that everything was being done as per guidelines laid down by the Medical Council of India, and claimed even the Centre and Health Ministry in particular had appreciated the process. The Chief Minister even went to the extent of challenging her to prove the allegations. Both have taken to Twitter to justify their positions in this latest round of sparring."

This has also led to a 50 per cent drop in production at rice mills. This is despite the Civil Supplies departments attempts to douse the rumours by debunking the claims of plastic rice being in city shops.We have witnessed a drop of 60 to 70 per cent sales over the week. Retail shop owners who buy from us are yet to get rid of their stocks. People are believing rumours and even the media is spreading fear among public, said Siva Reddy Aluva, proprietor of Sambashiva Rice Traders, Yousufguda.There has been a 30 per cent drop in sales for me, said Srikanth Reddy, owner of GJR Chaawal Wholesale And Retail Rice Distributor, Chikkadpalli. Both rice dealers attributed the drop to fake stories spreading via social media.The rumours kicked off almost a month ago with a YouTube video wherein a ball of cooked rice was shown bouncing off the ground. The video claimed that the ball of rice bounced as it (rice) was made of plastic. The claim has been, however, debunked. But within days of the video being uploaded, its regional variants making the same claim of started gaining viewership. The hoax eventually went viral affecting the sale of rice in the city.Civil supplies dept debunks rumoursThe civil supplies department on Wednesday debunked the rumour by replicating the bouncing property using rice. The department conducted the test from samples collected based on a complaint.People are believing rumours and not the news. The finest quality of rice sells for Rs 60 a kg. Where is the logic of adding Rs 140 per kg worth of plastic to that? People should think before they believe anything, said Srikanth.While some rice millers say that their business has taken a hit, others claim there is no problem over the rumours of plastic rice. We are not facing any problem, its business as usual and production at our mills are going on as usual, said Pabba Balaiah, president, Hyderabad Rice Millers Association.However, another member of the association said, The rumour did affect as much as 25 to 30 per cent of rice sales across Telangana, leading to a drop in demand and this has in turn resulted in a 50 per cent drop in production."

(File Photo)Kerala assembly today witnessed uproarious scenes during budget presentation with Congress-led opposition staging a walk out alleging leakage of the document in the social media. The budget, presented by Finance Minister Thomas Isaac, focused on infrastructure development, strengthening of social welfare measures, steps to enhance safety of women, giving impetus to public education and health. It is the second budget by the ruling CPI(M)-led LDF after it came to power last year.The budget, presented for the year 2017-18, showed a total revenue of Rs 93,584.74 crore and revenue expenditure of Rs 10,96,27.88 crore. Thomas Isaac said Kerala was fully ready to implement GST, which was advantageous to the state. The state GST law would be passed in the assembly session to be convened next month for passing the budget and the demand for grants, he said. The budget proposed an infrastructure investment worth Rs 25,000 crore and said it will be the highest investment project in the history of Kerala.Isaac, while giving details of the economic slowdown felt due to the demonetisation of Rs 1000 and Rs 500, said this investment will be the most effective defence against the recession during the period of demonetisation.A total of Rs 5628 crore has been earmarked for the construction and repair of 182 roads across the state, considered as one of the major infrastructure initiatives.In tune with the ruling CPI(M)-led LDFs election manifesto, the budget unveiled different schemes for improving basic amenities of public schools in the state. Another major initiative in the social sector was the proposal to provide free-internent connection to 20 lakh poor households.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAdmitting that there was a spurt in the prices of essential commodities especially rice due to the implementation of National Food Security Act, Isaac said a total of Rs 900 crore was earmarked for ration subsidy and Rs 700 crore for paddy procurement.An amount of Rs 450 crore was set apart for the open market intervention to check the price rise.In a bid to tap the NRI investments in the state, he said the Kerala State Financial Enterprises would come out with Pravasi (NRI) Chitty through bonds. The amount would be utilised for the construction of coastal and high range highway with a total outlay of Rs 10,000 crore, he said.The Finance Minister also announced an increase in the pension amount to Rs 2000 from Rs 500 of expatriates who returned home. An amnesty scheme for traders to settle their tax arrears, with affect from 2005-06 to 2010-11, was announced.To help rubber traders, the budget proposed to exempt natural rubber and its variants from tax for the period from December 20, 2014 to March 31,2015. Seeking to encourage Akshay Urja Scheme which promotes the utilisation of renewable energy, the budget fixed the tax rate for the installation of solar devices at 1 per cent, he said. The budget, presented for the year 2017-18, showed a total revenue of Rs 93,584.74 crore and revenue expenditure of Rs 10,96,27.88 crore. About one lakh houses would be built for homeless people during 2018.Trouble started as the nearly three-hour-long budget presentation reached its final stages, when Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala stood up and waved a set of papers alleging that the budget proposal was already available in social media even before being presented. Taken aback by the sudden development Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said budget details have not been leaked. But he assured the Opposition that their charge would be looked into.When budget is being presented, what has already been tabled, it might have come in the social media and other media. We will examine what has happened, he said.Intervening on the matter, Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan said, It is serious issue and we will look into it and make statement in the House later.Cutting short the presentation due to opposition sloganeering, Finance Minister Issac said I have not seen what has come in the social media. I cannot give a reply without knowing what has happened.Seizing of the matter, Chennithala said the budget has been leaked and its sanctity lost.He also alleged that the papers have been leaked from Finance Ministers office itself as he is very active in social media.UDF Opposition members, Kerala Congress(M) led by former Finance Minister K M Mani and lone BJP member O Rajagopal walked out of the House in protest against the alleged leak.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Jayachandra on Tuesday, it was decided to write to the Centre seeking aid to procure toor dal from farmers. The State will provide an additional Rs. 450 a quintal to the Centres Minimum Support Price of Rs. 5,050, thus procuring the commodity for Rs. 5,500.The State has already procured 31.32 lakh quintals of toor dal.Furthermore, with only the less-nutritious rice being distributed to BPL families, the sub-committee has decided to propose to the State Cabinet to distribute toor dal to BPL families under the Anna Bhagya scheme. The proposal is to distribute 1 kg of toor dal to every family by giving a subsidy of Rs. 30 a kg. The prevailing market price of toor dal is Rs. 80 a kg.However, subsidised distribution of toor dal under PDS will cost the State exchequer an additional Rs. 1,100 crore annually.We are seeking the Centres support for lessen the burden on the State, Mr. Jayachandra said.Big harvestThe decision follows large-scale procurement of toor dal in north Karnataka, with 2.5 lakh tonnes of the protein-rich grain procured this year  10 times the quantity bought last year through market intervention centres. The necessity to buy rose from the unprecedented production of around 14 lakh tonnes, compared to just 10 lakh tonnes in the State last year.All these years when red gram was bought from farmers, it was auctioned in the open market and it would end up with the same traders who used to buy it from farmers. This would mean that though market intervention schemes helped farmers, they did little to help home-makers. Selling toor through the PDS would make a huge difference to the poor and middle classes, a senior officer from the Food and Civil Supplies Department said.Some challengesHowever, the government faces some challenges. While it has procured red gram, it needs to dehusk it to distribute the toor dal. Secondly, red gram sheds around 25-30% of its weight during dehusking.We are buying 1 kg packets of the dehusked pulse from the National Agricultooral Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED). We have come to an agreement with the cooperative for providing us with 10 months worth of supply, said Harsha Gupta, Secretary of Food and Civil Supplies."

However, it is doubtful whether the aim of bringing 5,000 hectares under Pokkali rice this ensuing season will be realised, said a spokesman for the Samiti recently. He pointed to a recent incident in which around 400 acres of paddy field in Maruvakkadu in Chellanam panchayat was flooded by saline water. A bund preventing the intrusion of saline water was breached and the paddy fields got inundated.It would take about a week to fully recover the original condition, he said about the paddy fields that were actually ploughed and quite ready for the early rains before sowing.Even if the salt water is drained now, the fields will have to receive showers to get rid of the salt content in the soil.The Maruvakkad field was one of the paddy collectives which saw Pokkali cultivation during the last season.However, only about 20 acres came under sawing and only about ten acres were harvested.The Samiti feels that the district administration has to step in and take action immediately to ensure that Pokkali cultivation takes place at least in some of the paddy collectives in the district.The Samiti also wants the responsibility for the breach of the bund fixed."

Chandrasekhar Rao at a recent meeting with them, training would also be given on compiling/uploading data.All the 2,800 AEOs in the State, including the 2,112 newly recruited, would be supplied with Tabs in a phased manner for carrying out the comprehensive farmers survey to have a proper databased on the 55 lakh-strong farming community in the State.RecruitmentThe Minister stated that recruitment of 1,000 more AEOs was already handed over to TSPSC and in addition to that, recruitment of 526 more would be taken up soon to ensure that there is one AEO per every 5,000 acres of agriculture land.The AEOs were also given 2,000 mini soil testing labs to help farmers cultivate crops suitable to their lands.Director General of CGG Rajender Nimje said the objective of the mobile app is to provide all details pertaining to farmers at one place.Agriculture Secretary C. Parthasarathi, Agriculture Commissioner M. Jaganmohan and others participated.Seed melaEarlier in the day, the Minister inaugurated the first seed mela at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University here. As part of the mela, seed of various crop varieties produced and developed by the university, including popular rice varieties Telangana Sona (RNR 15408), Kunaram Sannalu (KNM 118). JGL 18047 and WGL 347, were made available to farmers."

Two months later, his doctor received an approval from a German hospital about his enrolment for a drug trial for leptin hormone deficiency, which was diagnosed as the reason for his excess weight. At the time of his death, Srijit weighed 31.5 kg, equivalent to the average weight of a 10-year-old.I plan to utilise the approval to enrol another baby so that someone else doesnt meet Srijits fate, said bariatric surgeon Dr. Shashank Shah, who practises in Mumbai and Pune.Leptin hormoneSrijit, a resident of Akola, was referred to Dr. Shah when he was three months old and weighed 11 kg. Examinations carried out at the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health in Mumbai revealed that he had leptin hormone deficiency. Known as satiety hormone, leptin helps regulate hunger. But the leptin replacement drug made by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals is under clinical trial and is available only in the U.S., U.K. and Germany.Approval from GermanyWe received a green signal from the U.K. centre after which we made a passport for the baby and the parents. But at the last moment, the pharma company refused permission to give the drug. After that, we began correspondence with the Germany centre, which finally sent an approval on May 9. But by then Srijit was gone, said Dr. Shah, adding that it is time that the government stepped in. We have several children with genetic obesity. If our government tries, we can have these rare drug trials here as well.Srijits distraught parents havent been able to get over his loss. He was the most loved baby in our locality. Every child from the neighbourhood only wanted to play with him, said his father Amol, who works as a helper in a private firm in Akola. His mother has not eaten properly since he has gone. Srijits elder brother does not suffer from such deficiency. His father said his diet is as much as a full grown adult  six chapatis, vegetable, daal and rice  and he still cries with hunger throughout the day.Leptin receptorBariatric surgeon Dr. Mufazzal Lakdawala, known for operating on the worlds heaviest woman, is also in the process of getting approvals to enrol seven morbidly obese children, including three siblings from Gujarat, for a clinical trial on a drug to tackle a mutation of the LEPR gene, also known as the leptin receptor.While leptin deficiency means shortfall of the hormone, leptin receptor deficiency indicates that the patient has the hormone but there is lack of signalling to the brain. The drug for this particular condition is made by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals and so far only three patients are said to be under trial in the U.K. and the U.S. Childhood obesity is a growing problem. We definitely dont want our kids go down in this way and therefore our government has to intervene, said Dr. Lakdawala, adding that corporates should offer help through CSR projects.Dr. Lakdawala said he has sent the samples of his patients to the U.K. for further tests and is coordinating for the trial. It takes time because the pharma companies obviously want to ensure a watertight trial."

Murali KumarTwo-time defending champion Mosinet Geremew will be the man to beat at the TCS World 10k here on Sunday. The 25-year-old Ethiopian is in a rich vein of form, after having won the Yangzhou International Half Marathon in China last month in a time of 60:56.Athletes are strong here, said Geremew when asked why he likes it here in Bengaluru. Its also a good time to run. But I dont like the hot weather.The weather may well put a spanner in the works. In a departure from the past, the Elite mens race will be the last event of the day, starting at 8.50 a.m., nearly an hour and a half later than last year. With the city in the midst of a blistering summer  the heavy rain on Thursday notwithstanding  it remains to be seen how adverse its effect will be.It is scaring the hell out of me, said New Zealands Zane Robertson with a laugh. I went for a run at 5.30 a.m. and it was hot. But I have been training in the desert for this race. I have prepared with the aim of breaking the course record (27:44) here.The 27-year-old, who trains in Kenya, ran the fastest 10km time in the world last year, clocking 27:28 in Berlin and is one of the contenders here.Geremew was once his training partner. So was 10k World Record-holder Leonard Komon, the other big name in the fray.Kenyas Komon, who set the record of 26:44 way back in 2010, has endured more than his fair share of injuries.But after having finished a strong 12th at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in March, he hoped this year would be his best year.Cheptai the biggest drawIn the womens field, the 2016 winner Peres Jepchirchir isnt returning, but the reigning womens world cross country champion, Kenyas Irene Cheptai, will be the biggest draw. Compatriot Gladys Chesir, the fastest woman in the field with a personal best of 30:41, would hope for better luck after a heat stroke cut short her challenge for second spot with roughly a kilometre to go in the last edition.Competition is also expected from former champions Helah Kiprop (2012) and Wude Yimer (2010), who finished second and third respectively in 2016.The Indian Elite field will, however, wear a depleted look. Defending champions G. Lakshmanan and Swati Gadhave are both missing, because of the Federation Cup athletics championships, which will start in ten days time and serve as the selection trials for the Asian Championship in Bhubaneswar in July.So are M.D. Yunus, winner of the 2016 Kolkata 25K, and Monica Athare, the Half Marathon champion at the 2017 Standard Chartered Mumbai Marathon."

593ce3177be9e017f792e296,Two Dalit weddings reveal Saharanpur’s human tragedy,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/meerut/two-dalit-weddings-reveal-saharanpurs-human-tragedy/articleshow/58849573.cms,2017-05-26,"SHABBIRPUR (WEST UP): The first wedding took place three weeks ago; the second will be solemnised on Friday. And yet, in different ways, everybody involved in these two Dalit weddings has been scarred by the May 5 inter-caste violence, a permanent black mark for this Thakur-majority village in west UP, that has since spilled to other parts of Saharanpur district.First, the story of the wedding that's yet to happen: it's actually two weddings rolled in one. Daily wager Faqirchand 's two daughters, Preeti and Manisha, are getting married the same day. But anxiety, not elation, is the primary feeling of the two brides-to-be.""Dar lagta hai kahin phir se jhagda na ho aur nuksan jo jaye (I worry that there might be another quarrel and more loss),"" says Preeti, 22, who stopped going to school after class VIII.Dozens of Dalit homes were torched and belongings destroyed after simmering tension between Dalits and Thakurs spiralled out of control.A Thakur from a nearby village died in the violence. Close to Faqirchand lives Dal Singh, another Dalit daily wager, with his family.On May 4, less than a day before Shabbirpur's darkest day, his brother's son had been married. A number of guests were yet to leave when the attack took place. ""I kept pleading with them to spare us but they were relentless,"" says his wife Kamla . The sutures below her right eye are still visible.By the time the marauders  some armed with swords, according to eye witnesses  left, the house was history. The roof made of iron, wood and mud was brought crashing down and torched.Even the iron beams were twisted by the heat. Singh and his two sons, as well as many Dalits in this village, work as daily wagers and earn about Rs 250-300 per day.Over the years, Singh's family had saved some money and bought items of comfort. When the two sons were married, wedding gifts added to their list of possessions.The Singhs had a fan, a cooler, an almirah and two colour TVs among other comforts. There were four motorcyles parked at home that day; three of these belonged to wedding guests. Everything was charred. Since the floor was uncemented, some of the items lie burnt and submerged under the fallen roof.""This happens whenever a poor person climbs up the ladder. The rich bring him down,"" says Singh.He is angry, not philosophical. Wedding preparations have begun at Faqir chand's home. There are no signs of merriment, though. The halwai's huge cauldrons have arrived. Among the items rented are 30 chairs and a flashy gold colour sofa partly shaped like a throne. The glitzy sofa, kept in Faqirchand's brother's house at stone's throw, looks like a piece out of Dali's surreal artwork. Especially since everything else in the room - furniture, clothes, other items - are burnt black. Faqirchand, father of the would-be brides, looked worried as he spoke with the freshly-transferred district officials who'd come calling to the village on Thursday. He was assured of safety. But he's taking no chances. The wedding gifts he has offered to his sons-in-law include a motorbike each.""These have already been sent to their villages,"" he said. Suddenly, Dal Singh and his family have joined the ranks of homeless. He has received five kg of rice and another five kg of wheat as relief from the administration. His wife Kamala produces something from the remnants of a pot. Asked what's it, she says, ""It's the mangalsutra of one of the bahus."""
593ce5007be9e017f792e574,"When life gives you a lemon, farm it",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/when-life-gives-you-a-lemon-farm-it/articleshow/58865697.cms,2017-05-27,"Conventional wisdom of most Indian farmers and farm advisers is that over a large area it is suicidal to do organic farming. V Antonisamy, a 74-year-old farmer in Puliyangudi in southern Tamil Nadu, has disproved this by carrying out organic farming in more than 200 acres for more than three decades.With a strong dislike for studies, he cut his teeth on agricultural and horticultural activities on a four acre ancestral property at the age of 14.Like all farmers, he made money using chemical fertilizers that made their entry to the country in the 1950s. But by 1972, yield started to drop. In 1983, Antonisamy had a 150acre farm, but business was unsustainable. ""Crop would grow, but yield was low. Organic carbon content in the soil dropped to 0.8%. Worse, I fell sick and was bedridden for two years and my right hand was paralysed,"" said Antonisamy. To make up for the losses, he shifted to goat farming, but debts kept mounting. In 1988, banks put his 150 acres under the hammer to recover Rs 15 lakh loan with interest, which they claimed had scaled to Rs 53 lakh.A legal battle ensued. The crisis made him think about where he had gone wrong. In 1987, following Subhash Palekar 's method, he gave up chemical fertilizers and pesticides and shifted to 100% organic farming.The results were encouraging. It emboldened him and reassured the banks and the tribunal that he was on the way to recovery. ""My land became fertile and spring returned to my life by 1992. With the increase in the yield, my health too improved. The tribunal waived the penal interest and I repaid Rs 28 lakh and became debt-free in 1996,"" he said.On the field, Antonisamy continued challenging set practices. Usually, farmers replant sugarcane every two to three years to prevent drop in yield, but Antonisamy has not replanted the crop in the past 25 years, yet his field churns out 60 tonnes of cane per acre, against the national average of 30 tonnes.Sustaining organic farming during initial hiccups was the key to success, he said. ""Organic farmers should not bother about pests. When one pest strikes, another will emerge to prey on it. It also increases immunity of plants,"" he said. He maintains 150 cows of indigenous breed to make organic manure, but does not sell milk. Rainwater harvesting has helped him manage drought.Except for paddy, he practises drip irrigation and fertigation to make optimum use of water. In India, the average water requirement for producing one kg of sugar is 28,000 litres, but his farm consumes only 1,800 litres per kg of sugar. By 2000, the feisty farmer had 300 acres, cultivating lemon on 100 acres, sugarcane covering 15 acres, mango on 40 acres, and paddy and coconut on 30 acres each. Antonisamy would also qualify for high level of car bon credit for growing trees on about 85 acres.He spends only on die sel, power, labour and le guminous plant seeds, for nitrogen fixation. Annually, he buys Rs 2 lakh worth of leguminous plant seeds.""We grow everything we require on the land. No MNC has been able to extract a penny from me in the past 30 years.Back in 1982-83, I spent `33 lakh on fertilizer and pesticides. An average Indian consumes 300ppm pesticides, but my farm is 100% pesticide free (pulls out lab reports to substantiate the claim). My family does not buy any medicine,"" he said.Lemon is his mainstay, fetching him a clear profit of Rs 2 crore a year. When other lemon farmers get 1,000-2,000 fruits per plant per year, his farm yields 5,000-6,000 fruits per plant. His plants bear fruits in clusters of three to four. Being organic, they have a longer shelf life and yield more juice.Value addition is key to his success. He does not sell cane to sugar mills. Instead, he converts it into jaggery and sells it under Anto's brand. Rice is beaten rice flakes. India can turn a super power just through agricultural and horticultural farming. ""But to achieve it, we need to go organic and convert every produce into branded product,"" he said."

The Centre also said that states have promised to install digital payment system at ration shops by June. Under the food law, over 80 crore people get 5 kg wheat or rice per person per month at Rs 2-3 per kg costing exchequer Rs 1.4 lakh crore annually.Watch What Else Is Making NewsIn order to promote digital transactions and less cash economy post demonetisation, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan today held a national conference of state food ministers and secretaries on PDS Reforms and Cashless/Less-Cash Environment.At present, nearly 29,000 fair price shops have the cashless facility out of 5.27 lakh ration shops. We are happy to share that many states will have 100 per cent cashless system in rations shops by March, Paswan told reporters here.Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Maharashtra are the states that have committed to adopt digital payment system in their ration shops by March, he said.Most of the states will have digital payment system by June, he said, adding that Bihar and Uttarakhand have promised to install cashless system by July while Andaman & Nicobar and J&K by end of this year.Even West Bengal, which has been critical of the demonetisation move, has agreed to go cashless by June. Paswan said the beneficiaries would continue to have the option of payment through cash.The minister said that end-to-end computerisation of the PDS system and cashless transaction at ration shops would help check corruption and promote transparency in Public Distribution System.With some states raising the issue of banking transaction cost for electronic payments, Paswan said he would hold discussion with the Finance Minister on waiver of such costs, which at present are free till March.Food Secretary Preeti Sudan said the government is moving towards making Aadhaar essential but not mandatory and added that a notification in this regard would be issued.Stating that there is a fine line between essential and mandatory, she said: let me work with the nuances.However, she asserted that beneficiaries would never be denied their entitlement under the food law. So far, 72 per cent of ration cards have been seeded with Aadhaar Cards. There are 23 crore ration cards, of which about 16.62 crore have been seeded.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo by Arul HorizonCONDITIONS are favourable for the onset of monsoon in Pune in the next 2-3 days. The South-West monsoon has already arrived in Maharashtra with heavy rainfall reported from Mumbai and Konkan areas in the last few days.The progress of monsoon has been satisfactory with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) upgrading its earlier forecast. As of Saturday afternoon, the northern limit of monsoon passed through Harnai, Kolhapur, Gadag, Anantapur and some other places in the northeastern part of the country.After its arrival in the Konkan coast, the monsoon has progressed in some parts of Madhya Maharashtra, interior Karnataka. IMD said the conditions are favorable for progress of monsoon into more parts of Madhya Maharashtra, interior Karnataka, remaining parts of Rayalaseema, etc.As of June 9, the country has received 16 per cent surplus rain with the cumulative rain recorded by the IMD standing at 37 mm as against the normal of 31.9 mm rain. Arriving before time, the rainfall across the country has been above average since the start of the season.Predictions of a good monsoon has buoyed the hope of a good harvest. Mahesh Palawant, meteorologist with the private forecaster Skymet, said the conditions are favourable for advancement of the monsoon in Pune in the next 24-48 hours.Already Konkan and Mumbai have been receiving heavy rain and that is partly because of the cyclonic circulation near the Gujarat coast, he said. Palawant said strong westerlies will also help in set up of the monsoon. While Pune is yet to see monsoon rain, cloudy skies have given relief to residents from the scorching heat of May.Few areas of Pune have received occasional showers but heavy rainfall remains eluded from the city till date. In view of the onset of monsoon, the Agrimet department of the IMD has issued sowing advisories for rice in Konkan and Kolhapur.

Noting that scientists have said such a thing is not possible, he said, adulteration I can understand, but plastic we are hearing for the first time.Karnataka Health Minister Ramesh Kumar on Friday said reports about plastic rice and sugar being sold, including under public distribution system, will be thoroughly investigated. Replying to a question in the legislative assembly, the minister expressed doubts about the reports of the items being sold and sought time till Monday to find out facts behind it.Raising the issue during the Zero Hour, Opposition BJP leader Jagdish Shettar said there are reports about plastic rice being found in what is being distributed under PDS and governments popular Anna Bhagya scheme, and demanded a thorough inquiry and action in this regard. Shettar said such reports, even if it is a rumour, would cause panic among the public as these items are consumed every day. He said the government should soon get them tested and inform people about the genuineness of such reports.Responding, Ramesh Kumar said the government has come to know about such incidents from the media and officials have been asked to look into them. Noting that scientists have said such a thing is not possible, he said, adulteration I can understand, but plastic we are hearing for the first time. It is also costly, so why will anyone do it, he questioned.Stating that he will not take the risk of rejecting the reports straightaway as false, the minister said the government will get things examined. He said by Monday I will get hold of the information and will report it to the House. We will also conduct a thorough inquiry on the possibility of plastic and reasons behind it. The minister said the government will also look into whether the reports are based on mere gossips that had been floated by someone with wrong intentions.Intervening, Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said the presence of plastic rice was not possible in the rice supplied under governments Anna Bhagya scheme, as rice for this purpose is being procured from Food Corporation of India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A sales ban has exacerbated losses, as the military fears profits are funding insurgent activities.In recent weeks, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) donated 30 tonnes of early-maturing, pestresistant seeds to Borno's farmers.But IITA coordinator Kamai Nkike said three consecutive rainy seasons have been missed and the current season, which began two weeks ago, is also likely to pass without crops being planted.""Farming in northern Borno at the moment is practically impossible,"" said Nkike. ""The farmers want to be on their own.They are not happy with food aid."""

On April 18, the U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wrote to Congress  in the quarterly review Congress requires of the July 2015 international nuclear deal  that Iran continues to comply with the deal, but in the same letter he called Iran a leading state sponsor of terror. A day later, the Secretary of Defense, James Mattis, who has long been very hostile to Iran, accused it of attempting to destabilise yet another country, meaning Yemen. Two months earlier, on February 4, Mr. Mattis had responded to Irans late-January test of a ballistic missile by calling it the worlds single biggest state sponsor of terrorism. On April 12, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said in a Security Council briefing on Syria, Iran is [Bashar al-]Assads chief accomplice in the regimes horrific acts.Second, Washingtons major regional allies, Israel and Saudi Arabia, have been no less hostile. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Irans aggression must not go unanswered. Following exchanges with Riyadh, the White House has said the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have agreed to address what the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control, in a statement imposing several sanctions on businesses and individuals for Iranian links, calls Irans destabilising activities in the region.Third, Mr. Trumps own statements that he could consider committing U.S. troops abroad have been accompanied by an unprecedented $54 billion increase in the defence budget, despite the Presidents frequent pre-election denunciations of what he called excessively high defence spending.Indias Iran relationshipAll this is highly significant for India. In October 2016, Iran was Indias largest supplier of crude oil, with its exports to India exceeding the overall largest supplier Saudi Arabias exports of 697,000 barrels per day (bpd) by over 10%. As the U.S. federal body Energy Information Administration notes, India is also funnelling Iranian oil into its expanding strategic petroleum reserves (SPR), with a view to holding 90 days supply against contingencies. Crucially, Tehran has consistently offered New Delhi very favourable terms, including non-dollar oil sales and other commercial attractions.Oil is of course only one commodity in a long-standing Indo-Iranian trade relationship; Iran buys basmati rice and sugar from India, as well as various agrochemicals and petroleum products. Substantial expansions in the volume of business are also likely, despite earlier tensions over delayed Indian payments for oil. The Indian government has, furthermore, taken steps to reassure Indian insurers in the public and private sectors, as well as banks, over the risks they might take in handling Iranian money while the U.S. sanctions regime remains in force.In addition, India and Iran have reached agreement on the expansion of several industrial facilities at the port of Chabahar; the work is to be undertaken mainly by Indian entities. Another substantial deal is the one under preparation for India to have operating rights in the Farzad B gas field, which lies within Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf.ConsequencesThe prospect of a more aggressive U.S. attitude on Iran, if not stronger sanctions against Tehran, will almost certainly make the Government of India very uncomfortable, with the attitudes taken by Israel and Saudi Arabia no doubt exacerbating New Delhis predicament. It may help India that within the U.S. and Israel, moderating factors  both commercial and military  obtain. In 2012, the then Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, stated that attacking Iran would only delay Irans development of a nuclear weapon and not stop it. At that time too, the former head of Israels intelligence service Mossad, Meir Dagan (now deceased), said that a pre-emptive attack on Iran was the stupidest idea he had ever heard.Among the commercial agreements which have followed the Iran nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the European Union), is a 10-year, $16.6-billion contract for the aerospace giant Boeing to supply Iran Air with 80 passenger aircraft. Quite apart from Boeings competition with the EU manufacturer Airbus, any attack on Iran could put about 1,00,000 U.S. jobs at risk.Perhaps as a result, the Trump administration, despite its bellicose rhetoric, is showing some signs of moderation in all this. For example, the sanctions announced since the recent Iranian missile test amount to no more than the implementation of measures already prepared by the Obama White House. It is, nevertheless, virtually certain that Tel Aviv and Riyadh will maintain what pressure they can on Washington by continuing to be vituperatively anti-Iranian, at least in public. Whether or not the U.S. allows the exchange of rhetoric to escalate may well depend on whose advice is decisive, even though on the evidence Iran is not a clear and present threat.For India, a further point is that while previous U.S. administrations exempted India from certain sanctions over Indias continuing oil deal with Iran, the Trump administration may see the matter differently. One saving grace may be that no matter what Mr. Trumps main regional allies tell him or want him to do, they cannot predict what he will actually do.Arvind Sivaramakrishnan is an Adjunct Professor, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Madras"

A sum of Rs. 33 crore had been set aside for this.It had been estimated that the State had lost 36,891,22 hectares of paddy due to severe drought.The shortage of rain has increased the acidity of the soil which, in turn, affected farming adversely.In a reply to C.

This area was used to sell everything, from pulses to gold, and even small arms and ammunition.Walkers will visit AKTKM rice merchants and Chungath Spice traders and interact with proprietors of these shops.Members of Bhatkali, Bohra, Gujarati and Jain communities will share their contributions in trade with the walkers. The lore of Kammali Mooppans, the unsung foot soldiers who lugged heavy loads on their heads much before the advent of trucks and other motorised carriers will be narrated.Puzhavakkathu Palli, Jain Temple, Muthakkara Palli, Shree Balkrishna Lalji Temple and other places of worship peacefully co-exist around Valiayangadi, making it a secular place.Bylanes like Gunny Street, Bhatkal Lane and Halwa Bazar also contributed to the main trade at Valiyangadi. The team will visit a house in Gujarati Street.The introduction of railways in 1888 gave a fillip to trade at Valiyangadi initially. The rail line sliced through the Valiyangadi super market, derailing the traditional maritime trade in the port city, and that even killed a nearby river. The walk will culminate at the Kozhikode Railway Station, recalling interesting anecdotes connected to the arrival of railways."

While the situation in the Maoist-hit district is slowly improving, its district headquarters mirroring a well-kept small town and Maoist influence being largely pushed into the jungles of Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, senior police officers still identify Katekalyan as a problem area.Yet, Katekalyan has quietly been building another identity  as the nursery of organic farming mushrooming across the district, where farmers have come together to set up a company to market their produce across the country.Gonelu Ram is one such farmer. It isnt paddy season yet, so the crop is assorted  tomatoes, peas, chana and mustard. Standing in front of his lush green fields, he beams as he reels off their names, and then adds an important note. All this is completely organic. The fertlisers I use are what nature gives Cow urine, neem leaves, bitter gourd leaves and besharam patta. My produce has never been better before 90 per cent of Katekalyan has now returned to completely organic farming, he says.Watch What Else is Making NewsTill about five years ago, Ram, like most other farmers across Dantewada district, was caught in a dilemma. Organic fertilisers and indigenous seeds were part of the knowledge passed down to farmers for generations, but the administration, looking at agriculture as a way of reaching out to people in a conflict zone, was sending a different message. The crops that were pushed were homogenous high-yielding varieties that worked best with chemical fertilisers.These high-yielding seeds and the fertilisers were not suited for the microclimate. There was good yield for a while, but the soil soon became unresponsive and it killed the ecosystem around it. There were no fish in the ponds or earthworms in the ground. Now, the district administration is returning to organic methods, and wants to make Dantewada a completely organic farming district, says Akash Badave, who was a PMRDF fellow in Dantewada and has since been working on agricultural improvement in the district.The Indira Gandhi National Agricultural University records 22,000 different varieties of rice found in the state, most unique to it. And Dantewada is no different. Badave says that while no exhaustive study has been done so far, a 10-village sample survey revealed 35 different varieties of rice, with differences in gestation of crop ranging from 60 days to six months.The most important thing is that these communities have known these varieties for a generation, and each has different properties. There are many types of rice that have medicinal qualities, some that are given to lactating mothers, others for joint pain. Then there are millets such as Kosa, which are in high demand elsewhere but are unique to Bastar, he says.The return to traditional farming, with a few tweaks, began during the kharif crop of 2013. The district administration began the process of teaching farmers systems of rice intensification, which included tips like ensuring space between two stalks.The method was used to show that despite no use of fertilisers or high-yielding seeds, productivity could still be high. In 2013, 300 farmers adopted it, and their produce increased three to four times. Now, there are over 2,000 farmers, and 170 small groups of farmers have been formed to go around the district and tell others about the benefits of organic indigenous farming. Its a peer review system, with these groups looking at fields and certifying whether the produce is organic or not, says a senior government official.Those involved in the process realised that the system wouldnt work if there was no market to sell to. So, on August 26, 2016, the Bhumgadhi Organic Farmers Company Limited was set up to package and sell the unique Bastar produce across the country. It has since expanded to include 370 farmers. Each farmer pays Rs 1,000 to buy a share in the company, which in turn buys organic produce and uses state-aided technology to improve the seeds. In the next month or so, district officials plan to procure a processing unit with storage godowns.The administration is incurring some expenditure, but there will be no interest, and the money only has to be paid back in 10 years, by which time the company will have grown. The term Bhumgadhi, fittingly, means the post-harvest festival of prosperity, says Badave, who is the CEO of the company.Dantewada District Collector Saurabh Kumar says they are in touch with buyers from across the country. We are in talks to sell our produce in stores all over the country, such as Udaipur, Chandigarh, and especially in South India where the demand for our produce is very high. We are attempting to fill the vacuum of an available market, he says.A few kilometres short of Katekalyan, on the road from the district headquarters of Dantewada, some residents of Gatam village sit and listen intently to a small team that talks about the producers company. Eighty-six of them belong to an extended family, and they laugh when they are asked to confirm that number. All of us are related, one way or another, and live in one part of Madkampara village, says one of them.But the large family isnt the only thing that is striking. Amid a large swathe of brown, their fields are glistening green. Three big containers are filled with organic fertilisers, made from the waste after the droppings from the mahua tree are converted into local alcohol.Asked if they will be a part of the farmers company, one of them answers: Kucch accha ho raha hai Karenge, hum karenge (Something good is happening we will take part).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Source: Debabrata Mohanty House of Siba Bhatra, the farmer who committed suicide. Source: Debabrata MohantyON MARCH 3, a physically challenged tribal farmer, Siba Bhatra of Sanamasigaon village in Odishas Nabarangpur, had lunch at home just after noon and walked towards his paddy field about half a kilometre away. Sibas wife Sanadi was away attending the marriage function of her nephew in another village, while his father Banamali was at home.Around 3 pm, two neighbours saw Siba lying unconscious near a cashew tree next to his field with a 100-ml bottle of Lethal Super pesticide lying beside him. After undergoing treatment for four days, Siba, 47, a father of two sons and two daughters, died in the Nabarangpur district headquarter hospital on March 7.With Sibas wife and residents of the village claiming that he was stressed over his inability to provide for his family, the death has once again highlighted concerns over farmers suicides in one of Indias poorest districts.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe death comes more than a year after five farmers committed suicide within a span of 30 days between October and November 2015 in this southern Odisha district. And, it follows two more deaths of farmers in Odisha this month, including one in Chief Minister Naveen Patnaiks Ganjam district.On Saturday, T Bulu Reddy of Chikarada village in the Golanthara block of Ganjam consumed poison after untimely rains destroyed his tomato and chilli crops, said officials. Reddy, who had taken a loan of Rs 1 lakh for farming and Rs 1.5 lakh for the treatment of his ill son, consumed poison on the night of March 10, they said.Days earlier, another farmer Khainu Bagarti, 55, consumed poison in Kendapalli of Bargarh district in the west, after his crop of chilli, cauliflower and other vegetables failed due to lack of water, said his family. The government has directed the district collector to conduct a field investigation.Nabarangpur is the focus of an ongoing assignment by The Indian Express, titled District Zero, in a zone ranked at the bottom rung of the development ladder based on several indicators, such as literacy and healthcare.Nabarangpur tehsildar Akshay Khemundu acknowledged that Siba had taken loans worth over Rs 48,000 for his farming needs over the last four years, but cited an inquiry report prepared by local officials to argue that this may not have been the reason for the suspected suicide. And officials said that compared with 2015, when Nabarangpur suffered a drought, 2016 was a good year for farmers.He had taken a loan of Rs 35,000 in 2013 from the Sanamasigaon branch of Utkal Grameen Bank, of which he paid one instalment. Similarly, he took a loan of Rs 13,150 from LAMPCS (Large Scale Adivasi Multi-purpose Cooperative Societies) in 2014, but had not paid any instalment. He was never issued any notice either by the bank or the cooperative society, said Khemundu.There are also murmurs in Sanamasigaon about domestic discord in Sibas home, which Sanadi denied. He rarely spoke and never fought with me But he used to drink a lot, said Sanadi.Nilambar Satpathy, managing director, LAMPCS, Nabarangpur, said Siba had taken a loan of Rs 13,150 in July 2014 for farming, including Rs 4,650 for fertiliser, at an annual interest rate of two per cent. The same was to be repaid in one single instalment at the end of one year, failing which the interest rate would mount to 12 per cent. Bhatra had not paid any money till the end of July 2015, said Satpathy.The branch manager of the Utkal Grameen Bank did not respond to The Indian Expresss request for comment.Sanadi said she did not know the details of her husbands financial condition, except that he got Rs 3,600 as disability allowance every year. But it was difficult for the family to earn even Rs 100 a day, she said.Though struck with polio, which had affected both his legs since childhood, Siba used to till his share of land with the help of neighbours.Sanadi has an Antyodaya card through which the family gets 35 kg of rice at Re 1 a kg every month. But it was barely enough for the family. My husband and I used to work as agricultural labourers or household workers in others homes or fields, she said.Sanadi said poverty forced their two sons Gopal, 15, and Dhanurjay, 8, to drop out of school while one daughter Urmila works as a help in a schoolteachers home in Berhampur town. Kaushalya, the second daughter, is the only one in the Bhatra household still in school and now studies in Class VII.Officials said the government has given Rs 15,000 as ex-gratia assistance to the family from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund and District Red Cross fund. They also insisted that the death could not be attributed to crop failure, as there was no standing crop in his field.But Sibas death continues to haunt Sanamasigaon. No one saw him buy the pesticide. There is no pesticide shop in our village. He must have bought it from Nabarangpur town, said his neighbour Banamali Bhatra. As his wife was away, I served him lunch. He had his food quietly and left, said Sibas sister-in-law Kusuma Bhatra.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

Clearly there is one outlier that needs to be addressed and that is China, Nisha Desai Biswal, Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, told PTI in an interview.The US statement comes a week ahead of the Obama Administration passing on the baton to the Trump Administration.Officials say it is because of the Chinese resistance that India could not become a member of NSG, where all decisions are taken on the basis of consensus.The (US) President (Barack Obama) has been very clear and unequivocal that he believes that India has met the criteria for NSG and that the United States supports Indias entry that India is ready and India should be brought into the NSG, she said.We worked very closely with India to support Indias application into the NSG, but we also recognise that there continue to be some concerns, some reservations that some of the members of the NSG have expressed that need to be worked through, she said.We believe we have made substantial progress on that and as we hand the baton over to the next administration the path forward will be found for that. Clearly there is one outlier that needs to be addressed and that is China. As we move through all the other elements of the NSG membership, I think, were on a good path forward, Biswal said.So what remains is to be able to have a very clear understanding on what is the basis of Chinas reservations and to try to work through those. So that will be something that would move on to the next administration to carry forward, she said in response to a question.But this is something that the President himself has personally engaged on, the Secretary (of State), (National Security Advisor), Ambassador (Susan) Rice and down the line this has been an area of intense effort by this administration, Biswal said.While India not becoming a NSG member is disappointing, Biswal said the Obama Administration is very very gratified to see Indias entry into the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).China is advocating a two-step non-discriminatory approach for admission of countries who have not signed nuclear-Non Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in the NSG.As per the new stand announced by Beijing in November, it first wants to find a solution that is applicable to the admission of all non-NPT members followed by discussions to admit specific non-NPT member.Chinas stand for a non-discriminatory criteria is regarded significant as Pakistan, a close ally of Beijing too has applied for the NSG membership along with India.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul Horizon Ansari at work at his bakery near the Pune Railway Station. For three hours a day, he also works at another bakery. Express Photo by Arul HorizonHe was 11 when he ran away from home in Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh along with his elder brother. The year must have been 1997 or 1998, he doesnt remember exactly. The siblings came to Pune and found employment at Imperial Bakery  one of the biggest bakers in the city at the time  and started working as helps at a salary of Rs 300 a month.It was a novelty for me this whole bakery business. I had never seen the inside of a bakery before. This one was huge. They used to process 300 gunny bags full of flour everyday. I found to my surprise that I had a talent for baking, for handling the dough. And from the second month itself, my salary increased to Rs 350. The owner, Parsee, was impressed, says Tabaraq Ansari, around 32 and a father of four.Ansari is a khameer baker  he makes pav, doughnuts, breads, buns, and toasts. I dont know anything about biscuits or cookies. We have another cook for them, he adds.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAs per an estimate of those in the business, Pune and its outskirts have over 1,500 bakeries. Almost all those working as cooks and helpers here are migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and areas around Delhi. Ansari estimates that he has worked in over a dozen bakeries in Pune since landing here two decades ago.On December 30, six people suffocated to death at Punes Bakes N Cakes bakery in Kondhwa as the two exits were locked from outside. All six, who were in their 20s and all from Uttar Pradesh, were sleeping in the loft. Of them, one was visiting his brother employed at the factory.Ansari says that almost all bakeries, depending on their size, employ four to eight people who, without exception, stay and sleep on the premises.While its the responsibility of the Labour Commissioner, which grants operating licences to business establishments, to check the working conditions, Ansari cant recall a single instance when any official  from the Labour or any other department  visited any of the bakeries where he has worked. Even after the Kondhwa incident, no checks have been announced.The bakery that currently employs Ansari, for Rs 240 per day, is among the busiest in the area if not the biggest. As its close to the Pune Railway Station, its open for business day and night. The shop is on the ground floor while baking is done on the first floor. The space in the large kitchen is almost completely occupied by stacks of greasy black baking trays, and imposing bakery equipment such as moulders, mixers and ovens.Its in between these trays, or on the kitchen platform, even on the exhaust hood, that Ansari and the seven other workers sleep. Those sleeping on the floor use mattresses, others blankets or bedsheets. We use whatever is provided by the owner, says a young worker.As the staff work in shifts, at any given time, half of them sleep as the other half work around them. Two others and I work from 11 in the night till dawn, and go to sleep around 7 am. Another cook takes over in the morning, says Ansari.His day begins around 10.30 am, when he gets up and freshens himself in the dingy toilet on the ground floor that the bakery staff share with workers of a neighbouring hotel, which is also run by the bakery owner. There is no power in the toilet and bathroom block  a kuchcha structure and dark even at noon  and no water. The staff carry water in buckets from outside.The workers of the hotel sleep not far from the toilet. They dont mind the darkness, they say; it helps them sleep after their late-night hours.After freshening up, Ansari and the others who have worked at night head for tea and breakfast to a hawker outside. The lunch and dinner they cook themselves, in the hotels kitchen.Ansaris first shift lasts from 11 am to 3 pm, when the manager gives him a list of the items that need to be replenished in the shop below, and he starts work on them.After lunch, around 4 pm, Ansari cleans himself up and steps across the road to another, much smaller, bakery. He works there for the next three hours, earning Rs 150. Given the low wages, he says, he needs every penny.Ansari says his employer doesnt object. Most of us work at other bakeries. The owners dont say anything as they can silence us whenever we complain with, But we let you work at the other place too.After returning, Ansari has the food, mostly rice and daal, which is cooked by the bakery staff in turns. He lies down now in a corner of the bakery to catch some sleep.Its at 11 pm that his main work shift begins. For the next six hours, he makes buns, bread and other products to make sure there is enough maal (consignment) for sale till the next evening. He has to meet the demand slip that he got from the manager earlier in the day.Ansaris village lies about 50 km north of Gorakhpur. He and his brother, two years older, left home after some trouble in the family, he says. Neither had ever been to a school; with six children, their farm labourer father struggled to keep the family afloat. Few children in the village ever studied, Ansari adds, with most boys just waiting it out till it was time for them to leave for Pune or Mumbai to earn a living like the elders.By the time Ansari and his brother made their first visit back to the village 17 months after leaving it, Pune was home.This is how it is for most of us from UP who work here, be it in the bakery or the catering line, Ansari says. If you are unmarried, you visit once in 16-18 months. If you are married, you go once in four months.On his second visit home, when he was 16, Ansari got married. He was earning Rs 600 a month at the time. Humaare yehan shaadi jaldi hoti hai. Tab bhi, aur abhi bhi (Marriages happen early among us. It was the same then, and now), says Ansari.His brother worked with him at a bakery for the first two years. After that, he returned home and sat around doing nothing. Later, he left for Saudi Arabia and started working there, Ansari says.The 32-year-old fears there is no future for bakers like him who dont know modern baking techniques or about the exotic breads and cakes that have captured the market. He also feels bakeries now rely more and more on machines than on men with knowledge.I get Rs 240 a day despite my experience. Also, theres no job security. As long as the owner likes the taste, its alright. If I go wrong somewhere, he will sack me, and the next day Ill be on the road, he says.He also complains that the youth now are not willing to learn. They work for a month, collect their salaries, and the next day, disappear. The manager has to then go hunting for fresh boys, says Ansari, who has to train the new staff at his bakery.Ansari often visits his village, where his four children and wife stay with his elder brothers family. While his eldest child is 16 years old, the youngest is nine. Whenever I get bored, I go home and stay there as long as I want, says Ansari.He is determined though to ensure that all his children study, he says. I want my daughter and three sons to have a proper education. As a parent, that is my responsibility. Although we cant control what they will get in life  its destiny  its our duty to try help them secure a good future.His family has never been to Pune, and he has never thought of bringing them here. Its beyond my capacity. If I stay alone, I can do some adjustment, live in cheap places, save as much as I can and send home. If I bring them here, I will have to borrow money just to meet the daily needs, he says.The December fire that killed six bakery workers doesnt worry him too much, Ansari adds. It was a one-off incident, and death can catch you anywhere, he shrugs. That was their fate. If you are destined to die, you can die walking on the road or sitting in an AC office. I havent seen many accidents in my 20 years in this business.Since their bakery is open round the clock, it is never locked, unlike in the case of the six who died.Well past midnight, half the bakery staff start preparing to retire for the day. As the trays bang around them, the dough moulders thunder on, the staff still at work shout over the machine hum, and in a corner, a dough lump is slammed against a stone top, the tired workers dont stir.No burn marks were found on the six who died in the bakery fire, police found. They suffocated to death, in sleep.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Many times, pigeons, sparrows and even bats find shelter inside temples, churches and mosques.Aluminium meshes installed in openings on the nine Gopurams (towers) of the Arunachaleswarar temple in Tiruvannamalai seem to have stirred up a controversy with a section of devotees objecting to it saying pigeons and bats are unable to stay in the temple towers.Tiruvannamalai resident and animal lover M. Raghavan said a group of persons had submitted a petition to the District Collector asking him to instruct the temple officials to remove the meshes. In the evenings, hundreds of birds would usually be seen near the g opurams but now we only see a lot their feathers and wings near Vengikaal where many rice mills are located. We can only conclude that the birds are being caught in large numbers in that area, he said.Agriculture student and devotee J. Neelakantan said cleaning of droppings was an issue and the temple authorities could ask any of the devotee groups to do it. Temple gopurams are places where birds have been living for hundreds of years. We dont talk about the pollution that is created by thousands of humans coming for the monthly girivalam [circumambulation] around the Arunachala hill here, he complained.A former official of the Archaeological Survey of India, which protects monuments said that it was a regular practice to install such meshes in temples so as to not permit the entry of bats. There must not be any concrete or brick structure blocking the flow of wind across the towers, he said.Sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments explained that old damaged iron meshes were only replaced during the temples Kumbabhishekam in February this year with aluminium ones. After these new meshes were installed, the monkey menace has come down by 90%. Monkeys used to jump down from the Gopurams scaring devotees. The bat and bird droppings only speeded up the process of the wooden beams and rafters inside the g opurams rotting, the official said. The birds have been provided space and they do continue to sit on the g opurams. During the temple renovation, we found a 12-feet-long snake in one of the towers and it had devoured many birds and their eggs, he said."

Kailash Murthy and his wife Brahamaramba at their solar-powered rice and millet processing unit near Mysuru; (inset) solar panels that generate 30 kV power.M.A. SRIRAMStretching the concept of natural farming by a step, a progressive farmer in Mysuru has established a rice and millet processing unit energised by solar power on the outskirts of the city.Reckoned to be the first of its kind, it reduces carbon footprint and does away with consumption of energy generated through conventional norms like thermal power that entails burning coal.For M.K. Kailash Murthy, who took to natural farming nearly two decades ago, establishing a rice mill energised by solar power was a long cherished dream.Entirely eco-friendlyI thought about it for a long time. I cultivate paddy through natural means and on distribution to the public it enters the rice processing mill where it is processed. But, the electricity fuelling the mills were conventional. I wanted the last step  processing the paddy before distribution  to be eco-friendly too to make the produce fully natural, he explained.He sold his property in Mysuru city and used the funds to establish the processing unit with 95 solar panels that generate 30 kV power.I invested Rs. 22 lakh on the rice processing unit in Varuna on the road to T. Narsipura, Mr. Murthy said.Being an experiment, he was dissuaded from investing the huge amount on his green dreams by well-wishers. But, my wife Brahamaramba reposed confidence in my venture and backed me, he said, crediting her for the successful completion of the project.Not only is the process of rice cultivation natural, but even processing is through natural energy.Besides the high nutrition content, the rice is less polished than what is generally sold in the market, Mr. Murthy said.Source of inspirationA bank officer, Mr. Murthy plunged into farming after retirement. He was inspired by Masanobu Fukuokas The One-Straw Revolution , which is recognised as the pioneer of natural farming concepts that entails no tilling, ploughing, and chemical inputs to soil, and precludes the use chemical insecticides and pesticides.Once the rice is processed for the year, the solar power generated is also used to dry horticultural produce for preservation and value addition.

Billingslea knew Flynn would be speaking to Kislyak and seemed concerned Flynn did not fully understand he was dealing with a man rumored to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies.In late November, a member of Donald Trumps transition team approached national security officials in the Obama White House with a curious request: Could the incoming team get a copy of the classified CIA profile on Sergey Kislyak, Russias ambassador to the United States?Marshall Billingslea, a former Pentagon and NATO official, wanted the information for his boss, Michael Flynn, who had been tapped by Trump to serve as White House national security adviser. Billingslea knew Flynn would be speaking to Kislyak, according to two former Obama administration officials, and seemed concerned Flynn did not fully understand he was dealing with a man rumored to have ties to Russian intelligence agencies.To the Obama White House, Billingsleas concerns were startling: a member of Trumps own team suggesting the incoming Trump administration might be in over its head in dealing with an adversary. The request now stands out as a warning signal for Obama officials who would soon see Flynns contacts with the Russian spiral into a controversy that would cost him his job and lead to a series of shocking accusations hurled by Trump against his predecessors administration.In the following weeks, the Obama White House would grow deeply distrustful of Trumps dealing with the Kremlin and anxious about his teams ties. The concern compounded by surge of new intelligence, including evidence of multiple calls, texts and at least one in-person meeting between Flynn and Kislyak would eventually grow so great Obama advisers delayed telling Trumps team about plans to punish Russia for its election meddling. Obama officials worried the incoming administration might tip off Moscow, according to one Obama adviser.The Trump White House declined to comment. This account of the closing days of the Obama administration is based on interviews with 11 current and former U.S. officials, including seven with key roles in the Obama administration. The officials reveal an administration gripped by mounting anxiety over Russias election meddling and racing to grasp the Trump teams possible involvement before exiting the White House. Most of the officials spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss sensitive national security information.The Obama White Houses role in the Russia controversy will come under fresh scrutiny Monday. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former deputy Attorney General Sally Yates are slated to testify before lawmakers on the Senate Judiciary Committee, one of three committees investigating Trumps associates links to Moscow.Trump has said he has no nefarious ties to Russia and isnt aware of any involvement by his aides in Moscows interference in the election. Hes dismissed an FBI and congressional investigations into his campaigns possible ties to the election meddling as a hoax driven by Democrats bitter over losing the White House.Yates, an Obama administration official who carried over into the Trump administration, is expected to tell lawmakers that she expressed alarm to the Trump White House about Flynns contacts with the Russian ambassador. Trump fired Yates days later, after she told the Justice Department to not enforce the new presidents travel and immigration ban. Flynn was forced to resign three weeks later for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about the content of his discussions with Kislyak.Yatess warnings about Flynn in January capped weeks of building concern among top Obama officials. The president himself that month told one of his closest advisers that the FBI, which by then had been investigating Trump associates possible ties to Russia for about six months, seemed particularly focused on Flynn. Obama aides described Flynn as notably dismissive of the threat Russia posed to the United States when discussing policy in transition meetings with outgoing national security adviser Susan Rice and other top officials.Officials also found it curious that Billingslea only ever asked Obamas National Security Council for one classified leadership profile to give to Flynn: the internal document on Kislyak. The CIA compiles classified biographies of foreign officials, known as leadership profiles. The profiles include U.S. intelligence assessments about the officials, in addition to biographical information.When reached by the AP, Billingslea refused to comment. Last month, Trump announced his intention to nominate Billingslea to serve as assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the Treasury Department. Trump has accused Obama officials of illegally leaking classified information about Flynns contacts with Kislyak. Hes also contended, without evidence, that Rice asked for the names of Trump officials caught up in routine intelligence monitoring to be improperly revealed, a charge Rice has denied.The distrust in the other camp was clear months earlier. In late December, as the White House prepared to levy sanctions and oust Russians living in the in the U.S. in retaliation for the hacks, Obama officials did not brief the Trump team on the decision until shortly before it was announced publicly. The timing was chosen in part because they feared the transition team might give Moscow lead time to clear information out of two compounds the U.S. was shuttering, one official said.While its not inappropriate for someone in Flynns position to have contact with a diplomat, Obama officials said the frequency of his discussions raised enough red flags that aides discussed the possibility Trump was trying to establish a one-to-one line of communication a so-called back channel with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama aides say they never determined why Flynn was in close contact with the ambassador. Even with the suspicion, the officials said they did not withhold information.The outgoing White House also became concerned about the Trump teams handling of classified information. After learning that highly sensitive documents from a secure room at the transitions Washington headquarters were being copied and removed from the facility, Obamas national security team decided to only allow the transition officials to view some information at the White House, including documents on the governments contingency plans for crises.Some White House advisers now privately concede that the administration moved too slowly during the election to publicly blame Russia for the hack and explore possible ties to the Trump campaign. Others say it was only after the election, once Obama ordered a comprehensive review of the election interference, that the full scope of Russias interference and potential Trump ties become clearer.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
593d70857be9e00e964d5f45,"Beef, triple talaq, Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi are issues raised by parties, they can’t be govt policy: Ram Vilas Paswan",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/beef-triple-talaq-article-370-and-ram-janmabhoomi-are-issues-raised-by-parties-they-cant-be-govt-policy-ram-vilas-paswan-4654564/,2017-05-13,"Ram Vilas Paswan at the Idea Exchange (Express Photo By Amit Mehra) Ram Vilas Paswan at the Idea Exchange (Express Photo By Amit Mehra)Union Minister for Food and Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan talks about his suggestion on restaurant menus, claims there is a cold war between Nitish and Lalu, says Mayawati doesnt represent all Dalits, and insists talks can happen with Kashmiri separatists only after they disown terrorists.Why Ram Vilas Paswan?Since parting ways with the Congress, right before the 2014 polls, Ram Vilas Paswan has emerged as an important Dalit face in the NDA government. The nine-time MP from Bihar was recently in the news for urging restaurants to specify food portions on their menus. Last week, he also slammed Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray for speaking out against the government. Thackeray had accused Paswan of forcibly getting a sentence  that NDA will fight 2019 elections under the leadership of PM Modi  added in an NDA resolution.RAM VILAS PASWAN: When I took charge of the ministry, the Food Security Act had already come into force (July 5, 2013) but was implemented in only 11 states. Today, the Act is in force in all 29 states. 67 per cent of the countrys population or 81 crore people are getting rice at Rs 3 per kilo and wheat at Rs 2 per kilo. The Centre bears the subsidy cost, but the state governments claim that they are paying for it. They dont pay a single penny.We want to make use of modern technology to make transactions cashless. Of the 23 crore ration card holders in the country, 19 crore have been linked to Aadhaar. The benefit of this process is that 14 crore ration cards were found to be fake. If it (Aadhaar) is integrated in more states, a lot of money can be saved.On the issue of food portions, we have not told restaurants how much to serve and how much to charge the customer. What we have said is that the consumer should know what they are getting for the price they are paying. If I am paying Rs 700 for a bowl of soup, I should know what quantity of it is being served. (Last month the minister had suggested that restaurants specify on their menus the amount of food they serve per portion.)ANAND MISHRA: Some of your old socialist friends are now forming a mahagathbandhan with the Congress to name a common Opposition candidate for the presidential polls. They are also trying to put up a united Opposition front for the 2019 elections.These people (opposition parties) are wasting time. Look, it is the Oppositions job to propose their candidate. It is not surprising at all. But I see no coordination and understanding between the opposition parties. In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav are not on the same page. Mulayam says there will be no tie-up with the Congress, and Akhilesh is talking about an understanding with them. Then there is the Left, Mamata Banerjee (TMC), Congress and Arvind Kejriwal (AAP). The Opposition is fragmented and divided. For the first time, there is no Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The Opposition can come together and nominate their candidate for the presidential polls, but nothing will come of it.ANAND MISHRA: In the past, socialist leaders and splinter groups of the Janata Dal came together with the Left to form an Opposition front against the ruling Congress. They are coming together now as well.At the time when the opposition parties came together against the Congress, there was no one with the Congress. But now, when the BJP-led NDA is in power, there are many parties that have joined hands with the BJP. Like in the Janata Party government, when Atal Bihari Vajpayee was foreign minister. In 1967 in Bihar, when the Janata Party formed the government, the BJP was with us and so was the Left. But today, the situation has changed.See, the biggest thing is credibility. During that period, the Opposition had never been in power. So people thought that when the Opposition comes to power, there would be new vision and direction. But today members of the Opposition have already had opportunities to run governments, and people have seen them. So what is the point of forming the mahagathbandhan?COOMI KAPOOR: The Supreme Court recently ordered that Lalu Prasad will stand trial in all fodder scam cases. Do you think it will affect the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar?There are two things here  mass perception and actual impact. The mass perception has been formed. First it was the Mohammad Shahabuddin episode, when he was granted bail. Then he was sent to Tihar. Now, an audio tape has emerged where a criminal like Shahabuddin is heard instructing Lalu Prasad, who is himself a convict, regarding a superintendent of police. The (Bihar) government is responsible for this and they must now clarify.Then there is the controversy over land deals involving his sons Tej Pratap and Tejashwi. And now we have the Supreme Court judgment asking Lalu to face trial in all fodder scam cases.There is an ongoing cold war between Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. Nitish Kumar claims to be the face of sushasan (good governance), but so far he has remained silent over these issues.Many people claim that the (state) government is behind this, and some are even pointing to the role of RJD leaders who have been upset with Lalu Prasad. Nitish Kumar wants Lalu Prasads party to remain weak and surrounded by controversies. The RJD has more seats in the Bihar Assembly than the JD(U). The RJD has 80 seats (the JD-U has 71). One has the crown and the other has the power.ABANTIKA GHOSH: You have been a minister in both UPA and NDA governments. Whats the difference in their working styles?There was lack of decision-making in the UPA government. This could have been because it was a coalition government. Taking decisions was tough in the UPA government, there was no clear path. The government remained confused.The BJP-led NDA government has a majority in the Lok Sabha. Narendra Modi is currently the tallest leader in the BJP as well as in the country. He gets praise for the governments work and faces all of the criticism. Even if a decision is risky, the present dispensation takes a call.Take demonetisation for instance. The UPA government could have never taken a decision on the matter, but this government took the risk and was ready to face the consequences.The other difference is the lack of corruption. Its been three years and there is no corruption taint on this government. During the previous government, there were corruption charges every month.This government has only one centre of power. In the previous government, there were two centres.ANAND MISHRA: There are reports that ties between the BJP and Shiv Sena are strained.What can the Shiv Sena do? In Maharashtra, except for Mumbai, the BJP has won all the civic body elections. Even in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections, there was a very small difference between the two parties. The Sena thinks that if it does not oppose the BJP in Maharashtra, it will lose ground. During the recent NDA meeting, we told them not to raise issues with the BJP in public.For example, it was unanimously decided at an NDA meeting that Narendra Modi will be our PM candidate in 2019. However, the Sena later claimed otherwise. All allies were of the view that Narendra Modi is the tallest leader in the country and thats why we took the decision.VANDITA MISHRA: Do you agree with the BJPs decision to appoint Yogi Adityanath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh?This issue concerns the BJP. The party got a massive mandate and it has a system in place to make such choices. Who are we to say anything on their choice for the CMs post.ANAND MISHRA: Whenever there is an issue between Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, it is speculated that Nitish will return to the NDA fold. Is that a possibility?Nitish Kumar has a double card. He is apprehensive of Lalu Prasad taking over the reins of the government. The RJD has 80 seats and the Congress has 27, which gives them a total of 107 seats.Nitish fears that in case their alliance breaks, Lalu will manage to get support from some of the JD(U) MLAs. That is why he keeps sending signals to the RJD that if you withdraw support I have another way to get the numbers.Nitish needs to make up his mind on whether he wants to stay in the Mahagathbandhan, resign and seek mid-term polls, or if he wants to join the NDA.So, first he needs to take a clear stand and only then will the NDA decide on whether to support or oppose his inclusion in the alliance.ABANTIKA GHOSH: Recently, the PM backed generic drugs. You have held the Chemicals and Fertilisers portfolio. What are your views on it?I have been pitching for generic drugs since 2007. I also support printing of names of drugs in regional languages. Names of drugs are mostly printed in English and sometimes in Hindi too. I had told M Karunanidhi, when he was the Tamil Nadu chief minister, to push for printing of names of medicines in Tamil.SANDIP DAS: Aadhaar seeding in the Public Distribution System (PDS) has been slow in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. How do you want to pursue it?They are yet to give us names of at least 10-15 lakh beneficiaries. The state government picks all the stocks and yet we get several complaints of the poor not getting grains. When we seed Aadhaar numbers with ration cards, it will stop people from picking up ration from multiple locations under one name. It will stop pilferage.The Central government stores food grains at FCI godowns. From there the state government picks up the stock. We tried to computerise the entire process and asked state governments to pay 50 per cent of the expenses. But the entire process has yet not been fully computerised.ANAND MISHRA: You were part of the all-party delegation to Kashmir in both the UPA and NDA governments. You have also met separatist leaders from the Valley in past. At the moment, the BJP is in favour of a muscular policy to handle the issue. What, in your opinion, is the way forward?We had met separatist leaders such as Yasin Malik and Syed Ali Shah Geelani. But the situation is completely different now. I dont think that these leaders are influential anymore. In fact they are now using the language of terrorists to keep themselves relevant. The first issue is that certain people give youths stones to throw at security forces, and in response, the forces open fire. On both sides our people die, and those responsible remain safe.The other issue is of terror activities. There is no dispute between political parties and other sections of the society on the fact that such activities are supported by Pakistan. We have asked the government to adopt a tit-for-tat policy and give complete freedom to the Army.ANAND MISHRA: Can you elaborate on the tit-for-tat policy.We only want an equally strong reaction to Pakistans actions.HARISH DAMODARAN: What are your views on the Supreme Courts order to arrest Justice C S Karnan.It is a justice verses justice matter. I wont comment on the issue.HARISH DAMODARAN: Do you support reservation in the higher judiciary?We want an Indian judicial service on the lines of the Indian Administrative Service and Indian Police Service. In such a system the judges will be selected through competition, putting all questions about the collegium system to rest. No one can doubt the efficiency of IAS and IPS officers because they are selected through a competition. Similarly, no one will raise questions on judges if they are selected through a competition.I fully support the idea of an Indian judicial service, conducting Lok Sabha and Assembly elections together, State funding of political parties, and keeping a record of foreign funding (to NGOs).SRIJANA MITRA DAS: With Mayawati losing Dalit votes and the BJP reaching out to the community, dont you think Dalit identity politics is being marginalised? Also, what are your views on the politics around beef?Mayawati falsely claims to be a Dalit leader. Dalits stand for Scheduled Castes. There are many castes among the Dalits  Paswans, Pasis, Jatavs etc. She was the leader of only one Dalit caste, but claimed to represent the entire community. She only inherited the legacy of Kanshi Ram. Has she participated in any Dalit welfare movement? Where was she during the Mandal Commission movement?She just believes in vote-bank politics. First she suffered a massive defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and now in the Assembly polls. She will have to form an alliance even to secure her seat in the Rajya Sabha next year.Because of social awakening across the country, one single leader does not represent an entire community anymore. No Brahmin represents the entire community, no Rajput represents the entire community. Likewise, no leader can claim to represent all Dalits. In Bihar, Ram Vilas Paswan has the support of Dalits, but he cant make similar claims in Uttar Pradesh. Similarly, Lalu Prasad is the leader of Yadavs in Bihar, but he has no say in Uttar Pradesh; Mulayam Singh Yadav is zero in Bihar. The BSP cant win a single seat outside Uttar Pradesh.SRIJANA MITRA DAS: And what about beef politics? People are being killed because of it.Beef, triple talaq, Article 370 and Ram Janmabhoomi are issues raised by political parties, but it cant be part of the governments policy. Have you ever heard anything from PM on Article 370 (that grants special autonomous status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir)?VANDITA MISHRA: But BJP-ruled states are bringing in stricter laws against cow slaughter.When they bring in any such law, you can ask for my views. Recently, in Uttar Pradesh, there was a controversy surrounding closure of slaughterhouses. We looked into that issue. Those were illegal slaughterhouses.ANAND MISHRA: Should the government talk to separatists in Kashmir?The mass perception is against any talks with the separatists when our soldiers are being killed. The mass perception is also that terror activities should stop and separatists must cut all ties with terrorists.As soon as separatists disown terrorists, we will initiate talks with them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Officials also found it curious that Billingslea only ever asked Obamas National Security Council for one classified leadership profile to give to Flynn: the internal document on Kislyak.The CIA compiles classified biographies of foreign officials, known as leadership profiles. The profiles include U.S. intelligence assessments about the officials, in addition to biographical information. When reached by the AP, Billingslea refused to comment. Last month, Trump announced his intention to nominate Billingslea to serve as assistant secretary for terrorist financing at the Treasury Department.Trump has accused Obama officials of illegally leaking classified information about Flynns contacts with Kislyak. Hes also contended, without evidence, that Rice asked for the names of Trump officials caught up in routine intelligence monitoring to be improperly revealed, a charge Rice has denied.The distrust in the other camp was clear months earlier. In late December, as the White House prepared to levy sanctions and oust Russians living in the in the US in retaliation for the hacks, Obama officials did not brief the Trump team on the decision until shortly before it was announced publicly. The timing was chosen in part because they feared the transition team might give Moscow lead time to clear information out of two compounds the US was shuttering, one official said.While its not inappropriate for someone in Flynns position to have contact with a diplomat, Obama officials said the frequency of his discussions raised enough red flags that aides discussed the possibility Trump was trying to establish a one-to-one line of communication  a so-called back channel  with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Obama aides say they never determined why Flynn was in close contact with the ambassador.Even with the suspicion, the officials said they did not withhold information. The outgoing White House also became concerned about the Trump teams handling of classified information. After learning that highly sensitive documents from a secure room at the transitions Washington headquarters were being copied and removed from the facility, Obamas national security team decided to only allow the transition officials to view some information at the White House, including documents on the governments contingency plans for crises.Some White House advisers now privately concede that the administration moved too slowly during the election to publicly blame Russia for the hack and explore possible ties to the Trump campaign. Others say it was only after the election, once Obama ordered a comprehensive review of the election interference, that the full scope of Russias interference and potential Trump ties become clearer.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Jnanasambandam, research manager at Tamil Nadu Agricultural Universitys Technology Business Incubator, about five startups, including a farmer society, are involved in millet-based product-making currently. They make millet flakes, noodles, cookies, ready-to-cook powders. With increasing awareness among consumers the demand for these products are up. Even the neighbourhood stores now sell millet-based food items.Some of these companies also conduct training programmes for farmers to increase millet cultivation. While the demand for millet-based food goes up, millet production should also increase. Awareness among farmers and knowledge about millet cultivation should improve, he adds.According to Mr. Sadiq, millets generally grow well in semi arid lands with minimal water requirements. These are normally three to four month crops. There are two major seasons to sow millets in India: June-July and September-October. Low water requirements of millets makes them farmer-friendly crops, especially in drought prone areas, he says.City-based endocrinologist P. Velayutham says millets have several health benefits. With higher amounts of fibre, iron, vitamin B and calcium these help with better absorption of nutrients and minerals.However, there should not be a sudden shift from rice to millets, warns S. Kowsalya, a faculty with Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Avinashilingam University."

They said this issue would also be on the agenda of the next India-U.S. Trade Policy Forum (TPF)  the main bilateral platform for discussing and resolving trade and investment issues. The date for the next TPF meeting will be fixed after the new USTR assumes office.Child labourAccording to the Indian Commerce Ministry, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has arbitrarily listed 23 items produced in India on the List of Goods Produced by Child Labour or Forced Labour  which is in effect a ban on their import.The Ministry said Indian industry is worried as the reports that the DOL relies upon are not always accurate.The Ministry has also referred to the U.S. Government measures envisaged within an initiative to counter potential terrorist threats to the international maritime container trade system.This included X-ray scanning of containers exported to U.S., a measure, the ministry said would cause additional costs for Indian exporters across sectors. In addition, the Ministry has cited a law (the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 of the U.S.) allowing American manufacturers to petition for curbing imports from third nations on national security grounds without providing proof from industry.This is a major Non-Tariff Barrier (NTB) of the U.S. affecting Indian exports across sectors as the law  allowing invocation of national security exceptions without having to apply any detailed criteria  in effect restricts foreign competition, the Ministry added.Pharma exportsIndian pharmaceutical exports to the U.S. are hit by the increase in registration fees, approval delays and low approval rates for registrations mandatory for sale of all new drugs in the U.S.Also, ayurveda and traditional Indian medicines are hit by the U.S. requirement of clinical trials while the practice of traditional Indian medicine systems such as Siddha and Unani are not allowed by the U.S. Federal Government.On market access barriers for Indian rice, the ministry said until the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency registers, approves and fixes a tolerance level for certain pesticide residues, Indian Basmati Rice exports will be hurt owing to import alerts due to the presence of such pesticide residues.The Ministry has also opposed the U.S. requirement of irradiation treatment and inspection of mangoes prior to shipping from India. The Ministry said this is a time-consuming and costly certification process hurting the competitiveness of Indian mangoes in the U.S. market. Indian grapes, litchis, pomegranates, honey, marine and meat products are also impacted by various U.S. NTBs. Besides, the U.S. has imposed countervailing duties on Indian exports, including those by steel and paper industries."

Narayanasamy while distributing educational assistance, books and other benefits to the children of construction workers at a function here on Wednesday.Mr. Narayanasamy said that law and order was under control in Puducherry. He blamed the previous AINRC Government for failure to approach the Centre for allocation of funds resulting in the present financial crisis.The Centres demonetisation drive, shifting of liquor shops on national highways and ban on registration of plots in unauthorised layouts had resulted in a loss of Rs. 400 crore as revenue to Puducherry.The Puducherry Government would approach the Centre without break to get allocation of funds. The ruling Congress with the support of the DMK would complete one year in office soon.He felt sorry that an MLA of the Opposition party had indulged in a baseless campaign against the government at a function got up recently to give away job orders to educated youth. This had resulted in several companies leaving the venue without handing over the appointment orders.No diversionThe government had directed officials to ensure funds meant for implementation of free rice scheme, old age pension and educational assistance to students under CENTAC were not diverted. Old age pension would be distributed at the doorstep of the beneficiaries from June.Earlier, while declaring open the MLA office at Nellithope, the Chief Minister said he had asked the police to invoke the provisions of the Goondas Act to rein in the anti-social elements.Mr. Narayanasamy said the murders that had taken place were all because of domestic feuds and were not planned.

The poster at the city centre in Aizawl clearly shows where loyalties lie in the capital city.It poured this morning here in Aizawl, like it often does in April. The sun, which played hide and seek on Thursday, did not appear the whole day. The grey skies and chilly winds blowing across the valley take the sting out of the early summer here. The middle-aged man sipping rice beer at a cafe and his friend look skyward as dark clouds gather. Aizwal FC, a team doomed and relegated to the second division last season, will play their biggest match against Indian football giants Mohun Bagan on Saturday. If Aizwal FC win by a margin of two goals, they will clinch the I-League title. The men in the cafe philosophically wonder aloud what the rain gods and footballing gods have in store for their team. Aizwal were invited back to top-flight football only to make numbers after the Goan clubs had pulled out of I-League and the All India Football Federation did not have enough teams to run the competition.Now, Aizawl are on the verge of scripting Indian footballs Leicester moment. This team of rejects and unknowns has been morphed into a well-oiled unit by coach, Khalid Jamil, who was sacked last year by Mumbai for not being good enough. On Saturday, Aizawl will hope their attractive attacking style will help them scalp one last victim, Mohun Bagan, and complete the fairytale.The equation is simple: If Bagan win, the title will be theirs. Aizwal need a two-goal margin. Any other result and the champion will be decided on the final weekend of the league. Its a complete mismatch: Aizawl have been around only for 33 years, Bagan for more than 100. The Mariners have won everything Indian football has to offer, Aizawl have nothing in their cupboard. The Mizoram side operates on a budget of Rs 2 crore. Bagan have spent almost five times more in assembling their squad.Logic says teams like Aizawl are not supposed to win titles. Yet, quite astonishingly, they are just two goals, a clean sheet and three points away from doing just that. And the entire city is on the edge. The tension evident in their expressions each time you ask the local fans about their teams chances. Unwilling to jinx Aizawl, they mumble: Bagan. In the maelstrom of emotions, their unabashed love for Aizawl doesnt go unnoticed. The clubs official merchandise shop near Assam Rifles Lammaul Stadium has run out of jerseys. The clubs scarves hang on the back of cars and inside cafes. Outside the shop, and at many other spots across the city, the posters declaring tickets sold out are cello-taped on the walls. Yet, the phone at the clubs office does not stop ringing. Normally, Aizawl prints around 3000 to 4,000 tickets for a match.For Saturdays encounter, they printed 8,000 (priced at Rs 200 on an average) and they were sold within hours of going on sale. To meet the unexpected demand, the club also decided to make the hillock surrounding the stadium a ticketed spot. Those tickets, approximately a 1000, were sold at Rs 30 each. More than half of the ticket holders, say officials, are women. When we played in Mumbai, even the people staying in the buildings next to the stadium would not know theres a match going on, Jamil says. Here, the entire city is involved. Anywhere you go, they will be talking about Saturdays match.Lalnghinglova Hmar, secretary of Mizoram Football Association, says there will be special prayers at the churches across the city before the match. For a tiny city like ours to win the national league will be huge. This isnt just about football. This will help us in getting national recognition, Hmar says. At a restaurant in the city centre, Remruata Varte is informing his customers of a possible discount scheme if Aizawl win. Like every other person here, Varte claims he is a former footballer. He now runs a cozy little restaurant, and claims to serve the best pork in the city. Its not just pork for which his restaurant is famous for.Varte gives discount to every customer who holds a ticket for the Mizoram Premier League. Hopefully, Ill get less business on Saturday from 2 to 4. I can watch the match peacefully, then, says Varte. Everyone will be watching the match. If we win, Aizawl will see the biggest party. For a town that goes to sleep at 8, throwing a big party is not usual. But these are unusual times in Aizawl. Surely there will be a huge party if Aizawl wins, Hmar says. If, he crosses his fingers.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."

But today, due to the increase in income from animal husbandry, they are able to send their children to study engineering in the same metro.This is one of the success stories listed by Director of Animal Husbandry G. Somasekharam.The Department of Animal Husbandry is going to make use of technology to improve the convergence between agriculture and animal husbandry and increase the profitability of livestock farmers.Farmers feed the livestock the residue and byproducts of the crops they cultivate. Rice mill feed is suitable for ruminants, the higher grade material could be used in the diets of pigs and poultry. Oil seed residue is also used as diet supplement for livestock. But the trick is to give feed to the animal in the best combination. The department is going to soon equip Pasumithra, livestock activists with tablets for calculating the Total Mixed Ration (TMR), a complete balanced ration for all livestock. The farmer does not have to worry about what fodder or concentration feed. The livestock activists would provide it to the farmer. Use of optimum TMR feed would help the dairy farmers in two ways: It will increase milk production and cut the cost of production. The current cost of production for a litre of works out to Rs. 18 and the current procurement price is Rs. 28 a litre, Mr. Somasekharam said.The department was trying to reduce the cost of production to between Rs. 11 and Rs. 12 a litre. This would increase the margin of profit to the dairy farmer, Mr. Somasekharam said. Feed was the biggest expenditure for dairy farmers. With the help of TMR the feed cost that was currently 70% of the production cost, would come down to 50 %, he said.Host of interventionsThe department was trying to increase the viability of animal husbandry through a host of other interventions. With the help of A.P. Online Services, 18 applications were launched and another four were being tested, he said. The most amazing of the application is the one for Revamped Inputs Delivery System (RIDS). This facilitates the door delivery of various inputs used by livestock farmers. With this App, the input stocks available, the orders placed farmers and orders executed could be monitored. Mr. Somasekharam said because of the red tape involved for the distribution of several of these inputsfor which both Central and State governments provided subsidies, it took nearly two months for execution of the order, but now it could be done in less than a week.Applications were now available for the close monitoring of various diseases, health parameters and even frequency of vaccinations. Technology was being used to reduce wastage, increase production and profit, the Director said."

A draft project on the implementation of the scheme has been submitted to the government by A.G.Abdul Karim, the Principal Agricultural Officer, Alappuzha.The project, with an outlay of Rs. 50 crore, will be implemented over a four-year period, through an apex body to be set up at Alappuzha. It will be coordinated by the Principal Agricultural Officer Alappuzha, in association with Principal Agricultural Officers of Pathanamthitta and Kottayam. The chairman of the body will be selected by the Agriculture ministry. There will be 7 members representing the padasekhara committees.The scheme envisages conservation of biodiversity and development of location specific agriculture activities, aimed at sustaining productivity, incorporating ecological engineering concepts. It targets reduction of the chemical and pesticide load in the soil and water of Kuttanad.There will be proactive methods to prevent pest attack. Strategies will be adopted to control invasive weeds, water weeds and wild rice.The project will also aim at capturing new market by modifying supply chain governance.The soil of Kuttanad is acidic and becomes toxic due to accumulation of elements such as iron, aluminium, manganese. Deepening of small canals will facilitate washing away of the toxic elements from the field. It is proposed to deepen these canals using small excavators.Aerial survey of the fields will be conducted using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), for crop monitoring and to track down land utility.Demonstration plotsDemonstration plots will be set up in each panchayat. Production of bio-pesticides, bio-fertilizers and bio control agents, will be encouraged to meet the standards under good agricultural practices (GAP). Kudumbasree services will be utilized for the production of bio-pesticides.Development of suitable rice varieties will be done with the help of Rice Research Station, Mankomb and Regional Agricultural Research Station, Kumarakam. There is an estimated annual requirement of 3,000 metric tonnes of paddy seeds in Kuttanad. The special agri zone envisages production of seeds locally. Kayal lands such as Rani and Chithira will be developed into hubs for seed production. The farmers will be given incentives for seed production. Production and procurement of special rice varieties such as Njavara will be part of the plans.Radio stationA community radio station (CRS) for Kuttanad will be launched. There will be dedicated programmes along with other infotainment slots to be formulated under the direction of the Department of Agriculture. Local weather stations will be set up in major panchayats to keep track of the climatic changes. Mandatory insurance cover and promotion of agricultural innovations also form part of the project."

The village is celebrating the Grama Devi annual car festival, that sees Hindus and Muslims participating with equal fervour.The festival is inaugurated by the Desai family, who follow the Muslim faith.As the largest land owners in the village, they have the first right to Honnata, the lifting of the palanquin of the goddess. They also present the temple with a set of rice, jaggery cakes, blouse pieces, bangles and vermilion. They also lead the procession.Men and women of the family carry a bamboo basket with the rice and other materials to the temple. The women stand in silence as the pujari breaks coconuts and clothes the deity. The men later join the villagers in shifting the idol from the main temple to a makeshift temple created for the jatra. The Desai brothers carry the palanquin for some distance before passing it to others. Imam Saab Desai holds an important position in the jatra committee and plans the event. Various religious rituals are performed for seven days and end on Monday.Roles are reversed during the Urs of the Madar Sab Dargah, considered the village patron saint.

For, at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, on debut, she had won three gold medals (in 200m IM, 400 IM and 4200m freestyle relay) and each of them in world-record times.Yet, more than three years since retirement, she says there are no regrets, having achieved her biggest dream in her very first race. Now in the city as the Event Ambassador for the TCS World 10k, the 28-year-old spoke on various subjects.Excerpts:What is the hardest part of being an Olympic athlete?It was going from being a normal person to being someone that everyone recognised overnight. No one can prepare you for that.Whats going through your mind a minute or 30 seconds before a race?Not a lot. A minute or 30 seconds before a race when I am on the pool deck, I am looking at the board, my name. I am not looking at the crowd, because I just want to focus on whats next. The immediate thing. It almost becomes a feeling when you put your headphones on and you cant hear anything else around you.Why did you retire early?I was mentally exhausted six months before London. I know its impossible to feel motivated every session. But as a whole if I am not enjoying it, then I am not going to do it. I started feeling that. I couldnt do everything that my teammates were doing. [I was] taking extra time for physio, massage and everything. It felt like a lot.How hard was it to come back to the normal life?It was hard. Nothing will ever feel the same, walking out to an Olympic Stadium with the screaming crowd, the energy, winning and achieving. That is why a lot of athletes struggle. When you finish at 24 and 25, all your peers are now further in front.Most of the days now I wake up and think thank god I am not training anymore. But when you see those old videos, you realise what an achievement three gold medals was. It doesnt feel real.Was it hard to stay focused after Beijing?I wouldnt say I lost focus but it just became a balancing act of trying to fit everything in, making everybody happy and still get the performance out of me. The difference was that I was the reigning champion going into London and in Beijing I was just another person in the team.Did you think of a comeback?Never! Once you have won an Olympic gold, going to one [event] and coming in third doesnt feel successful to me. One in a billion people win an Olympic gold so it was too much of a gamble to be spending another four years of my life dedicating to sport.In your time, the polyurethane bodysuits increased speeds and were later outlawed. Recently Nikes special shoes with Carbon-fibre plates were used to try and break the 2-hour barrier in the Marathon. How do you see this?Sometimes technology can bridge the gap between those who work really hard and the rest. Thats unfortunate.I very much prefer to keep it raw. I would have just loved to compete in a training costume or whatever really basic and let the performance speak for itself.Why is Australian swimming not doing as well?At Rio we should have done so much better. Australian swimming is not doing enough in terms of mentally preparing its athletes. You cant break a world record four weeks before an Olympics and come fifth or sixth at the Olympics [Cate Campbell, 100m Freestyle]. Once in four years you have less than two minutes to show the world what you trained for.One little screw up and thats your four years gone. So handling that pressure is a big part.Is India a sleeping giant?Theres no reason why India cant be as good as China in swimming. You cant tell me that a country with this many people doesnt have talent.I think its about making the commitment, putting in facilities, funding to have good programmes and coaches."

We lose 16 tonnes of soil per hectare per year through land erosion, said the agricultural scientist.Despite these limitations, Indias grain production had increased five times, milk production by 8.5 times, egg production by 43 times and fish production by 13 times since the 1950s. The countrys horticultural produce had gone up three times since the 1990s, Mr. Mohapatra said.This was made possible because we applied science to agriculture which ushered in the green revolution making us self-sufficient and self-reliant. It is a huge growth in the face of all these adversities. We applied the science of genetics to grow the largest basmati rice which is being exported and it had made us self-sufficient in wheat now, he said.Food basketMr. Mohapatra said a pomegranate farmer in Gujarat was earning a net profit of Rs. 10-15 lakh per year through cultivation of the fruit which had been made possible because of scientific application in agriculture and it indicated as to how Indias food basket was diversified.He emphasising on integration of research, education and dissemination and application of new knowledge -- the main source of agricultural growth in future.The SOA University conferred the honoris causa on Mr. Mohapatra on the occasion."

Sunil Kumar has said.Formalities completedHe said the Land Assessment Committee had completed the formalities for the same and necessary steps would be taken to take over the excess land. The Minister was inaugurating the sale of Aranmula rice brand and the rice shop at Aranmula on Friday.He said paddy cultivation would be fully revived across the Aranmula Puncha, including the 420 hectares identified for the airport project, in the next two years.Paddy farming in the State would be extended to 3,00,000 ha from the present 1,96,000 ha in the next four years so as to double the States paddy production, he said.He said the idea was to market the rice produced in a particular locality there itself, giving it the brand name of the same village with a view to facilitating easy availability of pesticide-free rice across the State. The government was also planning to set up three rice mills to produce local rice brands, he said.The Left Democratic Front government had declared its policy that paddy land should not be utilised for any other purpose, he added. Veena Goerge, MLA, presided over the function."

DeepakK_R_DEEPAKSir Arthur Thomas Cotton is a much-revered figure in the East and West Godavari region, as it was he who built the Dowleswaram Barrage and the Godavari canal system that turned the region into a rice bowl.The world celebrated his 214th birth anniversary on Monday, but only a few would know that the general-turned-engineer had also given his share of engineering genius to Vizagapatam (as Vizag was then known as) that probably turned the sleepy fishing village into City of Destiny.It was Sir Arthur Cotton who first recognised that the city has the potential to house one of biggest and finest natural harbours in the country.In the summer of 1844, Arthur Cotton who had fallen sick, had come to Vizagapatam to recuperate, and one day while trotting down the expanse of the beach in the Fort area of Old Town on his pony, he had noticed the natural canal from hinterland that was emptying itself into the Bay of Bengal at the foothills of Dolphins Nose Hill. The view from an elevated position gave him the idea that if the canal can be dredged inward from the mouth to allow the seawater inside, it can be converted into a natural harbour.He had mentioned in his biography: It has the point of the eastern coast where, in-comparably, the best harbour can be made by a single breakwater run out from the bold promontory of Dolphins Nose, south of the town.His thought was probably the harbinger for the construction of Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT), which was constructed between 1927 and 1933, by building a breakwater at the mouth of the harbour at the foothills of Dolphins Nose hill, as indicated by Sir Cotton 80 years ago.According to the former Rector of Andhra University Prof. Prasanna Kumar, Sir Arthur Cotton was not only an engineering genius but a visionary, who visualised concepts such as linking of rivers a century ago and we are still pondering upon them.St Johns ChurchArthur Cotton not only spoke about the natural harbour and salubrious climate of Visakhapatnam, but also designed and built the St. Johns Church, which now houses the St. Johns School in the Old Town area, in 1844.A plaque still stands embedded exhibiting that the church was designed and built by Sir Arthur Cotton."

SubrahmanyamC.V.SubrahmanyamThe alleged Rs. 1,600-crore money laundering case took a new turn with Visakhapatnam Commissioner of Police T. Yoganand stating that Rs. 800 crore was shipped as outward remittances to foreign destinations from one single account in a public sector bank located on Netaji Subha Chandra Bose Road in Kolkata in 2016.Raising doubts over the involvement of several other persons, including the suspected connivance of bankers, he said it was in this same bank that Rs. 90 crore cash was deposited in one single account on a single day. How can such huge amount of cash deposit go unnoticed or unquestioned by the bankers, he questioned.The Visakhapatnam city police on Monday produced before the media the prime accused, Vaddi Mahesh, who was arrested on Sunday evening at the Visakhapatnam airport, as soon as he landed from Kolkata.Addressing the media, Mr. Yoganand said the case has been handed over to the AP-CID for further investigation, as the city police does not have the required trained officers to handle an economic offence case of this magnitude.We neither have the manpower nor the expertise. Moreover, the case has to be dealt pan-India and coordinated with various other investigating agencies, both nationally and internationally, such as CBI, ED and Interpol. The CID also has the powers to declare the red and blue corner notices, as and when required. And the decision to hand over the case was taken after consultation with DGP N. Sambasiva Rao, said Mr. Yoganand.Mahesh is the main and the first one to be arrested among the nine accused, who were named in the FIR that was filed by the Income Tax Department at MVP Police Station in Visakhapatnam last Friday.The case was initially investigated and unearthed by an IT Department team led by Income Tax Joint Director (Investigations) MVN Seshu Bhavanarayana.After three months of investigation, the IT department zeroed in on the accused, Vaddi Mahesh, his father, Vaddi Srinivasa Rao, and two of his cousins, Achanta Harish and Achanta Rajesh, and five others.According to Mr. Yoganand, Harish and Rajesh have been questioned, and the hunt is on for Srinivasa Rao and five others.As per the initial questioning, Mahesh reportedly claimed that they were under invoicing imported rice cookers, alcohol and cigarettes to evade Customs Duty. But this appears to be a wrong statement, as the IT department had filed a FIR stating that Mahesh and his gang had opened 12 shell companies and were operating 30 fictitious accounts to launder about Rs. 1600 crore since 2013 by remitting to five foreign companies  one in China, three in Singapore and one in Hong Kong  fraudulently towards purchase of customised software with the help of forged documents. A few of the accused also posses at least two Aadhaar cards that were used to open the accounts.According to a senior officer from the department of Income Tax, Mahesh was used as a tool, as he was taking a commission of 85 paisa for every US Dollar transhipped.The people behind Mahesh, who deposited the money, were to be caught in the further investigation, he said."

Now it has turned into barren land, and extreme heat makes cultivation impossible. Even if the land is irrigated, cultivation cannot be done as the water evaporates in the heat, said an aged inhabitant of the village, Kovalan. A building that once housed the office and facility to irrigate the farmland is now abandoned. For a population of 278 villagers, there is a lower primary school, health centre and an office of the Integrated Tribal Development Programme (ITDP). The village is in a rain shadow region and one of the eight Hill Pulaya colonies in the sanctuary. It is a tribal settlement with no income of its own. For some families that rear cattle, it is a long journey each day to find grasslands for rearing.We used to produce everything here. Now it all comes from outside. The ration rice provided by the government is the main food item now, he said. With no engagement, the people idle away their time. Some youth take up work provided by the Forest Department through the Eco Development Committees (EDCs).However, for most of us, it is not an option. If there is farming, others too can be engaged and we can generate income. Most of the families are without income, said Arumugham, a tribesman who works as a tourist guide under the Forest Department.In the past, there was government support for cultivation taken up by the Hill Pulayas of the Champakadu colony. However, farming activities were stopped owing to frequent attacks by wild animals.Forest produceBefore settling here, we depended on forest produce for a living. Now its availability has dwindled, making life more miserable, said a villager.Returning to farming is an option. But there is little scope for it now, said Kovalan."
593df7327be9e00dabcc6fb5,The mane entrepreneurs,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-mane-entrepreneurs/article18512333.ece,2017-05-20,"At 6 every morning the Narikuravars set out to collect human hair. The peripatetic gypsies, who liken themselves to Adivasis, live in Wagariyar Colony, near Kannamangalam gate outside Arcot town, about 120 km south-west of Chennai. The men and women leave on two-wheelers  mostly mopeds, and some motorcycles, many with loudspeakers fitted on the handlebars. Sometimes they head to a town as far as 50 km away. Once they reach their destination, they divide the streets among themselves, combing for hair, street by street. Some push their vehicles, switch on a taped message that blares out of the speaker:  Sikkumudi , sikkumudi , nooru gramme sikkumudi noor ruba , paththu gramme sikkumudi patthu ruba, sikku mudi ... (Comb waste hair, comb waste hair, we buy comb waste hair, hundred grams for hundred rupees, fifty grams for fifty rupees. We will weigh it and take it. Dont worry. Our weight is true. We buy even 10 grams of hair you dont need. We buy grey hair too.They collect hair from women in villages and towns who preserve strands that get tangled in the teeth of combs, or hair which falls in clumps, rolling it into small balls called  chutti . These they periodically exchange for money, aluminium vessels or fancy items  which could be anything from a hairband, hairpins, brooches, comb, small mirrors. When the hair collectors come, the women bring the chutti out for exchange. Fallen human hair keeps these collectors alive. When the pickings are poor, the Narikuravars find a tree under which they can sleep and try their luck elsewhere in the afternoon when the sun is less torrid.There is money in hair. Each year India exports Rs. 3,500 crore worth of human hair. Most of the worlds hair business, 70% of it, is in synthetic hair. The Indian exports are 80% of the worlds supply of two types of human hair. Remy hair, the longer hair, which is temple offerings made in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, especially in Tirupati by women who are part of the 18 million devotees who throng there every year and offer their hair to Lord Venkateswara. Women in south India maintain their hair well, use less henna than their counterparts elsewhere, oil their hair every day. Good hair also depends on good water and good food. Hair in Tirupati is auctioned every Thursday at 1 p.m. fetching revenue of about $10 million every year. Tirupati alone accounts for 40% of the Remy hair that is exported. Remy hair is only a fraction of the hair trade. The bulk of it is in non-Remy hair, which is collected by people like Devagopi in Wagariyar Colony.On the hair trailIt is a little after four on a Friday afternoon when we reach Wagariyar Colony, which has two streets and 65 houses, many with red crosses marked on the white walls. Right in the middle of the street, milling with activity, is spread a large, blue burlap mat on which people are sitting in a circle. A man in white shirt, vibhuti streaking his forehead, makes entries in a notebook, doing his maths on a blue calculator held together by rubber band. In front of him is a pair of weighing scales. By his side is a bag of human hair that he is about to assess and weigh. The weights, 10 grams upwards all the way to a kilo, crowd round his knees and ankles. This man is Palani, a hair collector one rung removed from the bottom of the chain of collectors. On Fridays and Tuesdays superstition prevents women from giving their fallen hair away, and today Palani has to make do with only two kilos. These Narikuravars give their hair mostly to Palani, nowadays for Rs. 3,400 per kilo. He collects 50 kilos of hair per month to supply up the chain.It is people like Devagopi who are at the bottom of the chain. He is philosophical about life. So long as we have noses, there will be snot. Nowadays, the pickings are poor. If each of us manages to collect even 200 grams of hair, it is a lot, he says. They have to cover as many as 10 villages, street by street, for a fistful of hair. Each village, by his count, has about a hundred houses. The bigger villages have more. The most Devagopi has collected in a single day is three kilos. But that is some years ago, in Red Hills outside Chennai.The collection chainThe bigger hair collectors sit in Gudiyatham, two hours away from Wagariyar Colony, at Puliar Koil Theru, Pandar Colony. There are 10 houses here, two stories tall, each building touching the other. Abutting the very first house is a 4 feet x 6 feet room with metal-slotted shelves along three walls on which sit vessels seven shelves high, all the way up almost to the ceiling. There are steel vessels, small bowls, airtight containers with lids, steel containers with long curving handles, plastic balls, mugs, cups. These Govindan Anandan, 54, exchanges for hair. His parents captured the poramboke land for which the late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran gave away pattas . Here, living in thatched huts, Anandan kept pigs. He began dealing with hair much later. It gave enough money to him and his brother, Kumar, who had sold chicken, to build a dream house for each, fifty-one feet deep so the other end of the house opened to the street in the back. It is here he parks the red Toyota Innova he bought second-hand for Rs. 5 lakh five years ago and has a driver who takes him around Tamil Nadu, collecting hair.Anandan travels to Thiruvannamalai, Arani, Arcot, down to the tip of the peninsula, Kanyakumari and to Pollachi, from where he brings hair from Kerala, prized for its lustre and good health. Today is Friday and he wont be using his weighing machine, which sits gleaming by the staircase, spotted reverentially with sandalwood and kunkumam (vermillion) marks. He is oblivious to the gurgling of his grandson, all of four months old, who watches wide-eyed over the shoulder of his mother Yogalakshmi. Up on the first floor, Anandan and his wife show us their collection, all packed in white burlap sacks, some 110 kilos of hair. At Rs. 3,400 per kilo they will get over Rs. 3,74,000 for it.Kamal, from Perambur in Chennai, who they regularly supply to, has paid an advance of Rs. 10 lakh to ensure the hair keeps coming in. The most Anandan has collected in a day is one tonne of human hair. His brother Kumars operation is much more modest. Kumars youngest son, Hari, has dropped out of school to help his father. Every day they set out in Haris motorcycle. The son drops the father off in a faraway town to forage for hair and ranges further afield, meeting up back at home, the father finding a bus to head back.There are smaller collectors: By the main road, east of Vellore, in Wallajahpettai, Ekambaram is drying hair on the road, his lungi hitched up almost to his chest, his shirt wet with sweat. Kamal examines the hair being dried, and then goes into the room where Ekambaram, 67, has lived alone since his wife died eight years ago, paying a rent of Rs. 500 per month. Ekambaram has been buying hair since 1965 when it sold for Rs. 7 a kilo, going around on a bicycle exchanging chikku mudi (ball of comb waste hair) with sticky sweets he made, heating a kilo or two of sugar till it became liquid, pouring it into a plate coated with oil, mixing it with colour, waiting for it to cool and shaping it into stick sweets to hand out to children and women in exchange for hair.Kamal has given an advance of Rs. 50,000 to keep Ekambaram incentivised. In the room he sleeps, there are calendars with pictures of gods and a heap of hair which he has brought from conservancy workers in Vellore. Kamal sorts through the hair separating them into two heaps and weighs them separately  two kilos and two hundred grams in all. They haggle good-naturedly over the price of the smaller pile of hair. Later he takes out some of the hair and asks if there is anything noticeably unusual about it. To touch it is like any other black chutti hair but to Kamals expert eyes this is grey hair that has been coloured black, hair which sells for far less, about Rs. 1,200 per kilo. He keeps rubbing some strands of hair between his thumb and index finger and shows us the fingers. They have faint traces of black now. Half the trick in this trade is to identify chutti hair that has been dyed just by a quick glance.Kamal remembers the most he has collected in a week: six tonnes. A couple of years ago, his stock was tight, and there was demand. Kamal removed the seats from the back of his Tata Sumo, and along with a helper, took off on a giant sweeping circle driving through small villages and then towns and cities, Rajampettah, Kadapa, Ongole, Vellore, Ranipet, Hosur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, sleeping in cheap rooms where they were available or on concrete by the Sumo parked in petrol pumps.Two ends of the spectrumThe smallest collectors live out in the open. At Officers Colony, Ayanavaram, west Chennai, at the curve of Barton Wright Road by a nondescript temple sit Vadivel, his wife Baika and their children, leaning against the concrete picket fence, sorting hair. Children, home for vacation from school near Salem where they study, are playing in the early afternoon sun, waiting for the meal to be cooked, across the road in an open fire. Mathi (sardine) and rice today. Here many families sleep under the blanket of stars, menfolk mostly sloshed. At 1.40 in the afternoon, Vadivel has alcohol on his breath. A bunch of corporation conservancy workers pass by. They sell Vadivel and others like him hair regularly, hair some 18,000 of them sweep up along the roads of 465 sq. km. of Chennai corporation area. Into the more crowded streets with a heavy population density women methodically roam, setting out early in the morning, and returning to cook late in the afternoon while the men do gas repair work and clean wells.A fancier name for hair collectors, sort of like a kabadiwallah , is hair aggregator. This is the term George Cherian, the CEO of Raj Hair International, uses. He is on top of the chain, one of the biggest hair exporters, one of about 50 who form the core of the business. At his plush office on Maloney Road, Chennai, he estimates the number of such aggregators in the country at roughly 80,000. Chennai and Eluru account for the biggest concentration of Remy hair exporters as well, about 150. The number of product manufacturers is way more.Benjamin Cherian, Georges father, who has been sending hair to 56 countries for 35 years now, has a couple of dreams that he wishes could be quickly fulfilled. He says only 20% of the villages of the country are covered by hair collection of the type that has been described here. Under the Swachh Bharat dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Benjamin feels if each village could set up a system to collect hair, not only would the villages be cleaner, it would effortlessly provide employment as well as export revenue to the country.If southern gods like hair, the West loves it. Once processed, the hair sells at an average of $400 a kilo, depending on the length of the hair; hair lengths of 8-11 inches cost $100 a kilo while 30 inches sells at $700 a kilo. Benjamin says former U.S. First Lady Michelle Obamas extensions are courtesy Remy hair sourced through his company. The same is the story of extensions worn by people such as singers Shakira and Queen Latifah and actress Sofia Vergara. Hair extensions that were made from hair he exports have also featured in, among other films, Hunger Games , The Chronicles of Narnia , Pirates of the Caribbean , X-Men , 50 First Dates , The Ring , and Planet of the Apes .Raj Hair International exports about 12 tonnes of finished hair products per year; to send this much they have to process twice the amount of hair, 24,000 kilos; 20,000 kilos of non-Remy hair is exported by him, for which 36,000 kilos have to be processed.Competition from ChinaChinese hair is thicker, twice that of Indian hair, better for wigs, bleaching. Their hair is not fine, lustrous. To make it that way they have to mix it with Indian hair. The problem is China does business worth $4 billion, over ten times the turnover of India, mostly because of their range of finished hair products such as wigs, extensions, wefts, weaves, root tips.Benjamin Cherians other cherished dream is to prevent the smuggling of chutti hair to Bangladesh and Myanmar and thence to China through Moreh border in Manipur, for which he has even made several representations to the government. The Chinese come and live here and they buy the chutti and ship it. They are in Gudiyatham, for instance, he says. They have been coming for seven years. Palani and his son supply to them. The Chinese pay Rs. 4,000 per kilo of chutti . Now, the Chinese live on the outskirts of Bengaluru where they have a godown, says Yogalakshmi.Whether Benjamin Cherians dreams come true or not, the future of dead hair looks secure. As he puts it, So long as men and women want to look beautiful, we are in business.The Chinese come and live here and they buy the chutti hair and ship it. They have been coming for several years.Benjamin CherianRaj Hair International"
