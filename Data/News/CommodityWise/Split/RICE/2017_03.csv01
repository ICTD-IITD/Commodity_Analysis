Sunilkumar launched the Aranmula Rice brand at a public function held at the village headquarters on May 19.Samiti leaders upsetLeaders of the Thechikkavu-Pannivelimoola-Thoombidy Padashekhara Samiti that has successfully carried out cultivation in 14 acres in the Aranmula Puncha are upset that they were not invited for the official launch of the Aranmula Rice.Though the padashekhara samiti had made preparations to open a Aranmula Rice shop at Aranmula with the Ministers consent, it had to drop the plan for reasons best known to the local MLA and the authorities concerned, alleged P.N. Thomas and R. Geethakrishnan, samiti leaders.Ironically, BJP leaders who had staged a dharna against the harvest festival were specially invited for the programme, they alleged.Anti-Airport Coordination Committee convener Pradeep Ayroor alleged that the Minister, who was not supposed mix politics in the Mission Green Aranmula programme, had failed to ensure the presence of leaders like BJP State president Kummanam Rajashekharan; P. Prasad of the CPI; V.S. Vijayan, former State Biodiversity Board chairman; R. Sreeranganathan, environmentalist; and K.K. Royson of the Congress who spearheaded the historic Aranmula land struggle that ultimately paved way for reviving paddy cultivation in the Puncha. The paddy harvested from the fields where the Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sowed the seeds at the launch of the Harita Keralam project at Aranmula was not used for making the Governments new brand of Aranmula tice, Mr. Royson alleged.Good workHowever, the farming community in Aranmula are all praise for the good work done by District Collector R. Girija, and Special Officer J. Sajeev. Mr. Thomas laments that there were also attempts to demoralise those officials and other stakeholders who had earnestly worked for the success of the venture."

Mukkulam taking out a rally against a private incinerator at Kariyapatti on Thursday.MA26-RALLYWith the high-level of pollution caused by a private incinerator that had reportedly claimed several lives in villages around A. Mukkulam, the village could get the dubious distinction of the graveyard of Tamil Nadu, said former State Minister Thangam Thennarasu.Addressing a massive all-party protest meeting organised here on Thursday, the Tiruchuli MLA, belonging to the DMK, said that Chennai was known as the Detroit of the South, Thanjavur as the Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu.But at a time when the people of several villages around A. Mukkulam were protesting against the incinerator where biomedical waste, including human organs, were being burnt, the district administration had allowed a second unit of dumping dyeing unit waste on the same premises.It looks like the increased pollution is going to spread diseases among the people of more villages, and A. Mukkulam would be called the graveyard of Tamil Nadu in the future, he said.After the revolutionary protest by the youth demanding jallikattu and the protest in Neduvasal against hydrocarbon extraction, the villagers, especially women who gathered in large numbers, had created a revolution by uniting all parties for the common cause.If the State Government that had earlier promised to close down the polluting unit of Ramky Energy and Environment Limited, the protest would snowball with national leaders converging for a massive protest in Virudhunagar district, Mr. Thennarasu said.The MLA said that people should create awareness of the ill-effects of the deadly plant among other villagers so that they would realise the lurking danger, he added.Leaders of various political parties, including former MLA Ramasamy (CPI), Arjunan (CPI-M), C. Raja (Congress), Balagangadaran (AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma), Murugan (VCK) and Pounraj (Puthiya Tamilagam), took part in the protest."

No seed was sown on the land identified for the airport project or the land in possession of KGS company, he alleged.Even Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had sown the seeds on the land owned by a private party and the Agriculture Department should clarify the area and quantum of paddy cultivated there.The government should clarify whether the paddy harvested from the land where the Chief Minister had launched cultivation was used for making the so-called Aranmula Rice, he said.He said paddy cultivation was carried out at the Punnackad and Neervilakom fields and there were reports of loss of huge quantity of paddy harvested there.He demanded a Vigilance probe into the alleged irregularities and corruption in the name of paddy cultivation and stream restoration at Aranmula."

DeepakK_R_DEEPAKThe agonising wait for cash compensation by fishermen affected by the annual fishing ban for 61 days, which began on April 15, continues due to procedural delays.Even as there are innumerable complaints regarding denial of compensation to those who submitted their claims last year, all those rendered jobless this time have been demanding early disbursal of the amount to make both ends meet.The State government has dispensed with the distribution of rice and, instead, introduced payment of Rs. 4,000 per eligible family.There are also complaints that 1,300 fishermen, who were found to be eligible last time, have not yet got the amount due to various reasons. We want the release of the amount on time so that we can plan the monthly budget, Chikati Chinna Rao, who works as a khalasi on a mechanised boat, told The Hindu .Each mechanised boat engages an eight-member crew, which includes a driver, a cook, and khalasis. In all, 700 boats are operated at the Visakhapatnam fishing harbour.According to sources, the government has sanctioned Rs. 23 crore towards payment of compensation this year. It is yet to be released.Last year, we got the amount after the end of the ban period. Now, the government should pay us at least Rs. 150 per day in lieu of loss of livelihood during the annual crop holiday period, said Visakhapatnam Fishing Harbour Workers Union general secretary J.D. Naidu.Repair worksThe ban period is utilised for overhauling and repairing the boats.As we are facing finance problem, we are yet to start painting, plumbing, engine repair, and other works on the boats, said Ch. Satyanarayana Murthy, president, Dolphin Boat Operators Welfare Association. AP Mechanised Boat Operators Welfare Association president P.Ch. Appa Rao said the treasury was playing spoilsport in most cases in releasing the amounts sanctioned by the government, He alleged that nearly Rs. 1 crore sanctioned for release towards oil subsidy lapsed last year due to the indifferent attitude of the Treasury Department.The issue had been brought to the notice of Visakha South MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar."
593e00b47be9e00dabcc7777,Thought for food,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/thought-for-food/article18662794.ece,2017-05-31,"One of the unfortunate paradoxes of our lives today is that despite adequate food production and unimaginable advances in technology, one in three persons worldwide is not getting enough of the right food to eat and approximately 800 million of seven billion sleep hungry every night. Not surprisingly, this makes poor diet the No. 1 risk factor by far, for the global burden of disease. Poor diets globally are more responsible for ill health as compared with the combined effect of drugs, tobacco and alcohol. Women and children continue to be the most vulnerable, with 156 million stunted children in the world and 40% women anaemic. Add to this the fact that the world adds 200,000 new people to its population every day, of which India adds 58,000. This translates to the need to feed two billion more people by 2050 and to support a higher demand for major crops, estimated to increase by 50%, from 2.5 to 3.5 billion tonnes.Staying on targetIt is therefore with compelling reason that Target 3 for the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 is to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer level, and reduce food losses along production and supply chains including post-harvest losses. Food loss is valued at $1 trillion globally by the Food and Agriculture Organisation, enough to feed the 800 million who sleep hungry every night. Of this, over 200 million are in India, a country that grows sufficient food to feed its burgeoning population of 1.3 billion.The SDGs have clearly put the spotlight on food loss and waste, and we are beginning to see more attentive discussion on the subject. At the recently held Food Congress in Dusseldorf in early May 2017, the focus was on identifying possible solutions for both  through better farming practices, use of technology, better information, change in consumer behaviour, etc. Estimates of food waste and food loss range between 30 and 50% for both developed and emerging countries.In developed countries food waste happens more at the consumer household level, where more is purchased than consumed; and in emerging economies, it is the supply chain that leads to food loss during harvest, storage or in transit, largely due to poor infrastructure and inadequately aligned processes. As an example, Indias cold storage requirement is 66 million tonnes, and the national storage capacity currently available is approximately 30 million tonnes. Investment in creating adequate cold storage capacity alone will stem food loss substantially. With increasing wealth, India is, ironically, home to both food waste and food loss.In either scenario, food that is produced (using depleting and critical resources such as water) but not consumed is a colossal waste which we cannot afford to ignore. Food loss is also nutrition loss, productivity loss and therefore GDP loss. The 40% food loss in India translates to approximately $7.5 billion, and for a country where agriculture contributes 15% to GDP and employs 53% of the workforce, this is clearly unaffordable.These are serious statistics, and unless there is an effort to address food loss factors systemically, the state of health and nutrition of our people will continue to be inadequate, as food loss means loss of macronutrients such as calories, fats, proteins; but even more alarming, it means loss of micronutrients because foods that are rich in micronutrients are also perishable  fruits, vegetables, poultry, fish, dairy, etc. Additionally, with urbanisation and rising incomes, the length of the food value chain also increases, as what people eat becomes less and less connected to where they live.The Global Nutrition Report 2016 has highlighted Indias overall tardy progress in addressing chronic undernutrition, manifest in stunting (low weight for age), wasting (low weight for height) and micronutrient deficiency or hidden hunger.With 17% of the worlds population, India remains home to a quarter of the worlds undernourished people, a third of the worlds underweight children and a quarter of the worlds hungry. This demographic cannot possibly result in a productive and efficient workforce, or be converted into any meaningful economic dividend. The World Happiness Report 2017, which looks at quality of peoples life beyond GDP and per capita income and includes economic variables, social factors and health indicators, has ranked India at 122 of 155 countries. Indias decline in 2014-16, compared with 2005-07, is on account of poor and slow progress on social factors and health indicators.Agriculture has to be one of the drivers of Indias growth, and even though we are the worlds third largest producer of food, our agriculture growth has fallen well below the targeted 4% over the last 15 years. According to the International Food Policy Research Institute, India needs to at least double its investment in agricultural research to double farmers incomes by 2022. This will not happen only with a focus on rice and wheat  more diversity is needed, with the addition of vegetables, fruits and dairy farming.Harnessing technology to increase agricultural productivity, where we lag both our potential and competitive benchmarks will be critical to our overall well-being. As an example, since the 1960s Indias groundwater irrigation has increased dramatically, and since the 1980s groundwater levels have been dropping, thus stressing the system. Groundwater recharge therefore becomes a critical variable to augment agricultural productivity. Further, imports of agricultural commodities have increased from 4% of GDP in 2008-09 to 5.5% of GDP in 2013-14, according to the Economic Survey. Edible oil imports alone in the last year cost us Rs. 65,000 crore ($10 billion). This need not be the case in future.Dignified quality of lifeTo provide even a baseline and dignified quality of life to its people, India has to address enhancing agricultural productivity, crop diversification and eliminating food loss and waste with a firm resolve, backed with the right and timely action. The last must be done on priority as it deals with food already available. So the key question is, how do we minimise food loss given that the government wants this, businesses want this, and people want this?There is clearly a structural and behavioural component to this, and the door is open for investment in food system infrastructure: storage, transportation, processing, etc; investment in information systems that help identify loss by crop and region so solutions can be specifically tailored to the problem; use of technology to better connect supply and demand; public-private partnerships with companies to reduce spoilage and loss; creation of food banking networks that work with civil society and development agencies on getting food already available to those that need it. Among the several priorities we have, minimising food loss has the potential to be transformative in multiple ways.Vinita Bali is chair, Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition.

593e01207be9e00dabcc77ce,Connecting the dots after three years in the saddle,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/connecting-the-dots-after-three-years-in-the-saddle/article18596515.ece,2017-05-29,"In 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won the mandate to rule India and took power after 10 years of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule. The BJP-led regime has now completed three years in office  on May 25 this year  which is also a fair enough time to critically examine the track record of this government. I let the facts speak for themselves in light of a series of unkept promises.Upholding farmers welfareIn one of his Chai Pe Charcha programmes on March 20, 2014, Narendra Modi, then Gujarat Chief Minister, termed farmer suicides as a national agony and added that the NDA (National Democratic Alliance) shall stand behind all farmers hit by natural calamities like the recent hailstorms, or economic crises. I shall not be able to sleep peacefully till I do something for you. He wanted a system where with the infusion of modern technology, water resources and efforts to double agriculture output, farmers were not driven to end their lives. Thus his attention was focussed on ensuring farmer welfare.According to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, titled Accidental deaths and suicides in India, 2015, the number of farmers who committed suicide was 8,007. The corresponding number in 2014 was 5,650. Thus there has been a 42% increase in loss of lives between 2014 and 2015. After blaming the UPA and its policies for farmer suicides, in the run-up to the 2014 general election and much after, this government now attributes suicides to reasons which it says have nothing to do with its policies.For instance, in reply to a question in Parliament on July 24, 2015, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh even cited among several other reasons, love affairs and impotency as key factors. To make matters worse, Haryanas Agriculture Minister, O.P. Dhankar, in a statement on April 29, 2015, termed farmers who commit suicide as cowards.Now back to Mr. Modi. Addressing a rally in Pathankot in Punjab, on April 25, 2014, as the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, he said: If the NDA comes to power, it will ensure remunerative prices to the farmers by adding 50% profit into the peasants input cost. In addition he said: We will fix the Minimum Support Price of crops incorporating 50% profit in farmers cost of production including seed, irrigation, manure, labour. And he ended by saying that no one will be allowed to loot farmers.Fast forward to February 2015. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Modi government did a U-turn, stating that the Minimum Support Price (MSP) cannot be fixed on the basis of cost+50 percent as that would distort the market. Between 2009 and 10, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 950 a quintal as against a production cost of Rs. 670 a quintal  translating to a 42% margin of profit for farmers.In 2015-16, the MSP for paddy was Rs. 1,410 a quintal against an estimated production cost of Rs. 1,324 a quintal, which is only a 6.5% margin of profit to farmers. It is clear that the procurement prices of wheat, paddy and other agricultural produce have been much less than the price received by farmers during the UPAs tenure.Between 2014 and 2016, the Modi government hiked the MSP of rice only by 3.9% per year. In comparison, during 2011 and 2013, the UPA increased the MSP of rice by 9.5% per year. For wheat, the figure is 4.1% per year under the Modi government as against 7% per year under the UPA.Bringing back black moneyAnother major issue for the BJP government has been the subject of black money. In his Chai Pe Charcha campaign, launched in Ahmedabad on February 12, 2014, Mr. Modi had said: The whole country is worried about black money... We will bring back each and every penny deposited abroad by Indian citizens. I am committed to this because this money belongs to the poor people of India and no one has the right to do this kind of anti-national activity.The facts. In the last three years, the Modi government has received the names of those with illegal bank accounts in foreign havens. Yet, they remain a closely guarded secret.On October 17, 2014, nearly five months after assuming office, the Modi government told the Supreme Court that it could not reveal the names of Indians with accounts in foreign banks due to double taxation avoidance treaties with other countries  a position taken by the UPA. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley dismissed the governments reluctance in revealing the names by saying: Is the present NDA government led by Modi in any way reluctant to make some names public? Certainly not. We have no difficulty in making names public. But they can be made public only in accordance with due process of law.The Modi government now states that any account opened after 2017 will be made public, pursuant to an agreement between India and foreign powers under the Common Reporting Standards (CRS) or the Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Informations, an information standard for the automatic exchange of information (AEoI).The resulting question is this. Why not the names of account holders before 2017? This was a demand made on the floor of the House by the BJP and the rest of the Opposition who attacked the UPA for not revealing the names of account holders.Job creationLet me focus on another Modi promise  of creating one crore jobs. Addressing an election rally in Agra, on November 22, 2013, Mr. Modi had said, If the BJP comes to power, it will provide one crore jobs which the UPA government could not do despite announcing it before the last Lok Sabha polls. Incidentally, the point about farmer interests becoming paramount under BJP rule was also made at this rally.The facts. In the three years 2009 to 2011, when Indias GDP was still growing at an average 8.5%, the organised sector was producing on average 9.5 lakh new jobs every year. In the last two years, 2015 and 2016, average employment generation has plummeted to less than 2 lakh jobs a year. This is less than 25% of the annual employment generated before 2011. In 2015, employment generated in eight labour intensive sectors collapsed to an all-time low of 1.5 lakh jobs.By adding service sectors to the organised sector employment data, the figures show a slight improvement in the growth of new jobs in 2016. New jobs generated increased from 1.55 lakh in 2015 to 2.31 lakh in 2016. But this is still only 25% of the organised sector jobs generated in 2009.Data on the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act show that unemployment continues unabated, and in fact seems to be worsening. In Mr. Modis first year as Prime Minister, 4.65 crore households demanded work in the scheme. In 2015-16, this number had increased by 15% to reach 5.3 crore. In 2016-17, it further increased by 6% to reach a staggering 5.69 crore households in search of work.Another promise  on the safety of women. In a public rally in Pune, on November 1, 2013, Mr. Modi, while accusing the Congress of failing to ensure safety for women in the capital, said: In spite of Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi being women, Delhi is known as the rape capital. People dont know who to trust anymore.Womens safetyInterestingly, at the BJPs National Executive in New Delhi, in January 2014, Mr. Modi, while speaking about empowering women and ensuring that they went from being homemakers to nation builders, said: What is happening with our mothers and sisters in the country leaves us shame-faced. Dignity of women should be a commitment.The facts. According to an NCRB report, though there was a slight reduction by 3.1% in crime against women in 2015 as compared to 2014, there was an increase of 2.5% in instances of sexual offences against women. There was also an increase in instances of kidnapping and abduction of women in 2015. Delhi recorded the highest overall rate of crime against women. Data from Delhi, the epicentre of the Nirbhaya rape protest movement, shows that, contrary to expectations, under a new government and with a new law  in 2013, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2013 or the Anti-Rape Bill, later called the Nirbhaya Act, came into existence  the number of rapes has gone up in the capital of India. As in Delhi, national data on rape too showed a substantial increase in 2015, when compared with 2012 data. In 2012, there were 24,923 cases while in 2015, there were 36,651 cases.Curbing inflationAnother Modi statement made in early 2014: The Congress had promised to curb inflation in 100 days, but did they live up to their promises? Dont trust those who betray public trust. If the governments of Vajpayeeji and Morarji Desai could stop price rise, why cant we? The BJP government in 2014 will do it, I assure you.The facts. Food inflation has not shown any trends of reversing. Instead, prices of essential commodities are on the rise, with pulses especially selling at Rs. 100-Rs. 150 a kg. Petrol and diesel prices continue to be raised with shocking regularity. Industrial production is down, the rupee is down and somehow people have stopped believing in GDP figures that this government relies upon.On corruptionFinally, I focus on yet another Modi promise  of delivering a corruption-free India. At a rally in Sujanpur, Himachal Pradesh, on February 16, 2014, Mr. Modi had said:  Mere liye na koi aagey, na peechhey. Kiske liye bhrashtachaar karunga (I have no family ties. I am single. Who will I be corrupt for)?He added, This mind and body is totally devoted to the nation. Then again on February 23, 2014, he tweeted: When we come to power, we will serve as Chowkidars who will never allow any Hand to loot coffers of our nation. Again on April 13, 2014, he tweeted: [The] NDA is firm on its commitment to create a corruption-free India so that best opportunities are created for our youth.The facts. There has been an increase  by 67%  in complaints received of corruption in various government departments. According to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the Railways tops the list with over 11,000 complaints.The probity watchdog received a total of 49,847 complaints in 2016, as against 29,838 in 2015  an increase of about 67%, according to the CVCs annual report tabled recently in Parliament.Kapil Sibal is a former Union Minister and senior Congress leader"
593e018a7be9e00dabcc7835,5% GST on hulled grain may hit millet hard,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/5-gst-on-hulled-grain-may-hit-millets-hard/article18621013.ece,2017-05-30,"The 5% tax on hulled grain, under the Goods and Service Tax (GST) to be rolled out from July 1, is going to be a dampener for many. For the first time, millet rice is coming into the tax bracket, and this will make it dearer for consumers.Known for its nutritional value, millets are fast replacing traditional paddy rice  known for its high glycemic index  across the country. The production and area under cultivation of this dry land crop had dwindled over decades before picking up steadily when the demand for urban consumers increased. The 5% tax is now being seen as an impediment both by the millet-based entrepreneurs as well as scientists working on the crop.The GST Council, in the third week of May, notified 5% tax on cereal grain, which is hulled. An exemption was given to paddy rice, which is also hulled. Of the nine type of millets cultivated in the country, six require hulling and are termed as husked or hulled millets, or millet rice. Foxtail millet, Barnyard millet, Little millet, Kodo millet, Proso millet and Browntop millet cannot be consumed without hulling, while the other three  ragi, jowar and bajra  can be ground into flour and consumed without hulling.A lot of people are now turning to millet because of the increasing incidence of lifestyle disorders. Bringing millet under the tax bracket would be an impediment for the growth of millet-based businesses that are working on very thin margins already. A Rs. 5 increase on a Rs. 100-worth millet product will also reduce consumption since it is a cost-sensitive market, Arun Kaulige of Kaulige Foods told The Hindu . Since the millet business is highly unorganised and still nascent, we do not have much say either. However, we plan to approach the Finance ministry seeking relief, said Mr. Arun, who incidentally has also started an online campaign seeking exemption for millet from GST. The tax on millet will work at cross purposes, especially when the Union government is trying to promote production and consumption of millets through Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millet Promotion, and State governments are also offering financial assistance to farmers, said Krishnaprasad of Sahaja Samruddha, which has been working for millet promotion.Dry land crop millets are also being seen as an alternative to many water-intensive crops such as paddy and wheat. While it causes less burden on the States exchequer since no irrigation facility is required, its health benefits are very high, experts point out.The Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) is set to seek exemption of GST on millets. According to the Director of IIMR, Vilas A. Tonapi, the GST on millet rice will not only affect consumers, but also farmers. Increase in cost will hamper production. Since millets are nutritionally superior to rice, they should be exempted from tax, and not discriminated against. He also said that the institute is in the process of approaching the authorities concerned, seeking exemption to millet rice on the lines of exemption given to paddy rice."

(Source: PTI) Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said people are not aware of how much subsidy the Centre was providing them. (Source: PTI)State governments should display at PDS shops the foodgrain subsidy borne by both the Centre and states that will prevent the latter from hijacking the credit for selling highly-subsidised grains to the poor, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said on Monday.Wheat and rice are being sold through PDS (public distribution system) shops, also known as fair price or ration shops, at a highly-subsidised rate of Rs 2 and Rs 3 per kg, respectively, as per the Food Security Law.It is unfortunate that most states are taking credit for this even though the entire PDS foodgrain subsidy is borne by the central government. So, we have asked states to display the details at PDS shops, Paswan told reporters.The Centre bears a subsidy of Rs 22 on wheat and Rs 29.64 per kg on rice. Except for one or two states like Tamil Nadu that are further subsidising it and selling it free of cost, others are not shelling out (anything) from their pocket, he said.Paswan further said the states have been asked to prominently display the foodgrains subsidy on a board at all ration shops for public awareness.More public awareness is required on this issue because for instance in Bihar the poor think that Nitish Kumar is giving foodgrains at Rs 2-3 per kg. People were not aware that the Centre was providing it, he added.The central governments annual food subsidy bill is over Rs 1 lakh crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Picture by Ashok Sinha The monsoon will take another three-four days to hit Bihar, the Met department said on Thursday. Earlier, the rains were expected to arrive in the state between June 12 and 14. The monsoon usually arrives in Bihar by June 10. Though rain lashed Patna early morning on Thursday for nearly 45 minutes from around 5.30am, there was no respite from the scorching sun and high humidity - that made the temperature seem higher than it actually was - throughout the day. ""It feels like a heat wave,"" said Santosh, who works at a electronic goods shop on New Dakbunglow Road. ""It seems we have to make some offering to God to please him so that it rains here."" Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""Monsoon has been delayed in the state by three to four days. Now it is expected to hit Bihar after June 17. We were expecting monsoon to arrive in Bihar by June 13 as a very strong low-pressure area was witnessed in the Bay of Bengal. However, the warm westerlies changed the direction of the trough line of the monsoon."" A trough line is an imaginary line that generally extends from west to east. Weather-related activities like rainfall and thunderstorms are very common in and around the region a trough line passes through. Sengupta attributed the early-morning showers to localised factors and a cyclonic circulation prevailing over the state. ""In this season (pre-monsoon), local systems develop frequently. This was the reason behind today's short spell of rain in the state capital,"" he said. The monsoon has not yet covered the entire country as it still eludes Bihar and Jharkhand, he said. ""We can say that the system responsible for the onset of monsoon is lying on the Bihar border and it will take another couple of days to break in the state,"" he added. A forecast by private weather agency Skymet said: ""A cyclonic circulation is embedded on the trough over east Uttar Pradesh. Due to these systems, good rain is likely to occur over Bihar and the foothills of east Uttar Pradesh. Meanwhile Gangetic Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha may also witness thundershower activities during the next 24 hours."" A Met official said a western disturbance was seen over Jammu and Kashmir. ""Its induced cyclonic circulation is over Punjab and adjoining areas. It will rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Showers today in some parts of Bihar can be attributed to this factor also,"" the official said. At other places in the country there was excess monsoon rain, the official said, including over north-eastern states such as Assam and Meghalaya.As per Skymet, during the past 24 hours, the country received 49 per cent surplus rain. While the south peninsula is surplus by 29 per cent, central India has seen 42 per cent more rain than usual. ""The timely onset of the south-west monsoon is crucial for sowing of kharif (summer) crops such as paddy, and a deficit in rainfall may hit rice output,"" said Gopal Sharma, a farmer in Rohtas district."

The health centre, which falls under Katigorah constituency, is around 22km from Silchar. The three nurses who left the staff quarters are Sangita Devi, 31, Jessy Laltranpui, 25, and K.K. Kheujiliu Rongmei, 27. All three are from Jiribam in Manipur and worked in the maternity ward. The health centre is run by two doctors, including the doctor in-charge Abdul Barik, and five nurses, including Sangita, Jessy and Rongmei. On an average it has around 140 to 150 patients everyday. The last robbery took place on Friday night around 1.40am when an armed gang broke into Sangita's quarters of the health centre and looted around Rs 10,000, gold ornaments, gas cylinder, mobile phones, ATM cards and a few other items. She lived there with her husband, child and sister-in-law. Sangita lodged an FIR with Katigorah police outpost yesterday afternoon in which she stated that the miscreants gained entry into the quarters by breaking a portion of the main door. After entering the house, they assaulted Sangita's sister-in-law Smita Devi, 25, as a result of which she was injured. The gang members threatened them with dire consequences if they shouted or did not abide by what they said. After the gang left, Smita, who was bleeding, was rushed to the health centre where she was given medical aid. Thereafter, Barik was informed about the incident. Though Laltranpui and Rongmei were not directly affected by the incident, they left the health centre out of fear. Barik said there had been a few thefts in the recent past and though FIRs were lodged, police could find any clue in these cases. The last theft took place around two months back in another quarters. An LED television, an inverter, a battery, a bag of 30kg rice and a few other items were stolen. Barik alleged that the police demanded money from the hospital staff, whenever they approached them regarding such incidents (thefts, robberies). Speaking to The Telegraph, Katigorah police outpost in-charge Shankar Mondal said a probe has been initiated into the Friday incident. He said the area, where the staff quarters are located, was vulnerable to crimes as it was quite far from the health centre. ""There is no watchman or security guard at the staff quarters, which makes them even more prone to crimes,"" Mondal said. He said the area did not have a boundary wall for which accessibility was an easy affair. The hospital authority should appoint a security guard and construct a boundary wall, he added. He dismissed the allegation of bribe by policemen. The investigating officer in the case, Mohitosh Nath Laskar, today said that a probe was under way and the police were trying their best to identify and catch the gang involved in such robberies."

Insiders, however, recalled that the name of Kovind, along with that of Droupadi Murmu, was all along on their mind since they were picked by the prime minister to occupy the Raj Bhavans in Patna and Ranchi two years ago.A soft-spoken Kovind made it a point to call on veterans L K Advani as well as Murli Manohar Joshi to take their blessings after his name was announced. On the day of his nomination, Kovind held on to the hands of Advani and Joshi to show everyone that the seniors, who could have felt left out of the race, were also supporting him. Finally, Modi too was seen holding Advani's hands as cameras clicked away.Shekhar Iyer, New DelhiQuick planThe Opposition is already rattled by the JD(U)s support to BJP Presidential candidate Ram Nath Kovind. Therefore, it was no surprise that the parties did not want to leave anything to chance when they met to choose their candidate on June 22. While Uttar Pradesh-based parties SP and BSP were in a tight spot because Kovind hails from the state, NCP chief Sharad Pawar was wavering on whether to announce a candidate on the same day.Opposition leaders were still uncertain if all their plans would fall in line when they turned up at the meeting that decided Meira Kumars candidature. It was then that senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury came up with a plan  get the signatures of the leaders of 17 parties on Kumars nomination papers at the meeting venue itself before venturing out of the room after the press conference.Shemin Joy, New DelhiSharmishtas strikesPresident Pranab Mukherjees daughter Sharmishta Mukherjee has not minced words in criticising West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her governments mishandling of the Darjeeling agitation. Blaming her for triggering a huge crisis during peak tourist season in the hills, she reminded the chief minister that the language issue had to be handled carefully. In a newspaper article, Sharmishta recalled several instances when row over languages even led to creation of a new country, like Bangladesh, and trouble over Hindi left a divide in the south in the 1950s and 1960s.Sharmishtas piece has come as a surprise to many. Only two months ago, Mamata was not averse to backing her as a Rajya Sabha candidate from the state if the Congress nominated her. Considering that West Bengal CM has had close ties with her father, Sharmishtas criticism of Didi has set tongues wagging. So far, Sharmishta had confined herself to Delhi politics. But is she considering her home state of Bengal for future course of action?SI, New DelhiRice blackmailWith rumours of plastic rice spreading on the social media, the owner of a hotel in Chennai claimed that a few persons, supposedly from the media, threatened to spoil the image of his restaurant if he did not take care of them. Two persons argued with Kumar, the restaurant owner, and said that the food they had bought from his restaurant was of bad quality. The hotelier apologised and returned the money. However, the duo returned that evening with two others, who claimed that they were from the media. They said that the rice used by the hotel was plastic rice.Though Kumar reasoned with them that even the government had clarified that there was no plastic rice, one of the mediaperson started bargaining. He demanded money from me and threatened that if I fail to offer, he would publish a news against my hotel, Kumar said. It was only when Kumar said he would lodge a complaint with the police, that the four left the place.R Sathyanarayana, ChennaiSenas recordVeteran Congressman Narayan Ranes son Nitesh Rane, had taken a dig at the Shiv Sena by writing to the Guinness World Records to feature a place in the record books for the most repeated threats to withdraw from a government.

How can two persons from the same cabinet give two version, he asked.In reply, Ramesh Kumar said he just wanted to confirm the fact through tests.We took samples of eggs, rice and sugar from the districts where such cases were reported in media. But all the tests came negative. Talk of plastic presence in food is only a rumour. One needs to spend at least `200 to make one kilo plastic rice, while rice is available in market for just `40. Why would one invest on expensive plastic rice, he asked.BJP MLC Raghunath Rao Malkhapure raised doubt if any foreign agency is behind this. In 1972 when there was food grain scarcity in India, we imported wheat from foreign countries and got parthenium seeds. Today, this weed is grown at many places, he said.UT Khader, food and civil supplies minister said there are also rumours that the rice given under Anna Bhagya scheme has plastic content. We procure rice from Chhattisgarh through Food corporation of India. We do not get rice from any private agency and there is no question of plastic presence, he said."
5991a0499855b71bdf9df9c0,Why natural gas could be Qatar's trump card in Gulf dispute,http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-natural-gas-could-be-qatar-s-trump-card-in-gulf-dispute/story-i8VHURXpqmeLxWXGClRs9K.html,2017-06-12,"Natural gas built the high-rises of Qatars capital, put the Al-Jazeera satellite news network on the air and a fleet of passengers jets for its state carrier in the sky. Now, it may be what protects Qatar as it is in the centre of the worst diplomatic crisis to strike the Gulf in decades.As the worlds biggest exporter of liquid natural gas, Qatars supplies keep homes warm in the British winter, fuel Asian markets and even power the electrical grid of the United Arab Emirates, one of the main countries that has cut ties to the energy-rich nation.So far, its supplies have continued uninterrupted since the diplomatic dispute began last week. Natural gas markets have yet to respond to the rift and prices have remained stable. But Qatar wields a potential economic weapon if the crisis escalates and countries around the world that depend on its supply may find themselves needing to side with the tiny nation that is home to a major US military installation.If Qatari gas exports were to be blocked, countries like Britain, Japan, South Korea and China would have an energy crisis and would have to scramble to get their energy elsewhere, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Seattle-based research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who has extensively studied Qatar.For any small country, particularly a small country in the Gulf surrounded by much larger and potentially expansionary powers, having international partnerships is a key tool of your external security, he said. I think that may be what the Qataris are banking on right now.Qatar, a country of 2.2 million people where citizens make up over 10% of the population, discovered the offshore North Field in 1971, the same year it became independent. It took years for engineers to discover the fields vast reserves, which shot Qatar to No. 3 in world rankings, behind Russia and Iran, with which it shares the North Field.It began exporting natural gas in 1997, just after Qatari Crown Prince Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani seized power from his father, Sheikh Khalifa, in a palace coup. Sheikh Hamad used revenue from the natural gas to pursue a diplomatic path away from Saudi Arabia, long the heavyweight among Gulf countries. Qatar also secured hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, relying on that money to build stadiums and develop Doha, its capital.But all that time, Qatar kept a wary eye on its neighbours. Though both it and Saudi Arabia practice an ultra-conservative form of Sunni Islam called Wahhabism, Qatar allows women to drive and foreigners to drink alcohol. Qatar also has clashed with Saudi Arabia and Bahrain over territory in the past.As a hedge, Qatar hosts some 10,000 American soldiers and the forward headquarters of the U.S. militarys Central Command. Other nations also operate forces out of Qatar. Its military, numbering around 11,800 troops, is only bigger than Bahrains.They really began an effort to escape the Saudi shadow and to carve out an autonomous regional and foreign policy that would be distinct, Ulrichsen said. It took on much more of an edge in 2011 when they really backed different sides in the Arab Spring. Qatar obviously made a bet that Islamists and the Muslim Brotherhood would be the group to back and clearly that over time failed to pay off.That support sits at the heart of Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE severing off diplomatic ties June 5 and cutting off Qatar from its land, sea and air routes. So far, Qatar has made a point of not retaliating against those nations.Qatars shipborne exports of liquid natural gas have continued to travel unhindered out of the Persian Gulf as well, though they could be a target if the crisis escalates. Qatars biggest Asian clients are Japan, India and South Korea, according to energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. About a third of British gas supplies come from Qatar, which leads Europe.Saad Sherida al-Kaabi, Qatar petroleums president and CEO, said Saturday that he wanted to assure customers of our determined efforts to continue uninterrupted supplies. A statement from the state-run firm also made a point to note that the UAE, Egypt and Jordan all rely on its natural gas.Qatar could retaliate by shutting down the undersea Dolphin Energy pipeline, which sends about 2 billion cubic feet (56 million cubic meters) of natural gas a day into the UAE, about a third of its daily need. About 200 million cubic feet (5.66 million cubic meters) of that goes onto Oman.Dolphin Energy, owned by the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund called the Mubadala Development Co., French oil giant Total SA and Houston-based Occidental Petroleum, did not respond to a request for comment.Without that natural gas, electricity plants in Dubai and the UAE capital of Abu Dhabi wouldnt be able to power air conditioners to beat the brutal heat of summer now descending on the desert sheikhdoms, nor run its vital desalination plants producing water. It would take time to import that gas from another source.If Qatar was to do anything like that, in Dubai the lights would probably go off, said Christopher Davidson, a professor of Middle East politics at Durham University in Britain. If this were to happen, it would be such an escalation from Qatars side, the UAE and Saudi would up the ante even more. ... If they were to do that, I think it would be no holds barred."

No traces of plastic were found in any of the samples, Kumar said.He said it takes Rs 200 to manufacture one kg of plastic rice. When rice is available at Rs 40 per kg why will anyone manufacture plastic rice and sell it in the market? the minister asked. He also said no case has been registered with regard to the sale of plastic rice or eggs.K T Srikante Gowda (JD-S) said that four people had been admitted to a government hospital in KR Pet in Mandya district after consuming plastic eggs.

We were sitting at a long table and by the time the soup travelled to me at the far end, there was hardly any left. The older members of the group had finished off most of it, leaving very little for us younger ones,"" he says.But this was not the end.""The same thing happened with the fried rice and chowmein and I barely managed to get two spoonfuls of each. The older boys had a great evening at our expense, but I returned home hungry and thirsty,"" Tendulkar recalls the incident in a new book.Hachette India has brought out ""Chase Your Dreams"", an adaptation of Tendulkar's autobiography ""Playing It My Way"", exclusively targeted at children and young adults.""Chase Your Dreams"" is billed as the first children's version of an autobiography by an Indian sportsperson.It tells the inspiring story of India's greatest cricketer through simple prose, call-outs, inspirational notes and comic visuals. The illustrations enable children to experience some of the defining moments in Tendulkar's illustrious career, the publisher says.Tendulkar, who was born to a very close-knit Maharashtrian family in Mumbai's Bandra East and lived in the Sahitya Sahawas colony, considers his mother the best cook who would do anything to see a smile on his face.""She used to make the most delicious fish and prawn curry, baigan bharta and varan bhaat for me, and I owe my appetite and love of food to her,"" he writes.Tendulkar tells many things about his childhood  his keenness on tennis so much so that he even went around with a John McEnroe-like curly mop and hair band, his love for music, how he got his first bicycle, and eventually his extraordinary cricketing journey.""My father set me free at the age of 11 when he told me 'Chase your dreams, but make sure you don't find shortcuts to them',"" he says."

Brunda Sahu, a farmer in Bargarh district, allegedly committed suicide after torching his pest-affected crops. There are allegations that Sahus despair over crop loss was compounded by the apathy of local government officials.Media reports have alleged that the crops were damaged because the pesticides provided were either substandard, or unsuitable for planthoppers. The Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) has sought reports on the suicides from principal secretaries of revenue, agriculture, superintendent of police and collector of Bargarh, officials said.The state government has reportedly announced compensation for farmers who have lost more than a third of their crops. However, the government may not award any compensation to the farmers burning their crops, an official said. It is difficult for government officials to establish the causes and extent of loss if crops are burnt, the official added.The BJP has alleged a scam in the distribution of pesticides in the state. State BJP president Basanta Kumar Panda told The Sunday Express, The Odisha government has given distribution rights of pesticides to an institution named Surabhi. No such institution exists. This, as per my information, will reveal a scam worth Rs 500 crore.Pramod Kumar Mohanty, who is part of a three-member team sent by the state government to test pesticide samples, told The Sunday Express over phone, The samples will have to be tested in Bhubaneswar to determine quality. Mohanty, Deputy Director in the Agriculture Department, also said that Bargarh is the most affected district. Bargarh is referred to as the rice bowl of Odisha.Dr Saurabh Garg, Principal Secretary, Department of Agriculture, said there was no reason to worry. It (BPH) is not an exotic pest. It is local to the area. It is nothing farmers are not aware of. There is no reason for farmers in the state to assume there is a pesticide crisis, he said. The pest attack is a recurrent problem. The government has been aware of it for 17 years. They are apathetic to the plight of farmers in Odisha, said Panda, who is also the MLA from Nuapada.Odishas Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout was unavailable for comment until Monday, his office said.According to Rice Knowledge Bank, a website partnering the Indian Institute of Rice Research, a high number of planthoppers initially turns leaves orange-yellow and then brown and dry, a condition called hopperburn. While hopperburn kills affected plants, BPH can also transmit two incurable diseases, rice ragged stunt and rice grassy stunt, the website notes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev stir the 918-kg concoction.A DRONE camera buzzed around, as did a relentless dragonfly, as 125 kg rice, 45 kg moong dal, 20 kg vegetables, 6.5 kg salt, many kilograms of jowar and bajra, and dollops of desi ghee, went into catapulting the humble khichdi to reluctant stardom at the government-organised World Food India 2017 here on Saturday.In the process, as a proud Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev beamed, the 918-kg concoction also felled a Guinness World record.This is Indias gift to the rest of the world, declared Baba Ramdev, who stirred the mixture with an oar-like ladle, along with the two ministers, as the team of 30 chefs led by Sanjeev Kapoor watched. Ramdev had earlier announced on Twitter he would be at hand to temper the khichdi with his Patanjali ghee. Swasthya ka naya mantra: Bharat ki Khichdi (The new trick to health: Indias khichdi). This is also PM Narendra Modis favourite dish Maybe one day we will celebrate World Khichdi Day like we now celebrate World Yoga Day, he said.We will now pack it in insulated containers and Akshay Patra Foundation and Food Relief will take it across the city to feed the needy, said Kapoor, adding he was very happy with the outcome. He said that the recipe, created by him and his team, had undergone many trials over the last two months  from a watery version to one with jowar and bajra.About all that went into the Saturday mix, chef Akshay Nayyar said, We designed the vessel 25 days ago, had to measure the volume to attempt something big make sure logistics were in place. Its a steam-charged vessel powered by a boiler because India Gate is a no-fire zone. We began by soaking the rice and chopping the veggies at 3 am.The last touch was added on Saturday at 1 pm, with the sprinkling of curry leaves.But the job was not done. A crane was then brought in to lift the cone-like vessel holding the khichdi, and over a delicate 20-minute process ensuring nothing was spilled, placed on a weighing machine. When the scales showed 918 kg, minus the vessel weight, smiles broke out all around. The minimum requirement to create a world record was 500 kg. The category: the largest serving of beans and rice.Guinness World Records Project Manager Paulina Sapinska, on stand by following an invitation from Kapoor and the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, said, We are still waiting for a few pieces of evidence. For the time being, I am happy to announce that this (khichdi) wins the Guinness World title.It was Sapinskas second trip to India within a week to witness a record.Also at hand watching was Denmark Food Minister Esben Lunde Larsen, apart from executives of several corporations. We can renew our own kitchen with your culinary traditions, starting with khichdi, Larsen promised.The three-day event, being organised along with industry body CII and featuring traditional food from more than 20 states, was inaugurated by PM Modi on Friday.Badal, who has been fighting off some steam over reports that khichdi was being promoted as Brand India Food, on Saturday said, The beauty of khichdi is that everyone has eaten it. To rope in the rest, the government plans to popularise the dish and recipe through its foreign missions.The few members of the public at the event though werent too convinced. Ranjana Sethi, 48, said, We make khichdi at home all the time but that never got famous Why so much drama around it?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A seafood park at Mangaluru is in conceptualisation stage. Food technology parks have been planned at Koppal, Kalaburagi and Bidar for the development of rice, maize, tur and coconut. There are 20 agribusiness and food processing clusters such as jaggery, rice mill, silk reeling, wool, agricultural implements and cashew, he added.Two major cold stores have opened at the Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) at Hubballi and Bagalkot for the export of mango and other horticultural products.A truck terminal-cum-logistics park will be built on 56 acres of land at Anchatageri on the outskirts of Hubballi.

(Source: Reuters) Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra is still famous among her supporters in north east Thailand. (Source: Reuters)Hundreds of supporters cheered as Thailands former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra on Friday arrived for the final hearing in her trial on charges she was negligent in overseeing a rice subsidy scheme which wasted billions of dollars. Yingluck, overthrown in a 2014 military coup, faces up to 10 years jail if found guilty. The hearing in the Supreme Court in Bangkok is expected to set a date for a verdict.Yingluck and her Phue Thai Party say the trial is politically motivated and aimed at discrediting her flagship policy, which helped the Shinawatra clan win every election since 2001, but was a disaster for state coffers and distorted global rice prices. The struggle for power between a conservative establishment and the populist movement founded by Yinglucks brother Thaksin Shinawatra, has been at the root of more than a decade of political turmoil in Southeast Asias second biggest economy. Thaksin was overthrown as prime minister in 2006 and now lives abroad to avoid corruption charges.An army of police officers were deployed around the Supreme Court as Yingluck supporters cheered her arrival  in defiance of junta leader Prayuth Chan-ochas request for her followers to stay away. I hope Yingluck will not be found guilty so she can become prime minister again and bring back the rice scheme, said Napa, a 56-year-old rice farmer from Ratchaburi province, west of Bangkok. She declined to give her full name. Appearing moved to tears by the show of support, Yingluck made no comment before entering the court room. Yinglucks legal team said the former prime minister had asked to be allowed to give her closing statement on Friday. Her lawyers have also petitioned the Constitutional Court over the case, potentially delaying the Supreme Courts verdict.In 2015, the military-appointed Legislative Assembly impeached Yingluck and banned her from politics for five years over the alleged mismanagement of the rice scheme. But Yingluck remains popular among her supporters, particularly in the northeast, Thailands poorest region.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

As about 160 countries overhauled their indirect tax systems, they confronted numerous challenges. Latecomer India is unlikely to escape some havoc.When Canada implemented its goods and services tax in 1991, retailers offered customers ""Don't Blame Me for the GST"" stickers amid cash-register snafus and vending-machine meltdowns. In Australia, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, where the GST was lower than pre-existing rates, the new regimes initially pushed up inflation, according to a May 26 report from Nomura Holdings Inc.India, which is scheduled to combine more than a dozen levies into ' one nation, one tax' on July 1, has more room for error than most. Not only does the country's size and diversity make the challenge daunting -- 1.3 billion people, 29 states, 22 official languages -- it's also implementing multiple rates. Some companies may be coming into the tax system for the first time and both federal and state governments, some ruled by different political parties, will jointly administer the new system.""Certainly there will be an adjustment period, there is no doubt about that,"" said Arvind Panagariya, vice-chairman of Niti Aayog, the government's top policy planning body. It's not clear ""how painful or how long"" this period would last.The pitfalls are daunting:The GST Network will process as many as 3.5 billion invoices each month. Taxpayers may be required to file as many as 37 returns a year. Experts doubt the system will be able to seamlessly match billions of credits, facilitate tax collections, provide refunds and check evasions.""Non-functioning of the GSTN portal, due to technical glitches is something which could give sleepless nights to the industry and thus can be a dark nightmare, "" said Harpreet Singh, partner, indirect tax at KPMG in India.Some companies, particularly in the consumer goods sector, are selling off their inventories to avoid having to deal with two different prices for the same product. Some may also be delaying production so they can claim a credit against their costs for the first time under the new regime. Conversely, once July 1 rolls around there could be transportation bottlenecks as stores rush to restock.The fact that most commonly used items will be taxed at a lower rate than previously argues that the GST should in theory be disinflationary, according to the Nomura note.But Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf, authors of the note, said that while the consumer price inflation could drop by 33 basis points in the short term, core inflation could rise by 60 basis points because of increased taxes on services. They note it may be difficult for authorities to enforce anti-profiteering rules.LawGST laws have introduced multiple new concepts like ""supply"" and ""location of supplier"" which can throw up different interpretations. Lack of tax literature and judicial precedents may add to confusion as industry and lawyers begin to grapple with new concepts, said Singh of KPMG.Small BusinessSmall businesses which haven't been in the tax net before may continue work in cash and have less than perfect books. Nevertheless, they'll be required to upload their tax details to the GSTN and compute their returns if they fall across the threshold for inclusion under GST which stands at 2 million rupees ($30,983) of annual sales.""Overall there will be some nagging problems to begin with on the implication and compliance sides,"" said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Credit Analysis & Research Ltd. in Mumbai. ""But this will be temporary for the first six to nine months.""Getting more of India's economy into the tax system, may be the country's biggest challenge.Here's what some other countries went through:MalaysiaFollowing the implementation of GST in April 2015, there were reports cash registers weren't calibrated to deal with the new regime, government agencies weren't ready and GST refunds were delayed. A minister attracted flack for posting pictures and recipes for fried rice on social media that would be GST-free based on items that would be exempt. Opposition parties have scored political points with the rising cost of living likely to be a major campaign topic in polls expected within months.South KoreaFollowing the introduction of a value added tax in 1977, a game of hide and seek broke out between tax officials implementing the new system and market vendors seeking to avoid taxation, prompting newspaper Dong-A Ilbo in 1978 to describe the year as a ""365-day nightmare."" The day the indirect tax regime applied, some taxi drivers thought the new system applied to taxi fares and argued with customers that they need to pay 10 percent more than the price on the meter.AustraliaThree years after pledging in 1995 to ""never"" introduce a GST, Australia Prime Minister John Howard reversed his policy for the 1998 election, saying he was seeking a mandate to implement a 10 percent tax on most goods and services. He barely won amid a voter backlash, but that narrow victory was enough to legislate a GST that's been used to fund health care and schools funding for the states. It excludes some politically contentious items such as fresh food, pre-owned real estate, and medical and education services.Current Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull toyed with the idea of increasing the tax to 15 percent, but ruled that out in February 2016. 2017 Bloomberg L.P"

BJP district president of Garo Hills Bernard Rimpu Marak, who had joined the BJP last year, was understood to have been asked to put in his papers. He, however, insisted his resignation was to protest the BJPs stand on beef.In the interest of the Garo people, I have put in my papers today as a mark of protest against the partys stand on beef, Marak told PTI.I have resigned because I am a Christian and a Garo first.

(Source: PTI Photo) The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, Jaitley said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification. (Source: PTI Photo)The row over beef eating and cattle trade kept the political cauldron astir on Thursday despite Finance Minister Arun Jaitleys attempt to calm frayed tempers by insisting the new central notification will not interfere with state laws on slaughtering animals. Following several days of protests, particularly in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Jaitley told a press conference in New Delhi that the ban imposed by the Centre on sale and purchase of cattle from animal markets for slaughter had nothing to do with state legislations.The animal markets are meant for farmers and not for traders, he said, adding that this is the only effect of the notification.Every state has its own legislation or no legislation (with regard to slaughter of cattle). You have provision in the Constitution Article 48 (Directive Principles) which says that certain category of animals have to be protected, Jaitley said.Prohibition of cow slaughter mentioned in Article 48 of the Constitution is not an enforceable article, but a Directive Principle of State Policy.West Bengals feisty Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who has been at the forefront of the oppositions attack on the ban, added a new twist to the row, claiming the Centre was planning to omit buffalo from the abmit of its notification to favour certain people close to BJP involved in trade of its meat.Some people close to the BJP are involved in the buffalo meat trade and that is why, they (Centre) are planning to allow the slaughter of buffaloes, she told a public meeting in Tarakeshwar in West Bengal.Assailing vigilantism in the name of cow protection, she said,The BJP has got only 29 per cent of the votes, but they are trying to bulldoze the entire people. Who are they to decide what one will eat? Who are they to decide what one will wear? It is a matter of personal choice.Notwithstanding Jaitleys attempt to pacify those angry at the ban, a top leader of the RSS, the BJPs ideological mentor, denounced beef parties being organised to protest the Modi governments measure as against humanity, and suggested that they should change their ways.Those who are doing this (hosting beef parties) are just a few in the population of 121 crore. They do not represent the opinion of the nation. Their act is against humanity and they should change their ways, veteran RSS leader Indresh Kumar told a press conference at Jaipur.Cow milk is healthier than beef. Milk is medicine while beef makes you prone to diseases. People should understand this and not eat beef, Kumar said.There also was a bit of political churning in Meghalaya where a senior BJP leader, who had announced a beef party in his hometown to celebrate Prime Minister Narendra Modis three years in office, resigned from the party.BJP district president of Garo Hills Bernard Rimpu Marak, who had joined the party last year, was understood to have been asked to put in his papers.

Kate Brown speaks at a news conference. (Source: AP Photo) Oregon Gov. Kate Brown speaks at a news conference. (Source: AP Photo)Governor Kate Brown has signed a bill that will make it easier for transgender people in Oregon to shield any updates they make to their birth certificates, a process typically conducted through the court system without privacy from public view.The measure, which takes effect next year, makes Oregon the second state after California to adopt laws specifically designed to help mitigate potential discrimination against transgender individuals from employers, landlords or anyone else who is otherwise able to dig up birth-record changes through public record.The new law eliminates the requirement that changes to someones name or gender identity must be posted publicly by the courts. It also allows court cases involving gender identity changes on birth records to be sealed.Its a minor tweak to state law that could have a big impact on the local transgender community, says 59-year-old Stacey Rice, executive co-director of Q Center, a Portland community support center for LGBTQ individuals.Rice is a transgender woman but still hasnt been able to change her North Carolina birth records after 17 years because she hasnt undergone a sex-change operation, which the state says must also be confirmed through a notarized letter from their doctor. The same requirements apply for drivers licenses, although Rice got it done anyway thanks to the kindness of a North Carolina DMV employee years ago.I was going to have a drivers license that has my female face on it, my female name, but its still going to say `M and lets say I get pulled over for some reason and maybe a police officer looks at it and says `whats going on here? that was terrifying, Rice said.HB 2673 passed the Democratic-controlled Oregon Legislature earlier this month with some Republican support at a time when, two years after the U.S. Supreme Courts legalization of same-sex marriage, the nation remains largely divided as to how to balance LGBTQ rights and religious freedoms.This year about 30 states introduced roughly 130 anti-LGBTQ bills, about half last years figure, according to the D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign. Most of the measures have died, but legislatures in South Dakota, Alabama and Texas passed bills providing protections for faith-based adoption agencies that do not want to place children with gay or lesbian adoptive parents.Opposite scenarios are playing out in other states like Nevada, where GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval signed a law earlier this month banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ youth.

Bernard Marak, the district president of the BJP in West Garo Hills, alleged that the BJP leaders were not respecting the tradition and culture of the indigenous people.Tribal people in the northeastern states have our own style of celebrating and feasting In Garo Hills, a cow is slaughtered on a festive occasion. Therefore, we wanted to organise bitchi-beef party to celebrate three years of Modi government but the party leaders are against it, Marak told IANS.What is the point of being part of a political party that does not want to keep our Garo tradition and culture alive? They (BJP leaders) cannot dictate us on our food habits, he said. Bitchi in Garo dialect is rice beer.Bachu Chambugong Marak, president of the BJPs North Garo Hills district, said: We will organise the beef party because beef is our traditional food. We, the Garo people, cannot live without eating beef.However, BJP national spokesperson Nalin Kohli brushed aside the allegations. The BJP has nothing against the tradition or food habits of any tribal society. They are making these statements to create political fortunes with the elections around the corner, he saidBachu said: We will automatically quit the party if the leadership cannot solve the issue. But if the party can solve the problem, we will remain in the party. There will be no support for the party in the Garo hills if it bans beef.On Wednesday, several BJP leaders in the state had threatened to quit the party if the Modi government refused to repeal the new cattle trade and slaughter rules. Most party leaders in Meghalaya are not happy with the new rules which are directly affecting the socio-economic status of the people, BJP Vice President John Antonius Lyngdoh said. We cannot accept the new rules on cattle trade and slaughter. We cannot go against our food behaviour besides putting the economic interest of those people dealing in cattle trade and slaughter in jeopardy, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Bernard Marak said that he was not permitted to hold the beef festival even though the BJP had announced that there would be no restriction on beef consumption in the state.BJPs Meghalaya in-charge Nalin Kohli, who accepted Maraks resignation, said the party had been considering removing Marak as part of its district-level preparations for the Assembly polls scheduled for February. Marak told The Indian Express, I resigned over the beef issue. Beef is an integral part of our culture and diet. To celebrate the third anniversary of our PMs term, we planned a festival in Tura and a huge feast where we would have served beef and our local rice beer  bitchi.When we put forth the proposal, senior leaders told us we could not do it. Nalin Kohli bluntly told us that this could not be done. I asked why. We are not Hindus, we are Christians and tribals. All tribes in Meghalaya eat beef. Their attempt is to impose Hindu culture on us, he said. Marak said the BJPs district units had worked hard to convince people that BJP is not a communal party but stands for progress and development. But when they issue notifications like this and refuse to let us celebrate according to our traditions and culture, they are acting on communal lines, he said.Reacting to Maraks allegations, Kohli said it was a political ploy because he was likely to have been removed from his party post for sabotageagainst the BJPs likely candidates for the Assembly polls. Over the past couple of months, BJP has been engaged in assessing preparedness for the polls. We had received complaints of infighting and attempts to sabotage prospects of possible candidates. Marak was the most prominent among the leaders under the scanner, he said.Kohli added that Marak was using the beef issue for political mileage as he wanted to contest from Tura. We are here to win the elections, not give tickets in charity. Beef is not an issue in Meghalaya. There is no beef ban, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The resignation of Bachu Marak -- a senior leader of the party in the North Garo Hills today - has triggered a crisis. Within a few hours of his resignation, around 200 party workers decided to quit. They took down the party flag and shut down the district party office.While protests against the Central rule swirled in a few southern states and much of northeast, where beef is staple for many, Bachu Marak had proposed a rice beer and beef party in the Garo Hills on his Facebook page to mark the three years of the Narendra Modi government.Coming just after the Youth Congress members publicly slaughtered a calf in Kerala to protest the cattle trade law, Mr Marak's idea drew scathing criticism from senior BJP leaders.Referring to the ""development for all"" slogan of the government, senior BJP leader Nalin Kohli said, ""How can the slaughter of an animal be the ground for celebrating 'sabka saath sabka vikas'?"" Mr Marak, he said, was ""welcome to leave the party"", which, he said, was ready to sack him.Though Mr Kohli had clarified that it was ""not the BJP's agenda to put a beef ban"" in Meghalaya, Bachu Marak, like Bernard Marack from the West Garo hills, accused the BJP of not accepting the Garo culture, traditions and food habits. Four days ago, his party colleague Bernard Mark had walked out on the issue.Bernard Marak - who, much to his party's discomfiture, promised cheap beef if the BJP came to power -- has now called for a bitchi (rice beer) and beef party in Tura on June 10.But with the party hoping to capture power in the Congress-ruled state in next year's assembly elections, Mr Marak's exit has forced local leaders to call a hasty meeting to chalk out an election strategy.The two leaders were seen as pillars of the party's growing strength in Garo hills -- a region Chief Minister Mukul Sangma dominates. The Garo-majority region has 24 of the assembly's 60 seats."

The offshore North Field, which provides virtually all of Qatar's gas, is shared with Iran, Saudi Arabia's hated rival.The wealth that followed turned Qatar into not just the world's richest nation, with an annual per-capita income of $130,000, but also the world's largest LNG exporter. The focus on gas set it apart from its oil producing neighbors in the Gulf Cooperation Council and allowed it to break from domination by Saudi Arabia, which in Monday's statement of complaint described Qataris as an ""extension of their brethren in the Kingdom"" as it cut off diplomatic relations and closed the border.Instead, Qatar built its own ties with other powers including Iran, the U.S. -- Qatar hosts U.S. Central Command -- and more recently, Russia. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund agreed last year to invest $2.7 billion in Russia's state-run Rosneft Oil Co. PJSC.""Qatar used to be a kind of Saudi vassal state, but it used the autonomy that its gas wealth created to carve out an independent role for itself,"" said Jim Krane, energy research fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute, in Houston, Texas. ""The rest of the region has been looking for an opportunity to clip Qatar's wings.""That opportunity came with U.S. President Donald Trump's recent visit to Saudi Arabia, when he called on ""all nations of conscience"" to isolate Iran. When Qatar disagreed publicly, in a statement the government later said was a product of hacking, the Saudi-led retribution followed. Critically, Qatar's natural gas output has been free from entanglement in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel that Saudi Arabia dominates.The new emir, having survived a counter-coup attempt in 1996, didn't build pipelines that would have integrated Qatar into the markets of its Gulf neighbors. Two senior Qatari government officials alleged during the trial of the coup plotters in 2000 that Bahrain helped to organize the attempt with Saudi Arabia's consent, according to a report by the BBC.At the time, those much richer oil states saw natural gas as virtually worthless, useful mainly for injecting back into oil wells to improve extraction rates. They were willing to pay only a fraction of the world market price for LNG, according to a paper Krane co-authored with Qatar University's Steven Wright.The sole pipeline built, the Dolphin project connecting Qatar's North Field to the United Arab Emirates and Oman, has operated at half to two thirds capacity. Contracts signed last year should fill the rest, yet the vast majority of Qatar's exports will continue to go to markets in Asia and Europe.Angering NeighborsMore recently, demand for LNG to produce electricity and power industry has been growing in the Gulf states. They're having to resort to higher-cost LNG imports and exploring difficult domestic gas formations that are expensive to get out of the ground, according to the research. Qatar's gas has the lowest extraction costs in the world.Qatar gas wealth enabled it to develop foreign policies that came to irritate its neighbors. It backed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, Hamas in the Gaza Strip and armed factions opposed by the UAE or Saudi Arabia in Libya and Syria. Gas also paid for a global television network, Al Jazeera, which at various times has embarrassed or angered most Middle Eastern governments.Above all, gas prompted Qatar to promote a regional policy of engagement with Shiite Iran to secure the source of its wealth.Gas isn't the immediate cause of the current showdown, but ""you can question why Qatar has been unwilling to supply its neighboring countries, making them gas poor,"" said Wright, the academic, speaking by telephone from the Qatari capital Doha. ""There probably was an expectation that Qatar would sell gas to them at a discount price.""What Next?Adding to regional frustrations, in 2005, Qatar declared a moratorium on the further development of the North Field that could have provided more gas for local export.Qatar said it needed to test how the field was responding to its exploitation, denying that it was bending to sensitivities in Iran, which had been much slower to draw gas from its side of the shared field. That two-year moratorium was lifted in April, a decade late, after Iran for the first time caught up with Qatar's extraction rates.""People here are scratching their heads as to exactly what the Saudis expect Qatar to do,"" said Gerd Nonneman, professor of international relations and Gulf studies at Georgetown University's Doha campus. ""They seem to want Qatar to cave in completely, but it won't call the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization, because it isn't. And it isn't going to excommunicate Iran, because that would jeopardize a relationship that is just too fundamental to Qatar's economic development."""

He said government should also ensure that the benefits of welfare schemes including the 20 kg free rice scheme operated every month and it should be restricted to the poorer sections.Anbalagan, Vayyapuri Manikandan, A Baskar and K A U Asana surrendered the cards to the Speaker. Welcoming their gesture, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy said the purpose of the freebies was to enable the poorer sections enjoy the benefits of welfare schemes.He said he had already appealed to the affluent sections, industrialists, officials, elected representatives and those paying income tax to voluntarily opt out of the freebies so that the money saved thereby would be used for various programmes.Welfare Minister M Kandasamy said government was hard-pressed for funds to operate various welfare schemes. Hence freebies should be available only for the needy and the money saved would be of help to strengthen the coffers, he said. Kandasamy said ruling Congress legislators too had decided to opt out of the freebies.Kandasamy later told PTI that ten out of the 15 Congress legislators surrendered their cards after the day`s session was over.

The exodus of thousands of residents has continued amid continuing gun battles between Government forces and Muslim militants occupying several buildings and houses in the city where they hoisted IS style black flags. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez)Dozens of people ran to freedom through a terrifying gauntlet of military air strikes and Islamist gunmen today, nearly two weeks after being trapped in a deadly battle for a Philippine city.The group of 38 said they ran from their hiding place in a part of Marawi city controlled by self-styled Islamic State group gunmen as soldiers seized a key bridge in the area to give the civilians safe passage.We lay on the floor in the dark each night whenever we heard gunshots or explosions. We barricaded the doors with furniture and a refrigerator, high school teacher Jerona Sedrome, 27, told AFP. The ISIS tried to force their way into the house and got in at the second attempt, so we hid in a tunnel beneath the house, she added, using the acronym for an alternative name for IS.Hundreds of gunmen rampaged through the city of 200,000, the Islamic capital of the mainly Catholic Philippines, on May 23 after government forces attempted to arrest their leader, Isnilon Hapilon. Up to 50 gunmen continued to control downtown Marawi nearly two weeks later with at least 15 hostages including a Catholic priest, with some being used as human shields, the military said.As many as 2,000 people also remained trapped in desperate conditions in these areas, the government said, likely without food and water and with some injured or ailing as security forces mount a relentless assault. The military has said it is firing artillery and rockets from the air, as well as dropping conventional bombs, as ground forces in armoured vehicles fight their way in dodging sniper fire, improvised explosives and anti-tank rockets.At least 70 people were rescued Saturday as intense fighting continued, including 23 teachers from Dansalan College, who were with a year-old baby, seven other children, and seven other adults. The gunmen set alight the college on the first day of the fighting, and the teachers said bombs and fires also destroyed many of the houses around the house where they hid.Dansalan college is run by the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church, and all the teachers were Christians. The teachers recounted to AFP between tears and gulps of coffee and bottled water how they survived on steamed rice and rainwater.If it didnt rain we had no water and we didnt eat, said Sedromes younger sister and fellow teacher, Jane Rose Sedrome, 25. The elder sister said they secretly communicated with government rescuers by mobile phone text messages through their ordeal, and made their break for freedom when informed the gunmen had been driven away from the bridge.But they had to go through the sniper alley of Bangolo, the citys old quarter which is one of the targets of the day and night air strikes. We passed through three corpses being eaten by maggots. They smelled really bad, fellow teacher Regene Apao, 23, told AFP. We knew they were ISIS because they wore black clothing and black head masks. Arnold Balo, 28, an ice cream factory worker, said he cradled a boy in one hand and carried a half-metre long machete in the other, their only protection from the gunmen.At one point during their sprint for freedom, a gunman perched near the top of a building aimed a sniper rifle at him and ordered him to put his weapon on the ground, Balo said. I will do as you order sir. Please dont kill us, he said he told the gunman. Balo said he put the machete, and the militant allowed the group to pass.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

This year, the festival is being held on Thursday, 8 June. On Vat Purnima, women observe a day-long fast, tying thread around a banyan tree. Generally a three-day festival, some women extend their fast to all three days. As per the Hindu calendar, the Vat Savitri Vrat is observed on Jyestha Purnima or full moon of Jyestha month. Vat Savitri Purnima Vrat Puja 2017 muhurat begins at around 4:16 pm on June 8 and will continue till 6:39 pm on Friday, June 9. Vat Savitri Purnima was first referred in the epic Mahabharata in relation to Savitri Satyavan mythology.Go on to read more about the significance and importance of Vat Savitri Purnima or Vat Purnima (Wat Purnima) Vrat here.The festival Vat Savitri Purnima was first mentioned in the legend of Savitri and Satyavan in the Mahabharata. Rishi Markandeya first refers to the couple Savitri-Satyavan while narrating a story to Yudhistra, the eldest Pandava. Yudhistra had apparently asked the sage if any other woman is as devoted and dedicated to her husband as his wife Draupadi.The legend goes: Savitri, the beautiful daughter of the King of Madra Kingdom - Asvapati, sets out on a pilgrimage to find a husband for herself. She chooses Satyavan, the son of blind king Dyumatsena of Salwa Kingdom who's living in exile. She later comes to know that Satyavan will die after a year but nonetheless goes on to marry him. She assumes the life of a hermit and lives in the forest with her husband and in-laws.Three days before the predicted death of Satyavan, Savitri goes on a fast and performs severe austerities. On that day, Savitri accompanies her husband Satyavan, who's blissfully unaware of his impending death, to the forest. While chopping wood, something happens and he lies down, putting his head in his wife's lap. God of Death, Yama, comes to take away Satyavan's soul. Savitri follows Yama. Impressed by her dedication, wit and pure nature, he once again grants life to Satyavan.The fast that Savitri observed for three days later came to be known as Vat Savitri Purnima.On Vat Savitri Purnima, women worship Savitri as the goddess, offering nine kinds of fruits and flowers including rice grain, pulses, mangos, bananas, etc, as Bhoga. They also tie the sacred thread around the banyan tree."

He says his family had been complaining of ailments that the doctor could not cure for the last couple of weeks.""The children suffered loose motions, all had gastric problems. Medicines and doctor were not able to cure as we continued to eat this. Now we have realised what is wrong,"" he says.Telugu TV journalist Indrasen found the biryani that he had bought in Saroornagar, when rolled into a ball, bounced with a thud. He says when he complained, he was beaten up.""I was alone at home. So I bought biryani and took it home for dinner. But somehow it felt different. When I rolled the biryani rice, it bounced and made a sound. I went back and complained at the shop. They attacked me,"" says Indrasen.Videos that show polythene being inserted into machines from where noodle-like plastic sticks emerge, which then get cut into fine rice, have gone viral on social media claiming that it is plastic rice coming from China that has infiltrated the market. This has created a scare among the people and rumours on social media have added to the fears. But none of this has been authoritatively established. The qualitative test reports from laboratories are awaited.Some experts point out that while rice is selling at less than 60 rs a kg, the so called plastic that is claimed to be used is more expensive at Rs 70 a kg, if not more. ""So what is the logic? Why would anyone do that,"" asks a rice trader Ramulu."

The officials captured nearly 20 birds and a handful of guinea pigs from these fortune tellers.The fortune tellers were charged under Section 4 of Wildlife Act 1972, said Forest Ranger P Murugesan, who was involved in the operation. These birds are locked in tiny cages and abused in the process of training and are left with chopped wings, he said. He added that while birds are being intimidated, even clients are manipulated and cheated.Around 100 fortune tellers make a living out of these birds in Marina beach alone, estimate Forest Department officials. Some fortune tellers even use guinea pigs to pick up cards.The Parrot Astrologers, commonly known as kili josiar, have a different story to tell.Rose-ringed parakeets or pachakili have been an integral part of Chennai beaches. When the clock strikes 4pm, one fortune teller after another step into the beach. They pace around the beach with tiny wooden boxes swinging in their hands.The single opening in the front of the box is lined with vertical metal bars. A parakeet or sometimes, even a guinea pig peeps from between the rods. Their fast footsteps falter when they see a couple crouched in the shades of unopened food stalls.Their face lights up if they see a group of noisy youngsters laughing and making fun of one another. These are hot spots of business. Catchy one-liners grab attention of these curious customers.Aana porakka vendiyava, penna poranthutta! (You have the soul of a man, but born as a woman), You will get a husband like lord Ram! and others that either invoke curiosity or humour. Once theyve sold their pick-up lines, they sit down and set the cage on the dune and spread a small cloth or rubber mat. Jakkamma! Amma Mahalakshmi, Ayya Manickam, they summon the parakeets calling their names, from the cage as they set a deck of cards on the mat.Enter parakeet. After waiting a while, the bird simply walks back into the cage. The fortune teller summons the bird again, only this time, he twirls a grain in his hand. With its eyes glued to the grain, the parakeet picks up one card after another and drops it on the mat. He drops the grain and it finally holds one up signalling a hand-over.He mutters a prayer to God Muruga and asks the parakeet to pray too before giving a few shards of grain. The bird after eating her fill, steps back into the cage.""They grow with us like our children. We wake up together and eat rice thrice a day. We keep water in a bowl because we also feed them grains,"" he said. ""Manickam eats Sambhar rice, lentil rice and curd rice. How do you think he got through this summer without curd rice?"" he asks. During the day, the birds are said to flutter freely around the house and in the evenings, they are packed in their cages and go with their 'parents' for work.""This is the only profession I know. Now my Manickam has been taken away,"" rued Muthukumar. 'Manickam is the Tamil equivalent of Ruby and the gem stone is supposed to bring prosperity to its owner. ""My uncle sells clothes in whole-sale. I may take his help and sell clothes door-to-door in some village,"" he said promising that he may never take up this profession again.The birds taken away from the fortune-tellers are now being rehabilitated and will be moved to Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur where they will live in bigger cages with other parakeets."

He, however, refused to say anything about the absence of Mohapatra and Diwedi.Some local BJP leaders and proteges of Mohapatra trained their guns on Pradhan as they were not consulted by the State BJP leaders before admitting the former MLAs into the BJP. They also claimed that Mohapatra was not invited to the meeting by Pradhan and other BJP leaders. We boycotted the meeting as Mohapatra was not invited to the meeting on his home turf. Of the 10 BJP Zilla Parishad members, five also skipped the meeting, said Diwedi.Speaking at the meeting, Pradhan blamed Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik for growing corruption and lawlessness in the State. Scaling up his battle against the BJD supremo, he predicted a defeat for the regional party in the 2019 poll.People are fed up with the BJD Government. Our party is highlighting the Governments slipshod attitude towards the welfare of rural people. Voters have already expressed their anger in the panchayat election by electing more BJP candidates in different Zilla Parishad zones, Pradhan said.Pradhan claimed that the BJD Government had been hoodwinking gullible people on its `1-a-kg rice scheme. While the Centre provides `29 per kg, the State Government contributes only `2, he said.After demonetisation, around `750 crore was deposited in Jan Dhan accounts of poor people in the State. It was ill gotten money of some corrupt BJD leaders who had collected it from ponzi firms and illegal mining activities, Pradhan added.Prior to the meeting, some banners and posters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pradhan were set on fire by unknown miscreants at several places in the coastal town on Saturday night.SP Dayanidhi Gochayat said a case has been registered following a complaint by BJP leader Umakanta Patnaik. Five Congress supporters were detained at Tinimuhani Chowk in Kendrapara town while they were trying to show black flags to Pradhan, he added."

It appears a missile has been launched. Please evacuate to a sturdy building or underground,"" the loudspeaker blared over the town, silencing the children who had been playing in the schoolyard and drowning out the sound of the water trickling alongside the rice paddies.Older residents streamed into the concrete community center, while the children at the neighboring elementary school hit the ground outside where they were playing, some covering their heads.Sakata, a sleepy city of 100,000 on Japan's northwestern coast, sits just 665 miles across the sea from North Korea, and many of the missiles that Kim Jong Un's regime has been launching have landed not far from this coast, within Japan's exclusive economic zone.While Kim has repeatedly stated that he wants an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, and while he has made observable progress toward that goal, his rocket scientists are not there yet.North Korea is, however, able to hit Japan. One of the new missiles that North Korea fired last month had a technical range of 2,800 miles, easily putting all of Japan and even the U.S. territory of Guam within reach. (North Korea fired a missile over Japan in 1998.)That has residents here worrying for the squid fishermen who ply this coast - and for themselves.""Sakata faces the Sea of Japan, so it's important to think about how to protect ourselves in case of an incoming North Korean missile,"" Itaru Maruyama, the mayor of Sakata, said after the city held its first missile preparedness drill Friday. ""We've trained for various disasters but not for a missile.""Japanese are used to drills for earthquakes and tsunamis, but the prime minister's office issued new ""actions to protect yourself"" guidelines in April, including instructions on how to respond if a North Korean ballistic missile is heading toward Japan. It marked the first time since the end of World War II that the Japanese government has instructed citizens on what to do if they come under enemy attack.The advice is limited to basically going inside or underground - there's not much else people can do, especially not since they would have only minutes to do it.In Tokyo, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party presented the prime minister with a plan Thursday to protect people from North Korean missiles. Among other things, it called for building shelters and evacuating Japanese citizens living in South Korea.""With North Korea continuing to ignore the international community and launching missiles, we must do everything we can to protect the public,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in response.As if to underline the threat, North Korea launched another salvo of missiles Thursday, although they were only cruise missiles rather than the usual ballistic ones.The threat of North Korea feels very real on this coast, and several regional authorities have organized similar practices.About 400 residents took part in Friday's exercise in Sakata, practicing what to do if satellites detect a ballistic missile launched from ""Country X"" flying toward Japan. In addition to triggering cellphone alarms, alerts will blare from loudspeakers already used for earthquake and tsunami warnings.Residents would have only minutes to evacuate to safety because the missile would take only about 10 minutes after launch to reach Japan, and some of that time would be spent alerting local authorities.After a siren started sounding the warning during the drill on Friday, a group of senior citizens who had been waiting patiently in a side alley began walking quickly toward the community center, cautioning each other to be careful not to fall and hurt themselves. The children playing on the school field followed their teacher's instructions and ducked down. In the rice paddies and fields around the area, people sheltered in place.""I feel fortunate that this is happening here so we will be prepared if a missile is coming toward us,"" said Mitsuharu Suzuki, a 67-year-old company worker who remembers when three North Korean spies came ashore in the area in 1973. ""We face North Korea across the Sea of Japan, so we always feel tense.""Sachiko Kaneko, a 69-year-old housewife who also took part, agreed. ""The missiles come so often, so I feel very worried,"" she said.After the exercise was over, Mayor Maruyama congratulated everyone on a drill well done.""Kids, you did a great job at escaping. It made you nervous, right?"" he said to the rows of children lined up in the school gym. ""Remember this experience and think about it during your school years.""The local fire chief came on next to describe what a missile would look like. He got a girl who was 53 inches tall to stand up to show everyone the width of the missile and the length of the warhead - and the children started to look slightly terrified. ""I hope a missile doesn't come here,"" one said to her friends afterward.Down at the port, fishermen who did not take part in the drill said they were also worried.""It's really scary because we have no idea where missiles might fall,"" said Kiyoshi Sugimoto, who works on a squid fishing boat based farther up the coast. He was once out on this sea when he heard that a North Korean missile had landed within Japan's economic zone, and he wanted to turn back.""They can tell us that a missile has been launched, but what are we supposed to do about it? We can't run away,"" he said as he sat on the ground smoking. He asked whether more missiles would be coming.Shizuka Yamashina, a 75-year-old retired farmer, said the tensions with North Korea were the worst he could remember.""I heard that North Korea wants Japan to go up in flames, because we are allies of America,"" Yamashina said as he and a friend fished on a dock, pulling in a bunch of minnows that they fed to the seagulls. ""I want the United States to restrain North Korea.""Residents on the coast feel so vulnerable, he said, that at a recent drinking party with his friends he gave a toast hoping that a North Korean missile does not land here.""I hope that we can have talks with North Korea and calm down the situation rather than use military force,"" Yamashina said, ""because right now we have no idea what they might do."""

He started four years back by cultivating pulses over 30 decimal of land and encouraged with the returns, Soren extended it to about one acre during last kharif season.Owner of eight acres of land, Samuel looks forward to cultivate pulses on four acres of land during the ensuing karif season. Since majority of his land holdings is high land and the paddy yield is far less than expectation, he decided to switch over to pulses.Like Samuel, 15 other farmers of the village are cultivating pulses after gradually diverting from paddy. The success story of Samuel and other farmers has led the Agriculture department to chalk out plan to increase pulses production by additional 5,022 tonnes during the ensuing kharif season. Pulses, including arhar, mung, biri, kulthi and other varieties will be cultivated on 35,800 hectares of land with a production target of 21,140 tonnes. The target last season for pulses was 16,118 tonnes.The department also plans to increase the yield during 2017 kharif season at 5.91 quintal per hectare compared to 4.49 quintal per hectare during last kharif season. The department has drawn up a plan to promote diversion from paddy to non-paddy crops through cultivation of pulses in Dhankauda block of the district.The mixed cropping of arhar and groundnut will be promoted in Naktideul block while pulses cultivation will be increased in Bamra block. This apart, bund plantation of arhar will be promoted in the blocks of Maneswar, Rairakhol, Naktideul, Kuchinda and Jamankira.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal said the Government has issued instructions to promote pulses in rice fallow and it is being promoted at ground level. Cultivation of pulses requires less water compared to paddy, he said."

Express Heera Kambdi says she and her husband end up eating the THR meant for their children, who prefer rice. ExpressHeera Kambdi, her five children snuggled beside her, laughs as she holds out a red-coloured packet of ready-to-eat Take Home Ration (THR). They make balls out of it and play, says the young mother, in her home in Kurlodh village, Mokhada, a region infamous for malnutrition.On April 29, the state extended by five years the contracts of 18 self help groups to supply the Take Home Ration (THR), a packet of ready-to-eat meal for children aimed to prevent malnutrition. However, in the regions where additional nutrition for children is most critical, the response to the THR is not enthusiastic. Parents complain the food is of sub-standard quality, and tastes poor. Social groups question the governments decision to continue with the THR when children prefer cheaper and locally available hot, cooked meals.They eat the raw powder since it is sweet. But when I cook it with water and milk, they run away, Kambdi says. The familys income is Rs 1,500 per month. She and her labourer husband end up eating the content of the packet, while her children eat rice twice a day.THR is supplied to children aged six months to three years, to pregnant or lactating mothers, and to malnourished children. One packet costs Rs 4.9. The powder contains wheat, soya chunks, jaggery and peanuts. Instructions on the packet say 260 grams must be given to a child each day. But the monthly ration supplied is only 3 kg, when the requirement would be at least 7.8 kg per month.About 40 km away in Jawahar taluka, two-year-old Sanjay Bambre has been diagnosed as suffering from moderately acute malnutrition for seven months. Despite four packets of THR every month and admission twice to the Village Child Development Center, his weight hovers at 8.7 kg. I dont know if he eats the THR. We cant go home and check, anganwadi worker Mala Mukesh says.In his mud hut, the frail boy is the ninth child in the family. His four siblings died from infections or malnutrition. He does not like the taste of THR. So I dont force him, mother Dhakli Bambre explains. The family, including parents and grandparents, finishes the THR packet in 15 days, while Sanjay eats rice. Sometimes, he spends the day hungry.Sanjay Bambre has been a moderately acute malnourished child for seven months. His mother says he does not like the taste of the powder. Express Sanjay Bambre has been a moderately acute malnourished child for seven months. His mother says he does not like the taste of the powder. ExpressIn the same village, Raju Bhoir, whose daughter Shanu is aged nine months, says, We are forcefully given the THR packets even if we refuse them, because the anganwadi has a target to fulfill. I sometimes feed the powder to my chicken if we cant finish it. Please do something about the food. Its quality is poor. Why will we feed our children poor-quality food?The latest ICDS data (till November 2016) shows 6.7 lakh children are malnourished in the state, of which 1.5 lakh are from tribal districts. In Amravati, following a writ petition that questioned the efficacy of the THR, the Bombay High Court passed a ruling in 2011 that allowed only hot cooked meals for children aged less than six. After the ruling, the number of children coming to anganwadis has increased, says Purnima Upadhyay, attached with NGO Khoj, adding, It shows children prefer fresh cooked meals.The HC ruling has been implemented only in Amravati. In Nandurbar, Yogini Khanolkar of the Narmada Bachao Andolan says it has been noticed that the rural and tribal population here prefers hot cooked food over ready-to-eat packets. The government needs to understand cultural differences of each tribe. Their food choices are different and we cannot implement uniform food for everyone, she says.Nandurbar records the states highest malnutrition cases. The demand for THR, however, is low, even when parents have no food to give their children. They are not habituated to the taste of the THR. Children traditionally eat millet, wheat chapattis and dal, social activist Latika Rajput says.In Gadchiroli, tribal children consume THR only if a home-cooked meal is not affordable. The THR consumption is uneven. While it is meant for children, the entire family consumes it during food shortage. How can we ensure only children eat it? Shubhdha Deshmukh from NGO Amhi Amachya Arogyasathi says.Palghars deputy CEO of ICDS Rajendra Patil told The Indian Express, This is a state policy that we are implementing. We cant create different nutrition providers for our district. He says ICDS officials are yet to receive any complaint from parents about the THR.On the NGOs criticism of THR, Maharashtras Secretary for Women and Child Development Vinita Singhal says its quality is being improved to improve acceptance level. NGOs have raised the issue of the poor quality of food. If that is improved, children will eat THR, she says.But Raju Bhoir, father of five daughters, says, Children will eat what they like. Nothing can be forced. He cultivates rice on the hill slopes of Jawahar, and uses half the produce for his wife and daughters. The THR powder is fed to the cattle, he adds.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

She is a proud owner of a 'traditional' farm house complete with a vegetable and dairy farm in the outskirts of the city on the OMR, built using the vernacular architecture style.I am originally from Kerala but have lived here all my life. I built a house like this mainly because of the fact that I wanted my children to grow up knowing their roots. Despite living in the city, we make sure we come here at least three times a week, says Malini.Having helped set up her husbands software firm, Malini realised that her passion lies in farming. After reading articles about the excessive use of pesticides in farming these days, she was worried about the health of her daughters; that was when she decided to set up her own farm. I had a small vegetable garden at first. Slowly, it expanded to include fruits like papayas, guavas and mangoes and grains like paddy, sesame, ragi, etc. Now we have a tiny dairy farm too, she smiles.After five years of pursuing her passion, she realised the impact that this can have on other peoples lives and started distributing the surplus to her extended family and friends. My speciality is mappillai samba and seeraga samba rice, the healthiest forms of rice available in the market today. I want to encourage people to eat healthy, says Malini who only uses the cooking oil extracted from her groundnut crop.Malini believes that tradition should be a part of everybody's life  however busy one may be. We make it a point to celebrate festivals in our farmhouse. We invite several families over and have an elaborate set of festivities on Pongal and Diwali, says the mother of two, who also organised a cultural event last year, where archery was taught to friends and family members."

The only Zilla Parishad school will remain shut until October. For the village elderly, however, there is reason to worry. This is our story every monsoon, septuagenarian Sanguni Damo Badur says as she stares at a barren trough that she knows will soon flood with heavy rains. Her wrinkled face creases further, Over the years, I have lost count of the number of times we have asked for a bridge or at least a road to this village.Every monsoon four padas in Kurlod Jambhulpada, Raipada, Sedasyachapada, Amdesyapada  remain cut from the entire district when heavy rains swell streams leaving padas sandwiched between steep hills on one side and the river on the other. A meeting between public works department (PWD) and district collector on Monday showed there are five such padas that get isolated during rains in Palghar, one of the tribal-dominated regions in Maharashtra.When there is an urgent need for medicines, men who know how to swim go across the river to closest primary health centre (PHC), ASHA worker Ranjana Sonu Pophane said. Last year, there were three deliveries done at home by a local midwife in Jambhulpada. Villagers claim if a pregnant woman is critical, the only way to reach a hospital is to tie her to bamboo sticks and carry her uphill which takes an hour on foot before a 108 emergency ambulance can be reached.The golden hour is lost by then. In haemorrhage cases where there is heavy bleeding during delivery, nothing can be done, Dr Ganesh Ahir, medical officer at PHC, said. In 2014, social activist Jayshree Bhore remembers death of a pregnant woman due to haemorrhage in a Jambhulpada hut during monsoons. There was nothing we could do. Our NGO gives first aid to all such hamlets before monsoons but for critical cases, there is nowhere to go, she adds.Accredited Social Health Activist or ASHA stocks four months of wheat and rice for children in the hamlet where currently at least four malnourished children reside. There is no Anganwadi in the hamlet. The local PHC gives her advance medicine supply for diarrhoea, fever, vomiting and water-borne infections. The padas have an estimated 300 population. But immunisation of children, lactating or pregnant women is impossible during this time, Bhore adds.Jambhulpada has one zilla parishad school till fourth class where 15 children study under one teacher. The teacher stops coming from June until October fearing he may get drowned in the stream. Villager Jairam Sitaram claims they have made several representations in front of local politicians to construct a bridge connecting Kurlod to Jambhulpada.In 2016, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis asked district authorities to submit a report identifying the hamlets that get isolated during monsoons and propose an action plan. Eight months after the order, the government is still gearing up to deal with yet another monsoon and there is no road network to reach these isolated hamlets.Since we cannot immediately construct roads or a bridge, for now we have supplied wheat and rice for next four months to all such hamlets. Our department will submit a report to state government for funds to improve connectivity, Palghar collector Dr Prashant Narnawre said.In 2016, Aarohan, an NGO, built a cement pathway connecting Kurlod and Jambhulpada. But if water level rises beyond it, it will become useless, says villager Shivaji Gode. State health minister Deepak Sawant claimed that a mapping of 108 emergency ambulance service has been done to connect sensitive regions with health posts.Sitting outside his mud hut where sacks of rice their treasured food for the next few months lay preserved, Sitaram smiles, We have lived our entire life waiting for a road. Our grandchildren have learnt to live with infection during every monsoon.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The banana leaf is many times bigger than any metal or porcelain plate and hence a dozen or more dishes can be served on it simultaneously. One has to sit cross-legged in front of the leaf. Vegetables are served on the top half of the leaf. Rice is served on the lower half.Then, sambar is poured in the crater formed in a mound of rice. The palm is used to squeeze the rice and sambar together. In the olden days, cups were made with cut and folded banana leaves. But the modern generation lacks the expertise to make banana leaf cups. Holding rasam or payasam on the leaf and scooping them with the palm of the hand and drinking without a slurping noise requires experience.After finishing a meal, one has to fold the upper half of the banana leaf towards the lower half to indicate that one is contented with the food served. In modern days, people fold the banana leaf to hide the amount of food wasted on the leaf, though wasting food is considered a sin. If you clean up the leaf without leaving a grain of rice, it would indicate that you relished the meal served by the host. Slurping and licking the fingers in a festive meal would indicate that you loved the dishes served.In some southern districts of Tamil Nadu, after a wedding feast, guests leave back cash in an envelope below the banana leaf. The women folks of the host collect the leftover banana leaves in one basket and the currency notes left below the leaves in another basket.In a small town in south Tamil Nadu, I had a meal on a banana leaf in a hotel. At the end of the meal, I got up and washed my hand in the wash-basin. The waiter followed me and politely asked me to remove the banana leaf and put it in drums kept for the purpose. To fold a leaf with leftover liquids and solids on it and carry it to the bin without spilling anything was a Herculean task.In the olden days, my grandfather used to buy a dozen large banana leaves in the weekly village shandy. The leaves were cleaned, cut to size and rolled up in a jute sack which prevented the leaves from drying up. The leaves remained green and fresh for a week until the next shandy. Though imitation banana leaves made of plastic have arrived in the market, they are no match for the natural banana leaves which impart a signature flavour to the food served on them and the best part is, they are biodegradable."

None proved to be plastic rice. It is fake news, Mrinalini Darswal commissioner of the state food safety department told HT.Rumours about plastic rice have been making rounds and spreading like wildfire over the past few days. It all started when customer complained that plastic rice was used to prepare biryani in Hyderabad.The news not only grabbed media headlines but also became viral on social media as wheat and paddy forms the staple diet of Indians.We have been receiving calls from wary customers across Delhi. Such rumours were also spreading across the social media. Earlier this month we received a grievance letter from a person. It was then we decided to go for a random check, said a food safety officer of the department.The samples were checked in the food laboratory of the department of food safety. All the samples complied with the specification under regulation no 2.4.6.5 of the Food Products Standards and Food Additives Regulation Act 2011 which defines the standards of rice in India.Only four samples were found to be misbranded due to labelling violations and one sample of cooked rice was found to be unsafe as it contained some bacteria, said Darswal.Environment right activist Vikrant Tongad who had shot the grievance letter to the food safety department said the panic about plastic rice being imported from China and flooding the markets were making rounds in social media.It was unlikely that plastic rice would be imported to India as it costs much more than normal paddy. Secondly India produces enough paddy and doesnt need to import rice from China. But as news of plastic rice were also surfacing from other countries I decided to inform the food safety department, said Tongad.Sources said that the concept of plastic rice first surfaced around seven years back in China. It was popularly known as the Wuchang Rice Scandal. It was said to be made out of sweet potatoes and synthetic resin moulded into the shape of real rice. In 2016 Nigerian authorities claimed to have seized around 2.5 tons of plastic rice."

Under their on-going project Adhyayan they make an attempt to admit eligible children from various slums across the city to private schools under the RTE Act section 12 (1)(c) of the Indian constitution which mandates a minimum of 25 percent reservation for children at the entry level belonging to economically and socially weaker sections in private unaided primary schools.Three years ago, a bunch of youngsters from KIIT university founded Desire foundation. With a motto to encourage social entrepreneurship, they started manufacturing books and lights for slum dwellers. This was also the time when they realised that the problem is not the facilities, but lack of education.Ten interns are working on the issue in the citySpeaking to the City Express the team coordinator said, Along with manufacturing books and lights, we also started the Rice Bucket Challenge in Bhubaneshwar after it was initiated in Hyderabad. Then, we came across this (education) issue and when we went through the statistics of implementation of RTE Act section 12 (1)(c) of our constitution, we found it to be negligible in the city. This was the time when we decided to work on it and make people aware of the act and get it implemented.This group of youngsters went through an internship programme in IIM Ahmedabad on public policy before starting Adhyayan. It has been a year that we started Adhyayan and during this span, we have admitted five children from the Mahimanagar slum, Bhubaneshwar, in the private school and shortlisted 50 children for the same, he stated.They say we rise by lifting others, Desire believes in a similar thought. What all challenges did they face while working on the project? Well, there were many obstacles while working on it. Some parents were not aware of the act. Convincing them was a tough task. Language was another formidable issue that we faced. However, overcoming all of it, we finally managed to shortlist 25 eligible children. Only seven out of these 25 children had the required documents. We contacted a number of schools nearby to discuss the admission procedures, he says.He adds, We realised that RTE awareness is in a dire state. Most schools were unaware of any such act. In order to solve this, we approached OPEPA (Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority) seeking their support. The officials at OPEPA recommended us to meet BEO authorities (Block Education Office) for the matter. We commuted every day to the Block Education Office to carve out a solution for the situation. The officials at BEO were highly coordinating and supportive of our cause and eventually, the first phase of Adhyayan towards the change was successful, responded the 24-year-old.Desire foundation has initiated the project with a survey in Hyderabad. Ten interns are working on the issue in the city. We are seeking support for Adhyayan from Hyderabad as well to admit 50 children to school this year and give wings to their dream, concludes the team coordinator."

There have been three complaints against Ravindra in the North Beach station so far.Police said Ravindra got acquainted with Kannan, a co-producer in the Tamil cinema industry, two years ago. He had asked Kannan to invest `25 lakh in the rice pulling vessel promising him double the returns once the vessel was sold. Believing him, Kannan gave him `25 lakh, but never got any money in return. After threatening to file a police complaint, Ravindra returned the money. However, a few months later, he managed to convince Kannan into giving him `19 lakh on the same condition, said an investigation officer.After he failed to get the money, Kannan filed a complaint at the North Beach station.During probe, officials found that Ravindra had two associates, Rahul and Basha, who assisted him in tracing well-to-do persons to be conned.The modus operandi, the police said, was similar. They would claim that the rice-puller is an ancient artefact made of copper and iridium, which has the capacity to draw rice grains. They even claim that this was an expensive metal used in satellites and nuclear weapons, for which NASA and ISRO would spend crores of rupees, said the officer.To lend more credibility to the fraudulent scheme, the victims are often shown bank documents of international buyers. Further probe is on to trace the money taken from the victims and a search launched for Basha and Rahul."

(Source: Reuters)In the backstreets of Agras Muslim quarter, where shoes have been made for centuries, small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community.The election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow, an animal they consider sacred.Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March, immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry.Last month the Modi government also banned trading cattle for slaughter, including not just cows, whose killing was already outlawed in most states, but also buffalo, an animal used for meat and leather.Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle, labour in tanneries and make shoes, bags and belts  including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks.Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry.Social TensionsMuch of Indias meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy, meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure.But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides.Abdul Faheem Qureshi, a representative of Indias Muslim Qureshi community of butchers, said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100.The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of Indias poorest communities, and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019.Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh governments move, arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industrys image.Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely, including from abroad.Still, millions work in the meat and leather industries, which are worth more than $16 billion in annual sales.When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered, shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo, buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes.They want to weaken us. They want to snatch our bread, says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem, whose workers stitch $3 shoes in his cellar, referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders.Muqeems monthly income has halved to $300 since last year as leather has become scarce. His dozen casual workers, down from 40, now use mostly synthetic materials.Impossible TargetLike meat, Indias leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade, providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes.Agra, in Uttar Pradesh, turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks. An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city, famed as the home of the Taj Mahal, depends on the industry.Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted. Zara and did not respond to requests for comment.India is one of the worlds top five producers of leather, with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo.Modi government is targeting leather revenues of $27 billion  more than double todays level  by 2020 as part of a job creation push.But in May, the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production  a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales.Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy.But industry officials said the shock of the ban, coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers, meant business would not easily recover.Companies say the governments leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed.There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order, which has come as the biggest blow, Puran Dawar, chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries, said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor, referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter.There are grave concerns about the supply of leather, exports of shoes and overall employment.There were no comments on the same by the commerce ministry.In Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March.About 30 percent of hides, mostly from buffaloes, that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs.Sitting in his one-room shop in Agras leather market, Mohammad Hashim, a burly leather dealer in his sixties, said business was down 40 percent in the last three months.The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims, he said, pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart.Modis election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack. As a minority making up 14 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people, they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus.When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame, one of the Imams thunders: Modi is to blame. He is targeting Muslims.In an interview with Reuters, Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group.Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits, he said in Lucknow, the state capital.Wider Industry HitIn the industrial city of Kanpur, 250 km (155 miles) east of Agra, tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up.Nayyar Jamal, general secretary of Kanpurs Small Tanners Association, reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpurs leather and related industries are temporarily jobless, including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution. Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent.Qureshi, from the butchers organisation, estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit.More than the economic loss, the government has injected fear, said Chandra Bhan Prasad, a writer and businessman from the Dalit community, as those at the bottom of Hinduisms social hierarchy once called untouchables are known. Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them.Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month  down from 25,000  because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes. He has a months inventory left, and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff.Shahnawaz Qureshi, a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeems cellar in Agra, lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather.He now earns 3,000 rupees  or $47  a month, down from 4,500 in his previous job, and together with his fathers income supports three sisters and his mother.I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The BJP is a minor partner of the NPF-led Democratic Alliance of Nagaland (DAN) government in the state.The CEC resolves to urge the (state) government to take up with the central government to desist from imposing restrictions on the dietary habits of the people, said a statement issued by the party.This is the first time the ruling party in Nagaland has taken an official stand on Centres notification banning cattle trade in animal markets for the purpose of slaughter.Despite assurances by senior BJP leaders that there would be no curbs on food habits, opposition to the notification continues in Christian-dominated Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram, where consumption of beef is common.Assembly elections are due in all three states, where consumption of beef is common, next year.The culinary preferences of the Naga people, along with their traditional, religious and customary practices (should not be) infringed upon by any unilateral decision of the central government, the resolution added.NPF is part of the BJP-led anti-Congress front, North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), and also the partner of the saffron party-led government in Manipur.Earlier this month, Meghalayas North Garo Hills district president of the party, Bachu C Marak, resigned accusing the BJP of dishonouring my culture and traditional practices. He followed Bernard N Marak, West Garo Hills district president, who quit after the BJPs senior leadership shut down his plans of a beef party.The sacked leaders claim they were planning to organise the beef and rice beer feast in order to allay fears among local residents that the BJP might be trying to control their food habits with the restrictions on cattle trade.But the partys central leadership says the beef fest was just an excuse by some disgruntled leaders to quit the party ahead of the assembly elections and seek tickets from other parties."

All the main rice traders in the city are under the scanner,"" District Civil Supply Officer Amar Mohapatra said.A local news channel reported that a family in Cuttack's Sheikh Bazaar had bought rice which, when cooked, did not release any aroma. The report said the rice grains did not break even after they were fully cooked.

The party leadership would issue a ticket to the winnable candidate after conducting survey and eliciting the opinion of party workers and the people, he said.He issued stern warning to local police officials for behaving inappropriately when the organisers of the convention approached them to seek permission for the event. The BJP is making a list of officials who harassed the partymen. We will show them the right place at the right time, he warned.He also visited Mandya, Maddur, Pandavapura taluks, addressed the party workers and had breakfast and lunch in the houses of Dalits.Yeddyurappa kept firing a salvo at Siddaramaiah and the Congress government, but he abstained from making even a mention of JD(S) during his tour in the district.Protest against BSYIn Maddur, members of Kasturi Karnataka Janapara Vedike staged a protest against Yeddyurappa and raised slogans for not receiving their complaints related to farmers issues.He is not concerned about the farmers. The tour is just for political gain, they alleged.Yeddyurappas much-publicised interaction with the slum-dwellers of Tamil Colony turned out to be a platform for only receiving petitions from the residents. The residents of the colony, who had been waiting to share their grievances with the leader, were left disappointed.Yeddyurappa said that the BJP government had launched works for constructing houses in Tamil Colony. The issue is now in the court due to the inefficiency of the government which has failed to argue the case properly. If BJP comes to power, suitable action would be taken and permanent shelter provided to the residents, he assured.He alleged that Siddaramaiah had hijacked the popular Anna Bhagya scheme of the Centre. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been giving Rs 30 per kg of rice and wheat at Rs 20 per kg but the state has been projecting it as their scheme, he said.Yeddyurappa was accompanied by former MP Tejaswini Ramesh, former IAS officer Shivaram, former minister B Somashekar and others."
