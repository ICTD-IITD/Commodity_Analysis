Coconut Oil Is Not Better Than Butter, Say Experts",http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/wait-coconut-oil-is-not-better-than-butter-says-the-american-heart-association-1713272,2017-06-16,"Highlights Coconut oil has long been touted as one of the best oils for health From cooking to beauty needs; it is used for a variety of purposes Coconut oil is believed to improve digestion and boost immunityImage via American Heart AssociationThe debate on the best cooking oil for a healthy lifestyle continues. While some stand by traditional cooking oils like coconut oil and mustard oil, there are others who vouch for newer variants like rice bran oil, canola oil and the like. In this battle of cooking oils, coconut oil has long held a strong hold of being good for health. It is one of the most commonly used oils in India, particularly South India, having a variety of purposes - from cooking to beauty needs, improving digestion, boosting immunity, facilitating weight loss, promoting healthy hair and skin, and maintaining heart health. But recent studies suggest that it may actually be worse than butter.According to a report, Dietary Fats Cardiovascular Disease: A Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association, coconut oil consumption is worse than having butter and other sources of saturated fats. Saturated fat consumption has long been tied to the rising incident of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). ""Clinical trials that used polyunsaturated fat to replace saturated fat reduced the incidence of CVD. The main sources of saturated fat to be decreased are dairy fat (butter), lard (pork), palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil,"" noted AHA.As per the table given above, coconut oil consists of close to 80% of saturated fat, quite high when compared to other ingredients such as lard, peanut butter, pork among others. A diet high in saturated fat is one of the biggest perpetrators of cardiovascular ailments and high cholesterol. Experts suggest switching to unsaturated vegetable oils for better health.""A recent systematic review found 7 controlled trials, including the 2 just mentioned, that compared coconut oil with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils. Coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol in all 7 of these trials, significantly in 6 of them. Clinical trials that compared direct effects on CVD of coconut oil and other dietary oils have not been reported. However, because coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, a cause of CVD, and has no known offsetting favorable effects, we advise against the use of coconut oil,"" noted the AHA research."

The OCSC, in its June 12 order, discontinued the handling charges paid to the custom millers for delivering the stock of rice at Rice Receiving Centre (RRC)-cum-Departmental Storage Centre (DSC) and stacking inside the godown citing that the handling charges amount to double payment.As a result, about 2 lakh quintals of rabi paddy are yet to be procured from the farmers. About 12.51 lakh quintals of rabi paddy have already been purchased in 70 purchasing centres run by 43 Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies, District Civil Supply Officer Siba Prasad Dora said.Farmers forum to protest Mandsaur killings todaySAMBALPUR: The Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti (POKSSS) will be staging road block across Western Odisha on Friday for one hour condemning killings of farmers at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.

The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi have fallen flat while the padyatra by Congress national vice-president Rahul Gandhi was nothing but a public stunt to woo the people.Neglected and struggling to make ends meet due to Central apathy, farmers of the district have questioned the vikas in Sab Ka Saath, Sabka Vikas Sammelan. Even as the district BJP gears to welcome Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to Bargarh on Saturday to attend the programme, marking three years of Modi Government, farmers of the the rice bowl of Odisha are peeved at the silence and inaction of the Centre on issues which would have improved their condition. They are also angered over the killing of farmers in Mandsuar in MP and the stand of BJP in resolving Mahanadi conflict.After the BJP organised Farmers Convention here on February 21 last year and Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed them, farmers had high hopes from the Centre. Instead of declaring sops for the district where farmer suicides are high, Modi advised multi-cropping and diversion of crop which they had already adopted.Farm loan waiver and strengthening of irrigation which would have brought some relief for the farmers trapped in the vicious cycle of debt, found no mention.Rahuls promise to rake up the plight of farmers in Bargarh after his 8 km padaytra in September 2015, never happened.Subsequently, Naveen visited Sohela in November the same year and promised strengthening of irrigation. The assurances could not stop suicides and Khainu Bagarti of Kendpali ended his life on February 28 this year after his deep borewell failed to irrigate land due to erratic power supply.Krushak Vikash Manch president, Jaykrushna Sahu said the BJP in its poll manifesto had mentioned to increase the MSP of agriculture produce to 1.5 times of cost of production of the crop. There has been no signs of this in the last three years, he added.Alleging non-payment of compensation against crop loss in rabi and kharif seasons, he revealed that the crop loss has been calculated at `245 crore in last kharif season and questioned what vikas is BJP talking about."

Here are 6 Vegetables That Can Help,http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/want-to-lose-weight-here-are-6-vegetables-that-can-help-1713052,2017-06-16,"Highlights Carrots are low in energy density due to their high fiber & water content Cauliflower can be a brilliant substitute for refined carbohydrates Spinach is full of protein that burns up more calories during digestionA new study, published in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, suggests that switching to a vegetarian diet is one of the healthiest ways to lose weight. It may be true because there's so much that a vegetarian diet can offer - lots of fiber to keep you full for longer, essential vitamins, protein to increase your metabolism and healthy carbohydrates to keep you energized. If you're motivated and would like to take the plunge, here are six vegetables you must include in your diet to support your weight loss goals.Mushrooms are delicious and loved for their chewy texture that makes them a great substitute for meat. Grilled or roasted, they contain a mere 25 calories for 100 grams and most of their weight is water weight.Carrots are low in energy density because of their high fiber and water content. Low-energy density foods fill you up while consuming fewer calories. Raw and crunchy carrot sticks make for a great healthy snack to curb your cravings between meals and prevent overeating. Enjoy them with a quick dip made of hung curb and fresh herbs.The humble cauliflower is being touted as the trendiest vegetable of 2017. It has no fat, is full of fiber and just so versatile. It has been used to make a delicious pizza base and even the popular cauliflower rice which goes to prove that it can be a brilliant substitute for refined carbohydrates. Other cruciferous vegetables like cabbage and broccoli are also great options.Bell peppers are great for weight loss as they contain a compound called dihydrocapsiate that boosts your metabolism and they also have a high content of vitamin C. Vitamin C counteracts the stress hormone - cortisol which is known to be one of the primary reasons for accumulating belly fat. Throw them in a wholesome salad for dinner or make a quick wrap with a homemade sauce for lunch on-the-go.Dark leafy greens such as spinach are great for weight loss. Spinach is full of protein that burns up more calories during digestion. It is low in calories plus provides you with iron, folate, magnesium, calcium and plenty of antioxidants.You should reserve a part of your meals for foods that are not only low in calories but also keep you full for longer. Due to its high water and fibre content, a glass of cucumber juice fills you up easily and so, it can be a great meal filler. You can also squeeze some lime juice and add a few mint leaves to make a refreshing summer drink.Take advantage of these powerful and delicious vegetables that fit the bill and can help you lose weight in a healthy way."

An engineer by training, and a dedicated history buff for more than 10 years, he has been scouring the Manipuri countryside for relics of the Battle of Imphal-Kohima (1944), a turning point in World War II, fought between the British and the Japanese (along with Subhas Chandra Boses Indian National Army) in northeastern India. Singh now has a museum to build.He and his team have found scores of rifles, artillery shells and grenades lobbed by the British at the Japanese and vice-versa. They have also found war witnesses such as Yangmaso Shishak, 80. But the biscuit-and-Bose stories of Shishak have been difficult to digest.Yangmaso Shishak, then a student, was a witness to the Battle of Shangshak, 1944, in Ukhrul district, Manipur. But some of his stories are full of fancy. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)In 44, Shishak, then a student, had been a runner carrying letters from camp to camp for the British on top of a hill near Imphal. When the British retreated and the Japanese overran his village, he ran errands for them too. Iwaichi Fujiwara, one of the top Japanese intelligence officers, Shishak says, fed him biscuits. Shishak says he also stood next to Subhash Bose on a hill as Bose looked through the binoculars towards Imphal  crying.Really?Boses INA had reached Manipur, but not Bose, says Singh, steering the conversation with Shishak back to that part of the story where the old man stays on the side of facts. When the museum to commemorate the Battle of Imphal (see box) finally comes up, with sections on participating soldiers and war witnesses, not all of Shishaks accounts will be included.Further background checks will have to be done when the museum  a civilian initiative awaiting some clearances from the central government and funds from Japans Nippon Foundation  comes up on Imphals Tiddim Road. We are, however, sitting with Shishak on top of a hill in Ukhrul district, outside Imphal. Tiddim Road is to its north-east.FaultlinesDaytime in Ukhrul is straight out of a tourist brochure: men lounge outside roadside inns; women sell berries and chips from behind shop-counters; tractors turn slowly on rice fields. The Assam Rifles regiment, a paramilitary force born in the belly of the British Empire, still patrols the area, underlining the difference between night and day. At night there are more patrols, say locals. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act is in place in Manipur since 1980.(Second from right) Angabam Singh, co-founder of a foundation of history buffs in Manipur. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)But Ukhrul is Thuingaleng Muivah territory. A leader of one of the more powerful factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, Muivah is a Tangkhul Naga from Manipur. Meitis, Kukis and Nagas of Manipur have been locked in conflict for years. Angabam Singh, a Meiti, hopes when the museum comes up it will remind them of a time when they fought together, not each other.Subedar Ninglam Tangkhul, 90, a Naga, fought in the Battle of Kohima. I was given 200 rounds of ammunition, a rifle and a water can. The British told us to fight, we fought. Years later when he battled Naga insurgents fighting for a separate nation, as part of the Indian army, he seemed to have applied the same rationale. Im a soldier. In a situation where Im likely to be killed, I will kill, says the retired Subedar. The north-easts ethnic conflicts intensified post World War II with various ethnic groups contesting joining the Indian nation.Chaoba, the caretaker of the memorial Manipuris built in the memory of fallen Japanese soldiers at Red Hill on Tiddim Road. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)Nagas, Kukis (people of the Hill) and Meitis (the Valley people), however, participated in the war in no small measure. At the INA memorial in Moirang, the gallery lists at least 20 of them. Some of them went on to have successful political careers: Moirembam Singh (latter-day Congressman and Manipur CM); Laiphrakpam Sanaba Singh, who later became a follower of Irabot Singh, one of the founder leaders of the Communist Party of India in Manipur; Hemam Nilamanisingh, who turned Congressman after being returning home after his release from a Burma jail. This is Indias forgotten war. Weve to revive the story, says Santosh Shekhar, Singhs counterpart in the Manipur Tourism Forum, joint partners of the museum initiative.Shekhars father, a Malayali, landed in Imphal following his brother, an Armyman posted in the Northeast. His mother is Manipuri. All the worlds soldiers seemed to have converged here at some point, says Shekhar with a laugh. The Japanese lost around 30,000 soldiers here during World War II and they havent forgotten it, he adds. Shishaks Fujiwara, the main liaison man between Bose and the Japanese army top brass, even wrote a book after the war where he anointed himself Lawrence of Arabia of Southeast Asia.World War II veteran 90 years old subedar AS Ninglam Tangkhul. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)In the Battle of Imphal, Manipuris fought on both sides. With the British and the Japanese. Henkholun Vaipei, a Kuki, 92, who joined up as a rifleman with the 3rd Assam Rifles of the British army, says he heard the Japanese appealing to Manipuris in their language to join them over loudspeakers; but he didnt do so. Desertion was an option he did not exercise, he says, as the times were confusing.An ordinary soldier like Vaipei went to battle against the Japanese because he was asked to, without any stakes. At the end of it he had a character certificate. It said his character and his musketry were good. I went without water for days. I couldnt move my tongue. The war taught me to fight. And it taught me to stay alive, says Vaipei, now a farmer.Side effectsThe Manipuris dream of being an independent people (Manipur was conquered by the British in the 1890s and merged with India in 1949) with a new post-colonial destiny was virtually finished by the time World War II was over.The monarchy had been humiliated into obedience, Manipuri generals hanged in the time of the British. Manipuri youth even today hardly know their history, says Sam Tonsingh (name changed on request), a retired scribe whose relative was one of the front-ranking leaders of the United National Liberation Front, one of Manipurs oldest insurgent groups. After accession to India, the history books that Manipuri children grew up reading were full of Rajputs, Aibaks, Tughlaqs and other stories about mainstream India.The Japanese corner with photos of Japan officers, including Fujiwara, in the makeshift museum at Arambam Singhs home in Imphal. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)Integration with India in Manipur, is, however, not a done deal. The conflict is still talked of behind closed rooms. Youngsters who point to the growing number of Audis or brightly-painted stand-alone restaurants on Imphal streets still give no straight answer to whether separatism is dead or alive. The Battle of Imphal, which Manipuris call the Japanese War, in such circumstances, seems a neutral terrain on which many Manipuris appear ready to build a new history of reconciliation  with its own divided ethnic groups and with mainland India.There is no problem in being with India. I mean we dont think about it, says Singh while going on to add that anyone who is 70 plus now and was in the British army and then the Indian army, has fought in the Battle of Imphal. Air Marshal Arjan Singh [the only Indian Air Force officer promoted to a rank equal to a Field Marshal] flew Spitfires around our skies.Japanese enthusiasm to remember the Battle of Imphal has also provided tourism professionals like Singh with opportunities. We were surprised by their interest  for the 70th anniversary day function, the Japanese ambassador was the first to confirm his participation, says Shekhar.At least 15 Japanese (veterans, soldiers children, academics) visit Manipur every month to re-connect with their personal histories or individual quests. Singh and Rajeshwar Yumnam, his co-founder at 2nd World War Imphal Campaign Foundation, are the go-to guys for all sorts of war-related projects these days. Even bone collection!Relic-hunting also has its funny moments. The first time the group came across a hand grenade was on top of a hill in 2014. We were terrified, says team member Jayanta Luwangcha, a swimmer and a telecom professional. We threw ourselves on the ground and threw stones at it. And waited. The outer part of these things are rusted but the TNT is still alive. We even had a stretcher ready. Collecting relics across the state also gave them an opportunity to understand that there could be multiple narratives about the war.Japan loveThe Battle of Imphal wrecked local economies and lives. Trees were burnt, bridges blasted, people died. The number of Manipuris who died in that battle is still unclear. For the British we were just a buffer state between them and Burma. There is not much documentation about us, says Shekhar.In the 60s, Maibamlotpaching, a little village in Manipur, near the proposed museum site, decided to make history on its own terms. Or lets put it this way: its people just have a very big heart.Henkholun Vaipei, a Kuki, joined up as a rifleman with the 3rd Assam Rifles during the Battle of Imphal. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)Henkholun Vaipeis Burma Star. The Burma Star is a military campaign medal given the UK to its soldiers who served in the Second World War, especifically in the Burma Campaign from 1941 to 1945. The Battle of Imphal is considered tobe part of the Burma Campaign. (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)The Japanese had been aggressors but had the British been any different? We had seen death at close quarters. There were bodies of Japanese soldiers everywhere and no one to take care of them. They were far from home... We decided to honour the dead. We cremated them and built a memorial, says Gourmohan, a local, who began the initiative. Veterans of the 33 Japanese Division returned to this village and erected the pillars. A Japanese professor teaching in Imphal paid for the fence.Everyone loves a success story. Should nation-states not embrace, or at least acknowledge their failures and miss-steps, people who arent on the right side of the story, people with whom they go to battle? The price of forgetting ones own history has always been steep."

The traditional holiday is a time to eat sticky rice, drink rice wine, race dragon boats and indulge in festivities with friends and family.The dim sums include Vegetarian Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, Chicken and Prawn Sticky Rice, Pork Belly Sticky Rice and Minced Lamb Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. Sticky rice is a must try, even by those who are wary of it. Served in two portions in a basket shaped like dimsums, they are light yet filling. Steamed in lotus leaf, you get the rich and lovely aroma of lotus leaf as you open the basket.The square, vegetarian dim sum tastes good. The mix of all vegetables mainly mushrooms and carrots sticks out from all sides in sticky rice, which is served in the shape of a cuboid. The water chestnut is also stuffed inside which gives it a refreshing flavour. The size of the grain is also retained.The Chicken and Prawn Sticky Rice had minced chicken and a prawn lost in the corner, stuffed in sticky rice. They have skimped on the seafood and you literally have to break it open to find a half piece of prawn in it. The minced lamb is a better option with its fibrous and moderately hard meat.From the Wok Dishes, one can choose from Stir-fry French Beans with Shitake Mushrooms, Braised Chicken Claypot with Mushroom, Wild Prawn Curry with Almond and Chestnuts and Stir-fry Lamb in Black Pepper Sauce. The beans in Stir Fry French Beans with mushrooms were crunchy, cooked to perfection. The dish is nice, garlicky and saucy. The wild prawn curry, which has a predominantly coconut milk flavour, is creamy with medium-size bland prawns in them. The consistency of the curry is very thin so try it with jasmine rice.You may also order Kung Pao Chicken from their regular menu. The Kung Pao Chicken looks appetising and tastes great with its combination of all the flavours. It has pieces of dried chillies and cashew nuts. When you take a bite of the chilly, it does not burn because of the sauces. The sauces in fact give it a sweet taste and the cashew nuts add a salty crunch to the dish. The stir fried chicken chunks are soft and delicious.To complete the festive meal, you can enjoy the Mango and Wine Soaked Water Chestnut Cake with Sauvignon Sorbet is unique and unusual. It has a mousse and sorbet. The sorbet is made of litchi juice and a little curd. It is very cold and thus gives you a fun electric shock. But it does linger for long because it melts as soon as you try a mouthful.The mango mousse is delicate. Stuffed with mangoes and topped with pieces of ripe mangoes and water chest nuts on a layer of white chocolate, all on a base of brownie. The bitterness of the chocolate filling, the creamy milk chocolate, sweet mango pieces and the mildness of the water chest nuts give a well-rounded taste.Try their limited edition menu of the Dragon Boat Festival until June 26."

If it is a guided walk with a local, it turns even educative.

These are the true children of the forest who know how to survive under the direst circumstances. Well, I had an insight into their lives recently in the Philippines, during a forest trail in Pamulaklakin Forest in Subic Bay Freeport, Zambales. This was right after my exhilarating experience in the Puning Hot Springs.Mount Pinatubo, that erupted in 1991 made the entire region quite fertile including the Pamulaklakin forest, which is inhabited by the Aetas. Aetas are an indigenous people who live in scattered, isolated mountainous parts in the Philippines.Thought to be among the earliest inhabitants of the Philippines, they are of small stature with a light frame, dark brown skin, kinky hair, a small nose and deep brown eyes. Nestor, an Aetas, took us on a long trail in the forest, revealing different herbs and trees, and their uses. It was a fascinating trek crossing small streams, going over bridges, walking through thick woods and climbing mildly steep hills.He showed us the Vinegar Leaf that is used in cooking, which indeed tasted sour. Then he pulled out some herbs that cure kidney stones and diabetes. Later, he took the bark of a tree, crushed it and rubbed it between his palms with a bit of water, working into a rich lather.Yes, that is what they use for washing their hair. When they are thirsty, they go to a particular tree; cut a branch, from where oozes water. We all lined up to taste as if its the divine nectar, though what each of us got was a mere drop.But that drop makes a difference when you are thirsty! He took us to a liana (woody vine), cut a long piece, made fine strands out of which he made a thin but strong rope by twisting them together; then he tied it to a bow as a bowstring. It is the same vine what we call Rattan, well known for its use in furniture and ropes. He also made a couple of traps with the same vine that is used to catch jungle fowl and monkeys. Of course, they do eat monkeys (and many other small animals).Meanwhile, a woman came to us holding two bamboos: one had rice in it while the other, some reddish gravy. Nestor said they use bamboo as containers to cook rice and curry. We stopped at the Balete tree, which he identified as a strangler fig. They are notorious for starting upon other trees, later entrapping them entirely and finally killing the host tree: they played a great role in destroying temples in Angkor Wat in Cambodia.The locals believe that spirits reside in the Balete tree. On the way, I met a group of young girls, dressed in shorts and T-shirts like any modern youngsters. They all study in nearby schools and can communicate in English.The forest trail was followed by an amusing jungle survival exercise that was like a stand-up comedy show. Tata Kasoy, one of the elder members of the Pastolan Tribe of the Aetas, is very theatrical and adds a lot of vitality to his performance. He was born under a cashew tree, hence the name Kasoy (means cashew in their language).Clad in a loincloth (the Ayta traditional clothing: the bahag), speaking broken English, Tata Kasoy indulged in melodrama, at times going overboard. He demonstrated how to craft a spoon, a fork, a cup and a container to cook, all from bamboo, using only his handy knife: in fact, he produced a whole kitchen just with a single trunk of bamboo; then cooking rice with a section of the bamboo stem, and pretending to eat in between. Finally, he showed us how to make fire with only dried leaves, wood shavings, and friction from the bamboo.He flipped the bamboo, scratched off thin strips off its outer skin using his sharp machete, then clumped them together and started vigorously rotating a small piece of wood over it. Seconds later smoke emitted from his work and fire eventually flared all over the bamboo strips. Though I watched ethnic groups making fire earlier, Tata Kasoys zeal made it a memorable experience. Later, the diminutive Casanova took pictures with all ladies, striking romantic poses, much to everyones amusement.On our way back, we went to the Ocean Adventure  a marine conservatory and adventure park located in Subic Bay. Watching the sea lions fly through the air, glide around the stage, and perform some rare feats provided a lot of mirth to families visiting with kids: at the same time teaching them how to protect marine and wildlife resources.At the end of the day, I realised how fulfilling was my experience. Seeing rain forests is different from watching from close quarters, how these indigenous guardians hold the jungles close to their heart, taking only for their needs and protecting them from the civilised mans greed.(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

In Punjab, farming is quite diversified. Mixed farming incorporates field crops, fruits, vegetables and livestock.With an objective to providing integrated solutions to problems faced by the farm sector, agricultural universities were set up in every state on land grant pattern of US universities. Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) was the second such university after the one at Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, which was inaugurated by then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962. PAU played a leading role in ushering in the Green Revolution, especially in Punjab, and contributed in making the nation food self-sufficient.The university carved its place among the countrys leading institutions and has been recognised at the international level for its research output, quality of education and contribution in the development of the farm sector. In recent years, it has developed less-seeded kinnow, improved Bt cotton variety, high-yielding short-duration varieties of rice and the first zincated variety of wheat.In 2006, PAU came under the political knife, and a veterinary and animal husbandry university (GADVASU) was carved out of it, maiming it by one-fourth. Ridiculously, even the fodder section was transferred to the new university on the plea that animals eat it. One wonders why then by the same argument wheat, rice, corn, vegetables and fruits production should have not been transferred to the medical university because humans eat these products! However, the financial position of the government permitting, there could have been no objection to setting up a new university separately, which could compete, supplement and complement the research at PAU. Yet, to take away its departments, and divide assets, infrastructure and budget hit the very vitals of this academic institution, negating the integrated concept of growth and development of the farm sector.ANOTHER SURGICAL STRIKE?Now, once again, it seems some person(s) with access extraordinary to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh is/are planning another surgical strike on the PAU, mooting a proposal to carve a horticultural university out of this institution, which, if pursued, will render the PAU a non-entity. Research and education in horticulture crops will need most of the same department as for other field crops such as genetics, bio-chemistry, molecular biology, entomology, plant pathology, food technology, farm machinery, soil and water engineering, agricultural economics and marketing, agriculture business management, agricultural extension etc. How can these departments be divided without debilitating the agricultural institution beyond repair!Stretching the same logic, should there be an independent vegetable university, fruit university, cereal crops university and pulse crops varsity? Though PAU as a premier institute catering to agricultural research and education in the state has been ranked number two by the Union ministry of human resources and development, the university itself needs strengthening financially rather than weakening through bifurcation.BETTER, VIABLE OPTIONSFor impetus to horticulture in Punjab, there are better and viable options. The first is to strengthen the fruits and vegetables departments along with other related departments through additional funding and staff positions. A centre of excellence in horticulture crops can be created within the university, which would complement the research activities of the above departments by focussing on basic and strategic research in horticultural crops. No additional infrastructure will be required. For a fund- starved state this is a better option.Another option is to strengthen specialised horticultural research in production areas. There is a northern belt where kinnow and vegetables are grown and the second is the south-western belt where mainly kinnow is grown. In these regions, PAU has its research farms that can serve as specialised centres of research. These should be research centres focusing on seed and nursery production of fruits and vegetables. The state government may provide additional land and funds for this purpose to the PAU.Yet another and the most important viable option to strengthen horticulture research in the state is to expedite the setting up of the Postgraduate Institute of Horticultural Research and Education (PGIHRE) in Amritsar, which has been approved by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). The setting up of PGIHRE was announced by the Union finance minister in 2015. The institute is to be funded by the Centre and only land is to be provided by the state government.For research, land at Attari (Amritsar) and Abohar have been marked. This institute requires 10 acres near Amritsar for an administrative complex and residences. PGIHRE has the provision of more than 200 scientific positions for horticultural research and education. Funds earmarked for the institute by ICAR are held up due to delay in land acquisition for building the campus near Amritsar.This is the best option for the cash-strapped Punjab government. Under this option, long-term financial sustainability of the institute is also ensured.The state government must not commit the blunder of acceding to vested interests to carve out a horticulture university out of one of the top-ranking agricultural universities of the country and weaken agricultural and horticultural research in the state.It is hoped that the powers that be are listening.(The writer is the chancellor of Central University, Bathinda, and a noted farm economist.

5a03a11a9855b76bf13b89ac,"Farming took root in India only 10,000 years ago, study finds",http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/farming-took-root-in-india-only-10-000-years-ago-study-finds/story-znhMgOYjQOWWtgX49PkUsJ.html,2017-06-17,"Farming came to India 10,000 years ago, and it was only much later that grains such as rice, wheat and millet  considered diet staples today  were grown in most parts of the country.A wave of migration from Central Asia led to the spread of agriculture across the Indian sub-continent, a new study by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) suggests. The study says the migrants started farming in the Indus-Ganga region and their farming techniques spread as the group moved to the east and south of the country.A four-member TIFR team simulated the prehistoric movement of people in India and modelled the spread of crops to find early humans encountered wild varieties of two food grains, rice and millet, in the Indus-Ganga region.Pre-historic humans in India depended on hunting small game, scavenging or forest produce for food. Several groups migrating from Central Asia or Iran brought farming with them to India as they practised it around that time, said Mayank Vahia, lead investigator, TIFR. While these groups came with crops they knew of, they came across rice and millets in the Indus-Ganga region for the first time and started cultivating them too.Previous studies have shown early humans started migrating to India 60,000 to 40,000 years ago from Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan) via the Khyber Pass, from Iran through Bolan Pass or the coastal route. These migrants formed three distinct groups  Ancestral North India (ANI), Ancestral South India (ASI) and Autro-Asian Indians (AAI).The latest study now shows that farming took root in India much later.As populations became very large, researchers said hunting-gathering was not enough and moving around was not possible.And, therefore they found farming as a good alternative. The idea that farming could be done and would be useful came from elsewhere, but these specific plants were identified in India, said Vahia.The results of their simulation matched with past studies based on archaeobiological data  study of the biology of ancient times with archaeological materials  from the Indian sub-continent.Previous studies show Indian rice was initially grown in east India, in the Ganga  Brahmaputra valley. The region also recorded the first spread of the water buffalo and chickens. According to work by Dorian Fuller, a professor of archaeobotany at the University College Londons Institute of Archaeology, the western region largely survived on millet and wheat. These reached eastern India only around 4,500 year ago. Those who first occupied the Gangetic plains 9,000 years ago consumed fish.Studies have also found people inhabiting Orissa started growing tubers, millet, vigna (flowering plant) and pulses only 5,000 years ago. Much later  2,500 years ago  cattle and black buck became the staple diet in Gujarat.Rice, the staple food of the south, reached the region much later. Until then, people depended on cattle, sheep and goat for food.Archaeological and archaeo-botanical data from the subcontinent is patchy because these are based on field work. This simulation study gives smooth distribution of people across the country, over time-periods, and one can do many more experiments with history than what was allowed so far, said Vahia.In their paper published last month, the TIFR team used the same model to simulate prehistoric population dynamics which showed that early humans entered the Indian subcontinent through three entry points  along the coast about 65,000 years ago, from Iran via the Bolan Pass around 45,000 years ago, and along the Khyber Pass 40,000 to 30,000 years ago. Their results matched with genetic maps from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad.Around 30,000 years ago, internal pressures seem to have stimulated migration, and over the next 20,000 years or so, this resulted in encounters with other population groups. Upon introduction of farming, the populations were once again precipitated into isolated, localised groups capable of sustaining themselves through agriculture, states the paper co-authored by Uma Ladiwala, and Deepak Mathur."

They had stopped paddy procurement challenging the direction of Odisha Civil Supply Corporation to discontinue payment of handling charges of milled rice from mill to government godown at `4 per quintal. Farmers protested the step by the millers and staged road blockades throughout the district demanding beginning of procurement before monsoon hits the district.Collector Anjan Kumar Manik held a meeting with 60 custom millers and asked them to complete rabi paddy procurement failing which, custom millers of other districts would be roped in for the job. The custom millers agreed to the proposal and started procurement.District Civil Supply Officer Siba Prasad Dora said that procurement has started in full swing and 40,000 quintals of paddy was sold on the day and lifted by custom millers.About 60 custom millers are engaged for the rabi paddy procurement in the district. The Odisha Civil Supply Corporation, in its June 12 order, discontinued the handling charges paid to the custom millers for delivering the stock of rice at Rice Receiving Centre (RRC)-cum-Departmental Storage Centre (DSC) and stacking inside the godown citing that the handling charges amount to double payment.As a result, about 2 lakh quintals of rabi paddy are yet to be procured from the farmers. About 12.51 lakh quintals of rabi paddy were previously purchased."

But shoulder injuries prevented her from a repeat in London. As event ambassador for Sundays TCS World 10K Run, she spoke about her career, life after swimming and other aspects of sport. Excerpts:Which gold medal was special?All three were different. The 400m medley was on the first day of the Games and it was my first race at such a level. This was my dream since I was a young girl. I achieved my biggest dream in my first race. Before the second (200m medley), I had flu. I was not going to race but told myself I should try. When I won that race, it was empowering, gave more confidence. Next was 4x200m freestyle relay. I cant pick a favourite but the first one probably is the most momentous because it was the first one.Multiple Olympic gold winner Stephanie Rice inBengaluru/Pushkar VWhy did you decide to retire early?I had mentally decided around two-three months before the 2012 London Olympics that it will be my last. I had two shoulder surgeries, needed a third and didnt have time to fix it before the Olympics. I was training, and it got worse and worse.Did you think of a comeback?It never crossed my mind because so many Australian swimmers made comebacks and I just thought it was crazy. If I have been training since I was seven and fit as I can possibly be, what makes me think that having a year or two off and starting again would make me better than before.World record timings are getting betterI dont think it is going to stop because there are so many improvements in technology.The suits that you wear, how you train, nutrition, gym work and everything keeps improving and getting better. Its only natural that athletes will get better and better. Sometimes, you have someone like a Michael Phelps or Usain Bolt come along and no one will go faster than them for like 10 years.Are things getting too complicated with technology?It can get complicated. People who have never played will give you so much data. There has to be a balance between education and technology. My coach and I were more into hard work but were open to try new bits and pieces.What is the hardest part of being an Olympic athlete?It was going from being a normal person to being someone that everyone recognised overnight. No one can prepare you for that and no one can tell you what it is going to be like. It was just a very big change and a lot to get used to.How hard was it to come back to normal life?It was hard because I like the media, the events and competing. Nothing will ever feel the same, walking out to an Olympic Stadium with the screaming crowd and all the energy, thinking about all the preparation and the race I prepared four years for. Winning and achieving does not get replicated.What do you think of Bollywood?I would love to do a Bollywood movie. But I dont know Hindi. I tried for a couple of months, but all I can say is namaste. I am a huge fan of Bollywood."

And it was while collecting Bagheli folklore, this 72-year-old farmer cum Bagheli poet realized that saving folk songs and sayings wont mean much if the local crop varieties, which repeatedly crop up in the folk literature, are not saved and protected side by side.Meet Babulal Dahiya from Madhya Pradeshs Satna district, who has till now collected over 110 traditional varieties of rice. And he has been cultivating these 110 varieties on small-sized plots in his two-acre land to preserve and protect them.Dahiya, says these rice varieties have developed uniquely over thousands of years, surviving the stiff competition that could have made them extinct long ago, but in the process they have acquired great adaptive capacity according to the local environmental conditionsWords and seeds have a long history; when they are lost, all knowledge they coded is also lost. There are rice varieties that need less water, varieties that are disease resistance, varieties that are comparatively drought resistant. But for larger yield and more profit, we started sowing hybrid and dwarf rice varieties, which need more pesticides and fertilizers. Local rice varieties have longer stalks that help them hold moisture and need less water, says Dahiya, who has been encouraging farmers and school children in over two dozen surrounding villages to grow traditional crop and vegetable varieties.Emphasising that traditional crop varieties are getting lost owing to mono-cropping and focus on maximum yield crop varieties, Dahiya says it is high time to save whatever has been left. Such knowledge, such genetic heritage should not vanish. From 2005 onwards, I dedicated myself to collect local varieties of rice. Till now I have collected 110 varieties, which I grow on my two-acre land. The seeds I collect are kept in a seed bank which has been developed with the help of the MP State Biodiversity Board, he says.Babulal Dahiya (seen at the back) has been encouraging farmers and school children in over two dozen surrounding villages to grow traditional crop and vegetable varieties. (HT Photo)Dahiya, who retired as postmaster in 2007, has been passionate about documenting Bagheli folk literature-songs, proverbs, folktales, legends, myths and so on. He has authored five books on Bagheli oral folk literature for MP Adiwasi Lok Kala Academy and published two Bagheli poetic collections.When asked about his varied interests, he says, In the songs, sayings and folk tales, I found many mentions about traditional crop varieties. There is one Kargi rice variety which has small protective spikes. There is saying in our Bagheli Dhaan bove Kargi, suvar khaye na samdhi. (If you sow, Kargi rice variety, it is neither eaten by wild boars nor by the family of son-in-law). Suddenly it dawned on me that even if these songs are saved, these local crop varieties will vanish if not saved. And that was the turning point- songs and seeds have to be saved at the same time.Dahiya says said there are rice varieties like Bajranga that are sown by farmers to feel satiated for a long time as it takes time to get digested, while there are other rice varieties like Kamalshree that are sown for guests. Nevari variety is sown for selling as it provides good returns, he adds.R Sreenivasa Murthy, member secretary, MP State Biodiversity Board said Dahiyas work has been an inspiration to so many, including the state biodiversity board. For the first time, we started a state wide Beej yatra to collect seeds of indigenous seed varieties of crops, vegetables, medicinal plants from May 3 to June 27. Babulal Dahiya and five others are leading this initiative. So far they have collected over 1600 seed varieties from 24 districts he said.According to agriculture scientists, the ingenious varieties of crops are vanishing with every passing day. According to State Biodiversity Board date, in 1980s, there were 23,800 varieties of rice in MP and Chhattisgarh. But many of them have been lost now. In Seoni district alone, of 570 rice varieties that existed in 1980s, only 110 exist by 2000s. This means over 80% have vanished."

Addressing Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas Sammelan organised by Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) marking three years of Modi-led BJP Government at the Centre on Saturday, Chouhan called upon the gathering to throw out the BJD to help Odisha join the development unleashed by Modi.He said the Centre is providing `400 crore per month to Odisha Government to make `1-a-kg rice scheme possible. This apart, the NDA Government has allocated `3,672 crore in the last three years for strengthening rural roads under PMGSY. Moreover, the Modi-led Government has allocated `1,752 crore for providing 24-hour electricity to rural dwellers under Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Garm Jyoti Yojana, he said. Altogether, the Centre has allocated `1, 75, 260 crore between fiscal 2014-15 and 2017-18. However, the State Government is reluctant to implement the Central Government schemes in Odisha, he alleged.There is no dearth of funds for development of Odisha but the State is lagging far behind due to failure in delivery mechanism, he said and added that to tackle the failure of health system, the Centre has sanctioned five medical colleges for Odisha.Reminding of policy paralysis during the UPA regime, Chouhan said it is a thing of past and ever since Modi took over, one can see the PM has a clear vision. While there was corruption in every sphere during the UPA regime, there is no scope for scam under the leadership of Modi, Chouhan said. Although the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister did not touch upon the contentious issue of killing of farmers by the police in his State, he spoke about development in his State and said it can be also be true in Odisha provided the people of the State bring BJP to power.Later, talking to mediapersons, Chouhan lost his cool when asked repeatedly about killing of farmers. He said Swaminathan Commissions recommendations have been implemented in his State. He clarified that the farmers movement in his State was handiwork of anti-social elements and Madhya Pradesh is the only State where there are numerous schemes for welfare of agriculture and farmers.To prevent any untoward incident, police took into preventive detention more than 200 political activists of BJD, Congress and AAP, including BJD Bargarh Municipality Chairman Prashanta Behera, former Congress MLAs Nihar Mahanand and Sadhu Charan Nepak. Earlier, the political parties had decided to oppose the visit of Chouhan to Bargarh over Mandsaur killings. Among others, State BJP president Basanta Panda, BJP MLAs Pradeep Purohit, Radha Rani Panda and Rabi Narayan Naik and State BJP vice-president Ashwini Sarangi addressed the sammelan.Shivraj unaware of ground realities, says POKSSSambalpur: Paschin Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti (POKSSS) spokesperson Saroj has charged Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan with misleading farmers and people on implementation of Swaminathan Commissions recommendations in his State.He said not much can be expected from a State Government led by a Chief Minister who is not aware of the ground realities of his State. Daring Chouhan to implement Swaminathan Commissions report in Madhya Pradesh, Saroj said had he done it, the farmers would not have agitated. He said as usual, the BJP Government in Madhya Pradesh is trying to fool people and distancing itself from key issues. MSP of agricultural produce recommended by the commission is a Central issue and I fail to understand how Madhya Pradesh Government can alone implement it, the farmer leader said."

Thats the amount of ration rice seized from areas lying cheek by jowl with Pollachi and Coimbatore over the past month. A clear indication of smuggling picking up intensity after a brief lull. That nefarious elements delve into the free ration for BPL cardholders in Tamil Nadu makes the act all the more unscrupulous.The Kozhinjampara Police, along with the Civil Supplies Department, made the seizure.On June 12, we seized at least 20 tonnes of ration rice stored in two shops at the Walayar dam site, Palakkad District Supplies Officer V K Shashidharan told Express.The rice supplied by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in recent times is of a very good quality. It is collected by agents at a very low price from the rural folk in villages and transported in trains and other modes. It is stored in shops or godowns on the border and then sold in bulk to rice merchants or mills in Kerala.The shop owners, he said, were abusive this time and threatened to slip into violence.We had to call in the Walayar Police for protection to transport the 20 tonnes into the godowns of the Civil Supplies Corporation. In February, too, we had seized around 30 tonnes from three shops at Walayar and cases were registered against them. We brought the seized ration rice in six tempos to Palakkad town, Shashidharan said.Chittur Taluk Supplies Officer R Manoj pointed to three other major hauls, amounting to 5,330 kg. While 1,240 kg was seized on May 30 from the shed of a certain Rajan of Kozhinjampara by the police, another 1,930 kg was seized from the house of another person, Raja, on the Velanthavalam-Ozhalapathy road. On June 11, 2,160 kg was seized from a Tata Sumo during a vehicle inspection by the police. The consignments have been handed over to us and we have registered cases, he said.The ration rice is transported in small vehicles, including bullock carts from across the border and stored in houses in the state, said Kozhinjampara SI Saji Kumar. There are also godowns in the area to store smuggled rice. It is later polished and marketed at a fancy price under various brands to consumers in Kerala. In the past two months, we have seized at least 10 tonnes from vehicles.The big question being raised is whether the rice was being sold by wholesalers in TN to unscrupulous traders or the beneficiaries themselves were indulging in these activities.In either case, it is the common people of both states who are being cheated. While the target groups were being denied free food in TN, people in the consumer state of Kerala will be paying through their nose for ration rice in the garb of a branded product."

The increases for these two grains were also the greatest since 2012/13."

Every body reacts differently to different food. If you observe discomfort with particularly these two foods, it is wise to avoid or have it in a very small quantity and gradually develop tolerance to it.I am lactose intolerant and I substitute it with products such as soy milk.

And it has forced 7.8 million people across the whole of Ethiopia to rely on emergency food handouts to stay alive.But by next month, that food will have run out, aid agencies say.Droughts are common in Ethiopia, and in past years the government and international community have mounted impressive efforts to curb starvation.This year though, Africa's second most-populous country is struggling to find the money for food aid, say aid agencies.""We're looking at the food pipeline actually breaking, so the food is running out in about a month's time,"" said John Graham, country director for Save the Children. ""After that, we don't know what's going to happen.""Distracted donorsOnce a global byword for starvation and poverty after a famine in 1984-85 killed hundreds of thousands, Ethiopia has seen its economy grow rapidly in the last decade. Health indicators such as infant mortality and malaria deaths have also improved.A stronger economy allowed Ethiopia to spend an impressive $766 million (683 million euros) fighting one of its worst droughts in decades in 2015-16.This year however, things are different.Economic growth has slowed, due in part to protests spurred by long-simmering grievances against Ethiopia's one-party state.Donors have also been distracted by other regional crises.To the southeast, Somalia is suffering from severe drought, with warnings it could tip into famine.Ethiopias western neighbour, South Sudan, has suffered four months of famine, and extreme hunger is at its highest levels ever after more than three years of civil war.Ethiopia by contrast has a strong central government and is relatively free from conflict.But with the situation so desperate in the region, donors aren't responding to the country's emergency as they have in the past, said Mitiku Kassa, head of Ethiopia's National Disaster Risk Management Commission, Mitiku Kassa.""They are stressed with the needs, especially from those countries which (have) declared famine,"" Mitiku said. ""That is why it is underfunded.""Skipping meals is commonEven though Ethiopia has contributed $117 million of its own money this year and the international community $302 million, a funding gap of $481 million remains, according to the United Nations.In the drought ravaged town of Warder, the hundreds of displaced families crowding a ramshackle camp say handouts of rice and sugar are becoming less frequent.""Skipping meals is common,"" said Halimo Halim, a grandmother living with her children in a shelter made of sticks and pieces of plastic. ""Skipping is the order of the day.""Families of nomadic herders such as Halimo's are central to the economy of Ethiopia's southeastern Somali region.The drought has deprived goats, sheep and donkeys of water, killing them or making them so weak that by the time the rains come they perish in the cold.Around 465,000 people who have lost their livestock have migrated to an estimated 250 camps in the region.The settlements are often located near water sources, but that presents its own problems.In Warder, workers are present around the clock at nearby wells to make sure people drawing water chlorinate it before they drink it, lest they contract ""acute watery diarrhoea"", which has broken out in the region.Some aid workers say this is actually cholera, which Ethiopia has long been accused of covering up to protect its image.Paying the billAid agencies have turned to so-called ""non-traditional"" donors like the Gulf countries for funding.At the same time they are keeping a nervous eye on budget negotiations in top funder the United States, where President Donald Trump has proposed slashing the aid budget.But some humanitarians privately complain that the Ethiopian government isn't doing enough to call attention to its plight.They argue that Addis Ababa does not want to distract from its development gains or resurrect the old image of Ethiopia as a place of mass starvation.""There is no shortage of funds to combat drought,"" communications minister Negeri Lencho insisted earlier this month.If the international community doesn't send more money, Mitiku said the government would be ""forced"" to tap its development budget for drought relief in July.But with a lead time of about four months required to procure emergency food, the UN says that may be too late.In Warder, those uprooted by drought, like Sanara Ahmed, are wondering how long they can survive on unreliable food handouts.""Some support was there, but it cannot substitute for our dependability on our livelihood,"" Sanara said."

They also received orders from about 50 volunteers across the city and fed more than 100 strays.Balaji Ramesh, founder-CEO of TailsLife, says, We recently launched a platform Furresh where we provide fresh food. It is like FreshMenu. It is nothing like packaged foods. We provide 500g of chicken or mutton and brown rice per pack. Each pack costs `150. These can be subscribed on a monthly basis as well. These can be ordered on the website or app. The volunteer can also order a trial pack and choose for subscription if the dog likes the food.They should just specify the number of packs they need and the TailsLife team will deliver it to the venue. He adds, If it is remote location which is difficult to reach, we ask them to meet at some common point and deliver the packs. Otherwise, we ensure that the packs are delivered to the given address.In order to sustain the initiative and take it to other cities, TailsLife has planned to carry out the initiative on a quarterly basis for now. The motto is to do something for the strays across the city who do not get proper food or nutrition, says Balaji. The company will be focussing on one centre at a time. We will be notifying our followers on the Facebook page and app. We will be inviting them to volunteer for this initiative, says Balaji. Presently, they have about 300 users.TailsLife started about two years ago to provide information about all services and products for pets owners. The app is available on both Android and Iphones.The next campaign will be held in August or September this year."

(Source: Indian Express) The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and affects children. (Source: Indian Express)The first case of Japanese Encephalitis in the city this year, detected in a ten-month-old baby, has put the health department on high alert. This is the second such case in the state. The infant, who hails from Kondhwa, is in a stable condition and has been admitted to a private hospital in the area, said Dr Kalpana Baliwant, in-charge of the Insect Control Cell at the Pune Municipal Corporation.The National Institute of Virology (NIV) has confirmed that the serum sample has tested positive for Japanese Encephalitis, a flavivirus related to dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes and primarily affects children.However, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer, said, These are sporadic cases and our surveillance network has been able to pick up the cases. The first one was from Raigad district and the second case this year is from Pune.The virus that causes JE is transmitted by the culex species of mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields as well as in water-logged areas of urban regions. The disease has assumed epidemic proportions in pockets of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam and West Bengal, with sporadic cases reported from Maharashtra.According to Awate, the problem-prone areas in Maharashtra are Amravati, Wardha, Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Chandrapur, Nagpur, Bhandara and Gondia. Last year, 12 cases of JE, and one death due to the disease, were reported from the state; two of the cases were from Pune.As many as 100 houses around the society at Kondhwa have been surveyed for the culex mosquito, said Baliwant. We conducted the container surveillance for the last four days and have not been able to find the mosquito. The parents had taken the baby to Mumbai 10 days ago, and its likely that the infection was picked up from there, she said.Awate said field officers from the state entomology section had carried out their own survey. We are waiting for the report but in all probability, it is a sporadic case. Most JE virus infections are mild or without apparent symptoms. However, one in 250 infections result in severe clinical illness, according to the World Health Organisation. JE is a serious virus infection resulting in the inflammation of the brain. The disease is characterised by the onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, coma, seizures and spastic paralysis, he said.This year, 111 JE virus cases and 20 deaths have been reported from across the country. A majority of the cases are from UP, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu. Last year, there were 1,676 cases and 283 deaths in the country, according to the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme.Meanwhile, PMC officials have urged local residents to take preventive measures and ensure there are no mosquito breeding sites nearby. While carrying out the container survey PMC officials found the dengue causing Aedes Aegypti mosquito breeding site at a swimming pool in the same society. We have slapped a fine against them, said Baliwant.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The Balchao was tangy and strong in flavour, and the pao cut through that intensity perfectly. While the Fish Cutlets were delicious, the Mixed Veg Chops can be given a miss. The Rawa Fried Babycorn was disappointing, as the pieces were limp and lacked that crispiness one expects to find in rawa fried anything. We were also served an extremely refreshing beverage of tender coconut water infused with honey.The main course dishes are a meat lover's dream. The Goan fish curry paired with Goan red rice was our favourite  rich, creamy, coconut-y and the fish was very fresh.We also loved the Beef Asado (strips of beef cooked to perfection, with strong pepper, onion, garlic and soya flavours) and Chicken Vindaloo (tangy, sweet and spicy chicken curry with a heavy dose of vinegar), as both were strong in flavour and instantly took us back to those little Goan restaurants by the sea.For dessert, we were served Bebinca and Houle, prepared with jaggery, coconut and jackfruit leaves.While the Bebinca was warm and comforting, the Houle perhaps is an acquired taste, as the texture of the outer coating is rubbery and sticky.

They are starchy and since, rice is a staple food in South India, people are enjoying Risotto and Paella. The restaurant serves them in combination with seafood and mixed meat as well. For starters, there is a platter with pita bread, hummus, assorted vegetables and tabbouleh made with broken wheat mixed with finely chopped parsley and assorted celery. It is served in a thali, an Indian accent to the festival. The tabbouleh tastes grainy with a tinge of bitterness from the parsley. The toasted pita bread has a crunch.If you prefer something mushy and creamy, go for Risotto. Risotto Alla Promaveera is a vegetable risotto with seasonal veggies including carrots, broccoli and bell peppers, and cheese. This rice dish is creamy and served with garlic bread. Prepared with South Italys most famous rice arborio and cooked with proper rice-water proportion, the chicken risotto is starchy. Topped with fibrous chicken cubes, the rice has longer grains than its vegetarian counterpart.Paella is a mix of ingredients such as saffron, green beans, pepper and tomatoes with seafood or chicken for the non-vegetarians. The warm vegetarian paella tastes more like Indian biryani as it is masaledaar, but it isnt too spicy. It was a bit dry in consistency. The seafood paella looks appealing, bright and colourful. It has the right consistency, like Indian khichdi, topped with shrimps and salmon, and has a flavour of saffron.For desserts, try baklava served with mango paste and mango yoghurt on a graphite stone.

While the world is slowly realising the benefits of Navara rice, it is still confined to certain pockets in the state where individual farmers cultivate it for medicinal purposes. Much more needs to be done to cultivate it on a commercial basis.Navara farmers say it was high time the government intervened to promote this unique variety. At the moment, government supervision is limited to research. Research is underway on five Navara varieties at the Rice Research Station in Mankombu, S Leena Kumari, registrar of Kerala Agricultural University, Mannuthy, and former head of the station, told Express. The aim is to genetically improve the capacity of the seeds without compromising its medicinal content, she said.Cultivators like Narayanan Unni of Chittur in Palakkad feel Navara cultivation should be widely encouraged. Navara has anti-cancerous and anti-diabetic properties. Knowing the medicinal value of karkidaka kanji (a medicinal gruel made of Navara and a host of other ingredients), many countries like China are now doing research to market it as a health drink, said the farmer growing organic Navara in 12 acres for the past 14 years.We have done pure line selection and identification of some of the varieties. However, it cannot be commercially grown unless there is a tie-up with ayurvedic pharma companies acknowledging its nutraceutical value, said Leena.She said like all other varieties of rice, Navara cultivation too faces roadblocks. Although the government declared 2016-17 as the year of paddy, we faced a lot of hardships, said Unni.Navara can only be cultivated if government outfits like Oushadi agree to purchase it for the navara kizhi (cloth pouch containing medicated Navara porridge) for ayurvedic treatment. Moreover, the Tourism Department can also promote Navara-based food products. Only then will it attract more cultivators, said Unni."

In its first year, it could resume paddy cultivation in over 15,200 acres of fallow land. It has also initiated dry land rice farming in 3,000 acres.This year, the government aims to double rice cultivation in fallow land. It has plans to gradually resume farming in all 90,000 acres of uncultivated land before the completion of its tenure. Minister for Agriculture V S Sunil Kumar said gram panchayats and district panchayats would also be roped in to implement a special scheme to revive paddy farming.By reviving paddy cultivation, the government plans to conserve water and make the land environment friendly to sustain life, the minister said. The state looks at increasing paddy production from 6 lakh tonnes to 10 to 12 lakh tonnes in the next four years. He also said dues to paddy farmers to the tune of `92 crore were cleared last year."

Uttarakhand has witnessed all time shrinkage of budget this year with massive lowering of departmental allocations, he added.The PCC chief said ever since the BJP government took over, governance in Uttarakhand is at Gods mercy with zero developmental work taking place on the ground. State never witnessed suicide by the farmers, but in three months of BJP government, two farmers have committed suicide. On one hand, food prices have gone all-time high, on the other hand, government has stopped the subsidized food for downtrodden section of the society, he added.They had promised to waive off the bank loans of farmers within 15 days of coming to the power, but have done nothing on that. On the other hand, BJP leaders have began extracting Rangadari Tax from rice millers in Khatima immediately after Tarivendra Singh Rawat took over the charge. The matter was raised by the Congress in the assembly, but government ignored it, he further added.He said Chardham pilgrimage, regarded as the pillar of tourism sector in the state, has been left to its fate, as the state government has shown no concern for the same. This is the basic difference between the Congress and BJP rule.While Harish Rawat government has the credit of brining Chadham pilgrimage back on track after the 2013 rain disaster, BJP government is least bothered to provide them even basic facilities as the pilgrims were seen craving for transportation at Haridwar and Rishikesh and medical services resulting in the death of 30 tourists so far, he said.Singh claimed that BJP ministers in Uttarakhand are busy settling scores with each other instead of working for the development of the state."

It may appear like the roll call in a girls school. In fact, they are paddy varieties developed through cross breeding at the Kerala Agricultural Universitys Rice Research Station (RRS) at Mankombu. The bountiful future of several varieties of paddy is secure in this research facility.As many as 180 rare varieties of paddy from across the state are preserved here. It has also developed 22 high yielding versions from ancient varieties through decades-long research. According to RRS professor Reena Mathew, the station has been coming out with disease-resistant strains suitable for the ecology of Kuttanad and deep water farming.The scientists of the centre have separated the characteristics of the old varieties and developed new ones through cross pollination, she said. Chitteni, Thavalakannan, Chettivirippu and many more varieties have been protected in the centre for future generations and study. The genetic mapping of paddy started around two decades ago. Researchers identified the genes of the old varieties and developed it through cross pollination. Commonly used by farmers of Kuttanad, Uma is one such type. It is high yielding, Reena said.Kalladachembavu, Chettivirippu and Kunjathikkira are three traditional varieties of Kuttanad developed without changing the pattern. Bhadra, Asha, Pavizham, Karthika, Aruna, Makom, Remya, Kanakam, Rajani, Pavithra, Panchami, Remanika, Uma, Revathy, Karishma, Krishnanjana and Shreyas are the seeds developed through cross breeding.

Through the Ponnaryan Koyyunna Ponnani scheme, the seeds have been sown for the revival of rice cultivation here.Last year, farmers turned 45 acres of barren land into paddy fields in their first attempt. The enthusiasm soon gave way to disappointment with drought bringing down the yield. This year, though, no rain or drought appear to be able enough to draw them back.We are looking to expand it to another 45 acres this year, says Rajeesh U of the farmers collective here.While the production stood at 1,200 kg per acre last year, farmers believe the yield could be increased to 1,500-2,000 with better care. Under the aegis of the Padasekhara Samithi, 45 farmers were part of the sceme last year. Ten more have been added this year. These 55 include ten young professionals who have either given up their jobs or found time for farming.For them, cultivation is not just an affair for profit. Rather it is a mission to revive the indigenous varieties and ensure healthy food for local residents. Ranging from Thavalakkannan to Kokkan, 13 local varieties on the brink of extinction due to the intrusion of new brands are cultivated here. Besides, fully organic farming methods are followed.None here dares to ask whether we can use chemical fertilisers or pesticides. We only use organic manure like cow dung and oil cakes, Rajeesh says.Most farmers have their own cattle, helping them get manure. The farmers community has opened an eco-shop for direct marketing and to ensure maximum profit for the farmer.Last year, rice was collected from only some farmers and was sold to local residents. With the opening of the eco-shop, Padasekhara Samithi is looking to procure rice from all farmers and market it under the brand name Ponnani Ponnari. The plan is to sell one kg rice for Rs 70. Farmers will be given `63 while Rs 7 will be spent for transportation and packing charges.Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan and Ponnani Municipality deserve special mention for their constant backing to the farmers. The municipality is providing a subsidy of `6,500 for each acre while seed is distributed for free. Besides, it allocated Rs 2.5 lakh towards purchasing two tillers.Farmers should be treated as a privileged community, says municipal chairman C P Mohamed Kunhi. We are obliged to extend any kind of help.The civic body has earmarked `6 lakh for the project in the 2017-2018 budget while the previous years allocation stood at Rs 5 lakh. Farmers here says Sreeramakrishnan, who represents Ponnani, is keen to know the developments and visits the fields. He has offered us all support, Rajeesh says.""The scheme was envisioned to reduce barren land and help people get toxin-free food. The scheme will be spread to more areas. We are looking to encourage organic farming. The government will extend all possible help to the farmers,"" said Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan"

Organically grown. Famed for its peculiar taste and high protein content. Cultivated in the sprawling waterlogged, and acidic, coastal regions of central Kerala. It has the potential to revolutionise paddy farming in the state's saline rice production system.The organic mode of cultivation of Pokkali is best suited for the climatic conditions of the coastal regions as it catalyses the region's rich biodiversity to generate paddy and shrimp alternatively.However, Pokkali farming is yet to make giant strides in the saline rice production system where a single crop of the Pokkali rice is cultivated in the low-saline phase of the production cycle that starts with the arrival of monsoon and ends with the monsoon. Prawn farming follows, during the high-saline phase.Statistics available with the Agriculture Department has always shown a marginal increase in Pokkali farming in the state, mainly in three districts - Ernakulam, Alappuzha and Thrissur - and in some parts of Kannur. But the ground reality is quite different as the profit-minded hoodwink the authorities by sowing seeds and then desert farming to claim government incentives offered for promoting Pokkali farming.Later, they make available the field to shrimp farming as it is more beneficial, say experts.Statistics show around 4,055 hectares of Pokkali fields are available for farming in Ernakulam alone. However, the area under cultivation is less than 500 hectares in the district which accounts for the largest area under Pokkali cultivation. District Collector K Mohammed Y Safirulla said the area under cultivation will be increased to 1,000 hectares this year, and 2,000 hectares next year.Ernakulam Principal Agricultural Officer Sreedevi said the department has submitted a Rs 29 crore infrastructure development proposal to the Pokkali Land Development Agency to make farming more convenient.K S Shylaraj, Head, Rice Research Station, Vyttila, said Pokkali cultivation declined to less than 6,000 hectares from around 26,500 hectares over the past two decades."

The bonam was presented to the goddess and after that, it was eaten as prasdam by the household members.Ujjani Mahankali temple in Secunderabad, Simhavahini Mahankali temple in Lal Darwaza, and Yellamma temple in Balkampet will be few of the major temples that will wear a festive look during the month long celebrations.The festival typically falls in the Telugu month of Ashada masam. At every temple, the celebrations are marked by poojas performed for the deity Shakti popularly called in Telangana as Yellamma or Pochamma. The word Bonam actually comes from the Telugu word, Bhojanalu, which means a meal or feast.The history of Bonalu goes back to 1813 when a plague claimed several lives in Hyderabad. It was believed that the plague was an outcome of the anger of Goddess Mahakali. So, to calm her down, Bonalu was offered to her and the tradition has been followed since then."
5a03d75b9855b76bf13ba7c3,Niti Aayog vindicates UPA’s claims on poverty alleviation,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/niti-aayog-report-upa-govt-poverty-alleviation-congress-4723525/,2017-06-26,"The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has called on different countries to begin efforts to achieve the 17 defined goals over the next 15-year period The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has called on different countries to begin efforts to achieve the 17 defined goals over the next 15-year periodVindicating the UPA governments stand on pulling people out of poverty, Indias Voluntary National Review Report on the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals to the United Nations has said that sustained growth of 8.3 per cent from 2004-05 to 2011-12, and 6.2 per cent during 1993-94 to 2003-04 created gainful employment and helped raise wages thereby directly empowering the poor. The Niti Aayog led the preparation of the report, as part of its role to co-ordinate for the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. The review report was submitted to the UN last week, and will be discussed at a meeting of multilateral agencys High Level Political Forum in July.The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has called on different countries to begin efforts to achieve the 17 defined goals over the next 15-year period. It has also brought the government an increased volume of revenues enabling it to sustain a high level of social spending and, thus, doubling the direct effect of growth on poverty, the report said, adding that implementation of several large-scale anti-poverty programmes such as the MGNREGA has helped the weaker sections of the society. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), for instance, has generated over 2 billion person-days of employment during 2016-17 alone, largely for the disadvantaged sections of society, the report added, highlighting that women and disadvantaged groups have been the largest beneficiaries of the rural job guarantee scheme, accounting for 56 per cent and 39 per cent of person-days of work generated during the last year, respectively.Data released in 2013 by the erstwhile Planning Commission, which was replaced by the Niti Aayog, had shown that from 2004-05 onwards, almost 2 crore people were pulled out of poverty every year from 2004-05 onwards, resulting in a decline in number of people below the Tendulkar poverty line to 270 million in 2011-12 from 407 million in 2004-05. There is compelling evidence that the rapid growth India has achieved following the economic reforms initiated in 1991 has led to significant reduction in poverty. Poverty has fallen across all economic, social and religious groups nationally and in all states in the post-reform era, the Niti Aayog noted in the report. It has highlighted these points in its first Sustainable Development Goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.Furthermore, the voluntary review report also highlights the importance of food security in dealing with the ill-effects of poverty. A direct consequence of poverty is food insecurity. To address this problem, the National Food Security Act provides a basic quantity of food grains to nearly 75 per cent of the population in rural areas and 50 per cent of the population in urban areas at affordable prices under the Targeted Public Distribution System, it said. The PDS programme provides 5 kg wheat or rice per person per month at subsidised rates.Going forward, the report has said that efforts are required to make access to basic services universal, with drinking water and sanitation being priority areas apart from programmes that are already underway including housing for all, increasing access to education, health and nutritional security, with a special focus on vulnerable groups such as women and children.In the opening statement of the report, Niti Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya has noted that while India remains committed to protecting the environment, the success of the Paris Agreement required other signatories to make good on their commitment as well. These  include the provision of financial resources to the tune of $100 billion per year for the developing countries, he wrote. Recently, the US pulled out of the Paris accord, which aims at reducing global carbon emissions.Even as it combats poverty, India remains committed to protecting the environment. Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, India has ambitiously committed to reducing the emissions intensity per unit of GDP by 33-35 per cent by 2030 relative to its 2005 levels. Furthermore, it plans to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional tree cover, Panagariya noted.Additionally, the review report elaborated on how expansion of transportation forms such as waterways, rural road connectivity, would result in reduction of logistics-related costs and have a positive environmental impact. A total length of 8,000 km of pavements and cycle tracks will also be laid in 106 cities over the course of the next five years to promote non-motorised transport and reduce the carbon footprint, it said.It said that the Centre has set an investment target of Rs 25 lakh crore, or $390 billion, for infrastructure development over a period of three years 2016-2019. The government is also making efforts to mobilise additional resources, it pointed out. For instance, the monetisation of 75 publicly funded highway projects of value Rs 356 billion ($5.6 billion) via the toll-operate-transfer mode will finance the construction of 2,700 km of roads. Moreover, the Indian Railways is setting up a Rs 350 billion ($ 5.5 billion) Railways of India Development Fund to serve as an institutional mechanism for raising funds from the market, the report noted.Furthermore, the review report said that there was scope for boosting domestic resources by expanding the tax base and strengthening the tax administration system, considering that the tax to GDP ratio in India was significantly lower than the average for BRICS countries. The Indian government has committed to the implementation of an ambitious tax reform agenda, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST) as well as direct tax reforms to increase domestic resource mobilisation, while committing to keeping public debt at sustainable levels in the medium term, it said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP) K Srikanth loves his aggressive, attacking smashing, but has always admired MS Dhonis temperament. (Source: AP)Kidambi Srikanth has resurfaced on Indian badmintons horizon since the surprise of a win over Lin Dan in the China Open final in November 2014. The 24-year-old would win at home in 2015, and dazzle briefly at the Rio Olympics before disappearing like a shooting star, making his fans wish that he would get a little more consistent. His return might yet be more glorious than his first sighting.Here are the 10 things that most dont know about the newly minted double Super Series champion.Ran In Training After 18Its hard enough for most at the Gopichand Academy, as trainees are put through rigorous routines of lapping different distances of the synthetic track in specific times, but it was doubly challenging for Srikanth. Its because he wasnt used to running in training till 18 in his childhood. He started very late, informs physio C. Kiran. In the high-intensity workouts, Srikanth could hit a heart rate of 180-200 and finish almost breathless. Gym reps were easy in comparison. Running those 2 to 10 km  time trials after a taxing gym workout are the hardest for Indias top shuttler. Before Olympics, he puked and almost fainted in those sessions, recalls coach Gopichand, waving away all complaints. Running was hard work for me too in my playing days, but its gotta be done Ask the coach if running laps has gone out of fashion replaced by game-specific workouts and he answers, No. If you want to win, you still run.South Indian FareSrikanth was driven enough for success to teach himself to wean himself away from anything sweet. In general he just lost the craving for sweets. If its in a very minuscule quantity and just to taste, he is allowed. But he disciplined himself pretty early on, Kiran says. Never a big fan of fast-food  pizzas or burgers  Srikanth was encouraged to stick to food he had grown up eating. Rice is good. When he travels, south-east Asian food is his preferred choice, Kiran adds. At home, its whatever his mum makes.Dhoni InspiredIts one autograph he really wants. I think MSD will give it now, laughs brother K Nandagopal, explaining the teenaged inspiration. K Srikanth loves his aggressive, attacking smashing, but has always admired the former India cricket skippers temperament. I dont know if Im as cool as him, but I want to be. I love the way he believes in himself and backs himself in the big, important moments, Srikanth says. Its the restrained, no-antics aggression why hes a Roger Federer fan too. Its about how Dhoni conducted himself in tough situations, the brother adds. Srikanth always wants to respond the same way that Dhoni did when the situation was not in his hands. He has a cool, dignified way, Srikanth thinks.Inside Box TreatmentPV Sindhu had suffered a freak foot injury before the Olympics and had spent her time recovering, by sitting inside a marked box and hitting shuttles, working on every other part of the upper body. That experience helped us when Srikanth suffered his right ankle stress fracture, Gopichand says. The credit for his injury recovery goes to the physio Kiran who didnt let him go home when he got injured. Like Sindhu, we made him sit inside the box and play. He used his injury period to get physically stronger in fact, he adds. But the support staff didnt back off from high intensity training, while the ankle healed. What takes 6-8 weeks to come out from, in his case took 3 months, Kiran says.No Clutter ThinkingClosely linked to the injury rehab was Srikanths absolute faith in his coaching staff. Gopichand has long maintained that one reason for Srikanths success is he doesnt over-think even when hes down. He doesnt try to make too many decisions on his own off-court. When athletes get injured, theyll cross-check with many doctors or try for quick-fix, Kiran says. Srikanth trusted his team. Tournament routines too are designed to ensure this. Warm-ups, matches, recovery sessions and evening recovery is all planned so that hes kept busy and doesnt over-think  not about the last match and not too much about the next one, the physio informs. Aside of the nights sleep, theres only two hours in the day when hes not doing something. Oh, but thats when hes having lunch or dinner, Kiran wickedly informs.Patching Body TogetherSrikanth always played the aggressive game as a junior, but his body couldnt take the strain for more than 15 minutes. He survived lower levels on this cloud-burst of attack but found it tough at the Super Series level. A 3-year-plan was set into motion.We worked on strength and endurance and stabilised the body, but his movement became slower. Then the next year was movements and finally injury prevention, Kiran says. It was risky training initially, but for all the imbalance of the body position when playing strokes, it was what was needed. The strokes that he initially played using proximal areas  chest, back, thighs, the coaches slowly moved to the calf and forearm.The Big SmashWhile the overhead jump smash of K Srikanth is a work of art, most of it was a natural talent, the finishing though needed an injection of strength. Its not just the speed of the smash or the ferocity or proclivity, but the angles on the smashes. Theres straight, cross, a smash with 80 percent power and 100 percent. Though we cant tell from the action what hell hurl next, we can guess based on his mindframe, Kiran says.Facing Two ImpostersThe most common line brother Nandagopal has heard Srikanth say is, For everything, my time will come. The older sibling is thoroughly impressed with how the younger one deals with the equanimity that Srikanth shows dealing with failure and success. He says he cant bring time back. So best to prove to the world whatever hes trying to, in the next tournament, he says. Hell enjoy the moment, and not carry it forward. After the loss in Singapore, murmurs had begun that Srikanth would never match his heady results of 2014-15. He doesnt take any criticism personally. His mental clarity is brilliant, the brother adds.Patience & ConsistencyTheres a difference in the two, Nandagopal insists. Its not about consistency in results. The big lesson from Olympics was how small mistakes at 20-19 cost him so many matches. Against Chen Long on Sunday, he turned the tables. Hes learnt to not rush. And wait for opponent to make mistakes, he adds. Besides not giving Chen Long a chance to attack, Srikanth ensured accuracy of his smashes was clinical and its all those sprayed kills from the Olympics and the Singapore Open final that have cured his impatience. They have no option but to learn this lesson, Gopichand says. Sindhu shouldnt have rushed against Tai Tzu. You need to keep reminding them this. Theres a subtle difference between overdoing attack and getting it right.At 70 PercentHes operating at 70 percent of his capacity right now, the coach says. Theres a half dozen contenders at World Championships, but after Australia, Srikanth will be the marked man.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The seers initiative seems to have not gone down well with Pramod Muthalik, the firebrand leader of Sri Rama Sene, who has termed it as a stab in the back for Hindutva forces. Some fringe groups called it a betrayal.On Saturday, the swamiji greeted the Muslim fraternity and hosted the iftar event at the dining hall of Krishna temple and gave a brief benediction saying that God is one for all. There is need for binding Hindus and Muslims together. The people of both communities should lead a cordial life, he had said. The chief of Anjuman Mosque, Mohammed Sheesh, was present.Coming out strongly against the seers gesture, Muthalik said, We look forward to the same kind of love and reverence towards Hindu religious organisations from the Muslim fraternity. I would wait for the day when the Hindus can hold the Rama Navami festivities or Krishna Janmashtami in a mosque.Speaking to Express, the seer said, I dont see anything wrong in such initiatives. God created everybody equal. We may differ in the way we live, the way we pray. But every human being is Gods creation and we must respect His creation.The pontiff had arranged an elaborate menu that included ghee rice, beaten rice with curd, laddu, chakli, payasam and a platter of freshly cut fruits. The swamiji also distributed prasadam of Krishna temple to those present."

We had to depend on railway rakes from Punjab and Haryana to feed our own people,"" he said.In the next six years, Odisha achieved self-sufficiency in the production of paddy, the chief minister said and added that it is now third largest contributor to the public distribution system. Kalahandi is now the rice bowl of the state and the country, he said and added that production has now increased substantially as is evident from the Krishi Karman Award received four times by Odisha. ""This transformation was possible due to sustained efforts in certain key areas,"" he said.Stating that watershed programmes primarily impact the small and marginal farmers, the chief minister said soil conservation, integrated farming and water use efficiency are the needs of the time. He advised the soil conservation officers to play a proactive role keeping the interest of farmers in mind.Agriculture minister Damodar Rout, agriculture production commissioner GK Dhal and senior officers attended."

Some NGOs commented sex trafficking was temporarily reduced until other forms of payment were established, some NGOs reported a resultant increase in other methods of payment including online payments, the report said.Other NGOs stated workers in the informal economy, including brick kiln workers, were at times paid in void currency notes or were not paid at all due to cash shortages -- both situations subsequently increased the workers vulnerability to debt bondage and forced labour, it said.India, the report said, is a source, destination, and transit country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour and sex trafficking.Forced labour constitutes Indias largest trafficking problem; men, women, and children in debt bondage -- sometimes inherited from previous generations -- are forced to work in brick kilns, rice mills, agriculture, and embroidery factories, it said.Most of Indias trafficking problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata -- lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities, religious minorities, and women and girls from excluded groups -- are most vulnerable, the report said.Within India, some are subjected to forced labour in sectors such as construction, steel, and textile industries, wire manufacturing for underground cables, biscuit factories, pickling, floriculture, fish farms, and ship breaking, the report said.Thousands of unregulated work placement agencies reportedly lure adults and children under false promises of employment into sex trafficking or forced labour, including domestic servitude, it added."

Similar rumours often followed whenever Dossa, a chronic diabetic and hypertension patient, went for treatment to JJ hospital. Dossa is survived by two wives, three sons and two daughters.Born to a family of oil merchants in Agripada, Mustafa was the second among Ahmad Umars three sons. The Kutchi-Memon Dossa clan controls the wholesale trade at Crawford market. Like his elder sibling, Mohammad, and younger, Haroon, Mustafa, too, was a school dropout and joined his family business in the early 1970s. However, as soon as Mohammad joined hands with gold smuggler Haji Mohammad, in the late 1970s, Mustafa followed suit. It is said Mohammad introduced Tiger Memon, (also a key bomb blast accused), into the smuggling syndicate as a driver, to begin with.Soon after, Mohammad migrated to Dubai to join Dawood Ibrahim. Mustafa, too, fled to the UAE in 1988. Underworld observers said the Dossa familys fortunes changed after Mohammad and Mustafa flooded the black market with gold and electronic goods smuggled from Dubai.The family purchased a radio theatre near Crawford market and built the first electronic goods market in south Mumbai, Manish Market, in its place.In Dubai, too, the Dossa brothers built one of the biggest gold jewellery showrooms at Gold Souk, called Mignas, which is still the familys rice bowl, apart from the earnings from the rent paid by shops at Manish Market. In fact, the top floor of Manish Market was converted into a mosque following Ahmad Umars death, at the instance of Mustafa.Ahmad Umar was a follower of Sufism and the mosque is meant for Barelvi Muslims.Mustafa played a pivotal role in the conspiracy to avenge the 1992 Babri Masjid demolitions by actively aiding in the smuggling of arms and explosives used in the 1993 serial blasts.His run from the law came to an end in March 20, 2003, when he was deported to India and lodged at Arthur Road to face trial in the blasts case.Dossa was the richest inmate at Arthur Road jail in the past 14 years and he seldom missed an opportunity to flaunt his money.In jail, he lived lavishly by allegedly bribing staff with the money provided by his family. His penchant for designer clothes followed him to Arthur Road. He would exercise regularly and the dumbbells he used had been brought from Dubai following a court order.Fellow inmates recall tales of his durbars in jail and how he rewarded his loyalists with expensive gifts and gave a monthly ration to their families. Insiders also talk about his lavish Sheheri (breakfast) and Iftar for more than 300 prisoners during Ramzan for the past 14 years.One of his former fellow inmates at Arthur Road told HT Mustafas generosity was driven by his indomitable desire to maintain his sway over jailbirds. Once he got into a brawl with bomb blast accused Abu Salem and stabbed his face with a sharpened spoon, only because the latter refused to offer him salaam.Recalling his association with Dossa during the 14 long years of trial, special public prosecutor, Ujjwal Nikam said, He was calm and composed in the courtroom during his appearances. However, he indulged in groupism inside the jail.A fellow inmate described how he had brought the formers wrath by offering a Rs500 note to a member of a rival gang, who was in need of money. He [Mustafa] warned me not to mingle with rivals. Its not that he was against my association with that man, he was suspicious about whether I was trying to create my own group of loyalists, said the former detainee, highlighting Mustafas insecure nature."

(File photo) Indrani Mukerjea being taken into Byculla jail in 2015. (File photo)FROM all accounts  except that of the prison authorities  violence inside Mumbais Byculla jail for women, where an inmate was fatally assaulted, allegedly by jail staff, is not unusual. Former inmates and relatives of women currently in the jail, where over 200 inmates rioted for better facilities after murder convict Manjula Shetye was assaulted Saturday, have described life there as hell, filled with violence.The Byculla jail for women is actually a jail within a jail, where male police personnel and officers are also posted. One former inmate said, The jail authorities impose many restrictions on women as there is a male prison too. This makes it difficult for women inmates to easily access even the superintendent or the common staff doctor. One has to approach the junior-rung officials many times to even get out of the womens wing.Earlier, the Arthur Road jail had a separate womens barrack. After an increase in female prisoners, authorities in 2002 transferred them to Byculla, until then a male prison. Today, Byculla jail can house 365, including 165 women, but prison officials say that at any point there is severe overcrowding with at least 250 women lodged. Now, 291 have been booked for rioting.Beatings are very frequent in the jail, said a woman recently released on bail after two months in jail in a drug offence. The guards hit you in full view of other inmates to scare them, and it is always five or six guards who gang up to overpower the women. Six jail guards have booked for murdering Shetye, who had apparently asked for two eggs and five pieces of paav.Several women have said the six policewomen had created a climate of terror and that speaking out against injustice would result in severe consequences. The guards, one former inmate said, informally appoint three monitors in each barracks. The guards get all their work done through the monitors. The monitors decided what time we wake up and go to sleep, she said.Bhushan Kumar Upadhyay, additional director general of police, prisons, countered reports of the assault on Shetye saying prisoners are never hit in normal course. Jail guards only use force in case they are assaulted by prisoners. There are also CCTV cameras everywhere in the jail, he told The Indian Express.The woman recently released, on the other hand, alleged that guards assaulting prisoners take care to find blind corners that CCTV cameras dont cover.Shashikala Patankar, who was in the jail in 2015 for allegedly peddling 112 kg mephedrone, claims to have been witness to a brutal assault. It was for a very petty reason. Afterwards, they did not even take the woman to the hospital, she claimed.Before her release on bail, Patankar was among the jails high-profile inmates, which also lodged Jaya Chheda who is serving a life sentence for murdering her husband, matka king Suresh Bhagat. Currently, the jails maximum-security prisoner is media executive Indrani Mukerjea, arrested for the murder of her daughter Sheena Bora. Mukerjea, who has two guards deputed to watch her round the clock, is among those booked for rioting.In the days since the death, law enforcement officials have said the events of June 23-24 are rare for a womens prison. The National Crime Records Bureau listed deaths of five women in Maharashtras jails in 2015: four due to natural causes, one suicide.The revised Model Prison Manual, published by the Home Ministry in 2016, included amendments relating to women prisoners: sensitising and training jail staff in sexual violence, and restrictions on harsh punishment such as close confinement of pregnant women.NecessitiesFormer inmates spoke of neglect towards basic needs including hygiene and health. Every woman is given six sanitary napkins per month, and those who do not have family members sending money are unable to buy more from the canteen. So they end up helping others with their chores in exchange for napkins, a former inmate said. Another said lactating and pregnant women are supposed to be given groundnut and jaggery but each one gets less than prescribed.Women are given one bar of soap and washing soda. Water is a luxury. We get a limited supply each day. We fill two drums in each barrack for bathing, washing and drinking. There is a water purifier, usually accessed by only those prisoners who have money or clout, said an inmate.Even before this incident, violence has been very common. If you complain against anything to a visiting authority, staffers resort to violence after they are gone, she said.Retired Justice S R Bannurmath, chairman of the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission, knows he will find a spruced-up jail during his announced visits. Thats why I conduct surprise checks. Except my driver, no one knows where I go, he said. The commission has given the state prison department two weeks time to submit a preliminary inquiry report. Bannurmath, who oversaw a two-day workshop for superintendents of all the states jails in Pune on June 22-23, termed Shetyes death unfortunate. These things happen in spite of all that we do.Brewing unrestA relative of a woman currently in jail said unrest had been brewing for a long time. The rice and paav they give are full of worms. Women just mix some water with the rice and eat it, she said. The relative was herself lodged recently in Byculla jail, on a drug charge.Upadhyay, the additional DG, said overcrowding was a serious issue, and added the quality of food has improved in the past few years. The food may not be like home food, but it is of good quality. Our inquiry is under way into what led to rioting, he said.Some inmates said women are made to clean the guards living quarters in weekends and wash their clothes. Many would apply repeatedly for transfers to sub-jails in other cities. Byculla jail narak hai. (Byculla jail is hell) After being sent there on and off for six years, I never want do anything that will send me there, one former inmate said.While hearing a petition on the conditions of jails in Maharashtra, Bombay High Court had directed a prison reforms committee be set up. A government resolution was passed on June 1 for the formation of a five-member committee of retired judge Dr S Radhakrishnan, additional DG Upadhyay, Dr Vijay Raghavan of TISS, retired jail superintendent S N Chavan and a joint or deputy secretary (prisons). The committee is yet to meet. Its terms of references are wide including working on reforms in tune with UN conventions, the Model prison manual, 2016 to bring about changes in the existing prison system, Raghavan said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Hotel and restaurant owners have already warned people of the increase in prices under the GST regime coming into effect from July 1.Hoteliers and restaurant owners opine that the government is encouraging people to cook and eat at home rather than dining out. In a city like Bengaluru, where eating out is cheaper than cooking at home, GST could change this in future, said Veerendra N Kamat, treasurer, Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association (BBHA).He said the government is imposing 5% GST on sweets and 12% GST on idli, dosa and other food items. There is no balance in the taxation system, he said.There are many working couples who prefer to buy breakfast rather than cook at home. Also, every day, one can see many students and working professionals at darshinis, having a thali between Rs 30 and Rs 50 with pulao or rice bath. But now, with GST, this population will come down, said a restaurant owner.We will send a memorandum to the state and the Union governments urging them to reduce GST on AC restaurants from 18% to 12%. The last time we went on strike, the industry and customers suffered, let alone the government, which also incurred losses. We want the government to deliberate on the varied taxation on food items, Kamat said.The imposition of 18% GST on star hotels and AC restaurants is also worrying the industry. They are worried about the kind of customers entering star hotels and AC restaurants. Earlier, due to difference in rates, the kind of people visiting different types of restaurants was known. But what will happen now? We will have to wait and watch, said another association member.Book dealers also worriedThose dealing with books and stationery are also worried as the cost of these items will increase from July 1. Those dealing with second hand books are also concerned. They point out that getting books and selling them to other outlets will now become difficult. This has also left students worried as their reading material will cost more."

The consumers are thus getting items less than they are entitled to receive. The consumers have squarely blamed the PDS dealers for manipulating the supplies of essential commodities and selling them at a higher price in the open market.Several crores of rupees spent by the Government in subsidies for commodities supplied through fair price shops is going waste as only a small quantity reaches the actual beneficiaries.The errant ration shop owners in Dhinkia panchayat are supplying commodities to consumers less than they are entitled to get by manipulating weighing machines, locals alleged.After implementation of National Food Security Act (NFSA), the priority households are entitled to receive foodgrains at 5 kg per person per month at the issue prices of Rs 3, Rs 2 and Rs 1 per kg for rice, wheat and coarse grains respectively.Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households receive 35 kg of foodgrains per household per month at the same subsidised price. But the ration shop owners are supplying items less than the beneficiaries are entitled to get. Kerosene, which is sold at Rs 14.29 per litre through PDS, is being diverted and sold in the open market at `50-`60 per litre by such unscrupulous traders, they alleged.Nearly 2,000 beneficiaries get their rations through four dealers in Dhinkia panchayat. Last month, they had submitted a memorandum to the District Civil Supply Officer over the matter, but in vain. Similar cases of black marketing of PDS commodities have been reported from Nuagaon, Balitutha, Gadakujang and other panchayats of the block.The consumers have alleged that the PDS dealers are stealthily deducting 100 grams each of rice and wheat per kg and 50 ml of kerosene per litre. A racket is also active in diverting subsidised rice meant for ration card holders at Rs 1 per kg to supermarkets and malls and selling it as packaged rice priced at Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg.Dhinkia Panchayat Samiti member Debendra Swain said though villagers have sought the intervention of the BDO, and District Civil Supply Officer over the matter, no inquiry has been conducted so far against the errant ration shop owners.Block Development Officer Subodha Acharya said he has received allegation regarding supply of less quantity of PDS commodities in Dhinkia.

Agriculture Minister V S Sunil Kumar, who took the mantle to bring paddy farming back in the Methran Kayal polders, where paddy cultivation had given way for tourism development, launched the Methran Kayal rice at a function here.He handed over a rice packet, weighing 10 kg, to M K Karunakaran, the seniormost paddy farmer in Methran Kayal. For many, this was a realisation of their dreams and a decade-long struggle to retain paddy farming in this polder, sprawled over 403 acres. Paddy was cultivated in the Methran Kayal fields in November last year after a gap of eight years, following the stringent stand taken by the Agriculture Department, especially Sunil Kumar.After the harvest commenced in April this year, Supplyco procured a total of 356.30 tonnes of paddy from the farmers here and handed it over to the government-run Oil Palm India to introduce it in the market under the brand Methran Kayal rice. The Modern Mills of Oil Palm India was entrusted with the target. According to Oil Palm authorities, they could make around 200 tonnes of rice from the paddy they received. A 10 kg packet of Methran rice will be available from Oil Palm outlets for Rs 450 from Thursday.Paddy price will be given to farmers after procurement: MinSunilkumar said the state government has taken steps to hand over the price of paddy to farmers soon after its procurement. He was speaking after launching the Methran Kayal brand rice. He said the government will soon procure the entire paddy from farmers across the state through Supplyco. The price of paddy will be given to farmers through banks.The government has already signed a memorandum of understanding with some banks, including cooperative banks, in this regard. This initiative has been taken in the wake of the inordinate delay in the distribution of paddy price, he said. He added the government has given strict directives to the officers in the Agriculture Department to include all farmers in the crop insurance programme of the government.As many as 25 crops can be insured in the scheme to be launched on July 1, he said. Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan MLA presided over the function. K Suresh Kurup MLA, District Collector C A Latha, district panchayat president Zacharias Kuthiraveli and others also spoke."

A statue of the kid still remembered as Barry by childhood friends was erected outside the elementary school he once attended in Jakartas upscale, leafy neighbourhood of Menteng.This is the last opportunity for us to meet with Barry, our childhood friend who has made us so proud, said Widianto Cahyono, who sat next to Obama in the fourth grade and is hopeful the former president will visit his old neighborhood. We have long waited for a reunion with him.Obama also retains a soft spot for Indonesia, where he lived from age 6 to 10. He moved to Jakarta in 1967 after his mother split up with his father and remarried an Indonesian man. They had his half-sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng, who is traveling with the family. After her second marriage failed, Obamas mother, Ann Dunham, stayed on in Indonesia and Obama returned to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.During a 2010 presidential visit, he delighted onlookers by proclaiming in Bahasa Indonesia that bakso, a savory meatball soup, and nasi goreng, flavorful fried rice, are delicious. They are two of the countrys signature dishes.Prior to arriving in Jakarta, Obama, wife Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia visited the resort island of Bali where they stayed in the tranquil mountain enclave of Ubud, toured sweeping terraced rice paddies and rafted the Ayung river. They then traveled to the historic city of Yogyakarta, where Obamas mother did anthropology research, and visited Borobudur, a ninth century Buddhist temple complex, as well as the ancient Prambanan Hindu temple.Obama is scheduled to speak at an Indonesian Diaspora Congress in Jakarta on Saturday."

The state is expecting to see a growth in tax revenue by 20 per cent. In the new system, taxes will be levied only for value additions and is expected to prevent the cascading of taxes. GST is also expected to ease the tax burden on consumers, the CM said.He criticised the hyped midnight celebration of the GST launch. This is uncalled for and not made in good taste. The transition can be disruptive for many small and medium businesses in the country.Also, many experts have questioned the reliability of the software powering the system, he said. The FB post said GST has created an unconstitutional imbalance of rights between the Centre and the states. While the states surrendered their rights, the Centre has held on to some indirect taxes like customs duties.In all GST deliberations, Kerala put forward three key propositions to preserve the fiscal autonomy of states: Legitimate share in the GST administration, a band rate structure for SGST and greater rate for the SGST in the GST rate. Unfortunately, the last two proposals were not accepted by the council.In the GST model proposed originally, there were only three slabs at rates 6 per cent, 12 per cent and 24 per cent. That division was unfair; for example, the GST for luxury cars and rice flour were both fixed at the same rate. This was not just an anomaly but an injustice. Our argument this would exacerbate the income inequality was well received. This led to the removal of levy for around 150 essential items. Also, the minimum rates were lowered from six per cent to five per cent and the top rate was hiked to 28 per cent, the Chief Minister said."

Police acted swiftly and dispersed them.Later, commissioner of civil supplies CV Anand met dealers and representatives of registered dealer associations and promised to address their problems. Major reforms are in the pipeline. E-pos machines have been introduced across the state and the process will be completed soon. All ration shops will be made mini banks and mini supermarkets, he said.N Raju, president of Ration Shop Dealers Welfare Association, said while they welcomed the officials response, they also raised the demand for a uniform system for fair price shops across all the states. We are all hired on commission basis. But this is not uniform across all states. For instance, some states offer Rs 220 on sale of one quintal of rice but we get just Rs 20 in Telangana. Our demand is for making this uniform across the country, said Raju."

He walks 4 km down the hill, crosses the Relli river to reach the nearest blockade at Relli Bridge, some 10 km south from Kalimpong town, to join other protesters of various political parties.We gather by 5.30 am as people in the hills start day early. Blockade enforcers who commute from as far as 8-10 km are allowed to come in their motorbikes. We take turns every day to maintain a register of emergency vehicles who are allowed to pass through our blockade but only with valid pass from Gorkha Janmukti Morcha party office, Rajen said.Blockade enforcer Pemba Sherpa does multi-tasking at 7th mile bridge blockade, 5 km from Kalimpong. I give water bottles to participants of political rallies, stop and verify each vehicle passing through our blockade and also counsel intoxicated youth who try to create ruckus and bring bad name to the Gorkhaland movement, Pemba said.Though the blockade enforcers know that many of the hill residents defy the shutdown by commuting to Siliguri and other parts of the hills during the night, when blockades are abandoned, they plead helplessness because of the family they have to run.I have to cut grass for the cattle and milk the cows after sitting the entire day at the blockade. The family has to run despite the blockade. Every one of us has to work back at home due to which, we return at dusk, said 7th mile blockade enforcer Roshan Rai.When no vehicle is passing their blockade, the enforcers engage in long discussions about the events of the hills. We are not against Bengalis or Mamata Banerjee. We just want our own state. Look at the glory and money of our neighbours in Sikkim and then look at our poverty despite us being more enriched in natural resources than Sikkim, said Relli blockade enforcer Tenzing Bhutia.On the other hand, the blockade enforcers vow not to vandalise vehicles in response to vandalising of Sikkim vehicles in Siliguri. Several Sikkim vehicles were vandalised and Sikkimese people harassed in Siliguri after Sikkim chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling wrote a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh extending his support to Gorkhaland statehood.Those people (vandals in Siliguri) are actually strengthening our movement by attacking the people of Sikkim. We dont want to bring a bad name to Gorkhaland movement by copying them, said Relli blockade enforcer Bikash Chhetri."

Dipankar Ghose Kumari Mann Batti Rana, a PDS official in Gangaloor, said some people had secretly applied for Aadhaar. Dipankar GhoseFor at least two months, Mahendra Hemla has been having the same conversation with the villagers. They come, the entire village of Pipdia almost at once, to his small fair price centre in Gangaloor, having walked over 30 kilometres through thick forests. They show him their ration cards, and ask for the grain that they are entitled to under the Chhattisgarh governments subsidy schemes. Hemla tells them they need to make Aadhaar cards too, for if they dont, beginning July 1, they will get no ration if their Aadhaar and ration cards are not linked. They tell me they cant. That the Maoists forbid them from making Aadhaar cards, he says. All Hemla can do is repeat what he knows. The next time, he fears, they will make the long journey back empty handed.Gangaloor village is inside Maoist-affected territory in Bijapur, one of Chhattisgarhs and Indias worst Naxal-affected districts. But some years ago, Gangaloor, which has a series of fair price centres, got itself a concrete road from the district headquarters of Bijapur 22 km away. This has meant that the government has access, and the entire village has Aadhaar cards. But villages such as Pidia and Gampur, deep in the forests and with no motorable roads, will now find themselves cut off from one more government benefit  subsidised ration.Bijapur District Collector Aayaz Tamboli, however, says there are some families in both Pidia and Gampur who have got their Aadhaar made. As it stands now, after July 1, where ration cards and Aadhaar cards are not linked, government-subsidised ration will not be given. But Aadhaar is consent-based. We cannot force people to get Aadhaar, he said.Yet, for villages such as Pidia and Gampur who are caught between government orders and Maoist diktats, consent means little. In Pidia, of 485 ration cards, there are 25 that are Aadhaar-seeded. In Gampur, the number is 17 of 283.Kumari Mann Batti Rana, who administers the fair price shop for Gampur in Gangaloor, said, Even the few who have made Aadhaar cards have done so secretly. They keep their cards with someone they know in Gangaloor, take the rice back home, and pretend they have bought it at the market at Rs 25 a kilo. If the dadalog (Naxals) find out, they will be punished.In Gorna Mankeli village, 15 km from Bijapur, the villagers talk quietly amongst themselves about the need for grain. Near them, children  with prominent ribs and distended stomachs  cling on to mothers. Yet for over two hours, the villagers refuse to talk to journalists on record without clearance. Motorcycles and bicycles leave the village to get permission and then return. One villager, Modiyam Chamru, is authorised to speak. We want no Aadhaar cards and ration from the government because they commit atrocities on our people, he said.Senior officials admit that in these circumstances  Maoist orders, distribution of cards, issues of connectivity  up to 10 per cent people in districts in Bastar may no longer be eligible for ration, even in a best case scenario.Census 2011 pegs the population of Bijapur at 2.55 lakh. As of June 26, 18 per cent of the population still has no Aadhaar card and of those that have both Aadhaar and ration cards, only 71 per cent have at least one family member where the two are linked.According to government records, Bijapur, one of the countrys poorest districts, has around 56,000 families. Close to 54,000 families qualify for subsidies offered by the state government. Of these, 26,061 are Antyodaya, the poorest of the poor, who are meant to get 35 kg of rice a month at Re 1 a kg.Collector Tamboli said, Considering the security and communication situation, it is true that the policy will mean that 10 per cent (of the districts population) may be left out. Under this scheme, the beneficiary has to turn up (first to make Aadhaar and later to collect ration), which is a massive challenge. We set up Aadhaar centres at marketplaces, weekly haats and deployed mobile vans to collect biometric data. But there have been certain challenges, besides security. For instance, we had to reprint 90,000 Aadhaar cards after it was found that they did not reach the people. And then, there were connectivity issues while uploading Aadhaar data.Local activists point out that if people are forced to drop out of the safety net offered by PDS, it could have an impact on health indicators. One of the reasons the PDS system in Chhattisgarh was lauded was that this was a poor state, and these schemes counteracted starvation deaths and malnutrition. But this new rule could be a blow. There is no guarantee that in the future Maoists wont influence even more people to give up their Aadhaar cards, an activist said.District data of July 2016 shows that the malnutrition rate among children in Bijapur aged 0 to 5 was as high as 39 per cent.Some in Bastar, counting on the unintended benefits of the linking, say that subsidised rice often went straight to Maoist cadres and this would now come down.Others, however, argued that villagers would now have to buy rice from the open market and then give part of it to the party. In a land with little government access, these schemes were one of the few things that showed that the government is benevolent. This linkage of Aadhaar and ration cards may have its benefits in other parts of the country, but in Bastar, there are some clear issues, a government official said.Back in Gangaloor, Hemla and Rana, their crumbling shops side by side, brace for the day when villagers from Pidia and Gampur would arrive to collect their ration. They speak of turning away mothers, with children in their arms. They have little control over the government order, but they will have to be the faces that say no. Hemla says, It all seems so heartless.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

According to a senior Finance department official, Odisha will lose around Rs 600 crore per annum from paddy, rice, pulses and other related products because of the transition from the VAT to the GST regime.Paddy and rice had five per cent VAT and the rate of tax on pulses was brought down to one per cent by the State Government after protest by the traders. All these items are in the exempted category under GST.However, on the whole Odisha is not going to lose revenue as there is provision of compensation to the States if the collection from the GST falls short compared to the revenue generation under the VAT regime.Official sources said 2015-16 will be the base year to calculate profit or loss under the GST. The State Government will collect VAT on petrol, diesel, aviation turbine fuel and liquor as these items are outside the purview of GST.If revenue from GST on an average will be less than the collection from VAT, CST, Entry Tax and Entertainment Tax on different items minus revenue from these items, the Centre will compensate with 14 per cent growth rate. The States own tax revenue was Rs 22526.96 crore in 2015-16 while the share in Central taxes was Rs 23573.79 crore. These items alone contributed around Rs 5000 crore to the State exchequer including Rs 3000 crore excise revenue.Sources in the Finance department said the impact on resources generation will have to be studied from August onwards for three months to reach a conclusion. The quantum of revenue collection in July can be known only in August which was under the old system, a senior official said and added that from August onwards the impact of GST will be visible. A clear picture will emerge only in December, he said.The State will mostly benefit from service tax whose rate has been fixed at 18 per cent. The manner in which services are growing, there is no question for a loss for the State under the GST regime. It is for the first time that States have been empowered to raise service tax. However, revenue from the service tax is yet to be assessed.Besides, the State Government is also yet to fully receive the CST compensation. Odisha has claimed Rs 2,755.36 crore towards compensation for the loss on account of CST reduction from 2007-08 to 2011-12 but received Rs 2,201.40 crore."

Chandran, a rationing inspector.Beneficiaries of the Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) scheme will receive yellow cards while the pink cards belong to the priority category.The blue cardholders will get State subsidy for the non-priority category, and the white cardholders belong to the general non-priority category.The ration share of each category a month are: Yellow: 35 kg of foodgrains per card for free, including 28 kg of rice and 7 kg of wheat; Pink: 5 kg of foodgrains per person for free, including 4 kg of rice and 1 kg of wheat; Blue: 2 kg of rice per person at Rs. 2 (no wheat); White: Rice at Rs. 8.90 a kg and wheat at Rs. 6.70 a kg. Earlier, there were misconceptions among the cardholders. For example, since the AAY and priority categories were both BPL cardholders, it was common for the priority cardholders to question why they were being given a lesser quantity of foodgrains compared to AAY beneficiaries, says Mr. Chandran.The new cards are priced at Rs. 50 for the yellow, pink, and blue ones, and Rs. 100 for the white.

VenkatachalapathyThe sweet smell of mangoes fills the air at Mango Mundy in Vellore, but it is the sound of birds chirping that cannot be missed here.Hanging from the ceiling of one of the busiest shops in the Mundy is a number of cardboard nest boxes that have turned the shop literally into a house of sparrows.More than 20 cardboard nest boxes and 10 pots serve as home for tens of sparrows at the shop of Ram Babu, a commission agent at the Mango market.As workers are busy loading and unloading raw mangoes, several sparrows, which are rarely found in the city, fly in and out the hay-filled nest boxes. His shop has been a home for sparrows for a little over a decade.Nearly 12 years ago, I saw these sparrows building nests behind the framed photos of deities that were hung on the wall. So, I decided to keep nest boxes for the birds, and thus it began drawing sparrows to my shop.The sparrows multiplied, and the labourers started to take care of the nest boxes and the birds from then on, said Mr. Babu.With their days filled with the chirping of sparrows, Mr. Ramu and the workers look at the nest boxes and the sparrows as an integral part of the shop.After the mango season comes to a close, I take time to keenly watch the birds. They prefer fresh water to be kept in the tub, and feed on the rice only if the place has been cleaned. If one bird occupies anothers box, they end up in a long fight, he said.One of the workers, 50-year-old Chinnaponnu, a resident of Shenbakkam, has been taking keen interest in feeding the house sparrows. She arrives at the shop at 6 a.m. and keeps rice and water for the sparrows.At any given time, there are at least 50 sparrows here. I do not see sparrows anywhere else in the city, and it is such a happy feeling watching them.They fly within the market premises, and if they enter the nest boxes at 5 p.m. everyday, they come out only in the early morning, she said.Mr. Babu observed that the sparrows were timid, and would sit quietly near him or even on the workers if left undisturbed.But he begs to differ on one point.I will not agree to the common belief that the population of sparrows have dwindled due to mobile towers. Rather, it is because of mankind. Sparrows live in thatched roofs and trees. Now, there are no thatched houses or many trees, and hence the birds are rarely sighted.They are only multi-storey buildings now, and sparrows do not fly very high, he pointed out.Like him, a few other shops in the market have also put up a few nest boxes for the sparrows.

It would have been helped the stature of Rahul Gandhi had he spoken facts on the issue of employment too, they said adding that the TSPSC would soon give the number of posts filled/recruited and regularised since formation of Telangana.On the Rahul Gandhis comments of family rule by TRS, the ruling party leaders said the Congress had no moral right to speak on it since it was the party which is known for dynasty and family rule starting from Jawaharlal Nehru era.Family politicsOtherwise too, many Congress leaders including several former chief ministers had their family members in active politics simultaneously, the Congress leaders pointed out.However, the kin of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had joined the Telangana movement much before State formation and they did not come into politics after the TRS had come to power as in case of the kin of several Congress leaders, they said."

The others will be to seek a practical taxation system without scope for tax evasion, taxation on end product and not their components and reduction of dosage on commonly used goods by public. The government will also demand that the grievances of traders be addressed before the GST came into force. Therefore, the need for postponement.Tax slabThe Minister added that the Telangana government will want most of the items to be taxed in the range of 5 to 12 %. This was important for the State because it was not strong in manufacturing sector where heavy dosage of taxation could be considered. Telangana was identified with services sector which required lower level of taxes. The concerns of real estate, hotel, granite, cotton and fan manufacturing industries which were exposed to unrest in Telangana will be highlighted at the Council meeting. The Centre will be told that tax evasion should be checked by introduction of GST but not subject traders to agitation. The objective should be to bring all sections of traders into tax net rather than impose higher taxes.In Telangana, Mr. Rajender said 95% of rice traders evaded payment of 5% tax on their commodity. They demanded that the rate be restricted to 1% in which case they promised to see that the tax revenue to government from rice was 500 times more. Taxes on some of the items were impractical to raise because the State governments were already collecting value added tax on them at the rate of 14.5% in addition to Central Excise of 12.5%, aggregating to 27%."

While earlier forms of adulteration, including mixing sand, marble chips, stones, chalk powder and brick powder with spice and food grain were harmful to the digestive system, doctors warn plastic rice can increase risk of cancer by 15-20 per cent, apart from wreaking havoc on digestive and reproductive system. If consumed regularly, plastic rice can choke the intestine, leading to bloating and acute stomach ache. This will require surgical intervention too, doctors said.Plastic rice can either be made from potato carved in shape of rice grain and covered with a coating of cheap plastic or made in shape of rice granules carved out of plastic sheets. In either case, consumption can trigger havoc in the digestive system. ""While other forms of adulteration like mixing sand or crushed stones are easier to spot and sift, plastic rice is not only difficult to differentiate from real rice, but also affects digestive enzymes.It can even cause changes in the hormonal system and affect the entire reproductive system,"" said Dr Sudarshan Reddy , general physician at Continental Hospital.Worse, diagnose is delayed as doctors fail to pinpoint the cause of gastritis.

When mixed with rice, it effectively contaminates rice and decreases nutrient value.

""That is the reason it was decided to set up IRRI's centre in Varanasi,"" said the experts, adding that the institute has its headquarters at Manila, Phillipines.The IRRI is devoted to enhancing rice production through use of lesser water and introduction of drought and flood resistant varieties produced in China. ""India is the largest exporter of rice and the agenda now is to exceed production in China which does not have yield quality varieties like Basmati,"" said Singh.Both agriculture experts of Indian origin are working towards popularising rice in Africa and to introduce new varieties that can sustain odd weather.""Eastern India depends mostly on rains and has a very small irrigated area, so the region is most vulnerable to frequent floods and droughts and that is why IRRI has taken up the cause of introducing weather resistant varieties of rice in the region,"" said Gautam. He lamented that despite major effort and government intervention, not more than 50% agricultural land is irrigated while the remaining is rain-fed.Singh said that Central government has shown keen interest in improving the yield and has supported the IRRI project of setting up a research Centre in Varanasi. It has in principle been approved by the agriculture ministry too and a cabinet meeting will finally approve the opening of its centre. ""Though IRRI is a world organisation funded by the public and NGOs don't have any research centre anywhere in the world we are happy to start a research centre in Varanasi,"" he said"

But GST is expected to add a new twist to the tale of Indian consumerism. Under the new taxation regime fruits, vegetables, pulses, wheat, bread and rice are exempted from taxation even as chips, biscuits, butter, tea and coffee are attracting higher taxes. So, would that make families to make healthier choices at the supermarket?Cited as the single largest taxation reform in independent India, GST is set to change taxation for every sector -from real estate to vehicles to consumer durables to branded goods to luxury items.For a middle class family that earns between Rs50,000-Rs80,000 a month, the impact on the monthly budget will not be more than a few hundred rupees. For those earning in the Rs1.75 lakh bracket, the purchase of luxury items and SUVs or sedans will not necessarily result in an increase of more than 2-4%.While this is a rough estimate, individual likes and preferences might hold more weight as to which way the household budget might swing. For instance, ghee and tea are taxed higher. Now, if your budget includes substantial quantities of ghee, then you are likely to feel the pinch. It is still early though -it has not been made law. And many items have seen exemptions, says M R Venkatesh, a Chennai based char2 DAYS TO GST tered ac countant.Among the list of items getting cheaper are chicken, oil, butter and bhujia (snack), while purchase of tea, coffee, masala powders, curd, cheese, biscuits, chewing gum, chocolate and icecream will be 1-5% more expensive.At the top of the chart with the highest taxation increase are items like paneer, sweets and cornflakes. Tobacco, alcohol and petroleum continue to be exempted, allowing the state government to dictate rates.Instead of increasing the cost of alcohol, they have increased the cost of side-dishes, says B Kannan, a tax consultant.One major area of change for consumers could be big-ticket purchases like homes, cars and consumer durables. With service tax increasing to 18% from 15% all services will become dearer. Loans will get more expensive.Purchase of health, life and motor insurance will also get more expensive. Service tax rates were increased earlier too, but we didnt see any change in consumer buying pattern over more than a decade. Impact on policies for the common man will be at a minimum. For instance in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a 3% increase in taxation will hardly result in a few paise increase, says Tapan Singhel, CEO, Bajaj Allianz."

That too, from their own countrymen living abroad. A group of Tamils settled in Thailand have launched an initiative that will not only help the farmers here but will also create more awareness about the benefits of millets.Spearheading the initiative `Save Farmer is D Devadas, president of the Thailand Tamil Association. If we promote millets, we will benefit doubly . Millets are good for health and if more people begin consuming millets, small and marginal farmers will benefit as millets need very little water to grow and can be cultivated on unirrigated lands, said Devadas, at a get-together held in Bangkok last weekend. With less water being used for cultivation, there will be more availability of safe drinking water, he added.Detailing their plans, Kamaraj Viswagandhi, who works with an MNC in Bangkok said that at present middlemen eat into the profits of farmers. A product that a farmer sells for `3 reaches the end-consumer at over `25. Through our plan, we are directly reaching out to the farmer with the help of some NGOs, he said.The group will be procuring their first set of grains from Chittilingi gramam in Tamil Nadu. Farmers of this village, which has a population of 1,800, practice organic farming. The village also has women entrepreneurs who sell their grains through a farmers producer company .This initiative can be expanded to benefit entire south India and later the whole country by procuring millets from all the states. We are also tying up with interested Tamil associations in other countries so that millets are directly procured from the farm ers in TN, without involving middlemen, said Devadas, also the CEO of the Saraff Global group in Bangkok. Tamil associations in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore are now a part of our initiative. Our Tamil friends settled in these countries will buy the grains from farmers we have tied up with, whenever they visit Tamil Nadu.Apart from self-consumption theyll encourage other families to adapt this strategy. This will create a multiplier effect. Its an informal start, albeit small, he added.The plan is to stock more grains in the next few months and make it available to the expat community in Thailand through yoga, pranic healing and sports centres.Right now we are planning to connect to all Tamil Federations across Asia, said Devadas.At the event in Bangkok, which was attended by about 200 people, Coimbatorebased `Nallasoru Rajamurugan, who has authored several books on healthy food made from millets, captured the audiences attention, giving a live demo, making kelvaragu halwa, thinai payasam and kambu upma. The volunteers also sold about 30kg of millets during the event to the attendees.Elucidating some of the health benefits of millets, Dr Sivaraman, a Chennai-based Siddha doctor, said that even health-conscious youngsters and people who regularly work out are not spared from lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and blood pressure.This is due to an increased consumption of refined flour (maida) and polished rice.A switch to healthier options is paramount.Traditionally grown rice like kulkakru, kowni and black rice have immense medicinal and therapeutic properties. The difference in taste is only marginal and it can have a huge impact on health.(The author is a former journalist)"

But things have changed drastically after Thursday's announcement of an indefinite shutdown in the Hills.""What can we do? We can't buy provisions. We are even running short of items like rice and cereals. If this bandh continues, there is no saying when we will get supplies. We are also very concerned as transporters aren't running their vehicles. It is better to ask the guests to leave,"" a hotel owner said.A crowd had gathered at the Motor Stand in Chowkbazar on Fridaymorning. There were tourists, migrant labourers and a large number of policemen. The only things missing were vehicles. Some of the tourists had trekked 3-4 km uphill with luggage to reach the main vehicle stand in Darjeeling early. ""Our family, including children and senior citizens, trekked up from our hotel to reach here by 6 am but there were no taxis or buses. We are still waiting as it is not possible to stay in Darjeeling any longer.

Several people from the plains who work at establishments in Darjeeling as daily wageearners also left for home. The police helped by segregating those gathered there according to age, sex and profile and making them queue up. The idea was the help the elderly, women and children leave in the first vehicles that arrived from Siliguri.

From the 2006 elections to 2011 and to 2016, both AIADMK & DMK have been competing with each other to offer colour TVs, mixies, cash doles, gas stoves, free land, rice at Rs 2/kg or free cycles, sarees, dhotis  the list is endless.The curse of the freebie culture started in 2006, when DMK chief M Karunanidhi announced free colour TV sets and rice. It was for the AIADMK head J Jayalalithaa to follow suit. In a competitive spirit, she announced a slew of freebies in 2011 and came to power. And the same culture continued in 2016, bleeding the state of its resources. TN is a highly productive, competitive state and it is a crying shame we are in this situation, says S Gurumurthy, political commentator and editor of Thuglak.The government can defend itself by saying that its social sector expenditure was not going towards freebies, but towards health, education, roads and literacy.But does that argument hold water? RBI data shows that Tamil Nadu instead of improving on vital social indices is actually pushing the state down.Tamil Nadu is at 16th position nationwide when it comes to literacy with a 80.09% literacy rate. It is much behind Maharashtra, Manipur, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Delhi, Goa, Kerala, Nagaland and Tripura. Of course, there is always a high base in TN and the rate of increase in literacy rates may be slower.With a poverty rate of 21.2%, the state also has a high number of poor people. As many as 1.2 crore people of TNs total population of 6.78 crore are poverty-stricken. TN has the 7th highest population of BPL families in the country.This shows that the freebie culture, which is pushing up the debt ceiling of Tamil Nadu is also reallocating money away from real needs.The states current outstanding liabilities stand at Rs 2.56 lakh crore in 2016-17; up by 18% from 2015-16 and 67% from five years ago.The state also has the notoriety of being the fourth most debt-ridden state in India after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal. TNs current reserve fund of Rs 1,920 crore is not necessarily confidence inspiring given the extent of its liabilities, RBI data said.We have always been at third place in terms of revenue generation in India. Our GDP has been high, as has been our production and industrial capabilities. For instance because we have a diversified industrial workforce  automotive, engineering, chemicals, plastics, garments  we have been able to weather downturns in the domestic and international economy. We were delivering steady growth of 7% to 12% for the past 20 years. Our real problem comes from mismanagement of state finance, says P Ravichandran, chairman, southern region, industry body CII."

What started off as an attempt at weight loss has now achieved religio-cultural significance for me. A casual conversation in the news bureau was the trigger.Lets take up the Ramzan nombu along with Afrah, somebody re marked. Many heads nodded in agree ment. Then came the finer points.Lets eat only fruits, said one col league. Oh, thats not right. Lets do it the way she fasts and then we can all break with Iftar together. Back and forth it went but finally nobody did any thing about it.Back home, the discussion continued and my younger daughter mentioned how her classmates were fasting and she felt very bad having food while they didnt. It was mid way into the second week of Ramzan fasting when we all went to the cafeteria to have lunch and Afrah joined in for chit-chat. I suddenly felt that I couldnt eat when somebody was on a com plete fast without food or water. While she did not have any issues about it since it was driven by a strong faith and will-power, I decided that I would try and join her for a week. But I did not want to rush in and then fall sick or break it abruptly.I sought advice from my friend and nutritionist Dr Mumtaz Ismail and asked her to guide me on how I could do it in a healthy way. I dont have any religious inclinations and hence dont plan to carry it to the ex treme intensity that the faithful do, but I would like to do it in the spirit of companionship and camaraderie, I told her. In our community, fasting means avoiding rice completely, eating only once or eating before sunset. This is often limited to a single day. Fasting for days on end is generally not encouraged as there is a belief that nothing registers in a mind if the body is starving  you cant teach vedas to a hungry man. Feed him and then teach him, as the saying goes.Dr Mumtaz gave me a menu and briefed me on how to go about it. The first day, I drank water of course but had food just before sunrise and then just after sunset.Day one went off without any problem. Then I decided that I would break the fast with Afrah who went out to eat after she had said her prayers. I told her that I would bring something from home and we could share it. Suddenly while breaking the fast, it had become important to ensure that Afrah also ate healthy food when she broke the fast. I added fruits, salads, chappathi and rice with vegetables to our small evening meal. And when she told her family that she was having a vegetarian iftar every day, her folks were happy, Well, good, at least you are not eating porotta and beef every day, they said.In the office, our Muslim-Hindu combination caught attention as did our iftar. As the Ramzan fasting comes to an end, for me it has been a different experience. Somewhere during these days, it had become important to me to keep the sanctity of the fast because it mattered to my young colleagues faith and devotion. And I didnt want to disrespect it.At the end of the day as we sat for dinner after sunset, we both felt the same hunger and thirst and all those religious differences just didnt matter."

From this Saturday, over 85 lakh firms would be required to upload every detail of their business transactions onto the GST Network. From the largest firms to the smallest mobile phone sellers, everyone is busy getting ready for the new tax law. They are both excited and nervous.Excited as most people find the basic promise of GST compelling. Firms would pay less number of taxes (One GST replaces 17 taxes), less amount of tax (average GST rate for industrial products is 18% compared to 25-28% of tax burden now), and face less tax on tax incidences. The uniform GST rates across the states would further reduce the tax burden and compliance cost.Plus, no more hiring of a large number of staff to pay many taxes levied at the central, state and local levels, each with a different tax compliance system. No need to maintain a cozy relationship with the tax officer. All one needs to do is register with the GST Network website, fill the prescribed online forms and pay tax. Elimination of physical contact with the tax officer will be the game changer, many argue. The general mood is that GST will make doing business transparent and profitable.But there is nervousness over a few provisions of the law. Many firms sense they may need more working capital to carry out day to day business. This can happen in at least three ways.One: A firm will need to pay GST while shifting its products from the factory to its warehouses located in different states. This money will remain blocked until these products are sold. Firms selling seasonal products like ACs or heaters where production is throughout the year but sales peak only for few months will see blockages for longer periods.Two: A buyers money would remain blocked if the seller does not pay tax on time. Let us understand this with an example. Firm A buys fabric of value Rs 100 for making a shirt. The GST rate on the fabric is 5%. Firm A pays Rs 105 to the seller. But if the seller fails to pay Rs 5 to the government as GST, Firm A cannot claim input credit. So post-GST, a firm has to worry not only about his business but also ensure his business partners pay tax and file returns on time. Firms buying from a large number of suppliers are nervous on this.Three: An exporters money would be blocked because of the gap between payment of GST and its refund after a few months. Exporters currently get an exemption from the payment of taxes on inputs used for making the export product. But under GST, an exporter will have to first pay tax at the time of buying of inputs, and seek refund of this tax after the exports which may take place after many months. This will make exports expensive as firms have to borrow money to pay tax and interest. GST exemption would be available only to firms located in a SEZ, creating arbitrage in favor of the SEZs. Canada, Australia, Malaysia and many other countries allow exporters exemption from payment of taxes.There are worries that affect a certain class of firms. For example, firms located in states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand that offer area based exemptions are worried as those exemptions will no longer be available. Producers of wheat or rice that attract zero GST worry as the tax paid on buying of pesticides, insecticides, or tractors would not be refunded.A mobile phone dealer will have to pay tax when he receives advance money against the booking of say 2000 phones. The worry is not the tax but that he also has to provide details of each of the 2000 transactions in the return form GSTR-1, making compliance tedious.While large firms worry about the large number of returns to be filed, small firms worry how they will manage even a single return online. But many of these were filing VAT returns online and will pick up fast after initial glitches. Thats where the GST Suvidha providers may come in handy.As India prepares to become a GST nation, never before has a tax law had such large stakes or evoked such strong sentiments."
5a0437a89855b76bf13bcf64,It Began With Bristow...,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/it-began-with-bristow/articleshow/59187374.cms,2017-06-16,"KOCHI: In a city where different modes of transportation infrastructure - from ferries to flyovers, the whole `wagon wheel' as it were - coexist seamlessly, Kochi Metro , which will be inaugurated today, is symbolic of functional efficiency. Let's enjoy the ride.Back in 1938, Kochi witnessed an inauguration that triggered dramatic changes in the way its people - and goods - travelled. Venduruthi Bridge that fas tened Kochi to southern Kerala was inau gurated, without fanfare, without the maharajah or the governor from Madras, and even without a worthwhile function, to mark the momentous day . Four people, the late M S Menon, legal adviser to Cochin Port (later, chief justice), Sir Robert Bristow, the engineer who built Cochin Harbour, his wife, Lady Gertrude, and the driver, Narayanan, took the first ride over the bridge, in Menon's car, a Ford V8, bearing the number-plate CS 16.At the middle of the bridge, where the lifting span is fixed, Sir Robert tapped the driver's shoulder and asked him to stop. They both got out and the great engineer shook the driver's hand and said, ""We both are workers. Let us wish this bridge a bright future."" Menon later regretted that he didn't click a photo of the poignant moment.Through Narayanan's teary eyes, the blurred waterscape to the north of the bridge might have looked different from now. Small vessels, fishing boats, giant rice boats, machwas and small personal boats might have made the Vembanad backwater look like a busy thoroughfare. Its shores on both sides might have looked bald, bereft of even nominal skylines.In `The Cochin State Manual', C Achyutha Menon described Kochi at the beginning of the 20th century in these words, ""Roads suitable for wheeled traffic are of recent origin in Cochin, and before their construction inland traffic was carried on almost entirely by means of backwaters and rivers.""Like roads, bridges and overbridges these days, then major constructions were all about canals. Construc tion of a canal from Thevara to Kundannur, noted a happy Menon ""brought Tripunithura within easy dis tance of Ernakulam.""Venduruthi bridge ensured a long road journey - broken only by Vembanad backwater at Aroor - to the southern tip of Kerala. Introduction of mechanised barges at Aroor ferry helped buses and trucks to cross the wide chasm, without much wait. Later, the Aroor bridge was constructed in the early 1960s. Towards the north, at Desam village near Aluva, an unbridged river could also be similarly crossed. Rail-cum-road bridges at Chalakudi and Shoranur assured an uninterrupted journey northward.By the middle of 1950s, roads and railway became preferred mode of transport for people, but a lot of goods still moved by cheaper waterways. The cargo hub of Ernakulam till about 60 years ago was Chanthakulam (market tank), behind the Government Law College. Here hundreds of river craft, laden with wares, used to queue up. Atmosphere there used to be carnivalesque, with hundreds of merchants, buyers, onlookers and workers buzzing like one big beehive. Now the place is as dead as the unused Jewish cemetery , a stone's throw away from there. Ferry boats, the only means of transport from islands to the north-west of Ernakulam, dwindled with Goshree bridges coming up; the road from there now disgorge a steady stream of vehicles into the city . Ever since the neardeath of cheap water transport, Kochi has been struggling to cope with ways to move from point A to B.When Sir Robert Bristow first came to Cochin, he got down at the rail terminus at Pachalam, now known as Old Railway Station, and a small launch called `Vasco' met him at the waterfront. Later he wrote in his autobiography, Cochin Saga, ""[I]n a few minutes we were chugging across the calm waters of Cochin Harbour and marvelling at its scope. It seemed all the blue lagoons of the southern seas had come to rest in the wide bosom of Mother India at Cochin, for each side there stretched an interminable vista fading only into the sky itself[.]"" The man who changed all that was Bristow himself.From where he watched, three miles westward was a narrow break in the line of palms, marking the harbour mouth. Later, in the waters between he reclaimed an island and built wharves and erected giant cranes. In short, he changed the look of Kochi. To Bristow also goes the credit of bringing air transport to Kochi. In 1926, on an airstrip he built on what he called `Diamond Island', the first two-seater aircraft landed. A proper aerodrome came up at Wellingdon Island in 1943. It was not much of an airport, though it strove to serve the city for more than 50 years, providing magnificent take-offs, where the sea and the coconut-palm-filled land met over the horizon at acute angles. ""Two-roomed nondescript tin shed"" was an entry made in his journal by the late English poet Stephen Spender, who visited Ernakulam in the late 1950s. The airport was under the ministry of defence, making it too restricted for expanding aviation needs of civilians.The Cochin International Airport at Nedumbassery was, by then, an idea whose time had come. Kerala was whipping up good numbers in air travellers because of the Gulf migration. To call it the first privatelyfinanced airport would be inexact; actually it is the first crowd-funded airport in the world.Gulf Malayalis chipped in with modest sums in large numbers. The upsurge in tourism during the beginning of the 21st century was, to a great extent, fuelled by Nedumbassery airport. A later spin off was the commissioning of international cruise facility at the port in 2013.Kochi would be one of the few cities in the world whose destiny was shaped, and reshaped, by modes of transport. It all started in the dying years of the 19th century, when the maha rajah of the princely state agreed to meet entirely the expenses of drawing a railway line from Shoranur in British India, to Ernakulam.The project was commissioned in 1902, but got integrated into the larger Indian railway system through converting into broad gauge in 1935. Later, Cochin Port accessed the rail line at Cochin Harbour Terminus, in Wellingdon Island.Now Metro, the preferred mass transit system in almost all major urban conglomerates, is coming to Kochi. How it will change Kochi's travel habits is something only time can tell. I am holding my horses back and sounding cautious because I know Kochi is a place where some great ideas like international airport had taken wings; I know too that Kochi is perilously a cemetery of grand ideas. Remember, FC Cochin, the first football club to raise funds through issue of shares? Or more recently, Vallarpadam-Edapally railway line. No Kochiite has ever seen the silhouette of a freight train moving over it.What Metro has changed forever is the cityscape. Giant concrete columns snaking through the city's arterial roads is not a pretty sight. In all world cities, Metros are kept underground. We will have to be planning in those terms if and when it inches towards heritage areas. And also to spare a few thoughts now about urban aesthetics, along with infrastructure.The writer is a former bureaucrat and award-winning author."
5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."
5a043afb9855b76bf13bcfeb,Organic products are in high demand in Kolkata,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/organic-products-are-in-high-demand-in-kolkata/articleshow/59219467.cms,2017-06-19,"Spend whatever amount you may, but the rice you buy from the market will have some amount of pesticide in it. The two types of rice  polished and super-polished  go through multiple levels of refinement with chemicals and pesticide. On the one hand, the process drains nutritional value from the grains and on the other, pesticides and chemicals do what they usually do  harm the body in every possible way. A third category, however, is fast gaining popularity. Organic rice, free of artificial food additives, has come as a boon. Similarly, organic vegetables  considered healthier than conventionally grown counterparts  are not only in high demand but also sold regularly in five markets in and around Kolkata, including Behala Senhaati, Naktala Udayan Sangha and Garia chalpatti.Arabindo Mandal, a farmer and seller of organic vegetables, told us that like rice, an average vegetable also lacks nutritional value. He was one of the 19 farmers and handicraft artists, who gathered at the farmers' market at Little India Haat, Vedic Village recently. Be it veggies, poultry products or garments made of organic cotton, the haat had a lot on offer. ""People are now getting aware of the endless benefits of organic food. We want to promote it for the sake of better health and lifestyle,"" said Upasana Carpenter, the spokesperson of Vedic Village.Talking about the health benefits of organic food, Dr Kamalesh Chatterjee said every product we buy from the market smacks of pesticides, fertilisers or colours. Also, lead and arsenic are often found in high quantities in vegetables and other foods. Organic products, however, are free of chemicals, as they are harvested in a natural process without fertilisers. ""From neem, cow urine and some other natural ingredients, we can make more than 25 types of pesticides. If used in proper proportions, they are as effective as any other chemical pesticide,"" said Saheb Mondal, a farmer. ""Naturally, organic food has more antioxidant compounds linked to better health than regular food, and lower levels of toxic metals and pesticides,"" said Chatterjee. In case of poultry products, the chicken and ducks are not fed or injected hormones and steroids to increase the production of meat and eggs.The farmers at Little India Haat said they produce everything from paddy, veggies to poultry products. ""Whatever you eat in everyday life, we can produce it in an organic way,"" said Arabindo. According to him, there are multiple NGOs working in different parts of Bengal that support and encourage farmers to start organic farming. Arabindo, for instance, belongs to an NGO that operates in different parts of North 24 Parganas. ""There are 75 farmers working in a 10-acre farm,"" he said. Similarly, Parashuram Swain, a farmer from Odisha, who harvests two types of rice, said the production process is both easy and cost-effective. ""The only problem is the quantity. The artificial methods multiply production quantity, but if we resort to the natural process, there's quality but not quantity,"" said Parashuram.Naturally, organic products are costlier. For instance, a kilo of bottle gourd will cost Rs 25 in any Kolkata market, but its organic counterpart comes at Rs 35. Similarly, a kilo of organic ridge gourd is priced at Rs35, which is around RS 10 higher than the average market price.Despite the high price, demand for these products is going up. The farmers said, besides the five markets in and around Kolkata, they are trying to penetrate other bazars as well. However, due to less supply, they have not been able to meet the demand. Talking about the increasing demand, the farmers said people are more aware now. ""They know how harmful chemicals and pesticides are; so more and more people are consciously avoiding artificially grown products,"" said Namita Sarkar, another farmer.Sushila Jaiswal, who came to spend her weekend at Vedic Village and was spotted at the farmers' market, had an interesting story to share. The 60-something resident of Salt Lake said her grandson is all of eight months and is only fed homemade food. ""We give him a boiled mixture of vegetables and rice and everything in his food is organic. I made sure that he isn't given anything artificial. I know about the pesticides and chemicals in vegetables and did not take a chance with his food,"" she said."

It is home district of BJD's farmer's cell convenor and labour minister Sushant Singh.As a precursor how Saturday will unfold, the Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan Samanwaya Samiti (POKSSS) staged road bloackade at many places on Friday against the Mandsaur killings. The anti-BJP forces may try to send a political signal by registering their protests.Police have laid seize to the Mini stadium where Chouhan's chopper will land and the Lok Mandap right in front of it where the CM will address a public meeting as part of BJP's Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas programme.Chauhan was originally scheduled to address the meet on June 15. However, it was rescheduled in view of the unrest in MP.The saffron party is extra cautious given the fact that black flags were shown and eggs hurled at vehicles of Union ministers Radha Mohan Singh and Jual Oram in the state in past one week.Political parties invariably choose Bargarh for launching their farmer-outreach programmes. In February last year, Prime Minister Narendra had addressed a farmers' rally here. In 2015, Rahul Gandhi had taken out a Chasi Bachao padayatra at Attabira in Bargarh district highlighting farmers' plights followed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik addressing a farmers' rally at Sohela the same year."

But, now with the demonstrations at rest, it's time for the gastronomically driven Indoreans to binge in the elaborate Iftar spread. Indore streets are the place to be to enjoy the delectable dishes from the textured haleem to refreshing sherbets and desserts this Ramadan. Here is where you need to go to make your best pick from the gourmet Iftar spread.Monsoon munchies like Bhajiye, pakoras and samosas become the most sought after starters during Ramadan and otherwise. The makeshift stalls in Azad Nagar and Badwali Chowki are abuzz with devouts in the evening savouring these munchies. Danish Yusuf, a regular at the market shares, ""The various stall owners have given a twist to these munchies with stuffing of mutton, keema and mirchi in samosas and bhajiyas. These snacks have been priced at Rupees 20 for four samosas and a 100 gram bhajiyas."" These places see people hanging out post namaaz around 7.30 in the evening. Sarthak Soni, an engineering student adds, ""We at our home don't get to enjoy an Iftar spread, so we prefer going to these places to have a dash of celebration. The stall owners are extremely welcoming and we feel one amongst all.""A rich meal is incomplete without being guilty of gorging on some irresistible desserts. Areas like Khajrana and Rani Pura are just the streets to be to have desserts like Aam Paak, Gulab-jamun, Meetha Samosa (caramel dipped), rice pudding (condensed Kheer) etc. These pocket-friendly dishes attract hundreds of enthusiasts daily to feel the essence of the Ramadan month. Hamza Khan, a sweet shop owner in Khajrana, shares, ""In the month of Ramadan we don't open stalls with an idea to make money. It's a month of divinity and we want to make people happy. Serving them with desserts at low prices is one way of expressing our strong brotherhood.""Biryani tops the list of favourite delicacies for many during Ramadan. The speciality about the biryani that is served at Bambai Bazaar is its authentic preparation. Yusuf Ali, a Biryani stall owner, says, ""People prefer to break their roza at home and only come at our stalls around 10 pm. Though, this irresistible Iftar delicacy is a must have during this time. It takes us almost three hours to prepare it and we keep the quantity low so that people can enjoy the taste even when their tummy is full."" Ansh Pagare, a hostel resident who is a regular at the biryani stalls, shares, ""I have a couple of college friends who let me relish the Iftar feast at their homes and also take me to these famous biryani stalls late in the night. Now three more roommates of mine have become a regular at Bambai Bazaar.""There are a few savouries like Haleem, Shirmal and Khasta Rot that are commonly available at all these streets. Indori haleem is no less than the famous Hyderabadi haleem. Mohammad Tabish, a chef talks about the recipe, ""Haleem is a thick gravy like preparation made from variety of dals, gehu, matar and chunks of meat. It is better eaten hot. Families prepare haleem at home as well. This is one essential Ramadan dish relished by everyone."" However, dates, Shirmaal (a loaf of bread stuffed with fruits) and Khasta rot (a type of cookie) are the most savoured choices and available ever where.

The chief minister will hold a meeting in Bargarh on Saturday, his first since several farmers died in police firing in Mandsaur recently.Chouhan was scheduled to address his meeting on Thursday but postponed it after the unrest in his state.The BJP is also worried that protesters may show black flags to Chouhan or hurl eggs at his vehicle like they did for Union ministers Radha Mohan Singh and Jual Oram. To prevent such protests, the party has prepared Chouhan's schedule in such a way that he does not have to travel by road. Chouhan will land inside the mini stadium complex in Bargarh and address a meeting on a field in front of it.""In a democracy, rivals can stage such protests. We don't mind it as long as they are in tune with democratic norms,"" said Aswini Sarangi, the BJP leader coordinating Chouhan's tour.But more than the protests, a section of BJP leaders are worried about the message the meeting would send to the farming community. ""The very purpose of holding Chouhan's meeting in Bargarh, considered to be Odisha's rice bowl because of its contribution to paddy production, is to showcase Madhya Pradesh as a model state for farmers. But after Mandsaur, this message may not come across,"" said a BJP insider.Bargarh is traditionally the seat of farmers' movements in the state. Bargarh-based farmer-leader Lingaraj said no protests had been planned for Saturday but added that Chouhan's address would make a mockery of the farmers' plight."

5a0473769855b76bf13bd450,"Modi in US: chemistry done, politics, economics next",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/619892/modi-us-chemistry-done-politics.html,2017-06-29,"P S Raghavan, Jun 30 2017, 0:03 ISTAmerican President Donald Trumps penchant for throwing interlocutors off-balance with his tweets, words and actions made preparations of Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to the US a nervous exercise for Indian officials. In the event, the visit achieved its objectives: creating a positive chemistry between the two leaders, confirming the shared strategic vision that Indian and US leaders have developed since 2000, and sidestepping discordant issues.Trump passed the Modi hug test with flying colours. He was faithful to his carefully scripted utterances. And, importantly, he did not preface or follow the Modi visit with disconcerting tweets, as he did with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The Joint Statement addresses major Indian concerns. It mentions cross-border terrorist attacksby Pakistan-based groups and promises expanded intelligence-sharing and operational-level counterterrorism cooperation. The designation of Hizbul Mujahideen leader Salahuddin as a global terrorist was a welcome US statement on terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.Trump recognised Indias contribution to democracy, stability and security in Afghanistan and welcomed further contributions. The 2016 India-US joint statement had not mentioned Afghanistan.The forthright assertions about the Indo-Pacific  a term China does not particularly care for  were designed to counter the suspicion that US engagement with China to pull its North Korea chestnuts out of the fire would lead to soft-pedalling on Chinese expansionism in its neighbourhood.The joint statement emphasises freedom of navigation and commerce, resolution of territorial and maritime disputes in accordance with international law and  clearly addressing China  calls on nations in the region to adhere to these principles.Indias concerns about the geopolitical designs of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative were endorsed. A further message to China was delivered by Trumps declaration that the India-US-Japan Malabar naval exercises next month would be the largest maritime exercise ever conducted in the Indian Ocean.On bilateral relations, defence and security cooperation were highlighted with the commitment to working together on advanced defence equipment and technology. Missing this year was the word, technology-sharing, which was in the 2016 statement.The Defence Technology and Trade Initiative, set up in 2012 to promote co-development and co-production of advanced defence technologies, is included in the fact sheet on cooperation put out by the White House. The US confirmed its offer of Sea Guardian predator drones to bolster our maritime deterrence capability. The F-16 aircraft manufacture in India did not find mention; it may still have to pass the requirement, technology and viability tests.The section on trade predictably reflects Trumps much-repeated views on this subject, but is more politely phrased. There is an open-ended commitment to undertake a comprehensive review of trade relations, unlike the Chinese commitment to a 100-day plan.The difference is that the US trade deficit with China is about $350 billion while that with India is less than $25 billion. The goals of rationalising regulatory processes, fostering technology and innovation, and increasing market access are unexceptionable. It is in Indias interest to work in this direction; the US also has to keep its side of the bargain.The US energy exports to India were discussed. American company Westinghouse may have to restructure its nuclear energy project in India, because of its financial woes. Trump announced that the Indian companies are negotiating long-term contracts of for US Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplies. In todays global hydrocarbons scene, competitive prices will remain a constant issue.Indian companies have invested over $10 billion in the US LNG and shale sectors. There are, therefore, important convergences. The devil lies in the details of their realisation; Indian diplomats have their work cut out. Recognition of this should temper the euphoria of the Modi-Trump hugs.The Trump Administration has established a practice of contradictory policy signals emanating from its various departments. We have seen this on China, Russia and Europe. We have to see if the objectives outlined in the joint statement have an all-of-government acceptance. For example, corporate America would like a more accommodative approach to China; will the business-friendly Trump administration succumb to this pressure?American criticism of cross-border terrorism from Pakistan into India is not new. We heard it in the 2000s. The core American concern, however, is terrorism from Pakistan into Afghanistan. The US has, therefore, pressed Pakistan to cooperate on Afghanistan and, in return, tacitly condoned Pakistani terror export to India (except for periodical statements). Military and civil assistance to Pakistan are linked to cooperation on Afghanistan, not terrorism against India.There is a recurring temptation in the US establishment to take a regional approach to Afghanistan. This predicates that India-Pakistan competition for strategic space is the fundamental problem in Afghanistan and justifies Pakistans existential concerns about Indian presence in Afghanistan.Ominous hintsThe corollary is that to achieve peace in Afghanistan, the US has to promote peace between India and Pakistan. There are some ominous hints that US Defence Secretary Mattis comprehensive review of Afghanistan is looking at such a regional approach.The policy in USA emerges from a dynamic interaction of multiple stakeholders and interest groups. The president may be the final authority, but the National Security Adviser, the State Department, Pentagon, intelligence agencies and the Congress are all influential actors. The final advice to the president emerges through these filters.Extra-constitutional actors  like former vice president Dick Cheney during the Bush years or Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner in the present administration  can sometimes hijack the agenda. Summit-level assurances of high-technology transfers to India have often been nullified by inter-agency processes, Congressional stipulations or industrys reluctance to transfer technologies to potential competitors.This explains why advanced military technologies still do not figure in our growing defence cooperation. Then president George Bushs national security adviser Condoleezza Rice describes in her memoirs how the CIA influenced the inter-agency process in favour of Pakistan, overriding more accurate information from other agencies.These are the challenges our diplomats face in building on the Modi-Trump chemistry to further the bilateral agenda. The chemistry examination has been passed (with an A+); the politics and economics examinations may be tougher.(The writer, a former diplomat, is Convenor, National Security Advisory Board.

Lekin jab tak yahan BJD ki sarkar rahegi, tab tak sabka vikas sambhab nehin hai (the PM is committed to development of all. But there can't be development of all till BJD is in power.""""I have come here with all the good wishes. These good wishes will fully work when BJD government is thrown out of Odisha and a BJP government will come here. We need a government, and a CM, that is in sync with the PM. Then only there will be complete development,"" he said.Hitting out at Naveen on the Re-1 a kg rice scheme, often considered a vote earner for the BJD, Chouhan said for the Re 1 per kg rice, Modi government gives more than Rs 400 crore per month for that but often names of central schemes are changed for political benefits, he said.Stating that Modi has implemented welfare schemes for the poor across the country, Chouhan said the Centre is committed to houses for all by 2022. ""It is however a different matter that states having BJP governments are implementing the central schemes fast. And states not having BJP government, like there is BJD government here, they don't want faster implementation of the scheme. They fear, if these schemes are implemented, Modi will become more famous, BJP will excel and they will be left behind. That is why they never implement the schemes with sincerity,"" he said.In a counter to BJD's repeated allegations of central neglect, Chouhan said Odisha got Rs 36,000 crore central aid in 2014-15, Rs 40,000 crore in 2015-16, Rs 45000 crore in 2016-17 and Rs 52,000 crore in 2017-18, totalling Rs one lakh 75 thousand crore. UPA government never gave such big amounts, he said.The MP CM said despite liberal funding by the Centre, there is no improvement in the system in Odisha. Under Naveen government, power is scarce while no treatment is available at primary health centres.The BJD sharply reacted to Chouhan's comment. ""It's unfortunate that MCL money was spent to organise an event where CM of another state came here to criticise the incumbent here. It's wastage of public money and against principles of federalism. However, it won't have any impact on Naveen,"" said BJD spokesperson Samir Ranjan Dash."

""Political leaders know how to make promises but when it comes to fulfilling them, they disappear,"" Sonu, who passed the Class 10 board examinations this year, said.Taking a jibe at former chief minister Hemant Soren, the 16-year-old added, ""The JMM leader had visited us yesterday and made several promises. He told us he would send a party member later in the evening for some paper work. But no one turned up.""However, refuting the above allegations, JMM party vice-president Vinod Kumar told TOI that the family had already been supplied with foodgrains and had assured free education to the two children. ""We already sent them packets of rice and dal and will provide free education to their children,"" Kumar said.The vice-president also said that the party on Saturday decided to request the state government to waive of the loans of all farmers under the Kisan Credit Card KCC ) scheme.Sonu, on the other hand, also hit out at Ranchi district deputy commissioner Manoj Kumar who earlier said the farmer had brought a mobile phone before he committed suicide. ""So what if my father had brought a mobile phone? Every farmer owns one these days. The purchase of a Rs 1,400-mobile phone is not a sign of wealth. We face severe financial issues like most farmers,"" he said.However, BJP MLA Jitu Charan Ram stuck to police claims that the farmer did not take his life due to loan repayment. ""Baldeo had withdrawn Rs 20,000 after he got a loan on his KCC. How can the family claim they did not have money to buy food?"" He added, ""The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe is on and we are awaiting the post-mortem report. We will provide full help to the family.""Baldeo's wife Anita Devi claimed that the state government had already granted them some partial relief. ""The Raghubar Das government has given us nearly Rs 25,000 as of now and has promised to provide further assistance.""Saturday's bandh seemed to have little impact as several participants declared an early end to the protest on Friday. While few shops kept their shutters down for nearly an hour to avoid any trouble, they later resumed business after taking note of the little impact of the strike in the area.Meanwhile, few farmers in the village brushed aside reports of loan repayment as a major reason behind suicides. Instead, they claimed to be troubled by the lack of water supply to the agricultural fields and poor irrigation facilities.""There is an acute shortage of water in this village. The water level in rivers such as Jumar has gone down. It is the fear of a low or poor quality output that often that often leaves them worried,"" Rajesh Sahu, a farmer who owns one acre of land in the village, said.His father Mohan Sahu said, ""All the dobhas and the ponds have dried up. There are no proper tube wells too. We do not have water for even domestic use. Also, several farmers are not familiar with modern agricultural practices.""On the water grievances of the farmers, Ram said the project to dig tube wells close to every field has already been sanctioned by the government and work is under process to complete the same. ""Pithoria village is the driest zone and it is very difficult to dig wells there. The tender has been passed and work is under progress,"" he said."

The event which, was held here on Sunday, pointed out that writing-off loans would only be a temporary solution.The resolution said that the recently announced minimum support price of Rs 1,550 per quintal by the Union government for paddy would in no way match the hikes announced by various pay commissions for government employees. This apart, dearness allowance (DA) was also being increased by the government often.While elaborating on the necessity for minimum support price, the resolution alleged that, since 1970, while MSP for paddy has been hiked 29 times so far, the pay hike has been 120 to 150 times for government employees. If the MSP would have been increased on par with the salary of government employees, MSP would have been Rs 5,100 per quintal, it added. So, the resolution urged the government to fix Rs 5,100 as MSP for paddy per quintal.Another resolution urged farmers to grow traditional variety of paddy, as it would require only minimum water when compared to high-yielding varieties developed under the system of rice intensification. Demand for organic products have been increasing nowadays. Besides good returns, the health benefits it carry are also the main reason for growing organic products.Perumal, a progressive farmer from Alangudi village has developed his own method of paddy cultivation using minimum seed and has to spend less too. Since he had already proved his method to be fruitful, another resolution appealed the state government to extend its helping hand to Perumal to popularise it among other farmers across the state, so that all could benefit by adopting his technique.S Madumathi, commissioner, civil supplies and consumer protection department, gave away prizes to farmers who excelled in organic farming.

There, in the heart of the city, sandwiched between concrete structures is a piece of fertile land, all of 4 acres, flush with paddy. In fact, R Srinivasan has been carrying on his passion for agriculture for the last 40 years, a trait bequeathed to him by his father and grandfather.When most of the fertile lands was being converted into housing plots, he has been ploughing on over odds like shortage of water and labourers in the heart of the city. Despite the entire land - now Srinivasan Nagar  becoming residential, Srinivasan's family has been unwaveringly raising paddy.All the three sides of his land are engulfed by tall structures while on the northern side passes a black tarred road proceeding to Vayalur Murugan temple. Till 1975, his father G Ramachandran was looking after the lands. Srinivasan started to engage in agriculture at the age of 35. According to Srinivasan, his father had taken over the farming from his grandfather.""Since it is my passion, I have been engaging in agricultural activities 24 x 7. I am the third generation in my family looking after agriculture"", said Srinivasan. When the entire state is reeling under acute water shortage, he has raised Ponni rice as summer crop on four acres. Now the crop is in ripening stage. Within 20 days he is expecting to harvest.""Though paddy consumes more water, I can manage to raise two to three crop with the help of sewage water. As the farm land is lying low at least a feet compared to the surrounding areas, water flows into the land from three locations. Besides, there is a diesel motor to pump water"", he added. According to him, people never used water judiciously. That was the main reason for getting the required water in the form of sewage, he opined. Since the four acre land is located at a prime location, Srinivasan keeps getting calls from realtors and traders urging him to sell it. However, he has been unflinching in his commitment not to sell it.""I have never behaved like the owner of the land. I mingle with the labourers and join them in all works. Since I provide reasonable wages a large number of people come to me for work"", he said. Srinivasan says he gets 50 to 60 bags of rice per acre a year of which 25 bags were enough for his family for a year. So he sells his produce. ""I get immense satisfaction producing food for the people.

Among his three sons, one, S Ramesh , assists him in the fields while the other two are in business.

By the evening, task force officials of the civil supplies department raided the shop in Meerpet and seized samples which are now being examined. Meanwhile, rumours went viral on social media thatwas being sold on a large-scale at various stores in Andhra Pradesh triggering panic among the public.Meerpet police said Ashok, a resident of Nandanavanam colony, complained that for the last several days, he and his family members have been suffering from various health problems like stomach ache, pain in hands and legs. It was on Monday night that when Ashok returned home from work in the night, he found that the rice served to him by his wife was mashed and unedible.Rumours of plastic rice and the continuous flow of posts, videos and messages on social networking sites, particularly Facebook and WhatsApp, created panic on Tuesday in Andhra Pradesh too.Even as the reports are yet to be verified, officials in the state are taking no chances. The department of weights and measures (W&M) is planning to keep a tab on this novel method of rice adulteration by forming a special enforcement team.""We also came to know about plastic or fake rice through media and social networking sites. We have not received any instructions from our higher-ups so far on this issue, but locally I am sending four food inspectors to check rice with the main rice traders in Visakhapatnam,"" Srinivasa Rao, W&M assistant food controller, told TOI. Until then, he said, they had come across only cases of adulteration of red gram and other commodities.If any citizen lodges a complaint with the department, they would take it seriously, examine the facts and take action under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, Rao added. Rice traders, however, rule out the possibility of plastic rice in the port city. ""There is no sale of such plastic rice in the city. By God's grace, Andhra Pradesh does not have any rice shortage to leave space for fake or plastic rice,"" said K Bhima Rao, a rice trader."

So far, over 3.23 crore individuals were covered under the NFSA which is 99.09 per cent of the Centre's upper ceiling and 77.06 per cent of the 2011 census figure,"" Patro told reporters.The minister said even though a large number of applications seeking coverage under the NFSA are pending at district level, there is a limited scope for the state government to include them under the act.Justifying state's demand, there would be around 4 to 5 per cent increase in population of Odisha during last six years, which is evident from the trends of decadal growth rate from the census report. ""Accordingly, the projected population figure would be around 4.36 crore. If we take 78 per cent of the projected population growth figure, then the upper ceiling for the state should increase to 3.40 crore, which is less by around 14 lakh against the upper ceiling of 3.26 crore fixed by the Centre,"" Patro said.Keeping in mind the backwardness of the state having higher density of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe population, the minister said he has requested to increase the upper ceiling limit of beneficiaries.

Fishermen Nazar Thekintakathu, Husain Koya, Muhammed Basheer and Muhamed Iqbal are in a small fibre boat in the middle of the sea. There is no azan to be heard here, only the sounds of the sea, rains and thunder from far off. But the group get ready to break their day-long Ramzan fast.While Iqbal steers the boat to the West to say their prayers, the rest wash their hands and wet their legs in the sea, in preparation for the namaz. They start sharing the food they have bought from home, prepared by loved ones in the hope that their men will return with nets full of fish, by the next day's Iftar. And as the rest of the world enjoy Iftar, they too join in, in the boat, in the sea.Thousands of fishermen in Kerala observe Ramzan fast diligently, while going for fishing as usual in the sea. And as Eid nears, they spend more time in the sea for a better catch, so that they can gift new clothes and the best delicacies for their loved ones.With Eid just round corner, we catch up with some of these fishermen from Beypore, a sleepy port town in Kozhikode.Nazar and friends leave home after the Subahi namaz at 4.55 am in the outboard engine boat, carrying dates and water for the evening Iftar. It is a must for them to observe all 30 days' fast, which, they believe, gives them strength to face the unpredictable sea.""Rain or shine, we have to go to the sea everyday as it is our only source of income,"" he says. The fishermen keep a track of the Iftar Maghrib in the evening from the calendar. ""On some days it will be 6.52 pm and on others, 7 pm. As the sun comes down, no matter where we are, we do the Maghrib prayer and break the fast with dates and water,"" adds Muhamed Iqbal.Doing namaz in the middle of the sea might seem like a fantasy but for these fishermen who do it every year, it is not easy. ""Facing the West, towards the setting sun, is a must. Once we turn to the qiblah (towards Mecca), it doesn't matter whichever direction the boat turns, according to the waves and the wind,"" says Muhammed Basheer.The fishermen use two types of boats when the trawling ban is on  small boats, which carry four people and the big ones, which can accommodate forty. ""If we are planning to spend two to three days in the sea, we carry a stove and raw rice with us in the boat. And when it's Iftar time, we cook the rice and prepare fish curry with the fish we catch from the sea,"" says Nazar.And for those who set off in the bigger boat, Iftar is celebration time, with prayers, cooking and breaking the fast becoming a group activity, ""While it's true that we miss the homemade dishes prepared by our mothers and wives, the fish curry and rice we cook in the boat are also delicious, as it the result of our hope, faith and hard work,"" says Suhaib K. The big boats will also have two carrier boats attached, which are sometimes brought to the shore to bring the food. ""We work the hardest towards Eid. The bigger boats have roofs but for the smaller ones, we will have to take shelter under plastic sheets when it rains. Even the stove gets unusable at times in the rain,"" says Muhamed Iqbal, who has spent the past few weeks in the sea with his friends.Often, when there are heavy rains along with thunder and lightning, these fishermen lose track of directions.On such occasions, they don't get to return to the shore as planned, and will be left starving for days together. ""Even then, we would observe the fast and pray on time,"" says sexagenarian Abdul Razak, recollecting a Ramzan from years ago. ""A friend and I were stuck in the sea once, ten years back, during Ramzan. There was no sign of any boat or ship for nearly three days. But I did not miss even one day of fasting as I had kept a track of the time on my watch. The rice, dates and water which we had carried to break the fast saved us. I believe it was Allah who brought us back home.""The fishermen believe that nothing will go wrong for a believer who strictly follows the Ramzan fast. ""Once we leave the shore, it is Allah and the sea which decide our fate,"" adds Abdul Razak.59-year-old Abdul Nazar too has similar instances to relate and firmly believes that it's the power of fasting that has kept him alive for the past five decades. ""Once our boat got hit by waves and turned upside down. We were on our fast but I believe it's the will power we gained from the fast which helped us survive. We sat on top of the upside down boat, listening to the angry waves, staring at the darkness of the night, waiting for help. Finally after two nights, a fellow boatman saw us and we were rescued,"" he recalls.Husain Koya is 70 and cribs that his children no longer allow him to go to the sea. ""I have known the sea from the age of nine. Back then, we had wooden boats without engines. We had to exert a lot of physical energy to row the boat. But even during Ramzan, we used to go to the sea, tying big bags of pathiri and dry chicken in our boats as we were unsure when we would be returning to the shore. Those were the days of adventure and real faith,"" he murmurs, gazing at the sea, as the mild waves sweep over his feet."
5a048eac9855b76bf13bdcea,Look beyond waivers for Kisan 2.0: Agri policy must set market mechanisms free to work effectively,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/academic-interest/look-beyond-waivers-for-kisan-2-0-agri-policy-must-set-market-mechanisms-free-to-work-effectively/,2017-06-20,"When Lal Bahadur Shastri first shouted Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan at Delhis Ram Lila Maidan in 1965, he fleshed out a cardinal truth about Indias political imaginary: the idea of the brave soldier and the hardworking farmer as bulwarks of the nation. BJP, in the past three years, has adroitly managed to hook its political messaging to the martial constituency with its uncompromising nationalist rhetoric and chest-thumping machismo. The question is whether growing kisan unrest from Madhya Pradesh to Rajasthan will prove to be an unexpected political googly as we head towards 2019.After all, the imagery of the hard-pressed exploited farmer running the engines of the nation  deified from the beginning of the republic in films like Mother India and Do Bigha Zamin  remains an unshakeable shibboleth of the Indian political imagination. So, will the kisan agitations prove to be an effective political lever for a desperate opposition looking for evocative handles to block BJPs electoral juggernaut or will this crisis taper off?At the political level, BJP has, of course, been acutely focussed on the power of the farmer vote. Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly declared his governments intent to double farmers income by 2022 and BJPs 2014 manifesto promised to ensure a minimum of 50% profits over the costs of production in agriculture. Yet, at the policy level, it has been confounded by the fact that the toolkit that our governments have traditionally used for managing agriculture is outdated and faulty. It is essentially trying to fix the wrong questions with the wrong answers.The irony of MPs predicament is instructive. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan farcically went on a fast after his own police fired at farmers but agriculture is the one thing he has focussed consistently on since taking power in 2005. As the agricultural economist Ashok Gulati and his colleagues point out, the states agricultural GDP grew at a staggering 14.2% over the past five years and over thrice the national average over the last decade. This is unprecedented in the annals of Indias agricultural history. Even Punjab did not grow at this rate during the green revolution period.Yet, despite this, average earnings of agricultural households in MP continue to lag far behind the national average. This is basically because while farmers have been producing more, their input costs  water, diesel, fertilisers, etc  have increased substantially while prices for their products went down. A TOI analysis shows that between 2004-05 and 2014-15 in MP, the cost per hectare of fertilisers and seeds for wheat doubled while irrigation costs also increased substantially.This is of piece with the national agriculture story where after two years of drought, Indian farmers finally delivered a good crop for most commodities but saw their net margins going down  in many cases into the red. That greater farm production in 2016-17 would lead to a glut in the market, prices would collapse and farmer incomes would consequently go down is Economics 101. Yet, the problem is that most of our policies have been fixated on giving farmers a minimum support price (MSP) and not enough on creating conditions for market mechanisms to play out effectively.Government fixes MSP for 23 commodities but official procurement is limited to only two  wheat and rice  and that too in only a few states. It is estimated that over 90% of Indias farmers do not get the MSP price and are dependent on markets, which are circumscribed by arbitrary government over-regulation and the shortage of godowns and mandis.A good example of policy as a problem is the case of pulses farmers. After a bumper harvest, in February 2017, the India Pulses and Grain Association petitioned the Union commerce secretary to remove an old 2006 export ban since market prices in India had slipped below MSP. Tur dal was being sold at the time between Rs 35,000 and Rs 47,000 per tonne in MP, Karnataka and Maharashtra, against the MSP of Rs 50,500. Yet, inexplicably, the ban remains in place, along with limits on stocks, making it impossible for farmers to even recover their costs. Artificially choking the market and not letting it play out is a recipe for disaster.Second, farmer loan waivers only push the can further down the road. They dont solve the problem. After BJP came good on its UP loan waiver poll promise, Maharashtra caved in to a similar demand and Haryana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are all facing the same music. In Punjab, Congress came to power promising exactly this.States simply dont have the money for such largesse. The combined debt-to-state GDP ratio of all states taken together hit an alarming 3.6% in 2015-16, breaching the mandated 3% ceiling under fiscal prudence rules. It will go through the roof with new waivers. A similar waiver by UPA in 2008 had no discernible long-term impact on improving agriculture.As TV pictures of the kisan agitations show, the blue jeans and T-shirt clad farmers of 2017 are very different from the downtrodden peasants of our collective national imagination. They ask why only big corporates should get loan waivers. It is a fair question.Yet, instead of temporary sops each year, government must do a fundamental rethink and address this Kisan 2.0 with a new deal on market pricing and a comprehensive deregulation of policy instead of old mai-baap sarkar type solutions that are past their use-by date."
5a04908c9855b76bf13bdda1,"Mechanisation , a dream for Pokkali farmers?",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/jul/03/mechanisation--a-dream-for-pokkali-farmers-1623341.html,2017-07-03,"KOCHI: Introduction of latest technologies and good agriculture practices has revolutionised the traditional farming sector in Kerala. Over the years progressive farmers have been reaping the benefit of farm mechanisation. As a result of mechanisation there has been a reduction in production costs, helped overcome growing labour shortage, increased production and productivity.However, full swing mechanisation is still a distant dream for the traditional Pokkali paddy farming sector in the state. According to farmers, land preparation methods like ploughing or tiling are still being done manually since tractors or any other heavy machines cant be operated on soggy soil. The field can be tilled to some extent using light tiller machines. Also, the terrain, which is often criss crossed by small rivulets and marshy lands, is not conducive for mechanised tilling, say farmers.What the Pokkali farmers need is machinery that will help them to prepare and dismantle mounds as well as harvest the crop. A prototype of a floating harvesting machine, meant specifically for use in inundated Pokkali fields, was tested some years ago. But the project came a cropper. Farmers are still harvesting paddy using traditional methods which depend heavily on manual labour. Hence the demand for manual labourers increases during the Pokkali period in Ernakulam, Alappuzha and parts of Thrissur districts. Pokkali cultivation begins with the arrival of South West monsoon. The heavy rain flushes out the salt from the fields that had been lying fallow.Actor Salimkumar, who is also a Pokkali farmer, said, I have been cultivating Pokkali rice for the last 15 years in Ernakulam. The government should really help the farmers in regaining the lost glory of this style of farming. Unhappy about the nonchalant attitude of the government in promoting, the actor said, Man has taken a technological leap to the Moon, but in the case of mechanisation of Pokkali cultivation things still remain at the starting blocks. Successive governments have been making tall claims about taking steps to ensure the welfare of the Pokkali farmers.Francis Kalathungal, general convener, Pokkali Samrakashana Samithi, said, Since the crop does not need fertilisers or pesticides. The Pokkali crop can be cultivated more effectively than any other rice varieties in the region. But, mechanisation and strong government support is required to save the GI tagged rice variety from extinction, he said.The government had introduced a scheme One paddy, one rice, with an aim to promote organic cultivation of paddy and aquaculture (growing paddy and farming fish alternately in the same crop year). The scheme would have ensured protection of wetland ecosystem and also paved way for a cleaner environment. But a section of farmers in connivance with the fisheries lobbies campaigned to discourage Pokkali farming. They were in favour of doing aquaculture round the year since it was more beneficial.According to Francis, if the government can effectively address these issues, Pokkali has the potential to revolutionise the saline rice production system of Kerala.The agriculture department statistics show that there are around 4,055 ha of Pokkali field available for farming in Ernakulam district alone. However, the area under cultivation in Ernakulam is less than 500 ha. This amounts to the largest area under Pokkali cultivation in the state. K S Shylaraj, professor and head, Rice Research Station of the Kerala Agricultural University, Vyttila, said the state had about 26,500 hectares of fields under Pokkali cultivation a couple of decades ago. It has today got reduced to less than 6,000 hectares.The state government should give production-based incentives to farmers to check the nefarious interests of the fishing lobbies and a section of farmers. If only the area under Pokkali cultivation could be raised like the paddy farming revolution happening in other parts of the state, she said.Ernakulam District Collector K Mohammed Y Safirulla had recently announced the area under cultivation in Ernakulam will be increased to 1,000 ha this year and then to 2,000 ha by the next year. A project proposal worth Rs 29 crore, which aims to take up infrastructural development in the region in order to make farming reliable and convenient, has been submitted to Pokkali Land Development Agency."

Found six months ago in the bylanes of Durgapur, a baby girl and boy have been brought up by nurses of Durgapur hospital ever since police handed them over to the hospital.On Friday, the nurses  who've by now developed a strong bond with the two babies  went through the tradition of feeding them their first spoonfulls of rice during an annaprashan ceremony organised by the hospital. At the end of their six-month stay in hospital, the babies will be handed over to Childline on Saturday.Annaprashan is a Sanskrit word which literally means ""grain initiation"", when babies feed of rice. It is variously referred to as mukhebhaat in Bengali, choroonu in Kerala and bhaatkhulai in the Garhwal hills.Durgapur subdivisional hospital superintendent Debabrata Das said, ""Six months ago, police brought a male and a female baby to us with severe malnourishment. We nursed them back to health after admitting them to our neonatal care unit. Now, both babies are fit but no one came forward to claim them.

It also has an incremental effect on farming with lesser number of farmers opting to cultivate these varieties leading to environmental ramifications.To conserve the rich biodiversity of food grains and vegetables of the state, the Madhya Pradesh State Biodiversity Board in collaboration with agriculture department has launched a "" Madhya Pradesh Beej Bachao: Krishi Bachao Yatra"" from May 2 to June 27. The 55-day 'yatra' set to cover 35 districts will culminate in Bhopal after which a conservation plan will be finalized.MP is agriculturally well endowed state with production of wheat, paddy, soyabean as well as coarse grains like kodu, kutki among others. A survey in 1980 by R K Richharia, eminent rice scientist, stated the state had 23,800 species of paddy. The same survey stated that the paddy species in Seoni district numbered at 570. However, another survey by the MP forest department in 2003 found out that only 110 species of paddy were left remaining in Seoni district. In a matter of 23 years, 460 species  81 %  had vanished.""The Beej Yatra is an attempt to survey the traditional species still present in the state, to identify those cultivating them and to spread awareness about the need to conserve indigenous species.

The group A districts are those where the traditional species are still grown like Mandla, Dindori, Anoopur, Seoni, the group B covers those districts where even though less the farming of traditional species is yet to die down like Satna, Rewa, Panna, Sheopur,"" added Murthy.Six resource persons  Babulal Dahiya, Jagdish Rawat, Shailesh Singh, Ram Lotan Kushwaha, Anil Karn, Neelesh Kapoor  are covering the distance in order to survey the indigenous species of foodgrains and vegetables.Babulal Dahiya of Pithorabad village of Satna district has been involved in conserving and developing around 100 odd indigenous species of paddy for a decade now. Dahiya says this attempt is not only to save the traditional species of the state but also the dying rivers  thereby conserving the biological diversity.""All the rivers in the state are rain-fed. The agriculture of MP was largely dependent on monsoon. The high-yielding variety (HYV) of seeds needs a robust irrigation system and chemical fertilizers to sustain them. Indigenous species over the years have adapted themselves to the soil and monsoon pattern of the state and therefore need less maintenance as compared to the HYV seeds.""""In addition, the chemical constituents of the soil must be altered as per the seed variety, harming the natural composition of the soil.""We have found 70-80 species of paddy which if not conserved will soon vanish.

Only 60 per cent of custom-milled rice of last kharif season has been supplied to the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department so far.The Civil Supply wing of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department had procured 16 lakh quintals of paddy from farmers of the district in last kharif season through Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACs) and supplied it to 100 millers for custom milling. Around 11 lakh quintals of milled rice have to be delivered to the department by September this year but so far, only six lakh quintals have been delivered and another two lakh quintals are lying at milling units to be supplied to the department.Sources said delivery of milled rice has been delayed due to lack of storage space at the rice receiving centres from where, the stocks would be sent to the department for distribution under PDS.Koraput district has only three rice receiving centres in Koraput and Jeypore sub-divisions, which have the capacity to store only 1.76 lakh quintals rice each. Currently, the centres do not have any space to stock more rice as a result of which, collection of milled rice has been stopped. Custom millers, who have already completed milling, are running from pillar to post to submit their rice quota. Apparently, if the millers do not submit their rice quota on time, they would be debarred from participating in the milling process in the next season.In the past, the district civic supply officials had requested the Civil Supply Department to create more space at the existing rice receiving centres, but that has not happened so far. There was also a proposal to open rice receiving centres of five lakh quintal capacity in every block of the district, but that too has been put in cold storage. Millers fear that the milled rice would be damaged if the stock continues to be dumped in milling units for long.On Thursday, members of Koraput Millers Association urged the District Civil Supply Officer to sort out the space problem and extend the time limit for delivery of rice under custom milling system from September to December.District Civil Supply Officer Balava Chandra Dash said he has informed the higher officials of the department about space constraint at rice receiving centres and slow pace of rice delivery. The officer said he has suggested that milled rice be stored at godowns in neighbouring districts of Malkangiri and Nabarangpur.Meanwhile, procurement of rabi paddy has already started and so far, five lakh quintals have been purchased from farmers.16 lakh quintals of paddy procuredBhawanipatna: PADDY procurement in Kalahandi district was completed on Thursday with 16,58,000 quintals of paddy being procured from farmers. Rabi paddy was procured from 18,260 farmers through 70 paddy purchasing centres of 43 agriculture cooperative societies. As many as 60 custom millers were engaged to lift paddy from the purchasing centres. This year, procurement started late due to delay in harvesting. As water for irrigation from Indravati project was released late, it delayed harvesting. Although it was targeted to start procurement from May 10, the process started on May 25. Agitation by custom millers further added to the problem. Collector Anjan Kumar Manik said there needs to be better coordination between officials of agriculture and irrigation to ensure early release of water from Indravati."

Thousands of traders in Mysuru city have already enrolled under the GST network. A few have also decided to slow down their businesses until they get used to the new system. Some of them are eager to clear old stocks while others have taken it in their stride and have decided to wait and watch.Shopkeeper A E Louis, who deals with vessels, also the treasurer of Mandya District Chamber of Commerce and Industries, told DH that, If the invoice is raised by implementing GST, the prices will overshoot the maximum retail price (MRP). If the product is sold above the MRP, it is an offence and no customer is ready to pay more. Hence, the traders are confused. Who will bear the loss incurred from selling old stock?Pharma companiesPharma companies, meanwhile, have acceded to bear the expected loss of 5% post GST. This has come as a relief for druggists. K Prabhakar of Lakshmi Drug Agencies, Mandya, said that, Post GST, the price of various products may come down but if it turns out to be otherwise, it would surely cause losses to the traders. I do not have too many old medicines and will replenish stocks only after the implementation of GST, he said.Farmers sparedThe GST will have an impact only on major crops as others come under zero taxation. Sugarcane, coconut, paddy and ragi are the major crops of the district and all fall under zero taxation. It will not affect the farmers as they do not come under the GST network and thus will be spared of the confusion of the new taxation system. GST will, however, be applicable if their produce comes under commercial crop category.For instance, if they sell jaggery in retail, it does not invite tax, but if the same product is branded, it comes under GST purview. Normal coconut oil is not taxed but branded products invite taxes. However, farmers have no clue about the effects of GST on them. They are concerned only if their crops fetch a good price, said Raitha Sangha district president Shambunahalli Suresh.Rice to cost moreS C Basavaraj of Basaveshwara Agro Rice Industries said that procurement and sale of paddy does not come under GST. Rice invites 5% GST only if it is packaged and sold under a brand name. The price of rice may increase by Rs 5 per kg, he said."

Kumaraswamy said that if the state government, led by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, had fulfilled all the promises that figured in the Congress party manifesto in 2013, no farmer would have resorted to committing suicide. Kumaraswamys tirade was in context with Siddaramaiahs claims that out of 165 promises, the government had fulfilled 155.All the programmes of Siddaramaiah are bogus. Even Anna Bhagya scheme is old. It was introduced during the tenure of Ramakrishna Hegde as chief minister. Back then, rice was given at Rs 2 per kg and now it is being given for free. The scheme is not the state governments brainchild as the Union government has a big share in it, he said.When the reporters asked about a civic worker in Chamundi Hill Grama Panchayat being forced to get into a manhole to clean it , Kumaraswamy said, the issue was discussed in the Assembly session. There are lapses on the part of the government. If the government had provided the required equipment, why would the civic worker be forced to perform such work, he sought to know.Farm loans not waivedKumaraswamy said that Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra state governments have merely announced farm loan waivers but they have not actually waived them. The Union government has not provided funds to the governments to waive the loans. Instead of waiting for the Unions move to waive off farm loans, Siddaramaiah should announce the states decision. The Union and state governments are neglecting the farmers and the people, he said.Compensation of Re 1Kumaraswamy sought clarification from the government for issuing a cheque for Re 1 to the farmers as drought compensation under National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF).To tarnish JD(S) imageWith regard to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probe against Kumaraswamy for his alleged involvement in permitting illegal mining of iron ore by taking a kickback of Rs 150 crore, he said, The Supreme Court had quashed the case 11 years ago but the state government, led by the Congress and BJP leaders, are trying to tarnish my image.He asked former minister and BJP leader Janardhana Reddy, who had said that he would provide the documents, to contact Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to prepare fake documents. Siddaramaiah would help Reddy through the police for preparing the documents, Kumaraswamy said.In reply to a query about JD(S) partys stand on Presidential elections, he said, the party will take a stand on the basis of the decision taken by the Opposition parties."

Delhi police commissioner Amulya Patnaik said that based at different locations earlier, Delhi Police has now brought 35 Labrador Retrievers to a kennel in Pushp Vihar so that they can be deployed quickly in case of emergencies.Aged between three and 18 months, these canines have undergone preliminary training with the Indian Army. Further training will be given by Delhi Police.Their new state-of-the-art home in south Delhi is air-conditioned, has dog-friendly furniture and a pantry stocked with their daily meals. ""The dogs are very particular about their timings. They wake up along with the handlers early in the morning and go for drills without fail,"" said a police officer.The canines were procured from the Army last year as Delhi Police's existing squad of 30 is nearing retirement. ""Of the 25 dogs shifted here from 10 other dog homes, four are trained in tracking criminals, 15 in detecting explosives and 6 in sniffing out narcotics,"" said Rajan Bhagat, DCP (Crime Records Officer).An expert in detecting explosives, Kelly was seen lazing around and inspecting the newly-constructed Crime Branch building alongside the kennel. His handler said that he is one of the most enthusiastic dogs in the squad.""Koris knows that it's time to start work as soon as I put his harness on him. He wakes up before me for the drill,"" said his handler constable Dinesh Kumar.With 70 dogs in the force, Delhi Police may soon get another 100 as a proposal to procure them has already been made. During Commonwealth Games 2010, dog sentinels were deployed in all districts. ""At first, the newly-recruited dogs are trained to sniff and track. Later, some are trained for detecting explosives,"" said an officer.Each dog goes through a rigorous drill to memorise a particular smell and track it down within minutes. Their handlers make them follow a strict diet regime so that they are in top shape. ""The animals are usually given meat and rice twice a day. Currently they are on summer vacation and will only be deployed in case of heinous crimes,"" said Madhur Verma, Delhi Police PRO."
