Contractual farmers will have to pay GST,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/tax-on-agriculture-income-contractual-farmers-will-have-to-pay-gst/articleshow/59119396.cms,2017-06-12,"CHANDIGARH: Even as different sectors are still trying to comprehend the impact of goods and services tax ( GST ) regime, certain clauses of the new system could hit the agriculture sector in Punjab as it will make income from renting of farm land taxable.Member of indirect tax committee of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) and an expert on GST Keshav R Garg pointed out that only the person who cultivates the land for personal consumption or sale would be exempt from GST. Any other income like leasing of agricultural land or contract farming would become taxable under GST.""Tax on renting of agricultural land would be a big blow because once it is taxed under GST, it might also come under the income tax net. Farmer leasing out his land would be liable to pay GST at the rate of 18%. He would also need to take registration under new tax regime, and file 37 returns annually,"" he said.Reacting to the move, national president of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Bhupinder Singh Mann said the move would badly hit a sizeable chunk of farmers in the state. ""With landholdings becoming smaller in Punjab, farming is becoming unviable. In such a scenario, farmers are forced to lease out their land while they take up other vocations. It would be unfair to tax them. A farmer who has 2-3 acre of land has no option but lease the land out,"" the ex-MP said.Besides, under the GST, where the farmer sells the pulses and cereals in open, no GST would be charged but where he sells them under a brand name, he shall be charged GST at 5%.This would discourage the cultivator of land to promote his brand name. Where the exempted goods like rice and wheat are supplied as part of the mixed supply, they would attract the highest rate of the commodity in the mixed supply. Government should exempt these commodities irrespective of the mode by which they are sold, he said.Meanwhile Congress leader Gurpartap Singh Mann added that the Centre should not include mindless clauses in the GST system that could further dent the income of the agriculture sector in a state like Punjab which is agricultarally rich. ""Already there have been anti-farmer statements from members of the NITI Aayog that reflect on the mindset of the BJP government,"" he said categorically."

She became popular as a contestant from season six of MasterChef Australia, and is now a restaurateur who is focused on ethical food. Sarah was in Chennai last weekend, and spoke to us on how she discovered her passion, the emotional aspect of food, hosting cricketer Yuvraj Singh 's wedding party, her love for dosa and more...During her entire modelling career, for 10 years, Sarah says she kept trying different things because she knew that while she was lucky to have become a model, it actually wasn't her passion. Nothing ever stuck, until she started cooking. ""I just fell in love with it,"" she gushes.And it was because of her son that she started taking cooking seriously. ""I used to cook earlier, but I was a quick cook. I'd cook healthy food, but it'd be quite plain. And when I started feeding my son those, he would just spit them out. I realised that in addition to being nutritious, food has to be flavoursome because kids do not lie when it comes to food. So, I had to experiment, and started cooking different types of dishes. I realised that there is more to food than just fuelling your body,"" she recalls.She became obsessed with cooking and went to Le Cordon Bleu, where she'd be studying how to cook, and after coming home, in the evenings, she'd be watching cooking shows and taking notes and writing recipes. She knew then that she had found her passion. And once she got into MasterChef, she completely quit modelling. ""I said to myself that I'm going to give it a year and try and make food my career; if I can, I'll continue with it, and if not, I'd just go back to modelling. Now, here I'm, in India, cooking and running a restaurant,"" she says.The confidence that she gained was crucial in her pursuing cooking, she says. ""Especially, when we used to do the mystery boxes, we had to become creative and think on our feet. For instance, when one is cooking at home, you research a recipe, see what all you need and make that dish following the recipe. Whereas, while cooking from the mystery box, you would lift off the lid to find just some ingredients. You have no recipes and have to make something up, on the spot. Now, I can go into any of your houses, open your fridge  it would be like a mystery box to me  and make a dish,"" she says.But is it possible for people at home to plate their food just like how fancily the food is presented on the show? And does it even matter? ""Of course,"" feels Sarah, and adds, ""I believe we eat with our eyes first. So, no matter what dish I'm cooking at home, I'll make an effort to make it look nice. I won't just slap it into a bowl; I'd, maybe put some fresh herbs or plate it nicely. In Le Cordon Bleu, we were scolded every day. Say if you were using your chopping board to chop some herbs, you'd have to wipe it clean before you moved on to the next thing. That way, when I'm cooking, I'm finishing every step, and can start again quick, if I need something else. If you put a little bit of thought into the whole process, it shows in the final dish. And you are savouring the dish with your eyes. The first thing you see is the dish. If the same dish is plated sloppily and somewhat nicer on another plate, you are going to pick the latter. It's just a natural reaction. I like food to look nice and look like you have put effort into it as well.""Food is also emotional, she thinks. ""A dish could taste horrible, but if it reminds you of your childhood, say a dish that your mom cooked for you when you were down with cold and which made you feel warm and cosy, you would love it. So, if you can create emotions with your dishes, that's what counts. It might sound kind of stupid and crazy, I know, but if you do put more love into a dish, you can taste it,"" she says.Sarah decided to come to India after she got 50,000 followers on her Facebook page almost overnight when she was on MasterChef. ""I was like, 'Is that spam?' To just see if there are as many fans for the show in India, I flew over here. All along, people were recognising me  on the plane, at the airport once I got off the plane. I thought, 'Oh my God! It's real. People are indeed watching the show here,'"" she says.She already loved Indian cuisine, as her son is half-Indian, and had learnt to make some Indian dishes. And at a cooking demonstration, a couple invited her to Old Delhi. She describes the place as ""chaos"". ""You wouldn't go there unless it's for a special reason. The day we went there happened to be a holiday, so there was three days' worth of people there. You couldn't walk past without brushing another person. It was people's jam! But I was loving it. Everyone was really welcoming me, and I fell in love with this country straightaway,"" she says.Sarah chose to have her restaurant in Goa because it is tropical, like northern Queensland where she hails from. ""Goa has the same kind of climate, lots of beaches, lots of seafood. I love the water, having grown up near the beach, so Goa was amazing to me. And this property, in particular, made me go 'Whoa!' It was the ultimate place to have a restaurant, with the beach and hills,"" says the chef, who decides on everything  menu, interiors, staffing, and also cooks there.Her restaurant hosted cricketer Yuvraj Singh's pre-wedding party and she calls it a bit intimidating, but fun. ""It was five days of celebration. They flew in on their jets and came straight to our place from their previous party. We had a beautiful event and they absolutely loved it, and had a lot of seafood. It was amazing,"" she says.This is her second trip to Chennai. She had come here earlier this January, and stayed for a few days. ""So, yeah, I've seen a little bit and eaten a lot of food here,"" she quips. During that time, she had went to the Kapaleeswarar temple. ""It's really beautiful, with a lot of colour. And I went to a little store (Kalathi News Mart) down the temple street, and had rose milk there. I also went to the restaurant (Karpagambal Mess) that is a couple of doors away, with hopscotch colours on its floor. I had south Indian food served on the banana leaf.""She says she loves south Indian food because it's very different. ""My son's grandparents are from Punjab and the food here is unlike the food in the north. This time, I had lunch at the Dakshin restaurant and the food was amazing. I had the thali, and I tried everything on it. I found the banana fritter-type food, made using raw banana, amazing. It was quite strange to taste banana as a savoury. And the vegetable kurma was also very good. And dosa is my favourite food. Every time I come to India, on my first day, I have to eat dosa. If I don't, I feel like I haven't entered India,"" she says.It was in Mumbai that she had the dosa for the first time, and it was love at first sight. ""It was long ago and I instantly fell in love with it. The flavour was different from anything I had tasted before. I love having rice-based dishes, and the dosa is rice and lentils, so I found it amazing,"" she recollects. She says she had tried to make it in Australia, but couldn't then because the weather was not hot enough to ferment the batter. ""I'm actually contemplating sneaking in a bag of batter from here to Australia with me,"" she laughs.India, she thinks, is the number one place for showcasing the new trend in food  the produce. ""In this country, I find that every cuisine in a city or a region or a state is built around the ingredients produced in that area and that is how everyone has started to look at food today,"" she signs off."

5a04a43d9855b76bf13be4b6,Freebie culture rocks Tamil Nadu’s financial boat,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/freebie-culture-rocks-tamil-nadus-financial-boat/articleshow/59327699.cms,2017-06-26,"CHENNAI: The freebie culture in Tamil Nadu that has become the mainstay of Dravidian politics is pushing the state downhill on the fiscal front.Even as TN increases its social sector spend to a whopping Rs 78,100 crore, its outstanding liabilities has touched Rs 2.56 lakh crore as per data with the Reserve Bank of India.Also, the state's social sector expenditure is nearly double that of its capex (capital expenditure) at Rs 33,800 crore in 2016-17. From the 2006 elections to 2011 and to 2016, both AIADMK DMK have been competing with each other to offer colour TVs, mixies, cash doles, gas stoves, free land, rice at Rs 2/kg or free cycles, sarees, dhotis  the list is endless.""The curse of the freebie culture started in 2006, when DMK chief M Karunanidhi announced free colour TV sets and rice. It was for the AIADMK head J Jayalalithaa to follow suit. In a competitive spirit, she announced a slew of freebies in 2011 and came to power. And the same culture continued in 2016, bleeding the state of its resources. TN is a highly productive, competitive state and it is a crying shame we are in this situation,"" says S Gurumurthy, political commentator and editor of Thuglak.The government can defend itself by saying that its social sector expenditure was not going towards freebies, but towards health, education, roads and literacy.But does that argument hold water? RBI data shows that Tamil Nadu instead of improving on vital social indices is actually pushing the state down.Tamil Nadu is at 16th position nationwide when it comes to literacy with a 80.09% literacy rate. It is much behind Maharashtra, Manipur, Chandigarh, Puducherry, Delhi, Goa, Kerala, Nagaland and Tripura. Of course, there is always a high base in TN and the rate of increase in literacy rates may be slower.With a poverty rate of 21.2%, the state also has a high number of poor people. As many as 1.2 crore people of TN's total population of 6.78 crore are poverty-stricken. TN has the 7th highest population of BPL families in the country.This shows that the freebie culture, which is pushing up the debt ceiling of Tamil Nadu is also reallocating money away from real needs.The state's current outstanding liabilities stand at Rs 2.56 lakh crore in 2016-17; up by 18% from 2015-16 and 67% from five years ago.The state also has the notoriety of being the fourth most debt-ridden state in India after Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and West Bengal. TN's current reserve fund of Rs 1,920 crore is not necessarily confidence inspiring given the extent of its liabilities, RBI data said.""We have always been at third place in terms of revenue generation in India. Our GDP has been high, as has been our production and industrial capabilities. For instance because we have a diversified industrial workforce  automotive, engineering, chemicals, plastics, garments  we have been able to weather downturns in the domestic and international economy. We were delivering steady growth of 7% to 12% for the past 20 years. Our real problem comes from mismanagement of state finance,"" says P Ravichandran, chairman, southern region, industry body CII."
5a04a53c9855b76bf13be519,As you sow…,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Masquerader/as-you-sow/,2017-06-11,"The inventory begins-in agriculture, as in life! Peeling-off the political peels, there lies a core to the matter, which serially has the following aspects.Is farming the riskiest profession in this country, leading to so many suicides? Is a farmers income stability the same or even comparable to that of the wholesaler, retailer or consumer? Why does he have to take a heap of loans, and still continue to top-up? Why does the hand that tills the soil still considered synonymous with poverty? Are MSPs (minimal support prices) calculated on say, 25% above the costs, as retail elsewhere is protected by MRPs? All politicians being farmers (80% truly, the remaining by possession of land), enjoy tax exemptions, and earn their salaries, seem to have the cake and take it too! Can they help filling the loan kitty by paying taxes on their huge farm incomes?Finally, like so many professions, why does the farmer prefer his sons to settle in jobs in cities to plough-in the same profession?Some answers are obvious. Others may be linked to the frailty of human nature. The glaring blunder that one sees is that quite like the Imperial policy. Independent India found it easier to continue to enforce a camouflaged negative input policy (lagaan) on the farmer (In WTO parlance, it was once remarked that Indian agriculture was working on a negative subsidy). After consuming his voting powers, he was to be kept ignorant and disconnected so as not to be able to negotiate his grains in his market-linked product.Misinformation was to make him kneel down before his self -chosen ministers and beg for financial assistance so that he could he could replace himself as the second bull to till the soil once again.He was unaware of one crucial rightthat since he was the owner of the product, he had a right to negotiate for prices with his government, and that would also include international markets. I am not ruling out the democratic process of negotiations. No system was worked out. Our tanned sinewy brothers began to be seen hanging from trees, or slain by pesticides bought from loans, which was actually their own money, perpetually and systematically picked from his pockets. Cant blame anyone in particular, for we have had two farmer Prime Ministers (Ch. Charan Singh, Shri Dewe Gowda). I may vindicate the premise further. Why is loan waiver to the farmer a winning proposition for any political party, and has been tried by every political party!The book of politics is the same. Only editions vary.I had the honour of treating Indias first agronomist, Shri Sharad Joshi, the founder of the Shetkaari Sangathana in Vidarbha.Being a Rajya Sabha member, and for a while a WTO negotiator at that time, he would drop in casually, and often invite me to dinner at the India International Centre.On a particular day, he asked me how much a movie ticket cost twenty years ago. It was reasonable to guess, Rs. 20-25.At the time of the conversation, a PVR ticket was around Rs 500. Regarding onion, and tomato prices, I agreed they must have been around 10-15 then, and 15-25 now.He brought out his point that though the cinema gained 200 times in value (market links not denied), the man who grew the potato, at the most doubled his cost. This yawning gap was not sustainable once the markets get linked (invariably), nationally and internationally. This was the crux he told me.On the other hand, he added, it was not feasible that rice and pulses be sold at Rs. 100-200/kg.and in between lay the unpredictable and meandering river of politics! Sure enough, two months later, Mr Joshi dropped in for a chat, and told me that a politician had relieved him of his WTO duties. Neither he nor I was surprised. I had also begun to realize that even in medicine, mediocrity fetches the bulk.In Darwins quote, survival of the fittest, the word fittest perhaps denotes adaptability of a fox more than it denotes the strength of the lion, or the structure of the dinosaur.A wise government would like to take an opportunity in reforming the system.In its basics, the matter is of production of that which feeds the nation, as well contributes the largest chunk to the national economy, and the prices it should fetch in the market, so that the production is lucrative enough for people to invest and put efforts in this production.The answer lies in all the nitty-gritty that farming is about. Not to deny that government units may be working on it, the seed production units at much less subsidies, can increase yields many folds, for a component that grows naturally.Before one talks of outcomes, investments have to be made in infrastructure. Irrigation schemes, river linking have to pick up priority, much like that for industrial growth.I believe much information is being provided on fertilizers and indigenous soil additives as compost. They need to be capitalized on. I believe with better electricity farmers co-operative mini compost plants would be seen more frequently on the landscape.There is a case of hybrid seeds for certain crops, where there is enough evidence that there are no long- term effects on health. The damage done by pesticides should not be forgotten.Loaning to farmers at lesser rates has a limitation, and as other benefits as MNREGA, should be specific and should have checks that money is transferred, and that it is utilized for an agreed purpose.Finally, what the farmer requires are good fund managers. Money earned during a bumper crop is likely to flow to liquor barrels. It may be sagaciously invested for a rainy day or a non-rainy year.Advance advice on crop suitability worked on basis of demand or congestion of forward delivery chains nationally, and internationally is extremely crucial. Such knowledge is on the back of the palms of the commodity market players, as well as the government. Such information should be part of the fund manager and advisory units that should have every farmer enrolled in his area, and advice be given in one to one encounters. It is heartening to see a few apps by some Bangalore-based companies provide all such information to the farmers.Lastly, comes the question of the government allowing private participation in certain sectors in farming, exports, to make the outcomes comparable, publishable, replicable, and without intending much-reliable!Just heard the Chief Minister broke his fast on the second day. No further changes in the compost policy have been announced!Blog-breaking news! Maharashtra has just announced a loan waiver! Brave! Bharat and India are learning not to cheat on each other!Main chhahta bhi yahi tha, wo bewafa nikley,Usey samajhney ka koi to silsila nikaley(Maybe I wanted her to expose her disloyalty,Perhaps that was the only way to understand the affair)"

So, would that make families to make healthier choices at the supermarket?Cited as the ""single largest taxation reform"" in independent India, from real estate toto consumer durables to branded goods to luxury items.For a middle class family that earns between Rs 50,000-Rs 80,000 a month, the impact on the monthly budget will not be more than a few hundred rupees. For those earning in the Rs 1.75 lakh bracket, the purchase of luxury items and SUVs or sedans will not necessarily result in an increase of more than 2-4%.While this is a rough estimate, individual likes and preferences might hold more weight as to which way the household budget might swing.""For instance, ghee and tea are taxed higher. Now, if your budget includes substantial quantities of ghee, then you are likely to feel the pinch. It is still early though  it has not been made law. And many items have seen exemptions,"" says M R Venkatesh, a Chennai-based chartered accountant.Among the list of items getting cheaper are chicken, oil, butter and bhujia (snack), while purchase of tea, coffee, masala powders, curd, cheese, biscuits, chewing gum, chocolate and ice-cream will be 1-5% more expensive.At the top of the chart with the highest taxation increase are items like paneer, sweets and cornflakes. Tobacco,and petroleum continue to be exempted, allowing the state government to dictate rates.""Instead of increasing the cost of alcohol, they have increased the cost of side-dishes,"" says B Kannan, a tax consultant.One major area of change for consumers could be big-ticket purchases like homes, cars and consumer durables.With service tax increasing to 18% from 15% all services will become dearer. Loans will get more expensive. Purchase of health,will also get more expensive.""Service tax rates were increased earlier too, but we didn't see any change in consumer buying pattern over more than a decade. Impact on policies for the common man will be at a minimum. For instance in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a 3% increase in taxation will hardly result in a few paise increase,"" says Tapan Singhel, CEO, Bajaj Allianz."

The organization is also engaged in distribution of kits comprising wheat, oil, rice and other essentials to the needy. Total of 600 families have received the kit in areas such as Mankapur, Jaffer Nagar Ring Road and Taj Nagar. A part of the collected money is circulated to the Maharashtra as well as Delhi branches, informs Zeba Khan, member of the ladies wing of Jamaat-e-Islaami Hind.Individually, Ghazi has also donated cash and food grains to relatives and acquaintances. ""My focus is also to help those who want to set up a small business,"" he says, adding that he has helped nearly 15 homes so far in areas such as Jaffer Nagar and Ahbab Colony based on each family's financial conditions.

Shoeb Khan, an entrepreneur who runs the NGO Help Mate, helped an ailing patient with hospital fees and a widow with the groceries.Along with charity work, Zakat is obligatory on all Muslims, who are Sahib-e-Nisab, or those who possess a specified limit of wealth, to pay each year a prescribed portion from capital or savings like farm produce, cattle, business activities, paper currency and precious metals to the needy.Khwaja Izhar Ahmed, associate professor, Anjuman College of Engineering shares that it is compulsory for Muslims who own a specific amount of jewellery or cash to park 2.5 per cent of its value for the needy. Some even donate clothes directly to individuals or through organizations. In a broader sense, it is believed that it causes circulation of wealth, which results in its multiplication and benefits more and more people.A day before Eid, it is also mandatory for Muslims to contribute Fitra , which is 2kg wheat per person in the family to the poor. But nowadays, Ahmed says, people donate money equivalent to the total amount of wheat required to be donated."

It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil. There's no mechanism in place to curb this menace,"" said Dr B Sesikiran, director of NSI ""While the food regulator has to monitor, check and penalize people who adulterate food, nothing moves on the ground. Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."

The issue was also raised by deputy speaker Pollachi Jayaraman and DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu.""Enroute to Alagar Koil, there are reserve forests and several devotees come to the temple each day. They feed the monkeys with fruits, puffed rice and coconut. When monkeys don't get the food, they go in search of it by entering houses in nearby villages and ransacking them,"" said Selvam.

Perhaps it does.Like a problem child, Kashmir  or at least some elements in Kashmir  want to put their metaphorical hands in the fire by seceding from India and joining Pakistan.Such people  who are a minority in the state, but a highly aggressive and conspicuous minority  has compelled India to try to curb their stone-pelting and other agitational activities by deploying Armed forces against them. In the process, many lives have been lost, a stigma for Indias democratic polity.But what if India  like the mother in the story of the child and fire  was to allow this small but strident minority to have its way?If Kashmir was, in fact, to join Pakistan, what would happen?Over the years, Kashmir has received huge subsidies from India, from heavily subsidised rice to other benefits like government jobs and grants.The robust Indian economy can afford this. Pakistans economy is a basket case.Very soon, Islamabad could find that by taking Kashmir within its fold, it has taken on much more than it can afford.The very same stone-pelters of today would turn against Islamabad, and become another thorn in the side of Pakistan, as Balochistan and Sindh already are.The tables could well turn and the anti-Indian protestors may well want to secede from bankrupt Pakistan and rejoin an indulgent India.From being the Line of Control, the LoC would become the Line of Consent.Wont happen, of course. But just imagine if it did. Imagine what would happen if Kashmir was allowed to experience its own agni pareeksha, its own ordeal by fire."

Two successive seasons have been so bad in terms of rice production that AP millers and traders are now procuring paddy and rice from the neighbouring state to market demand.Though the millers claim that a major portion of paddy grown in Andhra Pradesh is exported due to its high quality, local traders and farmers talk about pitiable rice production that has led to this dependence on Telangana. This is mostly because the cultivable area in Telangana has increased considerably during the last rabi season, while it has alarmingly gone down in Andhra Pradesh. The farmers in Telangana have cultivated paddy in 8.65 lakh ha this time against their average area of 5.33 lakh ha. In Andhra Pradesh, the cultivable area has gone down to 5.67 lakh ha from 8 lakh ha. In the last season, Telangana had produced 60 lakh tonnes of paddy , while it was just 39 lakh tonnes in Andhra Pradesh. The fall in cultivable area in Andhra Pradesh and its increase in Telangana is attributed to the availability of water and the average rainfall . The rabi season's rainfall in Telangana was 1,004mm, while it was just 629mm in Andhra Pradesh, which resulted in the steep fall in paddy production. The Krishna delta had no crop for two consecutive seasons, while it was only the Godavari delta that had seen a partial cultivation of paddy. The varieties produced in Godavari delta are procured by the State Civil Supplies Department for its public distribution system (PDS), while the higher varieties are procured for the open market in the state.""There were no rains and there was no water for Krishna delta. We could not get the 140tmcft of assured water from Nagarajunasagar after bifurcation, leading to the crisis,"" said farmers' leader and former member of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) MVS Nagi Reddy.The Telangana government had not released even a drop of water either to the right canal that provides irrigation water to parts of Guntur and Prakasam districts, or to the left canal that irrigates parts of Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh.""The production of paddy in AP is low due to the prevailing drought conditions and non-availability of water. The prices for whatever quantity is produced have gone up. That is the reason why we are procuring paddy from Telangana, where a quintal of the grain is available for just Rs 800 to 900, while it is Rs 1,800 to RS 2,500 in Andhra Pradesh,"" said rice miller Chennuri Rambabu"

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

Kumar contested it, saying the earlier rate (of `20) was inclusive of tax and the GST could be sought only over the actual coffee cost.Two minutes into the argument, Kumar realised that no amount of argument could change the revised rate of his favourite beverage.Similar scenes played out at several places across the city through the day.Many consumers ignorant about the new tax system were seen accepting the price rise while others were complaining. Shops on their part wanted to educate customers about the increase in their bills.Dining and takeaways from restaurants became dearer.

The social media was taken by storm on Sunday with food aficionados posting pictures of varieties of Biryani and Pulao on their social media handles across India. Amongst cities like Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore etc. Indoreans too observed the day by coming together for a potluck supper. Amit Pamnani, a city based Chef who had invited foodies over for a potluck at his residence shares, ""The idea behind the event was to showcase Indian food to the world. Internationally, people celebrate food days like World Cheesecake Day, World French Fries day, World Nutella Day, Cheeseburger Day etc. Similarly, Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal thought of marking Indian food days to pay tribute to foods, dishes and ingredients that are Indian. Following the suit we are trying to elevate Indian food to the same level. We already had a few food days in the past recently like Pickle Masala Day, where people came together and made pickles together. On Biryani day, we made biryani as per our styles, some were signature recipes of grandmothers and some tasted authentically like Mughlai Biryani.""It was double the celebration as the day was observed on the onset of Eid and Biryani is synonymous to the festival. Food reviewer Belly Kanungo feels, ""The day gave us a chance to soak-in the Eid spirit. Initially, we had thought of having a potluck but eventually it turned out to be an elaborate Eid celebration as we had mutton Biryanis, chicken Biryanis, egg and cheese Pulao, different types of Raitas - veg, cucumber and plain authentic Raita along with some onion salad from eight different kitchens. Each Biryani tasted different from one another. There was dum Biryani which had layers of rice, Masala chicken and toppings of Kesar rice and caramelised onions that tasted absolutely like an authentic Biryani of a Mughlai restaurant. There was mutton and chicken masala pulao-biryani that tasted perfectly like how we Indoris like to eat - full of spices and Masala.""Food aficionado, Rakesh Dawani adds, ""Though, there have been debates on the difference between Biryani and Pulao but one thing is common between both these irresistible dishes that they bind foodies together. The celebration was given a pause with a dollop of Sheer-Khurma.""Indore has been seeing a lot of youngsters choosing to organise potluck dinners on occasions like Easters and even for Iftar. Shivam Anand, a 20 year old engineering student who replicated his grandma's recipe to make egg-pulao for the day is of the opinion, ""It is only because of potluck that we got to savour eight different kinds of Biryanis in a single day. Potlucks are fun and gives us ideas to experiment with different dishes in our kitchens. Indore is known for its food and such sessions are only taking the city forward as like-minded people get to meet under one roof and talk about food.""For Satyajeet David, a city based chef, Biryani means ""Celebrating - The Royal Way"". He shares, ""A day dedicated and celebrated as #PulaoBiryaniDay in India is indeed very inspiring not only for Chefs but all foodies. I appreciate the thought to embark an occasion like this once in a year.

But these will be phased out once the online e-way system becomes operational. Meanwhile, the mobile wings will be strengthened once the barriers go."" Excise and taxation commissioner Vivek Pratap Singh added that eventually the sale tax barriers will go under the GST system.It would be a hectic weekend for the department to monitor smooth transition from the value added tax (VAT) to the GST in the state. On Thursday, the department constituted a team of its officials to focus on the six excise divisions in the state on Saturday and Sunday. A GST helpline is also being launched.However, there is still no clarity about how long it could take for the new system to become fully functional in the state. Presently there are over 40 sale tax barriers, which are called information collection centres. As per the plan, under the GST system, the department would focus on mobile wings and their numbers will go up. Sources said due to technical glitches in e-way system, the sale tax barrier system, which was to end from July 1, would continue for some time.Traders in the state too are anxious about the new tax regime. Narotam Dev Ratti, former chairman, Punjab Trader Board, said the small traders who were not covered under VAT till now are the ones who will take time to come to terms with the new system. ""The online system has not been launched and there is lack of clarity on certain issues such as fate of traders who have already paid VAT. For instance, items like rice are exempt under the GST but there could be traders who would have paid VAT for trading in it as a single commodity. Will they get a refund? These are some grey areas,"" he said.Traders are also apprehensive about compliance as small and petty traders in the state may find difficult to meet the documentation and other statutory requirements for the GST. E-way bill is an electronic way bill for movement of goods which can be generated on the GSTN (common portal). The 'movement' of goods valuing more than Rs 50,000, cannot take place without an e-way bill.- 40-odd sale tax barriers to continue for time being- Online e-way system likely to miss deadline- Excise and taxation department constitutes team for weekend monitoring- Small traders still grappling with grey areas in taxation policy- Punjab yet to make formal communications about the switch over"

Come tomorrow, it just might taste a tad bitter. Your favourite snack  singara kachori , radhaballabi and the like  sold 24x7 at the city's ubiquitous mishtir dokaan and consumed at all times of the day will be taxed under the GST regime Not just that, GST also poses a challenge to the famed Bengali sweet tooth as sandesh, rosogolla, mishti doi and other varieties of sweets are being brought under the tax net. The worst hit though will be those who love chocolates. From chocolate bars to chocolate sandesh, black forest cakes to chocolate ice-creams, anything with a hint of chocolate will sting as Jaitley & Co has put chocolate in the highest GST slab of 28%.Most Kolkatans though are yet unaware of the rude shock in store. On Thursday, septuagenarian Sudip Ghosh of Bhowanipore blissfully relished his kochuri-alur torkari, something he has done every evening since childhood. ""I cannot even visualise mornings and evenings without hinger koch-uri and phulkopir singara,"" he said. In an alley in Burrabazar, Mahesh Agarwal was also biting into the same fare although with a slight different taste. ""Samosa and kachori are my staple diet,"" the trader said.With all major branded stores that retail snacks, sweets and savouries like Ganguram, Haldiram, Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick, Banchharam, Kamdhenu, Mouchak, Sen Mahasay, Haldiram, Bikharam Chandmal and Tewari now under the GST net, the kachuri/kochuri-samosa/singara fare sold from these stores will be costlier as namkeen snack items will attract 12% GST. If they are consumed in the store, the GST will be 18%.Industry observers said the effective price of all products is likely to go up by 6%-8%. ""While no GST has been imposed on fish and vegetables as they are perishables, no such benefit has been granted to snacks and sweets that also don't have shelf-life,"" rued Sudip Mullick of Bhawanipore's heritage brand Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick.For them, and Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy, north Kolkata's biggest name in sweets, there's an even bigger worry. Some of their best-selling sweets like chocolate rosogolla, chocolate sandesh, chocolate mudpie sandesh, black forest sandesh, rice ball, chocolate chips, chocolate singara and chocolate jalbhara may get badly dented by the 28% GST levied on them.""The impact will be so huge that one cannot possibly absorb the impact. There are two things that can be done. One is to retain the size and hike the price. The other is to retain the price and reduce the size. We haven't yet taken a decision but no matter which of the two it is, the customer will not like it,"" said Rana Nandy of Girish Chandra Dey & Nakur Chandra Nandy.Though all other sweets will be under the 5% category, sweet retailers are miffed at the cottage industry being taxed when it has all along been exempted from sales tax and VAT. ""What is the rationale of 0% GST on lassi and plain dahi and 5% GST on mishti doi? It will be a blow to the traditional eating habits,"" said Subhajit Ghosh of Banchharam.In shops across the city, retailers are worried about chocolate stocks that usually move slowly during this season. With shops unwilling to buy chocolates till fresh stocks with new MRP is launched, chocolate distributors have stopped making the rounds of markets. Foreseeing a possible crisis, big retail chains with deep pockets like Big Baazar and Spencer's have stocked up chocolates. The chocolate market in Bengal is around Rs 80 crore annually.The tax on chocolate is also weighing heavy on confectionaries, boutique chocolatiers like Madhumita Upadhyay whose start-up is not in distress. ""I have written letter to both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Mamata Banerjee on the irrationality of pegging chocolate at 28% when cake and pastry are in the 18% bracket,"" she said.Sumit Deb, managing director of Metro Dairy, feels prices of ice creams across the category including chocolate will go up as price of both key inputs  butter and cocoa powder  is set to rise. GST on ice cream will be 18% from the current level of 16.5% (VAT and Excise). The ice cream market in Bengal is worth Rs 200-250 crore annually, of which 15-20% is chocolate flavour."

5a0525789855b76bf13bfe06,"Food, thy name is...",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/01/food-thy-name-is-1622712.html,2017-07-01,"HYDERABAD: When you are in the Philippines, you get an opportunity to indulge in island hopping, which is as fun-filled as party hopping! You get to explore different places, meet interesting people, and taste different cuisines (if you are willing to do some bold experiments!). Otherwise, if you are like me, come back enlightened about some attention-grabbing food habits.Palawan, a narrow archipelago of 1,780 islands on the western border of the Philippines is bound by the South China Sea on the west and the Sulu Sea on the east, stretching 650 km from tip to tip. Synonymous with spectacular dives, magnificent seascapes and popular activities like snorkelling, kayaking etc., its sanctuaries, hidden lagoons, soaring limestone cliffs and pristine beaches are irresistible to any traveller. The capital city, Puerto Princesa is approximately one-hour air travel from Manila and that was where we landed.Allen, our guide, while briefing us on Palawan Island, said it is mostly inhabited by two tribes: Batak who live up in the mountains and practice slash and burn cultivation and the more civilised Tagbanwa who live in the lowlands. Concluding that their food habits also reflect their ethnic roots, my innocent question on the subject elicited an elaborate discourse from Allen, on the Filipino food culture.Rice is a staple in every meal and one without rice is not considered a full meal. It is only counted as merienda (snack) no matter how large the helping. A day isnt complete without three full, warm meals and snacks in between. It is not unusual to eat five times a day: breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner. Some may even fit in a sixth snack after dinner and before turning in for the night. Asking if the person has eaten or inviting people to eat is a common greeting in the Philippines. It is never polite to refuse food in the Filipino setting - even if you are already very full. A nibble or a bite is enough to show appreciation. Filipinos would rather starve than not prepare a small merienda for a guest - Isnt that typical of Asian hospitality?He went on to elaborate on the unique Filipino food culture and its own idiosyncrasies. Snake meat, he said, is indeed delicious when grilled or roasted and tastes like chicken. Crickets are much-coveted treats when heads, legs, and wings are removed and fried to crispiness on the outside, and soft texture on the inside. The clean farm rats and frogs living in the wilderness too taste like poultry! Tamilok, a mollusc found in the rotting mangroves, tastes like oyster and is a famous delicacy in Palawan.Buwaya, the crocodiles succulent white meat has a distinctive flavour and aroma. It is low in fat, low in calories and high in protein, good for the heart and lungs and is a natural aphrodisiac. What more, its easy to cook, chewy, texture like chicken etc. How about the Abuos, fried ant eggs and larvae? The giant ants/termites eggs and larvae are harvested from trees like the tamarind tree and are relished by all. They are a good source of protein and will lower blood pressure.Besides, some of them thrive on the meat of monitor lizard called bahawa while some relish the flesh of the monkey. As I listened to him, I was reminded of an idiom-One mans meat is another mans poison. Well, their food is their sustenance, their medicine. They look at these animals from a different angle.But the pice de rsistance came that evening at Baywalk Park, one of the most visited tourist attractions in Puerto Princesa City. Apart from its relaxing ambience, the Baywalk Park also houses a number of restaurants, which offers seafood and aphrodisiacs including crocodiles and frogs (Filipino street food is exotic and at times shocking!). There were many carts selling various foods like boiled corn, grilled meat etc. Women were selling boiled duck eggs on a bed of peanuts. Allen announced that he was going to demonstrate how they eat Balut, a popular snack. Balut is a 14 to 18 days old duck embryo, boiled and served with rock salt or spicy vinegar: the contents are eaten directly from the shell, the partially developed embryo bones being soft enough to chew and swallow as a whole.Allen ate it dramatically as we all clicked pictures. Later he explained that it is a powerful aphrodisiac and is very popular with Filipino men. During my brief stay on the bay walk, I saw only women selling it (on push carts) and men consuming. I didnt see any woman eating it. Maybe Filipino women dont need aphrodisiacs!!Then the next day we went for lunch at Badjao Seafront; a floating restaurant built in a mangrove area offering picturesque views of Puerto Princesas seascape and a surreal experience. Walking through the narrow wooden bridge leading to the restaurant, I felt the beauty of every step. The rustic al fresco Badjao rests on stilts and gives a great feeling of being in the midst of mangroves. After hearing Allens stories and seeing him in action, I played it safe and opted for ensaladang talong; a mixture of grilled eggplants, tomatoes and onions tossed in a vinegar dressing. For dessert, I had fresh slices of pineapple and watermelon. Sometimes we eat only to survive.

5a0527739855b76bf13bfe82,Modi-Trump multiple embraces signals India-US ties on strong footing,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/modi-trump-meeting-multiple-embraces-signals-india-us-ties-on-strong-footing-4725197/,2017-06-28,"Modi Trump meet: Prime Minister Modi and President Donald Trump arriving to deliver the Joint Press Statement, at White House, in Washington. (Source: PTI) Modi Trump meet: Prime Minister Modi and President Donald Trump arriving to deliver the Joint Press Statement, at White House, in Washington. (Source: PTI)In the face of considerable uncertainty, Prime Minister Modis first meeting with President Trump appears to have come off well. Setting aside the teeming crowds and spectacles of past visits, the Prime Minister settled for an intimate set of meetings focused on shoring up the US-India partnership and finding common ground with a President who has demonstrated a more unstructured and impulsive style of policymaking than his predecessors.Prime Minister Modi faced three imperatives in making this visit a success. The first was establishing a personal rapport with President Trump. Although the leaders hail from starkly different personal backgrounds, they brought to their initial meeting a shared impatience for bureaucracy and preference for communicating directly through social media; an unapologetic attitude about advancing their peoples economic interests in a competitive global marketplace; and a commitment to dealing with the menace of global terrorism.Judging from their warm public comments  and multiple embraces  it is fair to conclude that the leaders established some personal chemistry. But this is only a start. I observed first-hand how President Obama developed a real rapport with Prime Minister Modi, forged not simply through consultations on bilateral issues, but frequent conversations about global challenges from climate change to maritime security. To build a strong relationship, Trump and Modi will need to move beyond their early affinity and similarly identify a basket of global issues on which they can seek each others advice and support.The Prime Ministers second imperative was to use this visit to signal that the US-India relationship remains on solid footing. For well over a decade, the United States and India have been describing the bilateral relationship in increasingly florid language. This rhetorical escalation has reflected deepening ties between the two countries, but has also been a means by which both leaders have prompted their bureaucracies to overcome Cold War hesitations about engaging the other. It was a way of reaffirming that the relationship was special.It has, however, become abundantly clear that in Trumps America, special is no longer good enough. The new administrations litmus test seems to be whether a country can prove useful to the Presidents priorities of job creation and economizing the defense of Americas borders.On this count as well, the visit modestly exceeded expectations. The Rose Garden statements nicely recapitulated the common values that bind the two countries. And building on the Joint Strategic Vision of 2015, the joint statement reaffirmed an emphasis on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, particularly maritime collaboration; articulated a common understanding of the terrorist threat; highlighted deepening defense ties, including a significant offer of Guardian UAVs that required the administration to overcome a presumption of denial under its MTCR obligations; noted cooperation on a surprisingly wide range of energy initiatives, from clean coal to renewables; and, in a nod to Trumps focus on deficits, committed to further expanding and balancing the trade relationship.Taken together, the positive rhetoric and these incremental outcomes helped reaffirm that the relationship remains on a steady trajectory.Modis third and final imperative in meeting President Trump was to shape the new administrations view of Indias regional challenges, particularly those relating to China and Pakistan. Here the fruits of the summit are somewhat less clear. US policy toward China remains inchoate, pegged unrealistically to Chinese support on North Korea. This administrations China hawks  who are pointedly critical of Beijings trade practices and soft expansionism in Asia  may well gain the upper hand in the coming months.China was something of an unspoken apparition in the leaders public remarks. The joint statement reaffirmed the US-India strategic convergence in Asia, highlighting a shared concern over North Korea and posed a thinly-veiled critique of Chinas Belt and Road Initiative. But it did not resolve the longer-term question of whether India and the United States will arrive at a similar view of the challenge that China poses to our shared interests in Asia. Without that common view, the institutional energy behind US-India defence cooperation could eventually wane.Neither is it entirely clear to what extent Modi was able to shape the Presidents views on Pakistan. The White House is in the final stages of developing a South Asia strategy that, in part, seeks to address the problems of cross-border militancy that flow from Pakistani territory. Indeed, the leaders made the most explicit reference ever in high-level US document to Pakistani cross-border militancy, even more forceful than the strong statement issued by National Security Advisor Susan Rice in the wake of the Uri attacks last September.These statements, bolstered by the US designation of Syed Salahuddin, might suggest that Trump is moving inexorably toward Modis view of Pakistan. The reality, however, is more complex. The United States still has numerous equities with Pakistan, and can little afford to alienate Pakistani leaders precisely when it is considering reinvesting in an Afghan peace process. New Delhi may continue to hear a tougher rhetorical line on Pakistan, but so far there are few indications that Trump would be willing to use Americas limited leverage with Pakistan to press for action against India-focused groups like Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad, rather than groups like the Haqqani Taliban network that directly target US forces in Afghanistan. That may well change in the aftermath of another cross-border attack into India, but observers should be realistic about how fast and how far the United States will be willing to stress its relationship with Pakistan outside of a crisis environment.These uncertainties notwithstanding, both leaders can feel good about this summit. But they must not become complacent. What makes for a successful first visit is not enough to make for a successful relationship. There are still substantial irritants, particularly on economic issues. And more than ever before, both sides will face pressure to show that the partnership is not just special but useful to the other.For the US, that might mean finding ways to more assertively address Indias regional security concerns; ensure that trade disputes are handled respectfully and creatively; and advocate energetically for Indias leadership role on the global stage. For India, that might mean finding areas in which to make substantive contributions to the global counter-terrorism fight; continuing to purchase US equipment and defense goods, and demonstrating its ability to be a burden-sharing defence partner in the Indian Ocean; and making good on its pledges to gradually expand market access to US firms in protected sectors.These are achievable goals for the US-India relationship under this new administration. Reasonably assured of each others commitment, both sides now face the task of sustaining sufficient bureaucratic energy to advance nuts-and-bolts cooperation outside of the public glare. These are not ordinary times. But the foundations of a stronger partnership have ably been laid.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Although in its current form, it is not as perfect as was originally envisaged, yet it is being lauded as one of the most transformational reforms since 1991. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was humble and right in saying that the credit for this goes not just to this government but also to previous ones that conceived and steered it from time to time.Here we assess the likely impact of the new GST regime on agriculture and farmers. One can look at it from three angles: One, is the GST going to be inflation neutral, given that food has 45 per cent weight in consumer price index (CPI)? Two, is the GST going to be revenue neutral, and especially, which states could lose revenue and how will they be compensated? Three, does it give some incentives to link farmers with the food processing industry, which may help them reduce market risk, augment incomes and create new jobs in rural areas?Let us look at major inputs first. Fertilisers, which currently attract VAT varying from 0 to 8 per cent in several states, will now attract 12 per cent tax under the GST. That means the price of fertilisers is likely to go up by 5-7 per cent, unless the government decides to absorb this by increasing the subsidy. Pesticides are put in a slab of 18 per cent, up from the 12 per cent excise today and a VAT of 4-5 per cent in some states. Tractor rates are tricky: Several components and accessories are put in a slab of 28 per cent, while tractors are under the 12 per cent slab, up from zero excise and a VAT of 4-5 per cent. It is not very clear yet whether the input credit claims to cover taxes already paid on components and accessories will exceed the final tax rate of 12 per cent on tractors, and therefore, there could be a scope for reduction in tractor prices; or the taxes on components may be rationalised and brought down from the 28 to 12 per cent slab. There is quite a bit of confusion here.Overall, it seems from the inputs side that the cost of cultivation for farmers may increase marginally, which in turn may put a mild pressure on agri-prices. But the story is not complete unless we see the taxation structure on agri-output prices.Most raw agri-commodities ranging from rice, wheat, milk, fresh fruits and vegetables, are in the zero tax slab, rightly so, as they are consumed by the masses. However, it may be interesting to note that a state like Punjab which contributes maximum grains to the central pool, imposes taxes and various cesses to the extent of 12 per cent on wheat and rice. On top of that, there is the arhatiya commission of 2.5 per cent making the transaction cost of these staples in Punjab mandis as high as 14.5 per cent. In a country still ridden with poverty, imposing such high taxation on wheat and rice was nothing short of rent-seeking from the Centre and distorting the markets. Now, with the new GST regime, even if a commission of 2.5 per cent stays, one hopes that all other taxes and cesses will go away. As a result, the purchase cost of wheat and paddy (rice) from Punjab mandis will go down by 12 per cent. This would be a major gain with several ripple effects. One, that the price of these basic staples in the open market should come down by say 5-7 per cent, as most grain surplus states impose at least that much tax. This was a major distortion in the mandis, driving the private sector from Punjab. Now, with zero taxes, the private sector may come back to buying wheat and rice from these surplus states, giving a fillip to grain milling.At an all-India level, Food Corporation of India (FCI) may save anywhere from Rs 6,000-8,000 crore, which could show up in a lesser food subsidy bill. But surplus states like Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh may lose this tax revenue, which they are getting from the FCI or GoI under the current system. How they will be compensated is not yet clear even to the FCI, although there is a provision for compensating losing states for five years by the Centre. The rationalisation of mandi taxes and associated cess and levies will be the biggest gain from the GST as far as agriculture is concerned.However, the taxation structure for processed food is not very encouraging. For example, fruit and vegetable juices will be taxed at 12 per cent, up from the current 5 per cent; fruit jams, jellies, marmalades, fruit and vegetable purees, etc. are taxed even higher at 18 per cent, up from 5 per cent. This is surprising as it will discourage the development of the food processing industry, especially for perishable fruits and vegetables. Even the humble aloo tikki will attract 18 per cent tax, if it is in frozen form! This is contrary to the wishes of even the prime minister who wanted fruit juices to be put in aerated drinks to ensure a good market for farmers.It may be worth reconsidering these rates and bringing them down to the 5 per cent slab for stronger linkages between farmers and the food processing industry and creating jobs in rural areas. Since the raw material could be sourced directly from farmers instead of being entirely depending on middlemen in mandis, e-NAM provides this opportunity to graduate to a real pan-India market for agricultural products. A smooth GST regime can break inter-state barriers on movement and facilitate direct linkages between processors and farmers. This can transform the operations of mandis too if other necessary reforms to free up agricultural markets are undertaken. If this happens, farmers would also welcome the GST the way organised industry seems to be.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

They had been given tokens to eat in the Konark restaurant at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium after the previous mess suppliers contract ran out on May 31.Devika ML, Assistant Director, DYES, who has been assigned with the task of overseeing the needs of the hostel, said she hoped to ring in changes as soon as possible.The issue of the food contractor has been discussed and we have shortlisted three people who we see as worthy to take up the job. There is no tender process for the same but we have certain guidelines to be followed and the issue will be sorted in another day or two, she added.The athletes who train rigorously twice a day have been given a limited menu for the last week, something that barely satisfies their nutrition needs. We used to have 8-10 chappatis and rice when the food was being supplied in the canteen but now we are allotted just one chappati and a little rice. How are we expected to have enough energy to train then? said an aspiring discus thrower.That being said, we did not go the DYES office to protest or strike yesterday (Tuesday), all we wanted to do was to make the director aware of our plight and speed up the process of getting another caterer.Food was not the only concern at the hostel with athletes being deprived of good drinking water for a couple of days.We have ensured there were arrangements made to have water decanters around the hostel now, said a hostel employee on condition of anonymity.Another issue that is yet to be resolved is how the logistics would work in terms of getting food to the 50-odd boys that are housed at the hockey stadium since the previous contractor used to personally hire a vehicle and have the food delivered there."

On Sunday, all news channels bombarded us with Virats Surgical Strike (News India) as India beat Pakistan at cricket  all, that is, barring Zee, which said it would boycott Pakistani cricket and added, rather obscurely, that its news channels would support only actual heroes. Whereupon it set off in pursuit of Pakistan, across the border instead of on the cricket field. And, even as Star Sports promoted the Champions Trophy match with its Sabse Bada Moh advert, Zee hit back with Sabse Bada Droh  you know woh they mean.Meanwhile, Times Now went after crime in UP where Goonda Raj thrives and India Today had Operation Romeo: (Is) CM Yogis pet project going rogue?  this, when Adityanath has been the most celebrated chief minister on air. Not to be left behind, Republic went rogue, pardon the expression, on the Sriram Sene and the Bajrang Dal, asking hard questions of the Fringe, and India Today discussed what it called BJPs meat hypocrisy as it plays out in the north-eastern states.Then, on Wednesday, after farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh led to the death of five farmers, possibly in police firing, the same channels led the onslaught: BJP reels from farmer backlash (Times Now), a jai kisan litmus test for the BJP (India Today), the role of police in firing confirmed (Republic). Farmers protests in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh dominated news headlines throughout the day, but it isnt as if they began yesterday, its just that they have been given short shrift by news channels obsessed with the army, Kashmir and Pakistan, not necessarily in that order. Will the violence and deaths now lead to ultra-big debates on evening prime time? Lets wait and see.Its been a long, long time since so many questions were raised on these channels about the BJPs governance  even in states  or its fringe elements. Which is not to say that the usual agenda and suspects were not relentlessly pursued alongside: On Tuesday, it was the CPMs turn to be called out for questioning General Rawats comments on the army in Kashmir (Times Now, India Today). Speaking of agendas, NDTV made news for all the wrong reasons when anchor Nidhi Razdan and BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra got into an unnecessary, unseemly and unbecoming row over the channels alleged agenda (Left, Right and Centre) with Razdan asking Patra to leave her show.Worse followed when its promoters Prannoy and Radhika Roy were raided by the CBI, prompting Ravish Kumar to dwell darkly on the dangers of dar ki rajdhani for the media (NDTV India). The oddest news of the week came from India News and Zee Business: The former was incensed by videos on social media revealing plastic rice  perhaps from China  that bounced when squeezed into a ball, while the latter discovered videos of fake eggs, also on social media  again allegedly from China. News Nation went to Ujjain where it caught Pyare Mohan chomping green and red chillies  for a Guinness World Record?DD News showed us Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while other news channels carried its live feed to cover the launch of the GSLV MkIII. Told you it was an odd week. Other oddities? Well, what would you say about a TV commercial to promote mutual fund investments which shows that other gentlemans game in progress  golf  when one player advises another to invest in MFs and the latter doesnt seem to know a thing about MFs. Someone who plays golf doesnt know mutual funds? Decidedly odd. No odder than the Vrat Ayurdeva item on haemorrhoids, more indelicately known as piles (EPIC). While the information was extremely useful for those who suffer from this painful and uncomfortable ailment, the graphic which accompanied the discussion with doctors was, er, too graphic and in poor taste, tracking the movement of faeces through the intestines.And while this has nothing to do with anything, the accents of actors playing British characters on shows like EPICs Bandits of British India and Sher-e-Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh (Life OK) sound about as British as Punjabi. Very odd  and unconvincing indeed.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5a05a3a79855b76bf13c08ac,Close watch on Qatar tension,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170608/jsp/business/story_155686.jsp,2017-06-08,"New Delhi, June 7: Any further escalation of tension between Qatar and its Arab neighbours could push up oil and gas prices, affecting India's import bill. A senior India oil ministry official said, ""The rift between Qatar and its Arab neighbours is unlikely to immediately impact the hydrocarbon sector immediately. (But) We are keeping a watch on the situation. This is not a war-like situation and will have no impact on India's deal with Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company Ltd (RasGas)."" However, Indian aircraft flying to Qatar cannot use the airspace of the countries in dispute with Qatar, and neither can Indian ships use some Gulf ports. This could lead to added cost for Indian carriers and shippers. Officials also said the rift, which has seen the UAE and Saudi Arabia cutting supplies to Qatar, was ""an opportunity for exporters"". ""Indian rice traders and suppliers of poultry products have received feelers for quick deliveries to the emirate... we are encouraging them to fill in the opportunities presented,"" the official said. New Delhi-based rice exporter Harvir Singh said, ""There is a huge demand for our basmati rise in Doha... we are trying to fulfil it from Kerala and Maharashtra."" Qatar is the largest supplier of LNG to India, accounting for over 65 per cent of the country's global import. Around 8.5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is imported annually under a long-term contract between India's Petronet LNG and Qatar's RasGas. other companies also make some spot purchases from time to time. ""We bring in at least 10 ships of gas per month. The value of gas per ship, which carries about 150 cubic metres of gas, is Rs 150 crore. As we have a tie-up with a Japanese shipping consortium, we have nothing to worry about the developments,"" Prabhat Singh, managing director of Petronet LNG, said. While officials did not see immediate problems in supplies - either of oil or gas - shipments may be affected if the dispute is not resolved soon. If that happens, industry sources said, India may have to give up some of the comforts of the reworked gas deal with Qatar if oil prices continue to remain high for long. However, reports said the dispute among the Gulf nations had not affected cargo loading or shipments by Qatar. Ajay Sahai, director general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, ""At the moment, the trade has not been impacted by the dispute between Qatar and its Arab neighbours. But, we have to be watchful of the situation. If it deteriorates, it could impact shipments."" Major items of Indian exports are machinery and equipment, construction material, electrical and electronic items, textiles and garments, chemicals, precious stones, rubber, spices, cereals and iron, steel and plastic products. The two way trade between Qatar and India stood at $8.42 billion 2016-17."

Picture by Mayukh Sengupta June 11: Mamata Hansda, 18, has won multiple medals in state and national karate championships in the past three years. She can break a thick stack of tiles with one blow of the right hand. Or rain five kicks with her left leg without the foot touching the ground. But ask the diminutive teenager about her biggest achievement and she replies with a shy smile: ""Not being afraid to return home late at night."" Mamata won a bronze (under-21, 45kg) at the recent national karate championships in Delhi, the latest in her medal kitty. Her mother Sumitra is a mason. When she doesn't get work, she sells goat milk to feed her family. Mamata's father died when she was four. The third member of the family from Sukanta Pally village near Durgapur station is Mamata's elder sister, Chinta, who is training to be a nurse. Karate has not been able to lift the Hansdas out of abject poverty but it has given Mamata hope and courage. ""Earlier, I was very scared of returning home after tuitions. The road that leads to my home is dimly lit and it feels like midnight at 7pm. Now, I often train till 10pm and return home without any fear,"" Mamata told Metro. The Class XII student at Durgapur Rai Rani Debi Girls High School had her first brush with karate at a self-defence camp in 2014. About 100 girls had taken part in the camp, which was for most their first and last exposure to karate. But Mamata stuck to the sport. It seemed a natural progression for the girl who was a regular participant at school athletic meets - 100 metres, high jump and long jump. ""The kicks, punches and roar were the gateways to an unknown world. There was an instant liking,"" Mamata recollected. She started training with Sensei Samir Kumar Mondal at the centre in Sagarbhanga where the camp was held, a 20-minute walk from her home. In August 2014, with barely two months' training, Mamata participated in the state championship and won a bronze in the 40kg category. In 2016, Mamata took part in the junior national school games in Punjab's Rupnagar. She did not win a medal but learnt a lot by competing with the top fighters in the country. She put in longer hours of practice and the results followed. The same year, she won bronze in the under-17 category at a national open meet in the city. ""Consider her background when you look at her medals. Then, a bronze would look like a gold,"" Mondal, her coach, told Metro. Mamata's day starts at 4am with two hours of practice, followed by school and tuition and then more practice. Her lunch is puffed rice. Egg or milk is rare, so she makes do with bananas and sattu. For dinner, the family has rice with one side dish. ""She needs much more protein. She is short for her age and lacks strength because of her meagre diet,"" said Mondal. ""But her spirit is indomitable. What she lacks in height and strength, she makes up in speed."" Before the national games in Delhi, Mamata found hope in the form of a sponsor - the Emami Foundation, the CSR arm of the Emami Group. The foundation paid for all her expenses for the meet and has promised to provide all future help. ""We not only want Mamata to realise her dream but to complete her education,"" said Sushil Goenka, group MD and foundation head. For Mamata, winning medals is a matter of pride. So is teaching the local boys some manners. Two youths used to taunt her when she started taking karate lessons. ""They used to shout 'Kha-khu girl' every time they saw me, mocking the roars we make during bouts and practice. After a few months of training, I challenged them to a fight. They had no answer."" Mamata counts her family as her biggest strength. ""My mother toils hard to earn us two meals a day but not once has she asked me to quit karate. She and my sister are my biggest supporters. Whenever I take part in a tournament in Bengal, my mother is in the stands,"" she said. Even the teenager's leisure time revolves around martial arts: her favourite film is the Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan-starrer Karate Kid, which she has watched ""over 20 times""."

Picture by Passang Yolmo Darjeeling, June 9: Gobind Lal Bhagat had heard that the queen of the hills used to be turbulent in the mid-80s - police would be attacked, jeeps set on fire and tourists would steer clear of Darjeeling in fear. Last afternoon, the 55-year-old banker from East Delhi was witness to similar scenes being played out on Mall Road and accompanied by his wife and son, the man realised why tourists had once deserted Darjeeling. It didn't take him long to finalise his next course of action. Cutting short his maiden visit to Darjeeling, Bhagat checked out of Seven Seas Hotel around 6am today to catch a bus to return to Siliguri. But the wait seemed endless as hundreds like him took to the streets of Darjeeling hoping to catch a bus to the plains. The government had organised only six 20-seater buses to ferry them out of the town this morning. And only those categorised as ""immediate"" were packed off. Rest, like Bhagat, had to wait for over 12 hours on Hill Cart Road till small buses of North Bengal State Transport Corporation would arrive to ferry some of them back. ""A temporary camp was set up near the market where officers with police asked for identity proof of visitors waiting to return. Each person or group was then categorised depending on the scale of emergency,"" Bhagat said. ""One family member would be then stamped on the hand with a number and an alphabet - N for normal or E for emergency."" Some 15,000 tourists have been trying to head to the plains since yesterday's violence. With uncertainty looming and usual mode of return by jeeps and private cars appearing to be a rarity, many have decided to curtail their holiday plans to take a free ride - return to Siliguri or to Calcutta is free in government-provided vehicles - back to Siliguri at the earliest. With chief minister Mamata Banerjee laying emphasis on the evacuation of tourists, the government has so far pressed into service nearly 50 NBSTC buses to ferry passengers to and from the hills for free. Besides, special buses were roped in to carry passengers from the Tenzing Norgay Bus Terminus in Siliguri to Calcutta. Even 20 Tata Sumos were hired. ""It would cost anything between Rs 7,000 and Rs 8,000 for hiring a vehicle for travel to Siliguri from Darjeeling. The bus ride is free,"" said Chandan Mukherjee of Taratala, Calcutta. But like all free things, getting a bus was not so easy. Darjeeling, which had been buzzing with tourists cooling off this summer till last morning, suddenly struggled to cope with the huge exodus. Couples with kids, groups with senior citizens, backpackers and revellers sat on plastic sheets on pavements waiting for buses to reach Siliguri. ""We left hotel at2.30 in the morning hoping to catch the first bus to Siliguri,"" said Sujata Pradhan of Bajpur in Nandigram. ""By the time our number would come, all the buses had left in the morning."" Sujata and her husband Buddhadeb and son Sokal are a part of a 70-member group from East Midnapore which had come to chill out. Left stranded, the members just kept praying even as Mamata Banerjee went around in a car asking tourists not to panic. "" Aapnara chinta korben na. Shob rokom byabostha kora hochhey,"" she said. But that seemed hardly a balm. People sat together holding on to their luggage and munched on whatever local people would keep providing in turns - from puffed rice and biscuits to khichri and chow-chow. ""This is a very auspicious day in the Tibetan Buddhist calendar,"" said Jigme Dorje who had turned up with his sons, armed with litres of tea to serve the stuck tourists. ""It's a pleasure to serve to the tourists,"" he said with a smile, probably oblivious of the fact that the tourists would think twice before planning another Darjeeling trip."

The organisation demanded a waiver of loans, as farmers in the state have also incurred huge losses because of demonetisation. Assam, despite being an agricultural state and being located in a fertile zone, is also facing a similar situation to that in the other two states, KMSS chief Akhil Gogoi told The Telegraph. ""There are several signs that point towards the rise of such a massive protest here as well. Several farmers have dumped their crops after failing to get the right price. Small tea growers have dumped their leaves on the streets but the government has turned a deaf ear. A few days ago, KMSS and thousands of peasants protested against seeds dealers in Barpeta for providing low quality paddy seeds that led to production of seedless rice this year. The government has not taken action against these dealers. We will see more farmers coming out on the streets in the near future,"" Akhil said at his headquarters here. ""Vegetable growers of Barpeta and Sonitpur - the two districts that contribute to the highest vegetable production in the state - have repeatedly complained that they have suffered massive losses. Small tea growers who annually produce 600 million tonnes - about 35 per cent of the state's tea produce - are getting less than Rs 8 per kg. The situation here is very grim,"" Akhil said. After the farmers' protests in which six farmers were shot and which forced the Centre to despatch 1,100 paramilitary forces to Madhya Pradesh, the Reserve Bank of India had said one of the reasons was demonetisation. Akhil said, ""Because of demonetisation, farmers here could not invest enough. Since the village economy is mostly based on cash transactions, they could not buy seeds, manure and pesticides and could not pay wage labourers. This has resulted in massive low production. Whatever minimum profit they can procure, they have lost it now. This damage will have a long term impact, at least for more than a decade. ""But this is not the sole reason for their losses. The biggest challenge is that Assam has a very low credit deposit ratio compared to all-India standards. Farmers in Assam cannot invest in their agriculture,"" Gogoi said."
5a05b93b9855b76bf13c0c0f,Fest organisers slam Delhi's beef stand,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170611/jsp/northeast/story_156207.jsp,2017-06-11,"People attend the bitchi-beef festival on Saturday. Picture by Saidul Khan Tura, June 10: The bitchi (local rice beer)-beef festival, organised by former BJP leader Bernard Marak, at Eden Bari locality here - where the local brew and beef were served aplenty - today sent a strong message to the Narendra Modi government that the regulations on beef passed by the Centre cannot be forced and implemented directly in the scheduled areas of Garo hills in Meghalaya. The festival was attended by former president of the North Garo Hills unit of the BJP Bachu Marak, former president of Tura youth unit of the BJP Wilver Graham Danggo along with other ex-BJP functionaries and workers who have quit the party recently. They claimed that over 10,000 volunteers had quit the BJP in West Garo Hills and North Garo Hills districts of Meghalaya. Many local residents, too, attended the fest to register their protest against a move to ""target"" their eating habits. ""In Garo hills, we have a unique system as we have our own laws that do not restrict anyone's freedom and practices,"" Bernard said. According to him the fest demonstrated that the law of the land is ""autonomous and supreme"". ""Through this festival we wanted to tell all that in Garo hills we have our own law, our own culture, our own tradition and practices and nothing is above the age-old practices of the people,"" Bernard said. He asked the BJP to adhere to local laws if party wanted to have a base in Garo hills. ""Our law does not restrict us from having beef or momo. So we will continue to eat these. The BJP has to function within the ambit of our laws; we should not be forced to follow their diktat. Our beef fest is a strong message to the leaders not to violate our local laws,"" Bernard added. He termed the BJP an ""outsider"" in Garo hills and asked its leaders to respect freedom of the Garos. ""We are proud of the law of the land, our culture, customs, faith and practices and the prevailing law,"" Bernard said. Union minister of state for home affairs Kiren Rijiju, who was in Guwahati, this morning said the new rules on cattle trade have not ""affected"" common people. ""It is turned into an issue by the Congress and some pseudo-secular people. If it affected the common people, there would have been protests from their end. No such incidents, however happened,"" Rijiju said.The BJP in Meghalaya has termed as ""false and malicious untruth"" reports that it wants to impose a ban on beef in the state."

The arrested have been identified as Surendra Mirdha, Sadanand Kulu, Gobinda Mirdha and Janeka Mirdha. All the accused belong to Chichinda. The woman was allegedly gang raped by the criminals on June 16. Protest Bhubaneswar: The BJP staged a road blockade at Parjang on Tuesday demanding closure of illegal sand quarries in Parjang block of Dhenkanal. Former block chairman Sushant Dalbehera led the agitation. The BJP has alleged sand quarries at Kamar, Damal, Kulei, Khalpal, Basulei and Jatia in Parjang Tehsil were operating illegally. Rice seized Bhadrak: Police seized two vehicles and 150 bags of public distribution system rice meant for mid-day meal in Bhadrak district on Tuesday.

5a05c11c9855b76bf13c0d75,Letters to the Editor,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170620/jsp/opinion/story_157665.jsp,2017-06-20,"The winner takes it all Important win  Sir - Rafael Nadal must be congratulated for winning his 10th French Open title (""Rafa sails to 10th French Open title"", June 12). With this win, he has set a record: no one has ever won a single Grand Slam 10 times. Nadal won his first French Open in 2005. In the final this year, he crushed Switzerland's Stan Wawrinka 6-2, 6-3, 6-1. With this win, Nadal has won 15 Grand Slams and now stands second only to Roger Federer, who has won 18 Grand Slams. Nadal has dominated the clay court for nearly 12 years. This is a stupendous achievement. Only Margaret Court had won 11 titles at the Australian Open, although seven of those victories came at a time when it was an amateur event called the Australian Championships. Given his superb form, Nadal can pose a big challenge in the forthcoming Wimbledon tournament. His battle with Federer will be a treat to watch. Yours faithfully, Indranil Sanyal, Calcutta  Sir - Rafael Nadal, the undisputed king of clay, has finally silenced his critics. Before the final match, Stan Wawrinka spoke to reporters, and his words gave the impression that he thought he would easily emerge victorious. However, he suffered a humiliating straight set defeat at the hands of the Spaniard. There is no doubt that Wawrinka was in fiery form, but one must not forget that he went into the final hoping to dethrone the king of the clay court. Yours faithfully, Monisha Kaushal, Bokaro  Sir - Rafael Nadal's 10th French Open title at Roland Garros is his most significant win yet, as it came after a couple of years of below-par performances. His status as the greatest of all clay court tennis players was never in doubt. He can boast of a phenomenal 79-2 win-loss record at the French Open. This kind of feat demands tennis of the highest intensity, because the slow surface precludes a more attacking game, as is seen in Wimbledon. Nadal's accomplishments bear testament to his lasting prowess as an athlete. The manner in which he destroyed Stan Wawrinka's game in the final was electric. He has rendered age insignificant by continuing to play like a champion. Nadal, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Leander Paes are all over the age of 30 - Paes, in fact, is well past 40 - but they continue to enthral their audiences. Yours faithfully, S.S. Paul, Nadia  Sir - The final of the French Open was thrilling to watch. I have been a fan of Rafael Nadal ever since he won his first Grand Slam, and it felt great to witness his stunning return to form after a long spell of trouble. I have great respect for Roger Federer, but I was quite disappointed when Nadal did not manage to beat him at the Australian Open in January. Now, with this win, Nadal has inched closer to matching Federer's record of 18 Grand Slams. Yours faithfully, Anisha Sharma, Calcutta Star power  Sir - I have not seen Salim Durrani play, but I have heard that he used to hit sixes on demand from the gallery. Later, however, when cricket matches started being telecast live, I saw some really flamboyant cricketers in action, and Yuvraj Singh is certainly one of them (""The limited overs prince"", June 7). He has a huge fan following as well. Once he is at the crease, the spectators can always expect some fireworks. He is almost unstoppable, especially against India's cricketing arch-rivals. Yuvraj has displayed consistency and resilience not only on the cricket field, but off it as well. He has beaten cancer, and has also done a lot of social work for other cancer patients. Any captain would want a man like him on his team. He is also known to be a good ambassador for India when he goes abroad, as his behaviour is impeccable. Yuvraj has not only made the nation proud on the pitch, but also in other areas of his life. Yours faithfully, Alok Ganguly, Kalyani Ugly sight  Sir - I recently went to the famous Kali temple at Tarapith. Although the temple is maintained as per tradition, I was horrified to find goats and chickens being slaughtered in the open on either side of the road leading to the temple. Upon enquiry, I learnt that this has been going on for years. However, I remember that about 30 years ago, such unhygienic activities never took place on the main road near the temple. There ought to be proper abattoirs for these purposes. Yours faithfully, V.S. Giri, Chennai Parting shot  Sir - According to the rules of the railway authorities, anyone who wishes to enter certain stations must first purchase a ticket for the same. However, if people have to pay for platform tickets, then there should be basic amenities on the platforms for them to use. I had gone to Sealdah to receive some visitors who were coming to the city for the first time by the Rajdhani Express. On that particular day, the train was delayed for around two hours. I had to wait on the platform for a long time, but there were no benches for me to sit on, no drinking water, not even a fan above my head. The authorities should place more benches on the platforms, especially those at which trains travelling long distances arrive. Yours faithfully, Chameli Pal, Batanagar New faces  Sir - Now that the results of the elections to the Patna Municipal Corporation are out, I am not surprised that most sitting councillors, or their kin, have lost the polls. The citizens may have punished them for their poor performance. However, a former deputy-mayor managed to get his maid servant elected. Another sitting councillor said that she lost due to the caste factor. None of them, however, blamed themselves for their defeat. In some cases, semi-literate candidates won against their educated counterparts. We have to accept this as part and parcel of democracy. Patna's residents would be hoping that the new members of the municipality will be more efficient than the previous lot. A number of schemes, such as a new pipeline, are pending. Even basic amenities like street lights are missing in some areas. Every time the councillors held a meeting, a fight would break out between two warring groups. The newly-elected members have to overcome these problems and work to improve civic amenities for the city. Yours faithfully, S. Jha, Patna Safety last  Sir - A betel shop owner was shot dead recently. This murder took place at an important junction in the heart of the city where criminals should fear to tread. The police have a lot to think about as far as law and order is concerned. It has been reported that traders and businessmen are frequently receiving extortion calls. This indicates the growing confidence of criminals in Patna. The Patna police is overworked and understaffed. The police are busy dealing with illegal liquor and the investigation of high-profile scams. They also have to cope with political activities. More policemen should be put on the job of tackling crime. Such a move would instil confidence in Patna's citizens. If crime remains unchecked, we would not require 'outsiders' to defame Bihar. Yours faithfully, L.K. Sinha, Patna Water woes  Sir - The Biju Janata Dal had called a hartal in four districts in Odisha on June 10 to protest against two issues - the ""unilateral"" decision of the Chhattisgarh government to construct seven barrages in the upstream of the Mahanadi and the closing of the gates of one of these, the Kalma barrage. The closing of the barrage is causing an acute shortage of drinking water in parts of Odisha. Odisha has accused the Chhattisgarh government of denying Odiyas their right over the Mahanadi waters. The chief minister of Odisha, Naveen Patnaik, has written to his counterpart in Chhattisgarh, Raman Singh, and to the prime minister, Narendra Modi, about these problems. Patnaik has also tried to draw the attention of the Union water resources ministry to the matter. But none of his efforts has yielded any result. Common people are suffering because of the political equations between the parties in power in the two states. Yours faithfully, Santanu Bohidar, Sambalpur  Sir - The Union minister of state for petroleum and natural gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, has urged the Union water resources minister, Uma Bharti, to instruct the Chhattisgarh government to open the gates of the Kalma barrage. The closure of the gates has spelt disaster for Odisha's farmers. Pradhan was forced to take action after facing criticism from the BJD and the Congress that the BJP was not doing enough to safeguard Odisha's interests. This idea could be detrimental to the BJP, which is desperate to win the 2019 assembly elections in the state. Pradhan is being projected as the chief ministerial face of the BJP in Odisha. One wonders whether his action will make him popular. Yours faithfully, Manaswini Mohapatra, Cuttack Sir - The decision of the Chhattisgarh government to close the gates of the Kalma barrage has accentuated the conflict over the sharing of the Mahanadi waters. Chhattisgarh is trying to establish its dominance by taking a unilateral decision. It will affect agriculture in Odisha. Farmers in western Odisha are heavily dependent on the Mahanadi for irrigation purposes. The matter should be resolved at the earliest. Yours faithfully, Soma Mohapatra, Bhubaneswar  Sir - The restricted water flow in downstream Mahanadi is turning out to be a nightmare for farmers in Odisha. The Mahanadi is the lifeline of the state, especially the farming community in western Odisha. Bargarh, known as the rice bowl of Odisha, has been severely affected by the water shortage. The ruling BJD should be more proactive in its efforts to manage this crisis instead of calling hartals. Yours faithfully, Deepak Nanda, Bargarh  Sir - It is disheartening that the BJP government at the Centre has not spoken up about the Mahanadi water dispute between Odisha and Chhattisgarh. No state can claim to have sole rights over a river. The Union government should make an attempt to broker peace between the two states. Rising above political rivalries, the Centre should ensure that both states can benefit from the Mahanadi waters. Yours faithfully, Chintamani Behera, Kendrapara"

Ayush Pailuly, an MTech student, said this would be the most memorable final in years. Victory or defeat, the real fun lies in watching an India-Pakistan match with friends over a few drinks, he said. Pakistan is scoring well, raining sixes and fours and setting the stage for a mammoth target. The league matches were so one-sided. It is real contest when the chasing target crosses the 300 mark, added Nishant Singh Kaalkhanday, another MTech student of NIT FAMILY PACK Had it been any other Sunday, the Sinhas of Dhanbad would be digging into rice and mutton curry.

5a05ccd79855b76bf13c1032,Pious job: Structural conservation of Holy abode,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170625/jsp/odisha/story_158593.jsp,2017-06-25,"Nearly every person in Odisha and many beyond are devoted to Lord Jagannath and are concerned about what's happening to the temple complex in Puri. Unfortunately every person or commodity has a life span, including the Earth itself. Therefore the temple complex is not immortal and has a limited life. By constantly focusing our attention on this complex and continuously addressing the minor and major problems in the structure, the life of the temple complex can be extended, so as to seem that it will stay intact even in the distant future. Setting it right In the 1970s, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) took over charge for maintenance of the temple complex. Since then, about 17 stones have reportedly fallen from the main temple and other places. In 1992, corbel stones fell in front of the idol of Lord Balabhadra, which triggered an alarm all over the country. The then chief minister Biju babu had a responsive nature and called a meeting in September 1992 at the Townhall in Puri. The people attending this meeting spilled into the corridors of the hall. I had the privilege of being present. It was astonishing to see that the chief minister was profusely perspiring, but still answered patiently all the questions asked. This is where we learned about the ASI and some technical details about the temple complex, its problems and possible solutions. After that, the works department got involved in this work and a letter was addressed to the Government of India expressing concerns of the Government of Odisha in particular and the people of Odisha in general on November 8, 1992. Action was immediately taken in the last week of November. The deities were shifted to the front temple - Jagmohan - where the Lords sat on a neem pedestal singhasan (altar) (18ftx12ftx2ft) cladded with a brass sheet, prepared by the handicrafts department of Odisha. In February that year, it was suggested by the Government of India that the Government of Odisha should take over the structural conservation works of the main Garvgriha (sanctum sanctorum). That's when the government engineers started to learn about archaeological conservation. The director (conservation) Grover, director (science) R.K. Sharma, S. Maity, Chowle, all from ASI and A.P. Gupta from IIT, Kharagpur, were the guides. Garvgriha repairs This is a Rekha type temple. The sculptors of Odisha conceived this type of temple about 1,800 years ago. Temple building, evidence suggests, began about 1,500 years ago, starting with the smaller temples. Higher and higher temples were built subsequently, the effort culminating with the Sun Temple at Konark, which stood at a height of about 213ft (estimated - now collapsed). The inside rooms of all Odissan temples were square in plan. The thickness of four walls around this space was about 50 per cent of inside of clear dimension. The height of the temple could be four times the room size, but the limit was five times. (The failure of Konark main temple was possibly because the height was far more than five times the room size - 5 x 38ft - 190ft. There were multiple floors when the temple height was tall. For example, the Puri temple has three storeys. These diaphragms assist the temple to increase its resistance against earthquakes and wind pressure. In the case of the Puri temples, the floor heights are 13.8m(45.3ft), 10.7m (35ft) and 9.82m (32ft). The total height of the temple from the bottom of Nilachakra is 53.6m or about 173ft. The thickness of the floors is about one metre in which there are slits, which serve for ventilation. The temple is constructed of a less dense variety of stone, Khondalite, for ease of work, engraving statues, panels, moulds and so on. These stones have nevertheless withstood the vagaries of Puri's saline atmosphere comprising sulphate, chloride, nitrates and other dissolved solids for 800 years. No mortars, neither lime nor cementing materials, were used in these temples and the stability of the temple depended totally on anchorage between stones and provision of iron dowels. Iron dowels have a story. They have rusted over the past 800 years and are generating forces between stones. As a result, fascia stones are falling off. This happened when two amla stone segments fell in the late 1990s. The ASI replaced them. Works done The corbel stones, which support the floor stones, were in distress as the spans had to be reduced from 8.38m (30ft) to about 3m (10ft). The stress was at the edge of the protruding corbel stones and due to rusting of steel anchorages over 800 years, the cantilever corbles were pushed from the inside and falling off. Therefore a stainless steel space frame had to be introduced at a high level to support the floor slab. From this space frame each individual corbel stone found its stability. The worn-out stones in the walls were replaced on the inside and outside surfaces of the temple (this was not necessary for the floors, which were good condition). The entire inside, on the ground and first floors, the joints between stones were sealed and grouted. The first floor work could be done by using scaffolding and stone steps available from higher levels onwards, concealed in the walls. However, to allow movement of moisture, trapped inside the stone joints, grouting on the outside was done in bands to achieve moisture movement. There is no access to the second floor. Only four (13inchx18inch tunnels) were available at the clerestorey level at nearly the top of the temple. A large number of stones had fallen from the walls and the roof had fallen off. Nothing had been done before 1992, except giving a cushion of one metre thick rice husk, to minimise the shock and noise from the falling stones. In 1992-93, the rice husk was taken out from the inside, some of the fallen stones were reset, joints sealed and grouted with polymer cement suspension. Quite a few external and internal stones and statues needed to be fixed to the walls by drilling holes through them and thereafter inserting 25mm dia, stainless steel threaded bars, after which PMC or Epoxy grouting was done. On the top floor (second), no pinning could be done due to reasons of accessibility of the machine. Conservation In the past 65 years, we have seen how Khondalite stone statues in the Rajarani, Konark and other temples have deteriorated. Rajarani statues were the best exhibits from Odisha, but their pristine sharp features are already gone. The fate of statues and engravings of Konark, Sri Lingaraj (sandstone), Shri Jagannath and other temples is far worse. Khondalite is a metamorphie-sedimentary rock, banded structure, brownish in colour with quartz, graphite and other minerals. Its porosity varies from 7.8 per cent to 12.4 per cent. For this reason, it is susceptible to weathering, which results in concerting the material of either Kaolin with quartz and ferric hydroxide or in more advanced stages, a laterite material containing mainly hydroxides of iron and aluminium. For stone conservation, a vast number of materials are used depending on their composition. For Khondalite strengtheners, a base of ethyle silicate are being used and on penetrating the stone it is converted back into silica or quartz and becomes a mineral binder, silica gel, which combines with stone. It allows the stone to ""breathe"", thereby eliminating moisture (water vapour) pressure on the stones. However, Khondalite being a comparatively weak material, the disintegration due to pollution and water action still occurs. Therefore loss of beauty of the statues and engravings cannot be altogether prevented and with time all these temples, including Konark, will only be plain masses of rock. In conclusion, material science is developing and with effort, we may be able to substantially prolong the life of the temples, but we will not be able to preserve their original beauty.

5a05cf5d9855b76bf13c10cd,Businesslike meeting,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170701/jsp/opinion/story_159487.jsp,2017-07-01,"This time Narendra Modi hasn't tried to impress us desis and dehatis by boasting he enjoys the singular privilege of calling the Great White Chief ""Donald"". Perhaps the astute Jaishankar Subrahmanyam pointed out that even while he was bragging about being on first name terms with Barack Obama, the American president lost no public opportunity of addressing him with the utmost formality and no hint of the familiarity he claimed as ""Mr Prime Minister"" or ""Mr Modi"". Jaishankar may also have reminded him that Trump's comments and the joint statement demonstrated again the truth of Calvin Coolidge's comment that ""the business of America is business"". This column underlined during the election campaign that with larger private construction projects in India than probably anywhere else outside North America, Trump was unlikely to disturb the relationship. His aides rightly argue that far from contradicting each other, the ""Make in India"" and ""America First"" slogans would converge if F-16 and F/A-18 fighters are made in India, for spares would then have to be imported from the United States of America. But important as business is, there are other drivers. Apart from the ""American Dream"" of millions of educated young Indians, the US ""is the indispensable partner"" for realizing ""India's four key priorities -- energizing the economy, raising our technology and management capabilities, securing the homeland, and ensuring a favourable balance of power"" - as Jaishankar told the Carnegie Endowment three years ago. The moot question as Modi trots off to Israel but not Palestine is how to serve these ends without surrendering what remains of a once vigorously independent foreign policy. Apart from Tribeca Developers, Washington's reasons for courting India are rooted in the lone superpower's global aspirations. Despite claims that the separate strands of US policy don't add up to ""a zero sum game"", bilateral relationships must fit into the bigger picture like a jigsaw puzzle's pieces. It's even truer now as an American army colonel wrote a decade ago, ""If US relations with China deteriorate, then India becomes much more important. Similarly, if US relations with China improve, then India could become somewhat less crucial as a strategic partner."" We are witnessing a period of deteriorating Sino-US relations. As for Pakistan, rejoicing Indians should realize Syed Salahuddin's indictment doesn't mean support for India in the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. In fact, the state department's ""Indian-administered"" description reveals open-ended options. The US opposes jihadi violence, while India objects to territorial pretensions. Nor does the US endorse Indian variants of the ""Delenda est Carthago"" (Carthage must be destroyed) war cry with which Cato the Elder ended every speech in 2nd Century BC Rome. The rationale for relying on Pakistan hasn't changed since March 1949 when a memorandum by the US joint chiefs of staff dismissed South Asia - with one exception - as a region of ""negligible positive strategic importance"". The exception was Pakistan which ""might be required as a base for air operations against central USSR and as a staging area for forces engaged in the defence or recapture of Middle East oil areas"". Later, Pakistan was useful for espionage. Still later, it provided a conduit to China. Pakistan played a critical role in the American response to Nine-Eleven. Pakistan still matters because, as General Anthony Zinni, commander of US Central Command, warned, if the military or religious hardliners take over ""we'll see a theocracy like Iran"" or ""another failed state like Afghanistan"". His report described Pakistan as a major centre of Islamic terrorism where Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and the Taliban operated and trained ""either with active support from elements in the government or with their knowledge and lack of interference"" and al Qaida had set up shop. While all this explained why the US could not afford to disengage with Pakistan, none of it had much bearing on Indian allegations regarding Pakistani mischief in Kashmir which is well enough documented even by American officials. A five-page report by the House of Representatives task force on Kashmir accused the Inter-Services Intelligence of giving Kashmiri mujahideen the powerful long-range missiles that the US had developed for the Afghan resistance. A Congressman demanded that Pakistan shut down terrorist bases, and another introduced a bill naming Pakistan as a country whose government ""has repeatedly provided support for international terrorism"". The state department's Patterns of Global Terrorism report noted ""there were credible reports in 1994 of official Pakistani support to the Kashmiri militants"". The White House remained unmoved until terrorists struck at home. Modi has been criticized for not broaching the subjects of H1B visas and racist attacks with his host. Perhaps he realized (or was advised) that pleas on the first count would amount to a shameful admission of India's inability to provide for its best trained and most talented youth even while the prime minister goes gallivanting about the world. As for the second, a blunt man like Trump could easily turn round and retort, ""If they don't like it here, who asked them to come?"" Lasting partnerships are built on more substantial foundations of national interest. Hence the abiding importance of business. George W. Bush didn't mince his words addressing the Asia Society in Washington on the eve of visiting India. He linked ""the growing prosperity of the Indian people"" with ""the potential market it offers for America's goods and services"". Others claim Bush was dazzled by the notion of a billion Indian democrats. Bush himself admitted to being dazzled by India's middle class buying air-conditioners, kitchen appliances, and washing machines, a lot of them from American companies like GE, Whirlpool, and Westinghouse. ""Younger Indians are acquiring a taste for pizzas from Domino's, Pizza Hut,"" he said to laughter. ""And Air India ordered 68 planes valued at more than $11 billion from Boeing, the single largest commercial aeroplane order in India's civilian aviation history."" Business has a hoary past. The fabled phrase ""There is the East. There is India"" carved on a statue honouring the 19th century Missouri senator, Thomas Hart Benton, expressed his faith that the railway from St Louis to San Francisco would be the ""western route to Asia"" along which would pour the spices Columbus sought, ""the teas, silks and crepes of China, the Cashmeres of Thibet, the diamonds of India and Borneo..."" The threat of US import restrictions implicit in Trump's demand for ""a fair and reciprocal"" trading relationship (although the $24-billion trade gap in India's favour is a fleabite against China's $347-billion surplus) will severely test India's diplomacy. But India is no stranger to grappling with such challenges while seeking to cooperate with the US in crucial areas without surrendering an independent foreign policy that is presumably still New Delhi's aim. India abstained when the US, Britain and France imposed economic sanctions against Libya, but had to toe the line after Washington cut off aid to Yemen for not supporting the anti-Iraq coalition, though still refusing to denounce the ""Asian Hitler"", as the American president called Saddam Hussein. Some years ago, the US embargo against Cuba forced India to go to considerable lengths to disguise as a sale a gift of rice that had been promised to Castro. This time, the furtiveness seems to be about endorsing stronger sanctions against North Korea despite India being one of Pyongyang's biggest trading partners and a major food aid provider. Trump and Modi also agreed iftar is redundant: the White House abandoned the reception Bill Clinton introduced while no central minister attended Pranab Mukherjee's in Rashtrapati Bhavan. But while Trump can't be faulted for following Palmerston's injunction about a nation's permanent interests, one wonders whether Modi showered praise on Sushma Swaraj in Washington to distract attention from the lack of coherence and consistency in foreign policy or its shift from the independent mooring of so many decades. We might know if Modi moots the two-state solution in Israel."

The Dalhousie outlet of an electronic home appliances chain is bustling with people. Saturday, 4.30pm: The same outlet does not even have five customers. A group of employees is seen watching a film on a smart phone. July 1: The shopping frenzy that had marked the run-up to the implementation of GST fizzled out a day after the tax structure came into force, the contrast most evident at shops selling electronic goods. Several traders, unsure of the effect the new tax structure will have on prices, are waiting for old stocks to clear and charge GST on fresh products. Customers who had thought that essential commodities would become costlier overnight were relieved to find the prices of their preferred brand of spice or shaving cream unchanged. At Janbazaar near New Market, the cheapest variety of rice sold at Rs 35 a kilo today, same as yesterday. The price of masoor dal, too, remained unchanged at Rs 60 a kilo. ""I cannot charge more till old stocks are cleared,"" said the owner of a grocery store. The drop in footfall was most evident at stores selling electronic home appliances. Shops where there was not an inch of space and employees struggled to handle the customer rush yesterday wore an empty look today. Employees at most shops said they had run out of stock on almost all items because of the buying spree over the past week. Piles of TV sets stood packed on the pavement outside the Dalhousie store of Great Eastern Trading Corporation. ""All these are sold items. They will be delivered today,"" said an executive. The section selling TVs will remain shut for customers till Monday. ""We are waiting for the companies to update us on the modified MRP. We can sell goods only after that,"" said a senior employee of the store. At the Esplanade outlet of KC Das, a singara cost Rs 13 today, a rupee more than yesterday. ""Calculating a 12 per cent rate, the price would have been Rs 13.40. We have rounded it off,"" said Dhiman Das, one of the directors. Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick put up a notice at its Bhowanipore shop, announcing that GST would be charged on all items. ""We have learnt that there will be a five per cent tax on sweets and 12 per cent tax on savouries,"" said Sudip Mullick, one of the owners. Balaram's signature Baked Rosogolla, which sold at Rs 15 per piece till yesterday, is now a rupee costlier. Prerna Sharma, a Caf Coffee Day regular, was greeted with a pleasant surprise when she dropped in at the Bentinck Street outlet of CCD with her colleagues today. ""Earlier the total tax, including VAT, service tax and other cess, would come to 21 per cent. Now we are charging 18 per cent GST,"" said the manager of the store. Her favourite Cappuccino was two rupees cheaper at Rs 112, while the price of Smoked Chicken Sandwich (Rs 158) dropped by nearly Rs 10."

The samples were collected based on a directive from the Commissioner of Food Safety, said O.L.S. Vijay, Designated Officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Dr. Vijay said that no instances of plastic rice sold or detected have been reported in Coimbatore so far.We have not received any complaints related to plastic rice here, said Dr. Vijay.According to officials, plastic or synthetic rice can be identified through simple methods if people are doubtful about the genuineness. Unlike normal rice, plastic or synthetic rice are likely to float if put in a glass of water. Similarly, synthetic grains will easily burn like plastic if set on fire. If the grains are not natural, the cooked rice will have longer shelf life too according to officials.While normal rice gets fried when heated in a pan, plastic rice will is easily melted due to the heat.Similarly, the colour of the batter made of synthetic rice will be slightly yellowish while the one made out of natural rice will be whitish.In case of suspicion over the quality of rice, public can contact FSSAI at 0422-2220922, 94440-42322."

These reports were unfounded and baseless. The people need not panic as no such case had been reported so far. The government would give away the cash prize if any clue on the so-called plastic rice was provided, he said.Officials and organisations like the Rice Millers Association had already clarified that there was no possibility of cooking with plastic rice. The misconceptions were that it would float, bounce and cost the same as regular rice continued to flood the social media.The videos to distinguish between real rice and the so-called plastic variety also flooded it.

He will be attending the state reception for the PM in Tel Aviv. For him and the entire Indian Jewish community based in Israel, the visit of the first ever Indian PM to Israel means more than just business. It is about recognising the silent but consistent support that Israel has provided India, whether it was during the Bhuj earthquake, (a baby born then at the Israel mobile medical camp was named `Israeli) or in the field of science, technology, agriculture, medicine, diamond trading and most certainly Defence.According to Samuel, buses are being orgainsed from around 25 regions of Israel with a sizable Indian Jewish population for the welcome reception in Tel Aviv. The sponsors also belong to the Indian Gujarati diamond community based in Israel. For them its like a mini festival. You can never take India out of me, says Ivan who immigrated to Israel in 1986 at the age of 26.The Indian value system of humility and respect is what he passes on to his three `Sabra (Israeli born) children. They love India for its spirit and its mystic appeal. India is also one of the most popular tourist destination for the Israeli backpackers. Infact, regions in the North of India, have hoardings and food menus written in Hebrew. The locals in the tourism and hospitality business in Kulu Manali, Dharmasala, parts of Rajasthan and of course Goa, speak the Hebrew language fluently.Abraham Caustill, a member of the Bagdadi community left India for Israel in 1952, wherein he witnessed the spirit of nation building during his early years in Israel. From living on rice water and boil eggs to literally converting the desert into agricultural land, he remembers his early days in Israel with fondness. However it is the days he spent in the Byculla area of Mumbai, that takes him on a real nostalgic trip. For him and many other Indian Jews, India is forever their motherland and Israel their father land. India is the only country in the world that accepted the Jews wholeheartedly, anti-Semitic feels being unheard off.Elizabeth Assor left India when she was just six years of age, but speaks fluent Hindi. All thanks to her mother Florrie Shapurker who ensured her children learn and speak the national language of India, though she migrated in the year 1968. They are thrilled to learn that the PM of India is finally coming to Israel.For Ivan who stepped into Israel from India with only dollar 350 in hand, in 1986 and steadily built his business from imports to now in the high tech space, it would be interesting to explore the `Make in India initiative. He is quite confident that the PM will speak about some positive reforms to encourage trade and dialogue between the two countries and ancient civilizations, who received their independence a year apart from each other.Leora Micah Joseph, former staff at the Israeli Consulate office in Mumbai, has some interesting observations to share. She states that, Before 1992, though there were no full diplomatic ties, there were many ongoing programmes of cooperation between the two nations, albeit on a low level. Israel has a development programme for professionals from developing countries called MASHAV. India was one of the countries whose professionals were invited to train in Israel in varied fields such as Medicine, Agriculture, Social Work, Education as well as programmes targeted for Trade Unions. In fact the late Appasaheb Pawar  brother of Sharad Pawar too had been to Israel, way before the diplomatic ties were established. She further shares that, the Labour Union in Israel had a close relationship with Indian labour organizations and trade unions. Many trade union leaders such as the late Somnath Dube, the late Sharad Rao as well as the late George Fernandes  all had been to Israel at a time when India and Israel did not have formal relations, (way before 1992) . However, after 1992, the relations between Israel and India flourished. Business / trade between the two countries jumped up tremendously in a very short time. Israeli companies like Netafim came to India. The Israeli airline ELAL began operations in December 1993. This made life of the Indian Jews so much easier as we now for the first time in decades were able to fly directly to Israel. After a while Air India too started flying, and it made life for all Indians so much easier as more and more of us could fly to Israel and it kept the prices competitive. It was a huge blow to Indians and Indian Jews when Air India stopped direct flights to Israel. But, she concludes by saying, We Indian Jews are proud of your Indian origin and I am positive that this will lead to further strengthening of relationships between the land of Namaste and Shalom.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Discussion has revolved around an apparent paradox: why are farmers rioting after a bumper crop? But any student of economics knows that prices fall after bumper harvests, which is good for consumers but terrible for farmers. This is why the government needs to step in to buy from farmers at a minimum support price, while subsidising consumers so that they get affordable food. This is what we have done over the last fifty years after setting up the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in 1965.If this system has been in place for so long, why are we still lurching from crisis to crisis? For long, we have said that the solution is to get people off farming. While there is no doubt we need to create more jobs in manufacturing, we must not forget that even in the year 2050, according to the latest projections, there will still be 800 million people living in rural India. And just one look at the state of Indian cities makes it clear that endlessly moving people from villages to cities could actually deepen the urban imbroglio. So solutions have to be found for agriculture  and fast.Use and abuse of soil, waterThe problem with Indian agriculture is that we are still stuck with the so-called Green Revolution of the 1970s. I use the prefix so-called for a specific reason. Yes, there was a dramatic rise in food production. And India no longer needs to beg for food in the world market. But this was primarily a rice and wheat revolution. It completely neglected two-thirds of Indian agriculture and crops grown and eaten by the poorest people of our country  pulses and millets. There is also nothing green about this revolution because, over the years, it has caused a deep crisis of sustainability, economic and ecological. Large-scale use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides has had an extremely adverse impact on our soil and water. Deep drilling by tubewells to grow these water-intensive crops has happened without any reference whatsoever to Indias unique hydrogeology, where nearly two-thirds of our land is underlain by hard rock formations which have very low rates of natural recharge.This has meant that there is now a serious water crisis, with both water tables and water quality falling rapidly. We have arsenic, fluoride, mercury, even uranium in our drinking water, creating serious health issues. What is worse, to get the same increase in production, farmers have had to apply more and more fertilisers and pesticides over time. This dramatically raises costs of cultivation, without a proportionate increase in production. More than 3,00,000 farmers have committed suicide over the last two decades, which has absolutely no precedent in Indian history.Sustainable agricultureSo what can we do to address these twin tragedies of suicides and violence by farmers? First, we need to transition to a more ecologically resilient agriculture. This becomes even more urgent in the context of climate change. Large-scale evidence now exists that non-chemical agriculture has become a profitable alternative. As farmers reduce their dependence on synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, they slowly emerge from the ecological vicious cycle and are also able to dramatically reduce their costs of cultivation, without compromising on production. The biggest votary of non-chemical farming is the Prime Minister himself. He has also launched the Soil Health Card Scheme, which potentially enables farmers to more carefully manage input regimes. The government must announce a comprehensive package to give a green direction to the nature of subsidies in the sector.Second, we must radically reform the management of both surface and groundwater to ensure that the water in our irrigation commands reaches the farmers for whom it is meant and groundwater is managed sustainably in a way that ensures that no one is deprived of their right to water for life. There is positive movement in both these directions within government except for some hesitation in going ahead with a new model groundwater Bill drafted by the Ministry of Water Resources. This landmark Bill seeks to replace archaic British Common Law from the 19th century, which has provided legal legitimacy to the over-extraction of groundwater that underpins the current agrarian crisis. The new law needs urgent adoption and advocacy with the States by the Government of India.On diversificationThird, we require continued diversification to other forms of livelihood, such as livestock and fisheries, among the fastest-growing segments of the rural economy, which could be hurt by recent policy changes. We must also shift focus away from water-intensive rice and wheat. This means radical changes in the way we grow these crops (seed, water and input regimes) but also much greater encouragement to millets and pulses, which are nutritionally far superior alternatives in a country beset with the diabetes epidemic. The key change required here is aggressive and extensive procurement of these crops by the government. FCI procurement focusses only on rice and wheat although this year we saw some initial steps in the direction of procurement of pulses. This is a welcome move but needs to go much further. The best way would be to include millets and pulses in the massive anganwadi and mid-day meal programmes.Fourth, investments in agro-processing infrastructure are urgently required that would enable farmers to move up the value chain. We cannot continue to have them dumping their vegetables and milk on the road. They should be processed before they are sold and farmers must get their due share in the value chain.Fifth, we need to ensure access to credit and crop insurance, especially to our 85% small and marginal farmers. This is why I am strongly opposed to farm loan waivers as they destroy the integrity of the banking system and potentially undermine the extraordinary anti-poverty initiative led by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of women across the country. So many of these extremely poor women, with more than 97% loan recovery ratios, have helped the banking system survive in remote rural India. All this great work of providing an alternative to the usurious moneylender-traders is threatened by loan waivers.Finally, we need strong Farmer Producer Organisations, to overcome massive handicaps faced by isolated farmers and enable them to really benefit from market participation.Demonetisation crunchWhile many cumulative factors have taken a toll on farmers over decades, more proximate factors explain the outbreak of extreme violence. Speaking to farmers and traders, it appears that demonetisation squeezed so much liquidity out of the system that traders did not have requisite cash to buy the farmers produce. Farmers also feel that persisting with imports, even after clear signs of a bumper harvest, further depressed prices. Having lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, I do not recall a crash in prices as dramatic as this years, that too in the peak of summer. In Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, prices of tuar, gram, soybean, grapes, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, milk, garlic, cumin, coriander and fenugreek are at historical lows. And when this happens in crops with high costs of cultivation and inadequate government support, the impact is catastrophic, leading to what the Reserve Bank of India has called fire sales. Which has also created apprehensions about kharif sowing. No wonder the farmers are upset.Violence shows no way forward. But this is a juncture agrarian policy reform in India cannot afford to ignore. Only a comprehensive policy response can ensure that farmers distress becomes a thing of the past.Mihir Shah, a member of the erstwhile Planning Commission, has lived in remote rural Madhya Pradesh for the last three decades, working on issues of water and livelihood security"

Snatching and robbing credit has become a part of the political ideology today, the Sena said.However, despite the rush to take credit, the public is aware of the truth which is a respite, the ally said.The Shiv Sena had recently said that the loan waiver decision was due to its constant throttling of the Maharashtra government and that it has opted to remain in power to shake chairs of lazy person.The party also asked the chief minister to revive the Zunka Bhakar Kendra scheme, which was started during the Shiv Sena-BJP government in the state in the 90s, to provide traditional food to the poor at Re 1.You may take credit for this as well if you wish to.But at least people will benefit from the scheme, the Sena said.The scheme  providing zunka, a Maharashtrian dish prepared with gram flour and water, and bhakar, a chapati made of rice flour or bajra  was stopped by the previous Congress-NCP government.The scheme had envisaged addressing the states socio-economic problem by allotting stalls to the unemployed throughout the state.

Debate rages in Cauvery delta,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/time-to-skip-kuruvai-debate-rages-in-cauvery-delta/article19034780.ece,2017-06-14,"Should farmers of Cauvery delta have to go in for paddy cultivation during the Kuruvai season at all? What if they abandon Kuruvai ?Experts, government officials as well as leaders of farmers are mulling these questions, given that for the fifth year in succession, the scheduled opening date of water from Mettur dam  June 12  has been missed for want of water in the dam. Besides, the core constituents of Cauvery delta  Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts  are fast witnessing deterioration in their groundwater position. To give an illustration, one has to dig 300 ft in Thanjavur town, in the words of veteran geologist P.M. Natarajan, for a sustainable bore well. In many other places, the average groundwater level varies between 600 ft and 1,000 ft.Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University K. Ramasamy is emphatic. Give holiday for Kuruvai, he says.The Vice Chancellor goes on to say that it is only after deep reflection that he wants to give this call to the Cauvery delta farming community, which he says is quick to grasp changing realities. He adds that he is making this suggestion based on sound reasons.Salinity intrusion is taking place in many parts of the delta and even in interior areas, say Vaduvur, which is about 20 km from Mannargudi. I am coming across reports of the groundwater turning saline, which is extremely disturbing, he says.The reasons are not far to seek. Power supply for farm pumpsets is given free of cost. Hence, there is no compulsion for farmers to take seriously power supply or drawing excess groundwater.Saving for SambaEchoing Mr. Ramasamys view, S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, says: Let us conserve water for the Samba season when it is an open secret that the groundwater table is going down steeply. During Samba, paddy is raised over a period of 150 days (July/August to December/January). More importantly, it provides livelihood to a large number of landless labourers, he points out.But, Agriculture Minister R. Doraikannu, who hails from Papanasam of Thanjavur district, strongly defends the practice of paddy cultivation during Kuruvai. You will have to keep the farmers engaged with productive work. This is why encouragement is given to them to raise paddy, he explains.The minister says the Kuruvai package of assistance has been worked out, taking into consideration the forecast of the Meteorological department that the southwest monsoon will yield more rainfall this year than in the previous year. We are providing assistance to farmers for growing pulses too.A senior official in his department says that the support to Kuruvai means that you are supporting 1.2 lakh families in rural Tamil Nadu.Besides, one cannot gloss over the seasons contribution to food security in the State. However, a leading trader, D. Thulasingam, says that with the free movement of paddy or rice across the country, the absence of paddy cultivation during Kuruvai will not make any difference. But, he justifies the governments support to the farmers as  it is a matter of livelihood to the farming community.Neighbours adviceAnother government official says Karnataka has been arguing for years that Tamil Nadu should give up Kuruvai. But, it is only during this season that the yield is higher and the farmers get income at the time of Navaratri or Deepavali festival.Who wants Kuruvai ? What is the point in promoting paddy cultivation during the Kuruvai season, when you have no water in the Cauvery river and the falling groundwater table ? Let the State government exert pressure on the Central and Karnataka governments to ensure the implementation of the Supreme Courts order in March that 2,000 cubic feet per second be released to Tamil NaduS.

5a05f1d99855b76bf13c223d,More to it than MSP,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/more-to-it-than-msp/article18968876.ece,2017-06-13,"Agricultural distress is often viewed as a short-term phenomenon in which farmers look for support from various quarters on account of being unable to get a gainful return due to price crash, poor marketing facilities, rising credit burden, increasing cost of inputs and frequent occurrence of natural calamities. A prolonged unrest in rural India  such as the decision of Andhra Pradesh farmers not to sow in the 2011 kharif season and mark a crop holiday protest  will have serious consequences for food security.Agricultural distress has become a permanent feature due to the failure of not only elected governments to find a lasting solution but also local institutions such as community or social networks which are supposedly weakening because of increasing individualisation. The consequence is that helpless farmers are increasingly pushed to the brink of committing suicides.A tipping pointThe distress seems to have reached a tipping point, with scenes of dejected farmers throwing agricultural produce such as vegetables and milk on the roads becoming a routine feature in recent years. Rather than addressing the genuine problems of farmers, politicians are unfortunately busy scoring points over the deaths of innocent farmers.Are demands of our farmers unjust? Not really. They want a reasonable price for their produce, better marketing facilities, institutional credit, irrigation, quality seeds and fertilisers, procurement during times of market glut and a social safety net during natural calamities. These are the basic inputs and services farmers need to continue to engage in agricultural production. Many committees and commissions constituted in the past have looked into Indias farming conditions. Their recommendations have been shelved by successive governments.The non-availability of remunerative prices to farmers on agricultural produce is a vexed issue and emerges as the prime issue in various research studies wherein farmers are asked to rank production constraints. Will a rise in the minimum support price (MSP) solve the problem? Some critics argue that a rise in the MSP will lead to increase in food inflation, while others that it will augment farmers income. Both arguments rest on the mistaken notion that the MSP is a remunerative price. It is actually an insurance price, a floor price of sorts. Besides, a vast majority of the farming population is unaware of its existence.The Government of India has an MSP for 23 crops, but official procurement at the MSP is effectively limited to rice and wheat, and that too concentrated in a few States only. Awareness about the MSP is limited to States such as Punjab, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh where such procurement takes place. According to the National Sample Surveys (NSS) Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households 2013, even for paddy and wheat, less than one-third of farmers were aware of the MSP; for other crops, such awareness was negligible. Further, a substantial proportion of crops are sold to local private traders and input dealers to whom the resource-poor marginal and small landholders are obligated to sell their crops due to tie-up with credit.Since 2004, successive governments claimed to have increased institutional credit flow to the agricultural sector through increased budgetary allocation on crop loans. According to NSS data, over 40% of farmers still rely on non-institutional lenders, who mostly happen to be moneylenders-cum-traders and input dealers. Further, analysis of credit disbursement data from the Reserve Bank of India reveals that out of total advances to agriculture, the share of indirect finance has increased substantially over time, while that of direct finance to farmers has declined. This means that at the macro level, it would appear that there is an increase in credit flow to the agricultural sector but this has actually accrued to agro-business firms/corporations and not directly to the farmers. Consequently, marginal and small farmers continue to rely on traders and input dealers. Unless the fundamental problems of crop and regional bias of MSP policy, government procurement and access to institutional credit are addressed, mere increase in MSP will not benefit most farmers in the country.Further, the response of various State governments to a glut in the market appears to be muted. There exist intervention schemes to undertake the procurement of commodities whose market prices go below the MSP, but on most occasions the marketing season of bumper crops gets over by the time a bureaucratic decision on procurement is taken. Ultimately, the farmers are left at the mercy of unscrupulous traders to sell at whatever price they offer, with resultant repercussions such as the burning of the entire crop or throwing the harvested produce on roads in protest.Various studies show an increasing divergence between agricultural and non-agricultural income. And the rising aspirations among rural youth to emulate urban lifestyles put enormous pressure on them to find ways to increase income through various agricultural activities. Unfortunately, income from crop cultivation, which is a major segment of agriculture, is not growing enough to meet the expected level. On the contrary, the increasing market orientation and reforms in the input sector have resulted in a substantial rise in input costs.Dipping incomeAnalysis of data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare reveal that income from cultivation of many cereals and pulses has declined between 2004-05 and 2013-14 despite a considerable increase in MSP during this period. In the case of paddy, out of 18 major rice-growing States, net income has declined in five, and it is negative in six States. In seven States, it has increased only marginally. Income from the cultivation of even horticultural crops is uncertain due to the heavy investment involved and the high volatility in market prices. Most acute is the rise in prices of fertilisers: between 1991-92 and 2013-14, while the price of urea increased by 69%, that of DAP (diammonium phosphate) and potash rose by 300% and 600%, respectively.Recent policy pronouncements have added to the woes of already beleaguered farmers. The promotion of traditional farming at this juncture of agricultural development will take the sector to where it was decades ago. Most existing modern crop varieties will not respond to these practices in the medium term; consequently, yield and income will decline. Further, facilities to produce adequate organic inputs have not been developed either. Animal husbandry has been practised as a supplementary activity since time immemorial. Livestock acts as a cushion against crop loss during times of drought. The new rules on animal markets will put poor farmers and landless labourers in a fix. These developments do not augur well for rural youth whose interest in farming is already dwindling. While other developing countries are moving towards modernisation of agriculture which would reduce dependence of labour force and enable a rise in productivity, Indian agriculture is cluelessly plodding ahead.Elumalai Kannan is an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

Sunil Kumar on June 15, the organisers of the event said at a press conference here on Monday.Operating protocolKVK programme coordinator P. Jayaraj said the KVKs standard operating protocol for the northern midland laterite fields would be made mandatory for all rice-growing tracts of Mayyil.The slogan of the project was 300 kg rice from 10 cents of land, he said, adding provision of nutrients at critical stages of the growth to produce quality rice.He also said similar trials were conducted in the Kuttyattur panchayat where more than eight-tonne rice per paddy was produced by adopting the same method.Agricultural officials said the entire area where the paddy was being revived had been prepared for cultivation by utilising machinery available with the Agricultural Department and other agencies.16 tonnes of seedsThey also said 16 tonnes of seeds procured from the Seed Authority, agricultural farms, and the Kerala Agricultural University were being used for the paddy revival project in the first crop season. Sufficient seeds would be distributed among farmers during second season also, they said.A farmer producer organisation (FPO) had already been already incorporated under the Companys Act to hand-hold all farmers in Mayyil.The FPO would be acting a lead role in production, management, harvesting, processing and marketing of rice. The project was conceived under Samrudhi 2017 of Taliparamaba Constituency under the aegis of James Mathew, MLA."

The device makes use of a technology for selective drying of weedy rice panicles by direct contact application of a safe, green label herbicide.The process takes advantage of the earliness in flowering and tallness of weedy rice compared to cultivated rice, Ms.Nimmy told The Hindu . Application has been filed for getting Indian patent for the device. The technology has been transferred to Raidco Kerala Limited, a Government of Kerala enterprise.Weedy rice is a product of natural hybridization between cultivated rice and wild rice. Morphological and biochemical similarity of weedy rice to cultivated rice makes hand weeding and herbicidal control ineffective.The huge infestation of weedy rice in rice fields and subsequent huge reduction in yield (50-70 per cent) have forced many farmers to abandon the rice farming and leave the field fallow in the past, she said.Transplanting, deep tillage, cutting of earheads of weedy rice at flowering, and use of higher seed rate were the traditional practices followed for managing weedy rice. Shift in the crop establishment method from transplanting to direct sowing of pre-germinated seeds, dependence on pesticides, reduced tillage practices, acute shortage and high cost of labour are among reasons behind the shift in weed flora. Early flowering in weedy rice (20-25 days) compared to cultivated rice and shattering of weedy rice grains have contributed to the soil seed bank, adding to the severity of infestation.The product has been recommended by Krishi bhavans. It has been tested successfully in Kuttanad and other areas. Several padasekharams have already started using the machine, Ms.Nimmy, Assistant Professor at the Rice Research Station, said.The research conducted by her under the guidance of C.T. Abraham, former Professor and Head, All India Coordinated Research Project on Weed Control, Kerala Agricultural University, could also standardise an integrated strategy for the management of weedy rice in fields with a history of persistence of the menace.It included modified stale seed bed technique by ploughing for exhausting the soil seed bank (of weedy rice), and modifying the time, method and dose of pre-plant herbicide application to prevent the germination of weedy rice by pre-sowing surface application of herbicide."

(Right) Business is still going strong at Annapurna poli-bhaji kendra, a five-minute walk from Thane station, which was opened by Anushka and Amit Mulye 28 years ago.Sandeep RasalMany middle-class Maharashtrian Mumbaikars have moved away from the centre of the city and now can be found around the northern suburbs and the satellite cities, where they are joined by migrants from other parts of the State. As with an increasing number of middle-income families, both spouses tend to work, and in jobs far away in the city. An early train out and a late-night return leaves little time to cook three meals a day, so for many, this means subsisting on whatever they can afford to buy outside.In the late 1970s, a few smart entrepreneurs realised there was an unfulfilled need for home-cooked Maharashtrian food in the city. One of them was Jayashree Kanitkar, who in 1978 started one of the earliest poli-bhaji kendras in Dombivili, Trimurti Gruha Udyog. It started exclusively as a takeaway counter catering to office-goers and others who craved home-made food. Whether it was Ms. Kanitkar or some other person who was the first is open to debate. But soon, many other entrepreneurial souls joined in. These kendras served freshly made everyday Maharashtrian fare cooked the way they would be in middle-class homes: poli and a variety of bhajis, and also breakfast items such as poha and upma, all at low prices.Strategically situatedTheir primary clientele being the middle-class office-going crowd, most kendras are close to a railway station or bus stand. A typical kendra was and still is a no-frills, family-run establishment with minimal staff. There is usually zero outsourcing of cooking. At most, if faced with a shortage of family members, the owners might rope in a few known persons from their neighbourhood to assist in serving and packaging, but cooking is almost always done by the family. This ensures that the taste and quality is preserved through the decades.Customers pick the combinations they want from the limited but wholesome range of items displayed in wide containers. (Most kendras still dont bother with printed menus; at most, there will be a blackboard with the days fare scrawled boldly in chalk.) The poli component refers to soft, dry chapatis or phulkas, sometimes smeared with a light touch of oil; some centres will also serve rice rotis, and jowar and finger-millet bhakris. Then there will be one or two varieties of spicy bhaji: brinjals, cluster beans, French beans, or other seasonal vegetables. These could be cooked dry or in a gravy rich with a mix of finely-ground masalas. Aside from these, you could also get bhaath (steamed rice), varan (a thick yellow dal without any added flavouring, except for a jeera-rai tadka), amti (a sweet dal with jaggery and kokum), pitala (a besan-based curry) and a sweet dish (dessert).A few kendras also offer traditional fish and chicken dishes. Some also offer seasonal speciality beverages, such as kairi panha (a raw mango-based drink), masala buttermilk, and solkadhi (a kokum-based spicy drink).The exact flavour of the food depends on the origins and culture of the family who run it, and, typically, they attract people from the same region yearning for the taste of home. At Gajanan, in Dombivili West, for instance, Khandeshi food reigns: stuffed brinjals, sev masala bhaji, a variety of hand-rolled bhakris, and fish and meat dishes. Monika Surse, the owner, says she has her loyal clientele for more than 16 years now. Or Maansi in Kalyan, which serves Malwani food items including tandlachi bhakri, paplet fry, bandga fry, and amboli.If there is diversification, it tends to fall within the broad spectrum of traditional food. At Annapurna, a five-minute walk from Thane station, for example, stocks a variety of papads, powders, and chutneys. Anushka and Amit Mulye, the owners, say business is still going strong, 28 years since they opened shop. The combination of choice, economy and the familiarity of the food meant that the kendras met with rapturous welcomes wherever they sprang up, and they mushroomed across the citys periphery. The no-frills food and lack of marketing notwithstanding, their shopfronts were soon packed with customers any morning or evening during commuting hours. Office-goers got into the habit of taking their lunchboxes to these establishments and loading them up before they set out to work, and perhaps picking up a parcel for dinner on the way home too.The Kulkarnis (they declined to give their first names) of Dombivli East, for example, followed a routine for decades: every morning, as they rushed to board their train by 7.30 am, they would fill their lunch boxes with food from Trimurti. Theyre both retired now, and no longer as active as they used to be, but they continue to visit to satisfy their cravings.Its not just the old-school customer, though. Young people, whether single or married, unskilled in cooking or just unable to fit in time for it, find the kendras irresistible too. Like Uma Vakole, who moved to Thane from a small village in Maharastra in search of better job prospects. At a kendra in her new neighbourhood, the homesick young woman discovered food exactly the way her mother would make it; she is now a loyal and regular customer.Loyal clientleThis reporter asked Sushila Landge  who has been running Kshudha Shanti in Dombivili West since 1993  whether her business has been affected by the fast food centres and desi Chinese stalls that have sprouted up in her neighbourhood. She isnt worried, she says. Her kendra has its niche clientle, and they have remained loyal through the years. People who need hot and fresh food will always frequent us, so we arent worried nor do we plan to diversify as a grocery store or stock condiments. This is our core venture and we will continue with it. Other proprietors echoed her words and her confidence.It wasnt long before the kendras spread beyond their strongholds in Dombivili, Mulund, Thane and Kalyan, and took root in Pune, Aurangabad, Satara, and other cities in the State.Some kendras have diversified in a small way, taking catering orders for traditional functions, or making sweets for religious festivals. Omkar, another long-running establishment  in business for 20 years now  also runs a catering outfit that takes orders for functions and ceremonies.Some have attempted to beat new-fangled competition by making modest expansions, like adding a table or two and a few plastic chairs. For the most part, though, the kendras have stayed the same for more than a quarter of a century. They do not stock or sell regular grocery items, confectionery, or carbonated beverages. They remain humble and nondescript, content with their regular clientle.Quite remarkably, despite inflation and even when their customer base grows, most kendras have raised prices only marginally. We have to think of the customers, one proprietor says. For many of them, this is the only option they have, for home-cooked food.Comfort foodAnd their customers, of course, are always grateful, secure in the knowledge that despite the plethora of options in the megacity, and the internet era convenience of app-driven delivery, they can still find Maharashtrian comfort food at their poli-bhaji kendra."
5a05fc6b9855b76bf13c295c,How genetics is settling the Aryan migration debate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/how-genetics-is-settling-the-aryan-migration-debate/article19091109.ece,2017-06-17,"The thorniest, most fought-over question in Indian history is slowly but surely getting answered: did Indo-European language speakers, who called themselves Aryans, stream into India sometime around 2,000 BC  1,500 BC when the Indus Valley civilisation came to an end, bringing with them Sanskrit and a distinctive set of cultural practices? Genetic research based on an avalanche of new DNA evidence is making scientists around the world converge on an unambiguous answer: yes, they did.This may come as a surprise to many  and a shock to some  because the dominant narrative in recent years has been that genetics research had thoroughly disproved the Aryan migration theory. This interpretation was always a bit of a stretch as anyone who read the nuanced scientific papers in the original knew. But now it has broken apart altogether under a flood of new data on Y-chromosomes (or chromosomes that are transmitted through the male parental line, from father to son).Lines of descentUntil recently, only data on mtDNA (or matrilineal DNA, transmitted only from mother to daughter) were available and that seemed to suggest there was little external infusion into the Indian gene pool over the last 12,500 years or so. New Y-DNA data has turned that conclusion upside down, with strong evidence of external infusion of genes into the Indian male lineage during the period in question.The reason for the difference in mtDNA and Y-DNA data is obvious in hindsight: there was strong sex bias in Bronze Age migrations. In other words, those who migrated were predominantly male and, therefore, those gene flows do not really show up in the mtDNA data. On the other hand, they do show up in the Y-DNA data: specifically, about 17.5% of Indian male lineage has been found to belong to haplogroup R1a (haplogroups identify a single line of descent), which is today spread across Central Asia, Europe and South Asia. Pontic-Caspian Steppe is seen as the region from where R1a spread both west and east, splitting into different sub-branches along the way.The paper that put all of the recent discoveries together into a tight and coherent history of migrations into India was published just three months ago in a peer-reviewed journal called BMC Evolutionary Biology. In that paper, titled A Genetic Chronology for the Indian Subcontinent Points to Heavily Sex-biased Dispersals, 16 scientists led by Prof. Martin P. Richards of the University of Huddersfield, U.K., concluded: Genetic influx from Central Asia in the Bronze Age was strongly male-driven, consistent with the patriarchal, patrilocal and patrilineal social structure attributed to the inferred pastoralist early Indo-European society. This was part of a much wider process of Indo-European expansion, with an ultimate source in the Pontic-Caspian region, which carried closely related Y-chromosome lineages across a vast swathe of Eurasia between 5,000 and 3,500 years ago.In an email exchange, Prof. Richards said the prevalence of R1a in India was very powerful evidence for a substantial Bronze Age migration from central Asia that most likely brought Indo-European speakers to India. The robust conclusions of Prof. Richards and his team rest on their own substantive research as well as a vast trove of new data and findings that have become available in recent years, through the work of genetic scientists around the world.Peter Underhill, scientist at the Department of Genetics at the Stanford University School of Medicine, is one of those at the centre of the action. Three years ago, a team of 32 scientists he led published a massive study mapping the distribution and linkages of R1a. It used a panel of 16,244 male subjects from 126 populations across Eurasia. Dr. Underhills research found that R1a had two sub-haplogroups, one found primarily in Europe and the other confined to Central and South Asia. Ninety-six per cent of the R1a samples in Europe belonged to sub-haplogroup Z282, while 98.4% of the Central and South Asian R1a lineages belonged to sub-haplogroup Z93. The two groups diverged from each other only about 5,800 years ago. Dr. Underhills research showed that within the Z93 that is predominant in India, there is a further splintering into multiple branches. The paper found this star-like branching indicative of rapid growth and dispersal. So if you want to know the approximate period when Indo-European language speakers came and rapidly spread across India, you need to discover the date when Z93 splintered into its own various subgroups or lineages. We will come back to this later.So in a nutshell: R1a is distributed all over Europe, Central Asia and South Asia; its sub-group Z282 is distributed only in Europe while another subgroup Z93 is distributed only in parts of Central Asia and South Asia; and three major subgroups of Z93 are distributed only in India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the Himalayas. This clear picture of the distribution of R1a has finally put paid to an earlier hypothesis that this haplogroup perhaps originated in India and then spread outwards. This hypothesis was based on the erroneous assumption that R1a lineages in India had huge diversity compared to other regions, which could be indicative of its origin here. As Prof. Richards puts it, the idea that R1a is very diverse in India, which was largely based on fuzzy microsatellite data, has been laid to rest thanks to the arrival of large numbers of genomic Y-chromosome data.Gene-dating the migrationNow that we know that there WAS indeed a significant inflow of genes from Central Asia into India in the Bronze Age, can we get a better fix on the timing, especially the splintering of Z93 into its own sub-lineages? Yes, we can; the research paper that answers this question was published just last year, in April 2016, titled: Punctuated bursts in human male demography inferred from 1,244 worldwide Y-chromosome sequences. This paper, which looked at major expansions of Y-DNA haplogroups within five continental populations, was lead-authored by David Poznik of the Stanford University, with Dr. Underhill as one of the 42 co-authors. The study found the most striking expansions within Z93 occurring approximately 4,000 to 4,500 years ago. This is remarkable, because roughly 4,000 years ago is when the Indus Valley civilization began falling apart. (There is no evidence so far, archaeologically or otherwise, to suggest that one caused the other; it is quite possible that the two events happened to coincide.)The avalanche of new data has been so overwhelming that many scientists who were either sceptical or neutral about significant Bronze Age migrations into India have changed their opinions. Dr. Underhill himself is one of them. In a 2010 paper, for example, he had written that there was evidence against substantial patrilineal gene flow from East Europe to Asia, including to India in the last five or six millennia. Today, Dr. Underhill says there is no comparison between the kind of data available in 2010 and now. Then, it was like looking into a darkened room from the outside through a keyhole with a little torch in hand; you could see some corners but not all, and not the whole picture. With whole genome sequencing, we can now see nearly the entire room, in clearer light.Dr. Underhill is not the only one whose older work has been used to argue against Bronze Age migrations by Indo-European language speakers into India. David Reich, geneticist and professor in the Department of Genetics at the Harvard Medical School, is another one, even though he was very cautious in his older papers. The best example is a study lead-authored by Reich in 2009, titled Reconstructing Indian Population History and published in Nature . This study used the theoretical construct of Ancestral North Indians (ANI) and Ancestral South Indians (ASI) to discover the genetic substructure of the Indian population. The study proved that ANI are genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Europeans, while the ASI were unique to India. The study also proved that most groups in India today can be approximated as a mixture of these two populations, with the ANI ancestry higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers. By itself, the study didnt disprove the arrival of Indo-European language speakers; if anything, it suggested the opposite, by pointing to the genetic linkage of ANI to Central Asians.However, this theoretical structure was stretched beyond reason and was used to argue that these two groups came to India tens of thousands of years ago, long before the migration of Indo-European language speakers that is supposed to have happened only about 4,000 to 3,500 years ago. In fact, the study had included a strong caveat that suggested the opposite: We caution that models in population genetics should be treated with caution. While they provide an important framework for testing historical hypothesis, they are oversimplifications. For example, the true ancestral populations were probably not homogenous as we assume in our model but instead were likely to have been formed by clusters of related groups that mixed at different times. In other words, ANI is likely to have resulted from multiple migrations, possibly including the migration of Indo-European language speakers.The spin and the factsBut how was this research covered in the media? Aryan-Dravidian divide a myth: Study, screamed a newspaper headline on September 25, 2009. The article quoted Lalji Singh, a co-author of the study and a former director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad as saying: This paper rewrites history there is no north-south divide. The report also carried statements such as: The initial settlement took place 65,000 years ago in the Andamans and in ancient south India around the same time, which led to population growth in this part. At a later stage, 40,000 years ago, the ancient north Indians emerged which in turn led to rise in numbers there. But at some point in time, the ancient north and the ancient south mixed, giving birth to a different set of population. And that is the population which exists now and there is a genetic relationship between the population within India. The study, however, makes no such statements whatsoever  in fact, even the figures 65,000 and 40,000 do not figure it in it!This stark contrast between what the study says and what the media reports said did not go unnoticed. In his column for Discover magazine, geneticist Razib Khan said this about the media coverage of the study: But in the quotes in the media the other authors (other than Reich that is - ed) seem to be leading you to totally different conclusions from this. Instead of leaning toward ANI being proto-Indo-European, they deny that it is.Lets leave that there, and ask what Reich says now, when so much new data have become available? In an interview with Edge in February last year, while talking about the thesis that Indo-European languages originated in the Steppes and then spread to both Europe and South Asia, he said: The genetics is tending to support the Steppe hypothesis because in the last year, we have identified a very strong pattern that this ancient North Eurasian ancestry that you see in Europe today, we now know when it arrived in Europe. It arrived 4500 years ago from the East from the Steppe... About India, he said: In India, you can see, for example, that there is this profound population mixture event that happens between 2000 to 4000 years ago. It corresponds to the time of the composition of the Rigveda, the oldest Hindu religious text, one of the oldest pieces of literature in the world, which describes a mixed society... In essence according to Reich, in broadly the same time frame, we see Indo-European language speakers spreading out both to Europe and to South Asia, causing major population upheavals.The dating of the profound population mixture event that Reich refers to was arrived at in a paper that was published in the American Journal of Human Genetics in 2013, and was lead authored by Priya Moorjani of the Harvard Medical School, and co-authored, among others, by Reich and Lalji Singh. This paper too has been pushed into serving the case against migrations of Indo-European language speakers into India, but the paper itself says no such thing, once again!Heres what it says in one place: The dates we report have significant implications for Indian history in the sense that they document a period of demographic and cultural change in which mixture between highly differentiated populations became pervasive before it eventually became uncommon. The period of around 1,9004,200 years before present was a time of profound change in India, characterized by the de-urbanization of the Indus civilization, increasing population density in the central and downstream portions of the Gangetic system, shifts in burial practices, and the likely first appearance of Indo-European languages and Vedic religion in the subcontinent.The study didnt prove the migration of Indo-European language speakers since its focus was different: finding the dates for the population mixture. But it is clear that the authors think its findings fit in well with the traditional reading of the dates for this migration. In fact, the paper goes on to correlate the ending of population mixing with the shifting attitudes towards mixing of the races in ancient texts. It says: The shift from widespread mixture to strict endogamy that we document is mirrored in ancient Indian texts.So irrespective of the use to which Priya Moorjani et als 2013 study is put, what is clear is that the authors themselves admit their study is fully compatible with, and perhaps even strongly suggests, Bronze Age migration of Indo-European language speakers. In an email to this writer, Moorjani said as much. In answer to a question about the conclusions of the recent paper of Prof. Richards et al that there were strong, male-driven genetic inflows from Central Asia about 4,000 years ago, she said she found their results to be broadly consistent with our model. She also said the authors of the new study had access to ancient West Eurasian samples that were not available when we published in 2013, and that these samples had provided them additional information about the sources of ANI ancestry in South Asia.One by one, therefore, every single one of the genetic arguments that were earlier put forward to make the case against Bronze Age migrations of Indo-European language speakers have been disproved. To recap:1. The first argument was that there were no major gene flows from outside to India in the last 12,500 years or so because mtDNA data showed no signs of it. This argument was found faulty when it was shown that Y-DNA did indeed show major gene flows from outside into India within the last 4000 to 4,500 years or so, especially R1a which now forms 17.5% of the Indian male lineage. The reason why mtDNA data behaved differently was that Bronze Age migrations were severely sex-biased.2. The second argument put forward was that R1a lineages exhibited much greater diversity in India than elsewhere and, therefore, it must have originated in India and spread outward. This has been proved false because a mammoth, global study of R1a haplogroup published last year showed that R1a lineages in India mostly belong to just three subclades of the R1a-Z93 and they are only about 4,000 to 4,500 years old.3. The third argument was that there were two ancient groups in India, ANI and ASI, both of which settled here tens of thousands of years earlier, much before the supposed migration of Indo-European languages speakers to India. This argument was false to begin with because ANI  as the original paper that put forward this theoretical construct itself had warned  is a mixture of multiple migrations, including probably the migration of Indo-European language speakers.Connecting the dotsTwo additional things should be kept in mind while looking at all this evidence. The first is how multiple studies in different disciplines have arrived at one specific period as an important marker in the history of India: around 2000 B.C. According to the Priya Moorjani et al study, this is when population mixing began on a large scale, leaving few population groups anywhere in the subcontinent untouched. The Onge in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are the only ones we know to have been completely unaffected by what must have been a tumultuous period. And according to the David Poznik et al study of 2016 on the Y-chromosome, 2000 B.C. is around the time when the dominant R1a subclade in India, Z93, began splintering in a most striking manner, suggesting rapid growth and expansion. Lastly, from long-established archaeological studies, we also know that 2000 BC was around the time when the Indus Valley civilization began to decline. For anyone looking at all of these data objectively, it is difficult to avoid the feeling that the missing pieces of Indias historical puzzle are finally falling into place.The second is that many studies mentioned in this piece are global in scale, both in terms of the questions they address and in terms of the sampling and research methodology. For example, the Poznik study that arrived at 4,000-4,500 years ago as the dating for the splintering of the R1a Z93 lineage, looked at major Y-DNA expansions not just in India, but in four other continental populations. In the Americas, the study proved the expansion of haplogrop Q1a-M3 around 15,000 years ago, which fits in with the generally accepted time for the initial colonisation of the continent. So the pieces that are falling in place are not merely in India, but all across the globe. The more the global migration picture gets filled in, the more difficult it will be to overturn the consensus that is forming on how the world got populated.Nobody explains what is happening now better than Reich: Whats happened very rapidly, dramatically, and powerfully in the last few years has been the explosion of genome-wide studies of human history based on modern and ancient DNA, and thats been enabled by the technology of genomics and the technology of ancient DNA. Basically, its a gold rush right now; its a new technology and that technology is being applied to everything we can apply it to, and there are many low-hanging fruits, many gold nuggets strewn on the ground that are being picked up very rapidly.So far, we have only looked at the migrations of Indo-European language speakers because that has been the most debated and argued about historical event. But one must not lose the bigger picture: R1a lineages form only about 17.5 % of Indian male lineage, and an even smaller percentage of the female lineage. The vast majority of Indians owe their ancestry mostly to people from other migrations, starting with the original Out of Africa migrations of around 55,000 to 65,000 years ago, or the farming-related migrations from West Asia that probably occurred in multiple waves after 10,000 B.C., or the migrations of Austro-Asiatic speakers such as the Munda from East Asia the dating of which is yet to determined, and the migrations of Tibeto-Burman speakers such as the Garo again from east Asia, the dating of which is also yet to be determined.What is abundantly clear is that we are a multi-source civilization, not a single-source one, drawing its cultural impulses, its tradition and practices from a variety of lineages and migration histories. The Out of Africa immigrants, the pioneering, fearless explorers who discovered this land originally and settled in it and whose lineages still form the bedrock of our population; those who arrived later with a package of farming techniques and built the Indus Valley civilization whose cultural ideas and practices perhaps enrich much of our traditions today; those who arrived from East Asia, probably bringing with them the practice of rice cultivation and all that goes with it; those who came later with a language called Sanskrit and its associated beliefs and practices and reshaped our society in fundamental ways; and those who came even later for trade or for conquest and chose to stay, all have mingled and contributed to this civilization we call Indian. We are all migrants.Tony Joseph is a writer and former editor of BusinessWorld.

5a05fdea9855b76bf13c2a4e,Go organic to beat drought  says seed reviver,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/go-organic-to-beat-drought-says-seed-reviver/article19097377.ece,2017-06-18,"Organic farmer Nel Jayaraman has some advice for farmers struggling to grow high-yielding varieties of paddy during drought: Go organic. Having switched to growing indigenous paddy in an organic manner some 15 years ago, Mr. Jayaraman said farmers need spend only a little on input costs and can get good returns on their investment if they grew traditional varieties of paddy. Some of these rice varieties require less water compared to high-yielding varieties developed under the System of Rice Intensification (SRI).India is home to around 100,000 varieties of indigenous paddy, but the Green Revolution wiped out everything. I have managed to revive around 150 indigenous varieties, and these crops grow very well with no fertilisers and chemicals, he said. Though the yield may be low compared to varieties such as IR-8, Mr. Jayaraman said organic farmers could earn more with less, unlike farmers now who produced higher yield but got less returns for their produce from the government.In a well-tilled field with good soil, I can grow 20 sacks (60 kg) of paddy in an acre of land. The market fetches around Rs. 30,000 in total at the rate of Rs. 1,500/sack. This is much higher compared to what farmers growing high-yielding varieties get from the government, he said.Low profitHigh-yielding paddy fetches around 30-35 sacks/acre, which could be sold for Rs. 880-900 per sack, and the total expenses for cultivating per acre of paddy this way was around Rs. 30,000, farmers say. The margin of profit in SRI cultivation is low. There are native varieties that required only five bursts of rainfall to grow: during seed germination, during flowering, and so on, he said.More than 3,000 organic farmers converged in Thiruthuraipoondi on Saturday to participate in an open seed festival, supported by CREATE, Mr. Jayaramans organisation, and NABARD as a major partner. Among those attending are horticulturist Usha Kumari and scientist S. Sulochana.Usha Kumari, who represents Thanal, an organic farming organisation based in Thiruvananthapuram, said that a national-level Save our Rice campaign that started in 2004 in Kumbalangi, Kerala, has begun to attract farmers from across the country who wish to switch to organic farming practices now. After cotton, rice cultivation has the highest pesticide use , she said.In Tamil Nadu, varieties such as kattuyanam are both drought-proof and salt water tolerant. In places like Nagapattinam district where salt water intrusion has made farming difficult, farmers could grow these varieties.Health benefitsThe Kattuyanam is a very tall variety of paddy, growing up to 8 feet tall. A red rice variety, it fetches more than Rs. 150/kg in the open market, Ms. Kumari said.Besides good returns, the health benefits of organic rice is also a reason for its growing popularity.Scientist S. Sulochana, a researcher at the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology, Thanjavur, said she had conducted studies that showed several indigenous paddy varieties had components that could cure cancer.Mappillai Samba, Kuzhiadichan, Kattu Ponni, Garudan Samba, Seeraga Samba and Poonggar are some of the indigenous paddy we studied. These traditional varieties contain squalene, compounds that are present in olive oil and cod liver oil, which can reduce bad cholesterol, she said, sharing some of her research findings."

Stalin on Sunday denied reports that his party was making attempts to topple the AIADMK government.There is not even an iota of truth in the allegation. The AIADMK factions themselves are capable of bringing down their government, he told reporters on his way to Pudukottai.Mr. Stalin also took exception to BJP president Amit Shahs remarks that Mahatma Gandhi was a  chatur Baniya  (clever Baniya), saying it was an insult to a leader who upheld the idea that India was a garland representing pluralism. Since the BJP has a brutal majority, its leader has chosen to denigrate Mahatma Gandhi. Both the DMK and the Dravidar Kazhagam are campaigning among the people to expose the BJP, he said.Asked about rumours about the sale of plastic rice, he said Tamil Nadu had already witnessed allegations of adulterated milk being sold in the market and no action was taken so far. Now, we are hearing about adulteration of rice and milk, he said.War crimes probeMr. Stalin also demanded a reliable independent investigation by international judges into the war crimes and human rights violations committed by the Sri Lankan armed forces against the ethnic Tamils in the last leg of the civil war in 2009.In a letter to Kate Gilmore, the United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Stalin expressed his inability to attend the 35th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva due to urgent legislative engagements at home. A copy of the letter was released to the media here.Reiterating that the Sri Lankan Tamils needed a meaningful political solution to live with self-respect, Mr. Stalin said it could be achieved only by a referendum among the Eelam Tamils, including Tamils living abroad. I hope the Human Rights Council will take earnest and useful steps to uphold values of human rights and meaningful political solution. The personal intervention for the UN Human Rights Council is the need of the hour to protect the Tamils in Sri Lanka, he added."
5a05fe7b9855b76bf13c2ab8,Adulteration provides food for thought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adulteration-provides-food-for-thought/article19097316.ece,2017-06-18,"Last week, the city witnessed a video of MTC staff purporting to show plastic rice being served in their canteen. The clip, showing men in khaki bouncing small balls of rice off the walls and tables at the canteen of the Ayanavaram bus depot, spread like wildfire on social media. The footage also came close on the heels of information shared on WhatsApp regarding the seizure of alleged plastic rice in other parts of the country.In a State where its own Dairy Development Minister came out with the shocking allegation that private milk producers were adding chemicals to their products, similar claims pertaining to adulteration of rice with plastic seemed ever more probable. So, is there really plastic in rice and sugar, and are there chemicals in milk? Could eggs be made of plastic? Was there any truth to the messages circulating on WhatsApp or were they merely old wives tales that no one in the position of authority was prepared to debunk?As one scare story after another finds prominence through social media platforms, questions are asked, and sometimes answered, with knee-jerk reactions. As adulteration has long remained a tool of choice for unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick buck, only the adulterants have varied with time. Consumer activists point to the need for a proper system capable of answering these questions in a scientific manner, and wherever necessary, allaying rumours and suspicions about food safety that arise periodically among the public.The term plastic rice came into being after a scandal was exposed in China in 2010, in which pellets were made by mixing sweet potato powder with poor quality rice. A resin was found to have been used for the bonding. But this was banned.But in India, although there have been several complaints and allegations of rice being mixed with plastic, tests conducted on so-called plastic rice have conclusively proved that there had been no plastic element in such rice samples, said A. C. Mohan, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Associations.As regards the clips showing rice balls being bounced off the walls, Mr. Mohan said that gelatine, which is found naturally in rice, could make it bouncy if rolled into balls. Boiled rice has more of gelatine, which retains more of its germinal matter. While raw rice varieties including Basmati are not sticky, varieties grown in Tamil Nadu such as Ponni , ADT 36 and Adhisiya Ponni are more sticky than the usual boiled rice. Rubber samba and Maappilai samba are rare varieties that have even more starch and gelatin and are suitable to make kall dosai . These varieties take longer to grow (in some cases six months) and are more healthy, he explained.Federation president D. Thulasingam said that rice merchants were also consumers in the first place, and that they will not sell such adulterated products. Various government agencies had taken samples and conducted tests but so far, no plastic has been found in rice anywhere in the country. Plastic cannot be cooked, it will only melt in the heat. Rice will sink in water, whereas plastic will float. Any home-maker can differentiate between boiled and raw rice by mere feel, smell and sight, he said.It also does not make economic sense to mix plastic with rice, he said. Plastic pellets available in the market are costlier than rice. A kilo of plastic costs anywhere between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100, whereas rice costs Rs. 30-Rs. 60 a kilo. How can someone use a costlier item to make something cheaper? Also, we have at least six months worth of stocks of rice and there is no need for importing rice, let alone plastic rice, Mr. Thulasingam added.R. Kathiravan, designated officer, Food Safety department, Chennai, said that 20 samples of rice were collected and sent for analysis. While 16 of them were sent to the food analysis lab at the King Institute campus in Chennai, four samples were sent to a lab in Thanjavur . Of the 15 results received till date, there has been no evidence of any plastic content in the rice in Chennai, he said.Chemicals in milkUntil a few days ago, milk vendors too had to ward off such queries from consumers after State Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji levelled allegations against certain private milk brands, saying they were adding chemicals to milk.In the wake of the controversy, district administrations stepped in at places such as Madurai and Coimbatore and tested milk samples submitted by the residents. In Madurai, the electronic milk adulteration tests showed that out of 217 samples taken on three different dates in the city and two other locations in the suburbs, 25 samples were found to be of sub-standard quality, while another was found to be unsafe for consumption. District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that awareness was high among rural people as well.Maheswari of Jawahar Nagar, Thirumangalam, in Madurai, said she purchased milk from a vendor who supplied it in quantities of 100 ml and 150 ml. Since it was not branded, we decided to provide a sample of it for testing and found that it was safe to consume, she added.Madurai-based consumer activist Andrews pointed out that the government officials carried out tests only after the Minister for Dairy Development raised the issue of adulteration, adding that such tests should be conducted on a regular basis. Not just milk, the officials should also carry out periodic tests on all items including oil and rice as there have been complaints of sub-standard goods coming in, he added.Adulteration of milk is being monitored on a monthly basis, said a senior Food Safety department official. Of the samples we collected, only one from Madurai was found to be unsafe, as soap oil had been mixed with it. With regard to the other samples, some were found to be sub-standard  containing water, for instance, in milk, but they were not unsafe in terms of health, he said. While sub-standard milk can attract a penalty, unsafe milk can lead to a case in court, a fine and imprisonment, he noted.A milk industry expert said that so far, in samples lifted by the Food Safety department, only samples of unpackaged milk have been found to contain traces of detergent or soap oil.The soap element may have even been due to improper cleansing of utensils at homes. Private milk producers know that their customers are brand-conscious and loyal to their brands due to certain factors, the most important being quality. At times, when it comes to favoured brands, consumers wont even bother about the cost. Companies will not compromise on quality and end up losing the loyalty of such consumers, he said.However, the Milk Commissionerate has stopped taking samples of milk ever since the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stepped in and began collecting samples.Plastic eggs scareIn the wake of the recent plastic eggs scare, acting on a State-wide directive and complaints from consumers, checks were conducted on eggs in Coimbatore district. All of the 161 samples collected in April this year were found to be safe. Samples of popular White Leghorn were tested at the government laboratory in Madurai, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Adulteration not newWith plastics and chemicals prevalent in pretty much everything we use, the adulteration scare is here to stay. In the 1980s food adulteration was something that people had just begun hearing about  it used to mean stones in rice, water in milk, sawdust in tea and brick powder in chilli powder. But all that is pass now.Adulteration has taken on a new avatar. It now comes in the form of non-permitted colours being added to snacks like bhajji and pakoda sold on the roadsides, maida bleached with chemicals, oil-soluble red colour added to chilli powder and cheap palm oil mixed with other cooking oils to reduce the price, says G. Santhanarajan of the Consumer Association of India (CAI).Even the word adulteration is not to be found in the Food Safety and Standards Act. The Act talks about safe foods, sub-standard and unsafe foods. You can simply pay a fine and get off the hook unless the product is deemed unsafe. We now have to be afraid of plastics, especially those that come in the form of food packaging. Packing hot food items in plastic bags is bad for health as the heat causes the plastic to react. Everything from oil to water to pulses that we buy comes in plastic packs. But since nobody has time for anything, people dont even bother to carry their own bags to department stores to avoid plastic bags, he rued.Enforcement failureAfter the Food Safety and Standards Act came into force, though a separate set-up came into being to check food standards, the very same officials of various local bodies have been implementing the norms. Consumer activists feel that the department is failing at enforcement.Nirmala Desikan, chairman and managing trustee, CAI, said that the new Act was a detailed and more comprehensive one than the one that it replaced. There are so many things that are adulterated, but the problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rules. We also dont know how many complaints it (Food Safety department) receives or how many are dealt with. The department is not transparent, she said.Food Safety officials have refused to provide the exact data on adulteration of milk in the State to The Hindu . Only rough figures of complaints and samples collected were provided. Each laboratory gets around 500 samples a month. Just 100 samples are collected from milk products, said a source.Many residents have registered complaints with the Food Safety department through its WhatsApp number 9444042322. We will increase random sampling to study the trends. The analysis is done in three days. Samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints, said an official.But activist T. Sadagopan is far less optimistic. The very few checks that are done hardy matter since very few people are penalised. And those who adulterate will continue to do so. For the consumer, this would only mean unchecked adulteration leading to an adverse impact on their health.( With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Zubeda Hamid in Chennai, L. Srikrishna in Madurai and Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore)Food samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints.Food safety officialThe problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rulesNirmala DesikanConsumer Association of India"

However, now there is a revival in agriculture, due to which cultivation is happening in places where it has not happened in years. The government formulated the Haritha Keralam Mission to bring people back into agriculture, he said.Ninety-five farmers have registered for cultivation at the 60-acre plot at Keezhammakam. The high-yielding Uma rice variety was used for planting, which was organised jointly by the Agriculture Department and the Keezhammakam paddy field committee.The Minister presented awards to the farmers children who scored high grades in the SSLC and Plus Two examinations."

The irony is that while the availability of clean water is coming down drastically, huge quantities of waste water generated by growing population is polluting the water bodies.It poses a two-dimensional challenge of conserving clean water and recycling the used water. Otherwise, humanity is going to pay a price for their complacency, which brings in the sensitive issue of assessing the value of water.It is akin to the saying of an ancient mariner that there is water, water everywhere but not a single drop to drink.Experts in water management expressed their opinion in the CII Summit here recently on the Sustainable Water that since the poor cannot afford to pay for it, an appropriate price has to be extracted from others to instil a sense of discipline among the users. According to them water, like a fragile object, should be handled with care. The question is who will do the pricing and on what basis. It is a topic everyone would like to talk about for the sake of rhetoric but who will bell the cat?Chopping trees on Environment DayWhile the world celebrated the Environment Day by planting saplings, organising seminars and awareness programmes on June 5, it was observed in Vijayawada by cutting trees.Many big trees were chopped off along the Bandar Road on the pretext of widening road. The government has taken up the laying of a six-lane road from Vijayawada to Machilipatnam a few days ago and several trees were slayed.Hundreds of trees hit the road in the last two years and green pastures disappeared after the government had announced the State capital in this region.Trunks of the trees were found on either side of roads on the city outskirts and the officials are not bothered to use technology of relocating trees.A surefire recipe for successThe city is brimming with temporary bhattis (cauldrons) to dish out the seasons most sought-after dish -- haleem.The gooey goodness of haleem, originally an Arabic dish and introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the Nizam rule, have found many takers in the city over the years.So popular is this meat-and-lentil meal that in the past, many youngsters would travel all the way to Hyderabad to relish the ubiquitous delicacy, which is one of the many good things Ramzan brings every year.Though the number of counters serving haleem has increased this season manifold there is crowd everywhere and so none is complaining.Sporting wide grins, owners of eateries talk of how they are running out of stock much before the closure of their shops. But ask them for the recipe they become tight-lipped. Interestingly, each one has developed our own secret recipe that cant be shared.As long as it is delicious and connoisseurs polish off cans full of the delicacy, who cares about the secret recipe, says a foodie.Every rice ball bumpsVideos of rice ball bumping when hit on the floor fuelled the plastic rice news reported by many news channels.And everyone started believing that every rice ball that bumps is made of plastic rice. But a look into basic properties of rice that has a high content of starch will debunk the goof-up made by a few and blindly believed by many. According to experts, rice balls made of cooked grains upon being compressed attain a certain amount of elasticity due to the presence of starch. When the ball is hit against a surface it reacts. The harder it is pressed, the bumpier it becomes. One can try this at home.V. Raghavendra, Rajulapudi Srinivas, P. Sujatha Varma and Tharun Boda"

From a food-short country with a begging bowl, Ms. Gandhi changed India to a rice and wheat exporter, said P. Chadambaram, former Union Finance Minister and Rajya Sabha Member. He was speaking at the birth centenary celebrations of the former Prime Minister at a gathering organised in the city on Saturday. Though many ministers and scientists are credited with the green revolution, no one can deny the fact that without the support of the Prime Minister the process was unrealisable, Mr. Chadambaram said, adding,After Mahatma Gandhi, the name easily recognised world over is Indira Gandhi, he said.Mr. Chidambaram, however, went soft on Ms. Gandhis declaration of State Emergency in 1975. Every historic figure had to be considered in relation to his or her historic context, he said, adding during Ms. Gandhis period, India had fought two wars, faced an acute drought and battled the worst conflagration of communal tensions. She had both the courage of conviction and examination. Though she declared Emergency she admitted it was a mistake in 1977, Mr. Chidambaram explained. No other leader had supported the deprived sections as much as Ms. Gandhi did, he said. The Congress realised through her leadership that it had to fight the causes of poverty.No one is backward. People are oppressed and driven to a deprived and backward condition. Ms. Gandhi brought out this distinction, he said. The Congressman said she stood against anyone who divided the country on the basis of religion and caste. TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, who was also part of the gathering, said Telugu-speaking States had supported all developmental reforms that Ms. Gandhi implemented.Raman Magsaysay award winner Shanta Sinha, who presented a paper on Ms. Gandhis rule, said, Indira Gandhi radicalised reform in the Congress party and the country.

A nutritious meal, it is made using roughly the same spices one finds in biriyani, and contains vegetables or mutton. The flavour of the nombu kanji cuts across religious lines. It is a hit with the Hindus too, who collect it from the mosques near their locality here.Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque at Suramangalam, at the heart of Salem city, serves the gruel to about 2,000 fasting Muslim families in and around this area. This gruelling task begins at the crack of dawn.Over the past three days, sixty nine year-old S. Sadaqatullah Sait, a native of Keeranur near Palani, has been heading a team of half a dozen persons in preparing the gruel at the mosque. He has been doing this for the last three decades ever since the residents of Keeranur, all businessmen who settled down in Suramangalam, introduced him to the jamath leaders of the mosque in the 1980s.Every day, it takes 150 kg of rice, seven kg of garlic, five kg of ginger and onion to make the gruel. Though the gruel is served only in the evening, the preparation commences at daybreak, says Sait.The gruel is ready by 1 p.m. and the serving commences at 3 p.m. After the gruel is served, he begins preparing the sahri (pre-dawn meal) also for about 200 fasting Muslims who are living away from their families and students put up in the hostels. This is served between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at the mosque. This leaves Sait and his team working day and night during the month of Ramzan. No doubt, it is tiresome.

Velmurugan observed in his order, dismissing the criminal appeal moved by the appellants.Based on inputs from a social worker of the International Justice Mission project, the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) had conducted a raid along with police personnel in 2005 on Power House Rice Mill near Kadambathur in Tiruvallur district and rescued 15 workers from the mill, where they were being treated as bonded labourers. A charge sheet was eventually filed in the case against those who engaged the workers.Multiple sentencesThe Additional District Court in Tiruvallur had in May 2010 sentenced each of the three accused persons to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment besides imposing a fine of Rs. 25,000 under Section 370, six months imprisonment under Section 374 of the IPC and 1 year imprisonment each besides a fine of Rs. 1,000 under Section 16 of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act.The first accused (A1) was also sentenced to undergo five years imprisonment under Section 371 of IPC and one year imprisonment under Section 17 of Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act. Since A1 died in 2011, the charge against him stood abated.Basic amenities deniedAccording to the prosecution, M. Kandasamy Mudaliar, K. Sivakumar and Munusamy Naidu engaged 15 persons and paid them below the prescribed amount under the Minimum Wages Act, 1947. They were treated as bonded labourers and were not provided accommodation or medical facilities in the mill.Workers were treated as bonded labourers and were denied accommodation"

The Tamil Nadu government has planned to allow Forest Department personnel to cull the wild boar for a limited period of time, say one year.While acknowledging the problem faced by farmers, environmentalists, however, warn that any attempt to declare the animal as vermin would result in irreparable damage to the biodiversity of forests.We have to make a detailed study before going ahead with the plan. On the one hand, the wild boar remains an important prey for carnivorous animals and, on the other, through their furrowing wild boars ensure germination of seeds in the forest area. Also, by scavenging on dead animals they clear the forests. The wild boars disappearance or reduction in numbers will affect biodiversity, said Mr. Kalidasan, President of Osai, an environmental organisation, who was one of the members of the committee constituted by the State government a few years ago to study the wild boar menace.He said that in many areas in Erode, Coimbatore and Sathyamangalam, wild boars had moved out of the forest and taken refuge in sugarcane fields. In Courtallam forest areas in the Western Ghats, they have taken permanent residence in irrigation tanks covered with invasive species, he said.Ravage farmsWild boars are among the most significant causes of losses that farmers face. They devour tapioca, bananas, rice and oil seeds. Since they are on the list of scheduled animals we are not able to do anything as it will result in action against farmers under the Wildlife Protection Act, said S.T. Sheik Mydeen, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association in Kadayanallur-Shencottah area.We make noise, burst crackers and use dogs to chase them away. But they come in such vast numbers that our efforts often fail. Sometimes forest officials take away our dogs if they find us chasing wild boars, said Mr. Mydeen.Mr. Kalidasan said if the government issued orders for shooting, it should be limited to areas where the threat is major. The carcass of the animal should not be allowed to be consumed by people. Mr. Mydeen also agreed that people should not be allowed to eat the meat of the hunted animal."

P. Ayyakannu, the farmer-leader who recently led a series of protests against the Centre and the State demanding drought relief, said, It has been six years since the dams gates were opened on time, and you can see the state of the river for yourselfand pro-Kannada organisations are calling for a bandh demanding two more dams in their State to tap the rivers water. Where are we to go then?The Cauvery irrigates eight districts in the main in Tamil Nadu  Erode, Karur, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Tiruchi, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam  and it journeys eastward towards Nagapattinam district, where it finally drains into the Bay of Bengal. Following two consecutive years of failed Northeast monsoon, Tamil Nadu suffered its worst drought in 140 years in 2016-17. The entire State was declared drought-hit in January this year.Six months on, little appears to have been done by the State to remedy the situation. In six badly-affected districts, The Hindu found that farmers were beginning to grow tired of the blame Karnataka strategy adopted by the government every time there is a water crisis. Farming operations have come to a virtual standstill, and only those with deep borewell irrigation or those cultivating on the riverbed could be seen carrying on with regular cultivation. While Karnataka has already built adequate dams on the Cauvery to tap its water upstream, farmers in Tamil Nadu are angry that the State has done little in terms of implementing similar measures.Inadequate rainfall during the Southwest monsoon in 2016 affected the upper riparian state of Karnataka as well, resulting in its inability to allocate to Tamil Nadu the 2,000 cusecs of Cauvery water per day as mandated by the Supreme Courts order of 2016. As on June 21, the inflow to the Krishna Raja Sagar dam in Mandya, Karnataka, was only 1,275 cusecs (as per government figures), most of which goes towards meeting the drinking water requirements of major cities in Karnataka.If you look at the total amount of water allocated for Tamil Nadu by the Cauvery Water Tribunal, Karnataka is only to provide 192 tmcft [thousand million cubic feet]. The remaining 227 tmcft is to be gained from Tamil Nadu. So the State too needs to do its bit to tap into the Cauverys potential for irrigation, said P.K. Deivasigamani, who heads the Tamil Nadu Joint Farmers Association, based in Erode. In 2014, Rs. 400 crore was allocated for building a check dam across the Kollidam River on the Nagapattinam-Cuddalore border, which could help meet the drinking water and irrigation requirements of the region, but the State government has not taken any action till date, he said.S. Janakarajan from the Madras Institute of Development Studies told The Hindu that across several districts in the State the problem of mining water was beginning to surface. Mining water refers to the stage when withdrawal of groundwater reaches a point where it is beyond replenishment. This was especially the case with the non-Cauvery delta irrigated zones such as Madurai, Theni, and Ramanathapuram. In coastal areas, sea water intrusion has resulted in the water turning saline. Half of Tiruvarur district now has saline water, he said.Even in the Cauvery delta regions, the groundwater table has fallen sharply, and the area under crops has come down drastically. In Thanjavur, kuruvai cultivation is only 1 lakh acres as against 4.5 lakh acres in a usual year, Prof. Janakarajan said, adding: Even samba cultivation is very uncertain due to low water levels in Mettur reservoir.Sand mining rampantSand mining is rampant in the Cauvery and its distributary, Kollidam, affecting its water retention capacity and quality of groundwater in nearby areas. While driving down the Karur bypass road from Tiruchi, we came across a 5 km-long queue of over 300 trucks on the side of the road waiting to extract sand from the Cauvery near Lalapet.A casual enquiry with one of the drivers revealed that trucks had lined up for 2-3 days outside the mine, near Pettavaithalai, and the quarry had dug deep into the riverbed such that a man could be buried in it standing upright. The same could be witnessed at Thiruvasi on the Tiruchirapalli-Namakkal Road where over 10 such sand quarries operate within a 10 km stretch. Inquiries with the police stationed outside the quarries revealed that about 350 trucks operated at each of these quarries every day. Sand mined from here fetches about Rs. 1,150 - Rs. 1,300 per truck load locally and was supplied across Tamil Nadu and to nearby states of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka too. In the cities, the sand is purchased for a rate of Rs. 13,000 to Rs. 14,000 per truck load and sellers thus make a killing.N. Ramachandran, a block coordinator for the Tamil Maanila Congress, and owner of a banana plantation in Uraiyur, Tiruchi district, said that due to the quarrying operations from Thiruvasi onward, fields within the 10 km radius have been severely affected by falling groundwater levels. The miners use earthmovers to dig deep into the riverbed, sometimes going up to 20 feet deep. If they hit on some water stream beneath, the miners use a motor to drain the water off, before beginning to extract sand again. This has left red blotches on the surface of the riverbed, he said.When it rains on such a surface, the clayey soil beneath the sandy upper layer of the river mixes with the water to form mushy puddles, with none of the water percolating below to recharge the river naturally. It also leads to accidents, with goats grazing the riverbed or people crossing by slipping into the pits left behind by miners, residents say. As one drives towards Karur from Tiruchi, the coconut trees in groves on both sides of the road begin to wilt and disappear as the sand mines approach.In spite of the drought, the Cauvery and the Kollidam rivers continue to supply drinking water to 20 out of the 32 districts in Tamil Nadu. The Community Drinking Water Schemes, run by the State government, have caused great resentment among local residents in Thanjavur district, where many of these projects operate.In Anaikudi, a village in Thiruvaiyaru taluk, Thanjavur, a sugarcane farmer S. Selvaraj reportedly committed suicide last month after attempts to extract water for his farm using a bore well failed. He had spent a large sum of money installing it. His wife Rasathi told The Hindu that her husband had lost all his investments in agriculture and the sugar mill to which he supplied sugarcane had not settled his dues. He had a debt of nearly Rs. 4 lakh and was unable to repay the bank. The family hasnt received any compensation from the government.About a kilometre away from here, a long pipe carrying drinking water under a government community drinking water scheme from the Kollidam River, goes to Pattukottai. At the pumping station, where a trial is currently underway, two motors were running, each pumping out 6,000 litres of water per minute. Villagers who protested the drawing of water from here say false cases were foisted against them to suppress local dissent.Deepening distressMany farmer families and agricultural labourers have begun to seek wage labour outside their villages out of desperation. In Thiruvalarsolai, near Tiruchirapalli, we saw farm labourers working in brick kilns to make ends meet.P. Periyasami, who owns 2 acres of land in Thanjavur district, migrated with his family comprising his wife, two daughters and a son to this place to bake bricks after his paddy field failed to yield for three consecutive years. We get paid Rs. 1-1.50 per brick and earn about Rs. 100 per day. The money is better in farming, but with no water available we have no choice but to work here, he said. He pointed to a tiny, straw hut on the corner of the road, Thats where we live.If this is the case in Thanjavur district, a relatively prosperous agricultural belt, the situation is worse in places that lie outside of the Cauvery irrigation zone. In Peragambi, near Siruganur, Tiruchi district, lemon farmers are buying water for Rs. 4,000 per tanker load to irrigate their withering fruit-bearing trees. The trees arent eligible for crop loss compensation from the government. C. Selvaraj, who had been growing the trees for the last six years, said, Its only this year that the trees started bearing fruit and theres no water. Half of them have withered. Im trying hard to keep the rest alive spending Rs. 30,000 per month watering them thrice.Not very far from Peragambi and Vazhaiyur is the Sanamangalam eri , a lake that stretches over 8 acres. While driving down the Chettikulam-Peragambi Road, we came across this lake that was covered entirely in thorny bushes. No one would identify it until someone told them that this was a lake! Less than a kilometre down the same road MNREGA workers sat resting under the shade of trees. They had just completed digging a small canal for irrigation here.When we inquired as to why the eri was not taken up for clearing as it would help store water, the workers said that it came under the PWD and the village panchayat could not commission any clearing work in it. Farmers in Nagapattinam district had complained to us that work on dredging silt from a major irrigation canal, under PWD supervision, was progressing slowly. They say with some irritation that the officials seem busy overseeing sand mining operations with police protection.Farmers growing Bt. cotton in Peragambi, Vazhaiyur and border areas of Perambalur district had mortgaged all their family jewellery and now risked losing them to bank auctions. A source in NABARD told The Hindu that a majority of farmers in Tamil Nadu had taken crop loans against gold jewellery.Most often when the farmers failed to repay the loans, the banks recovered it by auctioning the jewellery. In spite of the Madras High Court direction to waive off loans and RBI (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas Affected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2016, asking banks to restructure loans of farmers affected by drought, banks have continued to send notices for loan repayment to farmers who failed to return crop loans borrowed last year.In Kadichambadi village, Kumbakonam taluk, Thanjavur, we met Aruljothi Murugan whose father Rengasamy, 78, died last month unable to bear the shock of crop loss. His total outstanding loan amount was Rs. 32, 263. The family continues to get notices for repayment from the bank.Three days after his death we received Rs. 10,000 as crop loss compensation from the government. But can we bring the dead man back? his wife Amisham, 65, asked.Usually, in times of distress such as these, farm animals provide some back-up for income generation for farmers. But with the agrarian distress deepening, maintaining livestock has become a challenge. G. Ravi of Panchanadikkulam, Nadu Setti in Vedaranyam taluk, Nagapattinam district, says he lost his father due to crop loss last year. He owned two cows given free of cost by a charitable organisation a few years ago. Feeding and maintaining them required Rs. 100 per day. But the 2 litres of milk he got from the cow fetched only Rs. 50 when sold. He owes Rs. 3 lakh to a private moneylender and Rs. 25,000 as bank loan.What should I do, he asks, Feed the cows or keep myself alive?"

It could be addressed only through migration under difficult conditions, mostly to the Arabian Gulf. Their hardship is not properly mentioned in the discourse on Kerala.One of the things that is insufficiently recognised is that Kerala is a market economy, integrated with the rest of India. For employment to take place in a market economy, production must take place. For that to happen, what is being produced here should be competitive, he said. Giving the example of singer K.J. Yesudas in his prime, Dr. Balakrishnan said that the competitiveness of his music was unparalleled at one point. The rice you produce should be better than what is being produced in Andhra Pradesh. The soap you produce should be better than the one in Maharashtra, he pointed out.Dr. Balakrishnan said that in this process of building competitiveness, public capital had a fundamental role, whether it was in the public sector or the private sector. Things such as roads, water supply, waste management and electricity were highly important in a manufacturing economy. Kerala is at the bottom of the heap as far as public capital investment is concerned. The capital outlay in relation to the State budget is low due to the pressure to spend more on salaries and pension. Also, since the public spending was dependent on borrowing, the debt burden on future generations was growing too.Farming hitOn the environmental front, Dr. Balakrishnan said the focus should be on the reversal of degradation of natural capital.This is the second day of Thiruvathira njattuvela and look at the rain we are getting, he said. Dr. Balakrishnan said that due to the destruction of environment, Keralas agricultural production was on a decline for the past four decades.He termed equality of women as one of the major social problems confronting the State. Quoting statistics, Dr. Balakrishnan said that the representation of women in the Legislative Assembly was abysmal. Place women in charge of Kerala. The policies would have looked difficult had women been in charge of the legislative process, Dr. Balakrishnan pointed out. He also asserted the role of the universities in creating ideas for the future. D.D. Nampoothiri, executive director, CREST, was present."

When asked when UPA government in the past did that by waiving Rs. 70,000 crore farm loan, Ms. Karandlaje chose to keep quiet. When the reporters insisted, she said that the State government should do instead of asking the Centre. The Congress government has presented a budget of Rs. 1.82 lakh crore ... let it share some of this money with the farmers, she said.However, she kept avoiding to answer the question as to why the Centre was not coming to help the farmers.When a journalist asked to respond to the statement by Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu where he had reportedly said that farmers committing suicide has become a fashion, she asked the reporter to pose the question to Mr. Naidu.Earlier, she accused the Congress government of failing to control illegal sale of States rice meant for Anna Bhagya to Tamil Nadus Amma canteen.Ms. Karandlaje said that the alleged suicide of Anurag Tewari, an IAS officer , was linked to the illegal sale of rice.

Metran Kayal rice, the branded rice from the paddy harvested from the controversial polder, will be launched on Thursday.According to S.K. Suresh, managing director, Oil Palm India, who is the distributor, they had procured 356.30 tonnes of paddy from the polder. This include the paddy procured from 66 farmers who had taken up cultivation in the kayal.The packaged rice will be distributed through the outlets of Oil Palm India which already has an effective network for distribution of their Kuttanad brand rice. The same network is being used for the distribution of Aranmula brand rice, he said. Outlets of Horticorp and other government agencies would distribute the Metran Kayal rice, Mr. Suresh said. According to him, the rice, though it has not received the organic tag, will have a safe to eat tag attached to it since the farmers had tried to be as nature-friendly as possible during their cultivation process.Mr. Suresh said one of the interesting features of Metran Kayal rice was the limited quantity that had come for marketing. Since the total quantity of paddy procured was 356 tonnes, the quantity of rice produced from it could be around 200 tonnes. As such, we have only that much rice for sale under this brand, he said.The future of paddy cultivation in the polder is now hanging fire. Rony Varghese, agriculture officer who oversaw paddy cultivation at Metran Kayal, said the future course of action would be decided by next month."

Now, we have no option but to use the space near hostel. The stench is intolerable even from inside the hostel canteen, said R. Kannan, a college student, an inmate since Class IV.This is an indication of the hygiene, infrastructure and other issues that plague majority of the 56 such hostels functioning in the district, that accommodated 3,581 boys and girls in academic year 2016-17.HygieneOne of the wardens said that the toilets in majority of the hostels had been rendered useless mainly due to inadequate availability of water. The hostels are not equipped to even provide purified drinking water to the students. In such a situation, it is needless to mention the scarcity of water for other needs, he alleged.He added that the hostels do not have permanent sanitary workers. Instead, a paltry amount is allocated for the wardens to engage workers on a need basis for cleaning toilets and hostel premises. Even that amount is not sanctioned properly, he said.Alleging that adequate care had not been taken for the health of students, an official from the department, pointed out for instance that the hostel for school girls in Paravai was situated amid mounds of garbage.B. Pandiaraja, Member, Madurai district Vigilance and Monitoring Committee for Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, said though the procedures demanded periodic health check-up for hostellers, it was seldom done.InfrastructureStudents residing in some of the hostels also complain about the dilapidated condition of the buildings and inadequate transport facilities since the hostels are located in far off places. A case in point is the hostel for ITI Girls in Thanakkankulam. On realising that the hostel was not suitable for girls due to lack of security and transport facilities, the department recently shifted college boys from the hostel on Race Course Road to that campus.M. Muthukumar, a student of Madurai Kamaraj University College, who was shifted to Thanakkankulam, said commuting to the college had become tedious.Similar complaints have been levelled by students of hostels in places such as Alanganallur and Vadipatti where they have to walk long distances due to lack of transport facilities near the hostel.Support in studiesAlleging that majority of the wardens did not reside in the hostels, Mr. Pandiaraja said the students, particularly those attending schools, do not receive any support from wardens in their studies.Study hours should be organised for these students daily. However, it is seldom done since wardens are not available there all the time. If they are present, untoward incidents such as suicide attempts and quarrel between students can also be avoided, he said, adding that the hostels should also arrange periodic meeting with parents.N. Rajamani, a student from Tirupparankundram hostel, suggested that the department must also consider organising counselling session for students in choosing the right career. When I finished school, there was no one to guide me. Now, I am studying History since I got admitted only in that course, he said.Administrative lacunaeWardens and officials The Hindu spoke to alleged administrative issues that were hampering effective functioning of the hostels. A college student is allocated Rs. 875 per month for food while other students are allocated Rs. 750, which works out to roughly Rs. 25 - 30 per day. Though the rice comes from Public Distribution System and groceries are bought from cooperative stores, it is still impossible to provide quality food at this price, a warden said.An official, however, pointed out that there were also leakages of this fund since some of the hostels recorded inflated number of students. For instance, the ITI and school hostels on Race Course Road had 113 and 101 students on record in 2016-17. However, the actual students residing are far less, he said.Similarly, the rules demand that a warden cannot be retained in a place for more than five years. Importantly, Mathematics, English and Science teachers cannot be deputed as wardens. This is not followed, he alleged.Mr. Pandiaraja pointed to the non-functioning of Adi Dravidar Welfare Committee in the district, which could have helped in monitoring the functioning of hostels.When contacted, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said he would immediately look into the issues. Issues like lack of medical check-up for students should not happen since health officials are supposed to do routine check-ups. If the allegations are true, we will take swift action, he said.He added that as an initial step, senior officials would be asked to conduct a thorough inspection of the hostels to identify all issues.*Names of all students changed for anonymityThough the procedures demand periodic health check-up for hostellers, it is seldom doneB.

This is my answer to those who say prices will go up after GST is rolled out. The rate fixed for GST is a revenue-neutral rate, which means that if there is tax presently, it would not go up after the GST. Either it would remain the same or it would go down. So, there would be no rise in prices, she contended.The Minister also clarified that the new tax regime was only to ensure that corruption is weeded out from the system.Earlier, representatives from various industries raised several queries and made representations to the Minister over the GST. Centre Excise Department officials too clarified the doubts.While the association of rice merchants questioned the logic behind levying 5% GST for branded rice, even as the GST for gold was only 3%, film industry representatives sought a clarification as to how the refunded advance given to artistes would be treated for tax purpose. Rubber traders sought a relaxation in the tax rate for rubber, while makers of korai grass mat complained of new tax on their industry. Plastic traders questioned the logic behind levying tax on recycled plastic granules."

He read out item by item, the increases the prices of commodities such as rice, sugar and pulses had registered between the time the United Democratic Front (UDF) relinquished charge of the government and now. The prices of food commodities had gone up phenomenally during the three-and-a-half years of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government.Mr. Mohammed accused the government of not lifting the full allotment of subsidised rice from the Centre and, at the same time, selling an allotment of wheat to flour mills.Leader of the Opposition Oommen Chandy, who anchored the discussion for the UDF, also repeated the wheat-related charge and said it was strange that the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation should aim for profits through the sale of wheat given at heavily subsidised rates by the Union government.Charges deniedFood and Civil Supplies Minister C.

Achyuthan, engineer-turned-eco-activist, published by the Kerala Sasthra Sahithya Parishad, emphasises the imperative need for the State government to chalk out a clear-cut policy on sharing of inter-State river waters that gives it full controls over the structures constructed in Kerala for diversion of water to other States.This is essential for Kerala to protect its water resources and ensure sufficient water availability for its own development. Any settlement of water-related disputes has to be based on reliable data if it is to last and gain people's acceptance.In the case of Mullaperiyar, any agreement should be on the basis of the water requirements of both States, the agreement that is already in force and the safety of the dam and the people on the downstream banks, Dr. Achyuthan, alumnus of the University of Wisconsin, U.S., says in the book.Examining various aspects of the Mullaperiyar dispute that has been at the centre of a protracted legal dispute and an emotionally sensitive subject for people of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, Dr. Achyuthan says that Kerala has not been able to stop diversion of water to its neighbouring States from even rivers that are not inter-State.This has been because of its failure to produce convincing data gathered from detailed water-balance studies in its river basins to show if it really has surplus water which it should share with others.Absence of such studies has weakened the State's case to counter demands for water from Tamil and Karnataka, he says.The history of the Mullaperiyar dam is traced from the agreement signed on October 29, 1886 by the then Diwan of Travancore and the Resident of Travancore and Cochin to divert the flow of the Mullaperiyar in Kerala to the Vaigai river basin in Tamil Nadu for 999 years.The Kerala government had raised the issue of safety of the dam even in 1960. The dispute was now before a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court.Dr. Achyuthan says raising the water level in the lime-sukri dam as demanded by Tamil Nadu will result in only a marginal increase in water availability to that State, but it will be a grave risk to the safety of the dam and the people downstream.He is of the view that much of the water shortage in Tamil Nadu is due to planning for agriculture without considering the actual quantity of water available and expecting to get water from Kerala on which it has not right.He says that Kerala's requirement of water will increase steadily since it will have to provide irrigation to step up its rice and coconut production.R.
