Karunanidhi, president of the Nalasangam, who led the fast, said Thiruvadanai was the rice bowl of the district and establishment of the power plant would destroy farming in the block. If TANGEDCO was allowed to alienate the lands, farmers and fishermen in more than seven villages would lose their livelihood, he said.We are not against the project per se but against the location of the site, he said. The lands were very fertile and farmers harvested nearly 60 bags of paddy per acre, he said. They could launch the protest after obtaining permission through court order as the local police denied permission, he said.Farmers Associations leaders P.R. Pandian and P.Ayyakannu were expected to join the protest on the last day of fasting on July 3 and express their solidarity, he said.The Nalasangam would draw the future course of action after consulting Mr. Ayyakannu, he said.TANGEDCO began issuing notices to the 571 land owners, asking them to hand over the possession of lands to the district administration last month, when the farmers moved the court recently and obtained the stay order."

These were the words of popular African-American athlete and basketball player for the Cleveland Cavaliers, LeBron James, after his home in Los Angeles was vandalised prior to a National Basketball Association finals game in Oakland in early June. James is considered an icon in his home State of Ohio  he was born in the city Akron, not far from Cleveland, where he plays for the Cavaliers as their lynchpin. Cleveland, and the state of Ohio in general, is also Ground Zero for acts of police violence against African-Americans, Professor Ronnie Dunn of the Department of Urban Studies at Cleveland State University, told the The Hindu .The most prominent killing in Cleveland was that of 12 year-old-Tamir Rice, who was shot dead by a police officer while carrying a toy gun in a city park in November 2014. The officer, Timothy Loehmann, and his partner, were let off the hook by a grand jury, which ruled that the evidence did not indicate any criminal conduct by them. The killings of Rice and several other African-Americans triggered the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, which began as a hashtag on social media, before developing legs as a social movement.Protests and unrest in Cleveland finally forced the State of Ohio to come up with an institutional response. Governor John Kasich set up the Ohio Collaborative Community-Police Advisory Board in April 2015, after activists and academicians came up with recommendations on public safety. Prof. Dunn was one of the members, who overseeing the implementation of those recommendations on setting standards for state police agencies. The Collaborative recently published a report on the implementation of two recommendations relating to proper use of force and recruitment of officers. It is yet to submit other recommendations such as on bias-free policing.More to be doneProf. Dunn said the Collaborative was a good start but much more is needed to be done, especially on the issue of racial bias. Cleveland is ethnically segregated and his research found that African-American residents were subject to disproportionately higher racial profiling and bias by law enforcement agencies. Beyond piecemeal reform measures to address policing, he asserted that the real issues were to do with the politics in Cleveland and its inability to overcome institutionalised racism in the city, despite having a historically vibrant African-American political leadership and being a Democratic party citadel.Following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. President, the federal government has sought to overturn several measures put forth by the Obama administration to bring scrutiny on police violence. Heres where the role of movements such as the BLM  that seek to channel anger against police violence into changing the political culture  have become prominent. Clevelands BLM chapter is still in its infancy, said Angela Woodson, a long time activist belonging to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.Activists who protested against police violence have now sought to bring this issue to the political agenda, by encouraging black residents in the city to elect representatives committed to addressing racial biases. Basheer Jones, a candidate for the city council, told The Hindu that todays new social movements such as the BLM were seeking to revive the activism visible in the civil rights movement of the 1960s in their own ways. The bold public position taken by athletes such as LeBron James was helpful in promoting the cause.Protests and unrest in Cleveland forced the State of Ohio to come up with an institutional response to tackle police violence, but experts feel much more has to be done"

The foodgrain sector is dominated by hundreds of local brands apart from big, well-known brands of basmati rice and wheat flour (atta), all of which will get pricier.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president, Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrain and Pulses Merchants Association, said that over 60% of the foodgrains market was dominated by local brands which are registered. Starting from July 1, the consumer needs to pay tax of 5% on all these products. As per Thursdays market rates, all pulses will cost Rs. 5 more, rice Rs. 2.5 to Rs. 4 more and wheat Rs. 2 per kg, he said.Purchase orderBut, there is a peculiar problem consumers and retail traders will be faced with. Most retailers purchase a 50 kg bag of toor dal or wheat, mostly of local brands which enjoy customer loyalty. But individual consumers are likely to buy only a few kg in loose, which is the usual practice. The government in all its publicity over GST has been saying that loose unpacked foodgrains is exempt from GST. This may create a situation where the retailer may have paid tax, while the consumer refuses to, said Mr. Lahoti.B. Raju, who runs a kirana store in north Bengaluru, said the only way to overcome this was either to include the tax component in the retail price of the foodgrain without the knowledge of the consumer, or move to stock unbranded foodgrains to sell in smaller quantities.Mr. Lahoti predicted that most retailers, to withstand competition, will move to stock unbranded foodgrains to sell them loose and this may mean drop in quality."

Sunil Kumar here on Thursday.Mr. Sunil Kumar said the government had finalised a system for rooting out the inordinate delay in the disbursal of procurement prices to the farmers.The work was on to ink an agreement among various cooperative and commercial banks on the one hand and the Departments of Civil Supplies and Finance, on the other. Once the procurement was over, the receipt from the Civil supplies Department could be presented at the designated bank by the farmer for receiving his remuneration.Crop insuranceThe government would reimburse the banks with interest as and when the funds arrived in their kitty, the Minister said. According to him, currently the government owed Rs. 250 crore to farmers as remuneration for paddy procurement.He said that July 1 would be celebrated as Crop Insurance Day from this year. From July onwards, farmers would be able to insure nearly 25 varieties of crops at a nominal premium. In the age of climate change, the insurance would provide farmers with necessary financial support whenever there was a crop failure, he said.The Minister launched the Metran Kayal rice by handing over the first bag of rice to M.K.

The village is about 60 km from Dhanbad.However, timely intervention by the police saved the lives of the parents and brother of the girl who had married Sabbir Ansari from a neighbouring village on June 30.Officer-in-charge of the Naraianpur police station Surendra Singh, who reached the village before the family could be lynched, said it took few hours to persuade the agitated tribal leaders who then agreed to remove the barbed wires.They, however, insisted that the girls family will have to pay the fine imposed by the local panchayat.Following police intervention, the panchayat is likely to meet on July 5 to reconsider the quantum of fine.Its a difficult task to convince tribals to budge from their rules but certainly not impossible, Surendra Singh.He said armed police personnel have been deployed in village since Sunday afternoon to prevent any untoward incident.Trouble started on June 30 when the news spread that sister of Jogeshwar Hembrom had married Ansari and that the couple was living at the grooms house at Lakhanpur village.Angry tribal leaders of the village met the family and sought explanation, terming the marriage as an insult to tribal society.The girls family expressed its helplessness as she was rigid on marrying him and had left home for Ansari.We are being penalised for a fault committed by my sister, who is an adult and not ready to split with her husband, said Jogeshwar, who pleaded with the police to save his parents and his own life from the agitated villagers.He said attempts to persuade the panchayat to reduce quantum of fine keeping in mind their financial status had failed.My parents even offered to break all relations and perform last rites of my sister and treat her as dead but they refused and still are adamant that we would have to pay fine, rued Jogeshwar.Jharkhand has been rocked by a spate of lynchings in the recent past with Muslims mainly being the targets of tribals."

The middlemen would demand a commission of Rs100 each from the buyer and the seller. The price of the goat is determined by its weight. But, the middlemen would decide its weight by just looking at it. We couldnt say anything, says Kasiraj, recalling his helplessness. His plight is incidentally the story of almost every small and marginal farmer across India.Not anymore. Along with 1000 other goat-herders from 10 neighbouring villages, Kasiraj in 2015 floated Theni District Goat Producer Company Ltd (TNiGPCL), a company that markets the goats of all its shareholders in bulk. Eliminating middlemen, the company directly supplies meat to customers, selling it at a rate cheaper than retailers and getting its constituent farmers a fair price for their produce.In a silent revolution that has been fermenting in the farming sector since 2013-2014, many like Kasiraj are joining hands to form Farmers Producer Organisations (FPO)  corporate entities that are helping them eliminate middlemen and get a fair price for their produce. FPOs are farming start-ups which are being incubated by the Centre through Small Farmer Agri-business Consortium (SFAC), rural development bank NABARD, agriculture and horticulture departments of state governments and NGOs. There are around 200 such companies in Tamil Nadu.Farmers in nearby clusters who produce similar products like vegetables, paddy, coconut, milk and poultry, are bunched together as shared-owners in the company. By pooling their produce, they get a better bargaining price at the market compared to selling it individually, says a senior agriculture department official. In the food economy, there is a huge gap between the price at which a farmer sells his produce and that at which the consumer buys it. The process benefits middlemen, while farmers struggle to pay off their loans. This is why banks hesitate to give loans to small farmers. FPOs improve credit linkage as there is better credibility, the official adds.To form an FPO, every farmer has to pool in Rs1000 as paid-up capital while the incubating government agency sinks up to Rs10 lakh in the company. The agency nurtures every company for three years, providing salaries for an independent CEO and funds for training programmes and develops a business plan to build the company. After three years, the companies are out on their own.Some FPOs have started marketing goods under their own brand name; a company of guava growers at Ayakudi in Dindigul district exports guava juice under its brand name. It is a staple drink offered at meetings in the Secretariat. In Madurai, a company by coconut farmers tied up with a college hostel to supply rice and coconuts; the students got it cheaper, while farmers earned Rs1 more per coconut.Many agencies through several programmes provide farmers innovative learning mechanisms and rope in experts to ensure that their produce is of higher quality and resistant to diseases. Commonwealth of Learning, an intergovernmental body of Commonwealth countries, for instance sends out farming tips as voicemails to mobile phones of farmers.Experts say such programmes help farmers improve their products and repay loans and also encourage banks to give loans to farmers who are part of learning modules. We are trying to evaluate if banks can adopt learning modules as part of the credit policy to ensure prompt repayment of loans, says Dr P Thamizholi, a consultant at COL. Farmers are exploited by traders as they dont understand the system of profits. Corporatisation eliminates these shortcomings, says V Balaji, a consultant with COL who assists FPOs in drafting business plans.Preparing concrete plans to scale up business  constructing warehouses, abattoirs and refrigeration units for perishable products  should be the way forward for these companies, says an official of NABARD. Farmers need to tie up with bulk consumers like a residents welfare organisation or a gated community, says the agri-department official."

(Source: Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana) A buyer measures moisture content in neem fruit at a Gujarat mandi. (Source: Express Photo/Bhupendra Rana)NEARLY TWO years after the government made neem-coating mandatory for urea sold in India, questions are being raised over how much of neem oil used for this purpose is genuine. Roughly 800 grams of neem oil is required to coat one tonne of urea. For the estimated 310 lakh tonnes (lt) of urea annually consumed, that works out to about 25,000 tonnes. In terms of fruit from which the oil is extracted, it translates into around 3.25 lt, considering the average recovery rate of 11 per cent after transportation and post-storage weight losses of around 30 per cent.Now, the question being asked is: Where is all this oil and fruit coming from, given that theres not much organised cultivation of neem trees in the country and ripened fruit is available for barely two months of the year, from May-end till mid-July? Also, with no real systems in place for collection, drying and processing  except for a few fertiliser companies  how much of genuine neem oil is being sprayed on urea bagged in plants and ports across India? Read | Empowering through Nimboli: The story of a mini-rural entrepreneur LaxmibenSpeaking to The Indian Express, a top government official admitted, It is a sensitive issue, more so when the decision (to go for 100 per cent neem-coating for domestically produced and imported urea) came right from the top. On April 27, the Department of Fertilisers issued a circular, stating that some neem oil suppliers are offering more quantity of neem oil to urea manufacturers/ importers than their neem oil production capacity, which encourages malpractices and mixing of spurious oil in neem oil with azadirachtin powder. Fertiliser firms have since been directed to procure only from genuine neem oil manufacturers, who would have to provide details of their actual production capacity and existing supply commitments while bidding for purchase tenders.Now, the government is planning to tighten the screws further  by changing the specifications for neem oil used in urea-coating to ensure its purity. The existing specifications require the oil to have a maximum of one per cent moisture and insoluble matter by weight; specific gravity of 0.85-0.95 at 30 degrees Celsius; iodine value of 65-95; saponification value of 160-205; and, a minimum azadirachtin content of 150 parts per million (ppm). There are many vegetable oils  including washed cottonseed, rice bran, karanja, and palm  and even cutting (transformer) oil that can more or less meet the above values, barring the one relating to azadirachtin, the main active ingredient in neem. These oils are relatively cheap, costing Rs 55-65 per kg.On the other hand, the cost of neem fruit delivered to a processing unit is currently in the range of Rs 16,000 per tonne  processing costs of Rs 3,000 takes this to Rs 19,000. At 11 per cent recovery, and after deducting realisations from sale of the 85 per cent residual cake left after extraction (Rs 6,800, at Rs 8 per kg for 850 kg), the average net cost of neem oil comes to Rs 111 per kg. Within this, the cost of the primary expeller oil (which has a higher azadirachtin content of 400 ppm or more) would be Rs 120-130 per kg, while that for oil which is solvent-extracted from the cake (having only 100 ppm azadirachtin) would be Rs 80-90.There are suppliers who are using a mix of 70-80 per cent vegetable oils (average cost of Rs 60 per kg) and 20-30 per cent solvent-extracted neem oil (Rs 80 per kg). To this, they add one gram or so of azadirachtin powder costing Rs 9-10. The resultant so-called neem oil would meet all the specifications required for urea-coating, including the minimum 150 ppm azadirachtin content. And it will cost less than Rs 75 per kg, while being supplied to urea manufacturers/importers at Rs 100-plus (the current quoted rates for neem oil in most tenders), said the government official.One way to handle this, he said, would be to change the specifications for neem oil to be used for coating of urea. Azadirachtin apart, neem also has other compounds such as nimbin and salannin. We could lay down minimum values for these as well. These can be decided by the relevant technical bodies, said the official. All this, however, does not take away the overall success of the neem-coating programme. Being heavily subsidised, urea was used as a binder by plywood/particle board makers and for sizing (smoothening) textiles, besides being a common adulterant in milk. Such illegal diversion for non-agricultural applications is seen to have largely come down with neem-oil coating.Coating also enables a more gradual release of nitrogen which, in normal urea, is prone to losses through leaching (underground percolation) and volatilisation (escaping into atmosphere). The resultant higher nitrogen-use efficiency has translated into lesser bags of urea being consumed on farms. Both together  reduced diversion and improved nutrient-use efficiency  have led to urea sales in India falling from 319.74 lt in 2015-16 to 296.07 lt in 2016-17, despite agricultural production going up, said the official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But the newly-introduced GST is going to put an extra burden of over Rs 10 crore on this socio-religious activity at the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar and other gurdwaras, temple officials say.With purchases made for the community kitchen coming under various slabs of the new GST, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), the mini-parliament of the Sikh religion that manages Sikh shrines (gurdwaras) in Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, including the Harmandir Sahib (popularly known as the Golden Temple), is expecting an additional burden of Rs 10 crore from this year.Besides the Golden Temple, the SGPC runs the langar services in other famous Sikh shrines like Takht Keshgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib (where the modern day Khalsa Panth was established on April 13, 1699, by Guru Gobind Singh), Takht Damdama Sahib at Talwandi Sabo in Bathinda district and scores of other gurdwaras under it.The ""Langar Sewa"" (community kitchen) is a socio-religious activity that is part of the Sikh religious ethos from the time of the first Sikh Guru, Nanak Dev (1469-1539). The langar was started to emphasise equality in society regardless of religion, caste, colour and creed.With the new GST slabs likely to hit the SGPC 's purchases with an additional financial burden, Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has written to Finance Minister Arun Jaitely to exempt all purchases made by SGPC for ""langar sewa"" from the GST Act.""The Punjab government had earlier exempted all items purchased for langar by SGPC at Sri Darbar Sahib Amritsar, Sri Keshgarh Sahib Anandpur and Talwandi Sabo Bathinda from VAT. The SGPC spends around Rs 75 crore to purchase desi ghee, sugar and pulses. Now, it will have to bear a financial burden of Rs 10 crore on these purchases as they come under the 5 to 18 per cent GST bracket,"" Badal pointed out.SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar has also sent a communication to the GST Council, which decides on the tax structure and exemptions, to exempt the Sikh body from the GST slabs.""Sri Harmandir Sahib runs the world's largest mega kitchen, offering free meals throughout the year to hundreds of thousands of people. (It is funded by) offerings made by people,"" Badal pointed out.""The central government should immediately withdraw the GST on purchases made by the SGPC and other religious institutions that are doing community service of this magnitude,"" Prithipal Singh, a devout Sikh who has been doing voluntary service at the Langar Hall of the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar for the past nearly a decade, told IANS.Under the new GST Act, there is provision for exemption to institutions/businesses on the recommendation of the GST Council.Hundreds of people volunteer on a daily basis at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare and serve food and wash used utensils at the langars. The volunteers include scores of women and children as well. People partake langar while sitting on the floor in the langar halls of gurdwaras.The langar service is funded from donations made by people at gurdwaras. The SGPC has an annual budget of over Rs 1,100 crore to manage the gurdwaras under it.""Anyone coming to the langar is offered food. No one is ever turned back. It is part of the Sikh ethos,"" volunteer Gagandeep Singh pointed out.Hundreds of tonnes of wheat flour, desi ghee, pulses, vegetables, milk, sugar and rice are used, along with millions of litres of water, annually at the Golden Temple complex and other gurdwaras to prepare langar.The langar is completely vegetarian."

Representational Image.The Central GST (CGST) rate of 5% on edible goods will apply only on those registered under Trade Marks Act of 1999, the government said on Wednesday making it clear the ambit of branded edible items.The CGST rate on supply of certain goods, such as paneer, natural honey, wheat, rice and other cereals, pulses, flour of cereals and pulses is nil. However, supply of such goods, when put up in unit container and bearing a registered brand name will attract CGST at the rate of 2.5%, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.Thus, unless the brand name or trade name is actually on the register of trademarks and is in force under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, CGST rate of 5% will not be applicable on the supply of such goods, the ministry said.The ministrys clarification came amid doubts over what could be treated as branded or unbranded for sale under GST.Premier traders body CAIT had appealed to the government earlier last month to come out with a notification what constituted branded edible goods.It said that in absence of any clear cut directive, it was assumed that all packaged food will have to be taxed at 5%. Only those that come loose and sell mostly in mom & stores and roadside venders will qualify for nil tax.The government subsequently issued a notification detailing CGST rates of intra-state supply of goods another defining registered brand name as brand name or trade name, which is registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1999."

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

On the first day itself, the department booked 95 retailers.The traders were allegedly involved in charging above MRP for items such as rice and other essential commodities. Tampering with the price recorded on packets and reducing the quantity of commodities were the other anomalies detected.The raids were conducted in over 200 establishments on the directive of Food and Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman. The minister directed district supply officers and controllers of Legal Metrology to conduct checks in business establishments at major trading centres.With the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) the prices of food items have come down. The minister urged traders and hoteliers to pass on the benefit to consumers.Central Zone of Legal Metrology Department. Central Zone deputy controller R Ram Mohan said the drive was mostly against supermarkets. Squads were deployed in all districts to check whether the retailers were following the GST norms. We found several retailers selling goods without the MRP tag. Without price tag, the people will not be able to know the exact price and tax levied on each products, he said.In Ernakulam district three cases were registered. Eight cases were booked in Thrissur, while five cases were registered in Palakkad. Cases were booked against two retailers in Idukki. The department also decided to continue the drive until GST norms were fully enforced.The cases were registered under section 36(1) of Packaged Commodity Rule. The retailers booked during the crackdown will be charged a fine of Rs 25,000. If the offence is repeated, the department will initiate prosecution proceedings against him, Ram Mohan said.The crackdown also revealed many retailers were still unaware of the GST. The retailers still do not know about the changes in tax system after the introduction of the GST. However, the enforcement drive will continue to ensure the consumers are not exploited in the name of GST, the officer said.Once the crackdown on supermarkets is completed, the department will launch a drive against small scale retailers. There will be raids on hypermarkets in Kochi and Thrissur also."

These canteens which primarily caters to nearly 24,300 MTC employees including drivers and conductors came under the scanner of the state food safety department after reports emerged of poor quality food being served.K Anbazhgan, an MTC employee who was working in Chrompet bus depot took up the issue with higher authorities in the work floor and following a refusal to accept the complaint by the latter, he approached the food safety wing. In his complaint dated May 24, Anbazhgan mentioned that many MTC employees fell sick after consuming food from the depot canteens of late and some were unable to report to duty as they were frequently hospitalised for diarrhoea and other related ailments.Responding to this, seven different teams headed by R Kathiravan, designated officer, food safety department conducted an inspection all the 20 canteens across the capital city on June 19. It was found that all the canteens, maintained by MTC in their bus depots, were functioning without obtaining food safety licences and registration certificates, Kathiravan said in his reply to the complainant on June 29.According to Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, food businesses which have an annual turnover of less than Rs.12 lakh should register with Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and those above this ceiling should get a licence from the same autonomous body functioning under the Union Health Ministry.Post-inspection, Tamil Nadu food safety authorities had written to managing director of MTC pointing out various deficiencies in the manner in which food is prepared and served in the said canteens. Nine major concerns were highlighted including unhygienic kitchens, unsafe drinking water, poor personal hygienic of cooks and have advised MTC authorities not to use rotten vegetables.The complainant, Anbazhgan said that alongside these violations, MTC authorities are culpable of not serving 600 g of rice as per their contractual terms and engaged in verbal abuse when employees raised the matter.Despite not possessing licenses to operate, how could MTC let out contracts who were minting money? posed Anbazhgan, adding that this shows the lack of transparency in the accounts. Responding to this, a MTC official said that they have instructed all the contractors in Chennai to apply for licenses and rectify the deficiencies.Notably, MTC canteen at Aynavaram found itself in a controversy last month after allegations of plastic rice was being served to employees surfaced."

(Source: AP) Former Thailands Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra poses as she casts her vote in a national referendum on a new constitution at a polling station. (Source: AP)Thailands former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra arrived at a Bangkok court to shouts of encouragement from her supporters on Friday, two weeks before the final stages of a case about her involvement in a ruinously expensive state rice subsidy scheme. Yingluck, whose government was ousted in a 2014 military coup, faces up to 10 years in prison if she is found guilty of negligence over her role in the scheme, which proved popular with rural voters but was a disaster for state coffers.The former prime minister and opposition say the trial is politically motivated and is aimed at undermining the populist movement that has won every election since 2001. The movement is opposed by Thailands powerful military and conservative elite.Around 500 supporters showed up outside the court on Friday, police said, the largest turnout in many months. One wrote Love the prime minister on his hand, while others shouted: fight, fight. Yingluck has denied the charges against her.The military has said it will deploy troops to maintain security on July 21, when a final hearing in the case is expected. Yinglucks critics see the rice case as a litmus test of the juntas sincerity in tackling corruption in politics, one of its promises after it seized power in 2014.Closing statements in the case will be delivered within 30 days of the final hearing, court officials said.Im confident in the witnesses weve presented, Yingluck told crowds outside the court. The encouragement Ive been given is still good  this is a strong characteristic of the Thai people, she said.STREET PROTESTSSuccessive Thai governments have supported farmers since the 1980s, but none of the schemes has proved as popular with rural voters as the rice programmes pioneered by Yinglucks brother, ousted former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.Yinglucks government went a step further, promising to buy rice from farmers at some 50 percent above the market price. The scheme helped her to sail to victory in a 2011 general election, making her the countrys first female prime minister.However, public losses from the scheme fuelled street protests against Yingluck that eventually saw her removed from power just weeks before the 2014 coup.The scheme also saw Thailand lose its crown as the worlds top rice exporter as other countries, notably Vietnam and India, filled the void when Thailand held back rice stocks it had bought from farmers.The military government has managed to sell off most of about 18 million tonnes of rice accumulated during the rice scheme, some of it for industrial purposes, according to the commerce ministry. Yingluck said on Friday she was not sure when she would deliver her closing statement.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

He was speaking at a conference of MPs ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament. The Union Government should agree to set up monitoring cells at the state level and publish the tax rate before and after GST rollout.The tax rate of 12 percent imposed on non-AC restaurants should be reduced and the tax on ayurveda medicines should be slashed from 12 per cent to five per cent. Keralas tourism industry will be badly hit if the tax on houseboats is not reduced, Pinarayi said.He said he will take up with Prime Minister Narendra Modi the hike in air fares by airline companies during the festive season. Though the Union Civil Aviation Secretary had promised that more seats will be allotted during the festive season, it was not implemented. During Ramzan, the airfare was steeply hiked, Pinarayi said.The state government is opposed to the privatisation of central PSUs. Hindustan Newsprint, Velloor, Hindustan Organic Chemicals Ltd, Kochi, and HLL Lifecare, Thiruvananthapuram, are among the units being considered for closure or privatisation. Pinarayi urged the MPs to intervene in the matter.The intervention of MPs was crucial in getting an All-India Institute of Medical Sciences in the state, an international ayurveda research centre at Kannur, and an institute of tribal health at Wayanad. Central assistance is required for Malabar Cancer Centre in Kannur and a health insurance project for migrant labourers.On the railway front, the completion of Angamaly-Sabari line and Guruvayur-Thirunavaya lines need to be taken up with the Centre. The Nilambur-Nanjangud railway line via Nilambur should also be taken up, he said.The state is opposed to the Central Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill which is awaiting assent by the Rajya Sabha. Once implemented, state governments will not be in a position to operate bus services.He also asked MPs to demand Central assistance to ensure price stability for rubber. Central assistance is also required for increasing the area of paddy cultivation from two lakh hectares to three lakh hectares, he said.The states quota of rice and wheat should also be increased. As per the National Food Security Act, Kerala is entitled to get 14.25 lakh tonnes of foodgrain. An additional six lakh tonnes of foodgrain is required for the state, Pinarayi said.The Chief Minister also asked MPs to approve of a special quota of kerosene for fishermen in the state.

If it was a government programme, why did they invite former BJP MLAs to the event? asked BJD Rajya Sabha MP Pratap Deb.However, BJP termed Patnaiks boycott as his lack of interest in states affairs.I dont think Naveen babu cares for states interests and is not interested to go to places where there is no chance of an image makeover. The LNG terminal would bring prosperity to Odisha, but he is not bothered, said Sajjan Sharma, BJP spokesman.Scheduled for completion in 2020, the LNG terminal would feed IOCs three oil refineries at Barauni, Haldia and Paradip besides supplying feedstock to fertiliser plants at Barauni, Sindri and Gorakhpur.The politics of boycott between the two parties has been going on for a while.Last month, Patnaik skipped the inauguration event of the first food park in tribal-dominated district of Rayagada although Union minister of food processing industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal had invited him.The Rs 80 crore food park has fully operational industrial sheds for entrepreneurs, industrial plots for lease to food processing units, rice processing complex, dry warehouse and cold storage."

Basmati-386 that once brought fame to the region for its aroma and the length of its grain, is now grown on only 10% of the area it was grown just five years ago, Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana, has estimated.The reasons are many. These include the governments failure to put a favorable export system in place with the main reason being the inadequate returns to the farmer. Falling yields of the variety with newer more productive varieties being discovered have added to the farmer turning away from sowing the variety.Economics just does not add upGurjit Singh, a farmer from Chaguwan village that famous for this variety, says, This variety yields 8-10 quintals per acre. This is lower than other basmati varieties  PUSA-1121, PUSA-1509, Punjab-4 and 5  that yield 15 quintals per acre to 18 quintals per acre.Satnam Singh, another progressive farmer from Kuhala village, said, I sowed Basmati-386 on once acre and got only Rs 2,400 per quintal. I needed to earn Rs 5,500 per quintal to make ends meet. I sowed the variety only to make it alive. He added that the variety was also sown a month later than normal paddy, delaying the sowing of the Rabi wheat. This lowers the wheat yield by up to two quintals per acre. The government, however, in not serious on our concerns. Millers question quality of our produce on flimsy grounds, he claimed.Cultivation of Basmati-386 is no longer viable as the PAU and other agri-universities in the country have developed other look-alike varieties which give better yield, said Ashok Arora, owner of Dawat Basmati Rice, a prominent rice exporter. An attempt to make a similar variety, Basmati-370, also did not work as the aroma could not be reproduced.Apart from the two villages of Chaguwan and Kuhala, the other villages famous for the variety are Brar, Khyala, Bullar, Chawinda. These villages fall in Chugawan, Harchha Chhina, Ajnala and Attari blocks, respectively. Tarn Tarans Gaddiwind blocks and Gurdaspurs Batala area also situated in this belt.Chief agriculture officer Dalbir Singh Chinna said they aimed to ensure that growers got good price for their produce of older varieties to ensure survival.Why has Basmati-386 withered away?The main reason being the inadequate returns to the farmerThe governments failure to put a favorable export system in place withFalling yields of the varietyNewer more productive varieties have been discovered"

(File Photo) Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. (File Photo)The Sikkim government is set to take the West Bengal government to court for losses it incurred because of the Gorkhaland agitation in Darjeeling.Government representatives claimed that ever since the protests began, the West Bengal government and its police have deliberately prevented supply of goods to Sikkim, stopping trucks from entering the state because of the support Sikkim  including its Chief Minister Pawan Chamling  has shown for a separate Gorkhaland.National Highway 10, which connects Siliguri in North Bengal to Gangtok, is the only highway that connects Sikkim to the rest of the country and serves as the states lifeline.Sikkims lone Member of Parliament P D Rai, speaking with The Indian Express, said, We are planning to approach the Supreme Court next week. The circumstances which have been created are unconstitutional. Our food supply and all other essential goods coming to Sikkim have been stopped. In Siliguri, many of our trucks carrying essential goods have been stopped by police in civil clothes, while uniformed police have looked on. Just because we have a particular stand, which has been a known stand for many years, this is being done.Rai said that such disruptions have taken place routinely due to the shared highway with West Bengal, but the past 20 days  since the agitations began  have been particularly bad. Over the past 30 years, Sikkim has incurred losses worth Rs 60,000 crore due to such disruptions. We want the West Bengal government to make good on these losses, he said, adding that in the past 20 days alone, the state has incurred losses of Rs 200 crore.Till the day before Mamata Banerjee decided to hold her cabinet meeting in Darjeeling, there was not a single room vacant in any hotel in Sikkim. But since then, there is not a single room that is occupied. Our economic losses have been huge. Disruptions and agitations will occur, you cant prevent that. But the highway should have been protected by paramilitary to ensure that essential goods reach us. Yesterday, areas in north Sikkim ran out of rice and pulses; we have shipped these items to them today. There is no problem with organic vegetables or dairy in the state, but we import our cereals, and this has been hit. There is no cash in ATMs either, said Rai.Operators of trucks that ferry goods from Siliguri to Sikkim called an indefinite bandh on June 30 to protest the alleged attack on Sikkim-bound trucks by anti-Gorkhaland protesters. Groups of youths protesting the division of Bengal allegedly vandalised two trucks in Dhupguri and New Jalpaiguri, and another in Siliguri carrying milk supply for the Indian Army, on June 30. Tanker associations have also stopped supplying fuel to Sikkim.Very soon, our medical supplies will run out. We are sandwiched between two agitations  for and against Gorkhaland. The West Bengal government needs to pay up, said Rai.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0662fd9855b76bf13c5f47,MGNREGA wages less than minimum farm wages in 15 states: Panel,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mgnrega-wages-less-than-minimum-farm-wages-in-15-states-panel-4743412/,2017-07-09,"Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image) Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month. (Representational image)THE COMMITTEE for revision of wages paid under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarentee Act (MGNREGA) has found that minimum agricultural wages are higher than MGNREGA wages in 15 states. An upward revision in MGNREGA wages is estimated to require a Rs 4,500 crore increase in its budget.Based on these findings, the panel, under Additional Secretary in the Ministry of Rural Development Nagesh Singh, is expected to make its recommendations in another month.As per data being examined by the committee, the minimum wages paid to agricultural workers are significantly higher than MGNREGA wages in Karnataka, Punjab, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.The other states where MGNREGA wages fail to match up are Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar. In Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh, the minimum wages are marginally higher than MGNREGA wages.In the 15 states where MGNREGA wages are lower, we tried revising it to bring it on par with the minimum agricultural wages paid by the respective states. Where MGNREGA wages are on par or higher, we decided to protect it as it is. If a revision is done as per this formula, it is estimated that a Rs 4,500 crore addition to the existing MGNREGA budget would be needed, said an official from the Ministry of Rural Development.The Indian Express had earlier reported that despite official claims of this years MGNREGA budget of Rs 48,000 crore being the highest ever, the wage revision, at 2.7 per cent, was the lowest ever. It meant a per day, per person wage hike of merely Re 1 in some states like Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and Rs 2-Rs 3 in several others.This was because the finance ministry, on account of financial implications, rejected the recommendations of the S Mahendra Dev committee, which had proposed to bring MGNREGA wages on par with minimum wages paid to unskilled agricultural workers in the states. The expert panel had said that the Consumer Price Index for Rural (CPI-R), which reflects the current consumption pattern of rural households, should be the basis for revising MGNREGA wage rates, and not CPI for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL), which is based on the consumption pattern of 1983.The basket of goods for calculating CPI-AL comprises mainly food items. With the implementation of the National Food Security Act, rice and wheat is available for as cheap as Rs 2-3 per kg. CPI(Rural) gives lower weightage to food items, and hence, is found to be a better indicator of wage increase, said a ministry official.The Nagesh Singh panel has found that based on the second recommendation of the Mahendra Dev committee, if the existing MGNREGA wages are revised as per CPI(Rural), it would mean another Rs 600 crore increase in the budget.CPI(R) should be used to revise the wages every year instead of CPI(AL), as the former is more representative of the current rural consumption basket. Also, wage revision should take place every six months, in keeping with the practice for other trades and occupation, said Ankita Aggarwal from the peoples organisation, NREGA Sangharsh Morcha. Aggarwal said that with such low wages and delays in payments, MGNREGA fails to provide the livelihood security for which it was enacted.Jharkhand Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma had recently written a strongly-worded letter to the Ministry of Rural Development protesting against the growing divergence between the states minimum wage, which is currently Rs 224 per day, and MGNREGA wages of just Rs 168 per day after the wage hike.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

While the road connecting the village is in bad shape, electricity is still a luxury for the villagers.We have to wade through knee-deep water to reach the village and locals told the delegation that they are depending on nullah for drinking water, Nayak said.Several NFSA beneficiaries of the village said they have not received subsidised rice under the food security scheme in the last four months.The BJP delegation also visited the Sorada hospital where 80-year-old Bhanumati Nayak was admitted for her treatment and died on July 5.While Mahaprayan vehicle for carrying bodies from hospitals to homes was lying defunct for the last four months, the hospital authorities had no alternative, Nayak said.This is the condition of the people in the home district of Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who has been ruling the State for the last 17 years, the BJP MLA said.The body of the old woman, tied in cloth and slung to a piece of bamboo, was carried by her family members to their village at Sorishabili on Wednesday as the the hospital authorities failed to arrange a vehicle to send the body to her village."
5a0665189855b76bf13c60c1,Simply Manila!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/jul/10/simply-manila-1625647.html,2017-07-10,"HYDERABAD: Manila, the capital city of the Philippines holds a not so enviable title of the most densely populated cities in the world (we are not far behind, our amchi Mumbai is the second runner up!). The city is a mix of old and new: where the modern skyscrapers vie for attention with Spanish colonial architecture, even as the much polluted Pasig River flows by helplessly. Overriding all this, it is the quaint charm of the old city: the numerous churches and remnants of the Spanish rule that appeals to a sensitive traveller. Like all cities, Manila lives in its unforgettable history and the footprints left by various invaders.Tourism is a vital industry in Manila, attracting more than one million tourists annually. Top in the major tourist attractions is the walled city of Intramuros, the historic centre of Manila, whose architecture reflects the Spanish colonial and the American Neoclassical styles: the Philippines was a colony of Spain and the US before it was granted independence in 1946.The traffic jams in Metro Manila give you ample time at traffic signals to do some people watching and buy rice cakes from the vendors. Red, my driver (yes, thats his name - just Red), endowed with a warm smile and equipped with authentic information on local attractions, was too eager to show me his city. Talking about the Philippines and explaining the topography he said, We can travel either North or South in my country. If we move East or West, we will end up in the ocean.Rizal ParkAs we entered one of the largest urban parks in Asia, the beauty of La Madre Filipina statue in pure white struck me. Situated by the Manila Bay, it is an important site in Philippine history: the execution of national hero Jose Rizal in 1896 triggered the Philippines Revolution against the Spanish rule. Rizal Park honours his memory and the bronze-and- granite Rizal monument is among the most famous sculptural landmarks in the country.Fort SantiagoThe defence fortress Fort Santiago is part of the structures of the walled city of Manila referred to as Intramuros. One of the most important historical sites in Manila, several lives were lost in its prisons during the Spanish Colonial Period and World War II. The dungeons that were used as prison cells were damp and scary.Jose Rizal, one of the Philippine national heroes, was imprisoned here before his execution in 1896. The Rizal Shrine Museum displays memorabilia of the hero in their collection and the fort features, embedded onto the ground in bronze, his footsteps representing his final walk from his cell to the location of the actual execution. Seen from here, the Pasig River in the foreground sadly reflects the high-rise buildings and the transformation the city has gone through over a period.IntramurosThe city was the capital and seat of Spanish sovereignty in the Orient for over three hundred years. Threats of invasion by Chinese and Japanese pirates prompted the construction of defences consisting of high stonewalls, bulwarks and moats. The area consisted of residences, churches, palaces, schools, and government buildings. Entry was made possible through gates with drawbridges that were closed before midnight and opened at the break of dawn. Thus the city earned the name Intramuros, meaning within the walls.It served as the political, cultural, educational, religious, and commercial centre of Spains empire in the East. The riches of Asia were gathered in the Walled City (as Intramuros was later known) and loaded on galleons for transport to Acapulco, Mexico. After surviving a number of earthquakes, typhoons, fires, and wars through the centuries, Intramuros took the deathblow when the Americans liberated the Philippines from the Japanese in 1945.Artillery shells reduced the walls and buildings to ashes. Thousands died during the eight-day siege, making Intramuros a dead city. Today the place is buzzing with tourists, and the former residents are busy running shops and restaurants.Casa ManilaThis interesting colonial lifestyle museum within Intramuros reflects the living style of the affluent during the Spanish colonisation. Situated close to the historic San Augustan church, this antique looking building was built recently by Imelda Marcos. Made of stone and wood, the sprawling, quaint mansion is filled with beautifully crafted wooden furniture, highly polished mirrors, fine porcelain, exquisite tapestries, and curios. The beautiful courtyard, well-equipped kitchen, and the well on the top floor are simply charming!We breezed through the busy Binondo, the oldest Chinatown in the world, the citys centre of commerce and trade for all types of businesses run by Filipino-Chinese merchants with a wide variety of shops and restaurants.I dedicated the next day entirely for shopping as Manila is regarded as one of the best shopping destinations in Asia - quality goods, trusted brands, all at reasonable prices. I entered the Mall of Asia and was lost in that mysterious world of shopping: it is one place where a woman is at peace with herself.(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at vijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

Ironically, the petitioner did not get the answers to his complaint.M Kasimayan, a Thiruvottiyur resident, had lodged a complaint with the commissioner of Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Control Administration department in July 2016 about poor quality rice allegedly being served by a private departmental store in his neighbourhood.Though it was forwarded to the designated food safety officer in Thiruvallur district, no action was taken. Unhappy with this, Kasimayan filed an RTI petition with the food safety department in August 2016.Of his seven questions, only three were answered, with the remaining questions (pertaining to the specific case) referred to the designated officer in Thiruvallur.Following this, he was ignored three times, after which Kasimayan again wrote to the state information commission on June 26, 2017, to initiate contempt proceedings.Fearing the wrath of the commission, the public information officer of the food safety department, C Balasubramanian, finally sent a reply the very next day. And Kasimayan was startled to find several hundred sheets as a response.Though I had sought details about follow-ups to my complaint filed on July 2016, the department by mistake sent me details on follow-ups to all the complaints they received since July 2016, Kasimayan told Express.However, details on the exact action are taken with respect to the complaint were missing again. He also expressed qualms over public money being misspent in the form of providing irrelevant information.Balasubramanian was unavailable for comment, while Express was denied access when it tried meeting him at his office."

But the dry spell wilted germinated seedlings and forced Mujalge to plough land and prepare it for re-sowing.""I want to sow again once we get rainfall, but I don't have money to buy seeds,"" he told Reuters by phone.Indian farmers had initially rushed to sow seeds after ample rains, bringing total planting levels to 40.43 million hectares by July 7, up 9 percent from a year ago.""In two days rainfall is likely to revive in central India that badly needs rains,"" said a Pune based official with IMD.A drop in output of summer-sown crops could lift overseas purchases of edible oils and pulses by India, the world's biggest importer of both, while limiting its rice and cotton exports.""Due to the consecutive droughts and demonetization farmers income was curtailed in the last three years. This year they badly need good rainfall,"" said Kotak's Hudani."

The European Union accounts for 13 per cent of the production increase. Rice production is expected to grow by 66 Mt and will be almost exclusively driven by yield growth, which accounts for 93 per cent of additional production.The global area dedicated to rice is expected to increase by only a per cent from the base period, while global yields will increase by 12 per cent. Major production gains are projected for India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam with yields in these countries are expected to increase by over 15 per cent.The report said that global food commodity prices are projected to remain low over the next decade compared to previous peaks, as demand growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to slow down and biofuel policies have a diminished impact on markets.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Now, the state government has no power to exempt SGPC from paying any kind of tax.Hence, Harsimrat Kaur has shot off a separate letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to resume the old exemptions under the new tax system controlled by the Centre.Explaining the impact of GST on community kitchen, Golden Temple manager Sulakhan Singh said, Earlier, there was 4 per cent tax on desi ghee. We were exempted from paying this tax. Now, tax on ghee under GST has been increased from 4 per cent to 12 per cent. It means now we will have to buy 50 kg ghee by paying Rs 600 more. He added, We were spending around Rs 75 crore annually on buying ghee, pulses, sugar, vegetables, spices, wheat, rice and other items to run the community kitchen, where more than 50,000 devotees have langar every day on an average. Now, we are being made to pay tax which is even higher than the old system.SAD (Badal) has been an alliance partner at the Centre and there would not only be financial but also political ramifications if SGPC failed to convince the Centre to grant exemption from paying GST.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But the dry spell wilted germinated seedlings and forced Mujalge to plough land and prepare it for re-sowing.I want to sow again once we get rainfall, but I dont have money to buy seeds, he told Reuters by phone.Farmers had initially rushed to sow seeds after ample rains, bringing total planting levels to 40.43 million hectares by July 7, up 9% from a year ago.In two days rainfall is likely to revive in central India that badly needs rains, said a Pune based official with IMD.A drop in output of summer-sown crops could lift overseas purchases of edible oils and pulses by India, the worlds biggest importer of both, while limiting its rice and cotton exports.Due to the consecutive droughts and demonetization farmers income was curtailed in the last three years. This year they badly need good rainfall, said Kotaks Hudani."

India will overtake China and is projected to be the most populous country in the world by 2026.The report said that given their strong population growth, India and Sub-Saharan Africa will also drive a large share of global demand.It further said that over the first quarter of the 21st century, milk production in India will be nearly tripled. ""Over the course of the outlook period alone, milk production in India will grow 49 per cent; in 2026, India will be the world's largest milk producer, with an output one-third above that of the second largest producer, the European Union,"" said the report by the UN and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.Global production of wheat is projected to increase by 11 per cent over the outlook period of 2017-2026, while the wheat area increases by only 1.8 per cent.The increase in wheat production is expected to occur through higher yields, most notably in Asia and Pacific, which will account for 46 per cent of additional wheat production. Within the region and globally, India (15 Mt) will account for the biggest increase in production and Pakistan (6 Mt) and China (5.5 Mt) are also expected to have significant gains.The European Union accounts for 13 per cent of the production increase. Rice production is expected to grow by 66 Mt and will be almost exclusively driven by yield growth, which accounts for 93 per cent of additional production. The global area dedicated to rice is expected to increase by only a per cent from the base period, while global yields will increase by 12 per cent. Major production gains are projected for India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam with yields in these countries are expected to increase by over 15 per cent.The report said that global food commodity prices are projected to remain low over the next decade compared to previous peaks, as demand growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to slow down and biofuel policies have a diminished impact on markets."
5a06b7dd9855b76bf13c69a4,Pre-monsoon rain cheer for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170601/jsp/bihar/story_154462.jsp,2017-06-01,"Bihar has received around 50 per cent more than normal pre-monsoon rainfall between March 1 and May 31, which should be good enough reason for farmers to cheer as it would help kharif crops in a big way. Patna office meteorologist Sandeep Kumar said the normal rainfall for the pre-monsoon season in Bihar is 77.6mm against which the state has received 124.3mm. Most of the districts, including Patna, received above normal rainfall (see chart) heralding a favourable condition for the farmers who are gearing up for the kharif season. Agriculture department deputy director Anil Kumar Jha said: ""A good pre-monsoon rainfall would lead to early preparation of nursery for paddy plants and their timely transplantation in the field."" Normally, it takes around 20 to 25 days for a paddy plant to get ready in the nursery for being transplanted to the field. The ideal time of paddy nursery preparation is from May 25 to June 15 and timely and more-than-sufficient rainfall in the pre-monsoon period has ushered in relief. Farmers are otherwise forced either to take help of irrigation means, which involve cost, or have to start preparing the nursery work late waiting for the rains, which adversely hit the paddy crop. ""A paddy plant requires something between 100 and 155 days to get matured depending on the kind of variety being sown. Timely transplantation helps in proper growth of the plant and it does not need to be delayed till the advent of winter, as cold is detrimental to the paddy crop,"" said a rice scientist associated with Rajendra Agriculture University, Pusa. Apart from paddy, which is the main kharif crop of Bihar, other crops like vegetables, sugarcane, maize, arhar and finger millet, too, would benefit from the moisture content in the soil added because of the good pre-monsoon rainfall. The Bihar government has also promoted cultivation of green manure ahead of paddy transplantation, as it adds to the bio-mass content in the soil, which enhances crop productivity. ""Normally, farmers have to irrigate their fields for proper growth of the green manure. Good rainfall in the pre-monsoon season would save this cost,"" Jha said. The maturing period of green manure is 30 to 40 days and after getting ready, this crop is ploughed back in the field for adding to its fertility. Flood measures The state disaster management authority (SDMA) is planning to introduce special provisions in its standard operating procedure for floods so that proper care could be taken of transgenders in Bihar during the calamity. SDMA vice-chairman Vyasji shared the information on Wednesday and stated that the details for it would be discussed on Thursday when a state-level workshop would be organised in Patna to mark the beginning of the flood safety week in Bihar. The SDMA has been made the nodal agency for organising special programmes from June 1 to 7 during the flood safety week. Reshma, a transgender from Bihar, who thanked the SDMA for taking the initiative said: ""Transgenders face several problems during natural disasters and during the Chennai cyclones many of them had been raped and harassed. It is good that the Bihar government is showing us sensitivity."" According to the 2011 census, Bihar is home to 40,827 transgenders."
5a06b8659855b76bf13c69dc,Farm provides growth impetus,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170601/jsp/business/story_154524.jsp,2017-06-01,"New Delhi, May 31: A robust farm growth of 5.2 per cent in the March quarter pushed GDP growth up to 7.1 per cent. However, growth in the sector was lower than the previous quarter's expansion of 6.9 per cent. Farm growth for the full fiscal zoomed to 4.9 per cent because of good rainfall and record food-grain production compared with a near flat 0.7 per cent expansion in 2015-16. ""The third advance estimates of foodgrain production was 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, which is higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 million tonnes and final estimates of 251.57 million tonnes in the agricultural year 2015-16,"" an official statement said. Earlier this month, the agriculture ministry had released its third advance estimates for agriculture production in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). ""The volume, spatial and temporal distribution of the monsoon in 2017 would be crucial in determining kharif sowing and production dynamics. Following the record-high growth of most crops in 2016-17, our baseline expectation is that growth of agricultural GVA would moderate appreciably in 2017-18 from 4.9 per cent in 2016-17,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist with ICRA, said. According to the data, rice production is estimated at a record 109.15 million tonnes, wheat at a record 97.44mt and pulses at an all-time high of 22.40mt. Coarse cereal production is estimated to be a record 44.39mt in 2016-17 against 38.52mt last year. The foodgrain basket comprises rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses. ""As a result of very good rainfall during monsoon 2016 and various policy initiatives taken by the government, the country has witnessed record foodgrain production in the current year,"" the ministry had said. With the Met department forecasting a normal monsoon this year, the government is expecting to break last year's record foodgrain production. ""While GDP numbers are subdued we believe that this was expected after demonetisation. We do not expect demonetisation impact to spill over in 2017-18 as multiple sectors are showing signs of recovery as well as a positive thrust from the normal monsoon,"" Vaibhav Agrawal, head of research, Angel Broking, said. The southwest monsoon yesterday hit Kerala and the Northeast, two days ahead of the scheduled arrival of the crucial seasonal rainfall. The news brought cheer to farmers, especially from the drought-hit states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka. More than 50 per cent of the country's farmers rely on monsoon to grow their produce. The farm sector accounts for about 15 per cent of India's $2 trillion economy and 260 million farmers depend on the monsoon to grow crops such as rice, cane and cotton. Higher farm incomes lift the demand for an array of consumer goods such as cosmetics, television sets and automobiles, which boost overall economic growth."

Picture by Saidul Khan Ampati, June 21: Meghalaya chief minister Mukul Sangma today urged the people of the state to create opportunities for youths in the fields of entrepreneurship and business. ""Jobs in the government sector are limited. We should create enterprises for the next generation. We have to engage our youths in productive activities,"" he said, while addressing a gathering comprising wholesale dealers, civil society organisations, and village chiefs at Ampati in South West Garo Hills. He stressed the need to learn the act of entrepreneurship by running fair price shops. ""Meghalaya will prosper if its people are engaged in successful business ventures. This would help the government generate revenue. It is an incumbent on the government to create hope for its people in partnership with various communities,"" he said. The government has been sensitising the people to make Garo hills a business hub and tap the potential in neighbouring Bangladesh and in the rest of the country with the new road connectivity, which is being developed via Dhubri in Assam to Bengal, the chief minister said. Talking about the poor pass percentage in matriculation examination in Garo hills, the chief minister said youths are being lured into insurgency. ""Identifying the ground situation and the problems faced by the youths, the government has simplified the education criteria for recruitment in police so that youths have an opportunity to compete for the low-rank services,"" he said. While speaking to the wholesalers and dealers of fair price shops, Mukul said the government, by an act of Parliament, has been able to ensure food security in the country to eradicate poverty and hunger. ""The state government had several challenges in terms of distribution of essential food commodities but has been able to deal with the issue with the support and partnership of different stakeholders, particularly the wholesale and fair price shop dealers,"" he said. The government had faced several constraints to reach out to the grassroots in terms of handling and transportation of essential food items. ""The consistent support of the wholesale and fair price shop dealers have created an enabling environment for the effective delivery of the programme in the state,"" Mukul said, while handing over appreciation certificates to the wholesale and fair price shop dealers for their cooperation in the successful implementation of the National Food Security Act. ""The price of essential commodities are increasing. But the act ensures that the vulnerable and marginalised sections of the society receive the essential food items at a rate fixed by Parliament,"" he said. The chief minister said Meghalaya was the only state in the country to provide packaged sugar under the programme that has been recently withdrawn from the component by the Centre. ""The Centre asked us to discontinue providing sugar under the act. But we have decided to work out modalities from our own resources and continue providing sugar along with rice and other foodgrains. But instead of providing 3kg sugar, we will continue to provide 1kg from the state government's resources,"" he added. The chief minister said the government is promoting different livelihood activities under the flagship programme Integrated Basin Development and Livelihood Promotion, which encompasses sectors like agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, fisheries, apiculture, sericulture, industries and tourism. The government is also facilitating financial and bank linkages, besides offering to set up enterprises from different business incubation and entrepreneurial facilitation centres, he added."

5a06f9279855b76bf13c6ffd,Three square meals for Rs 34: Here is why prisoners risk assault to seek better food,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/three-square-meals-for-rs-34-here-is-why-prisoners-risk-assault-to-seek-better-food-4746559/,2017-07-11,"Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22.ACCORDING to many of her former cellmates, it was Manjula Shetyes complaint about a shortage of eggs and paav that cost the 35-year-old inmate her life inside the Byculla Womens Prison. On June 23, the 45-year-old convict serving the final few months of her sentence died after an assault allegedly by jail staff following a scuffle over food rations.For most, its hard to imagine staking life and personal safety for two eggs, but former prison inmates do not find it surprising at all that Shetye picked a grave fight over food. In a place where dal is referred to as pathar ke sanam for the substantial number of stones found wading in it, and rock hard rotis are surreptitiously used by prisoners as fuel to light up small kitchen fires called hundis to spice up their notoriously low quality and bland diet, the longing for decent food afflicts almost every prisoner.Every day you should stand outside the prison gates and monitor the garbage that is strewn out. Almost 75 per cent of the garbage would comprise of rotis and rice that get thrown away because they are unpalatable, says Wahid Shaikh, a former undertrial who spent over eight years inside various jails in the city. Clearly, access to good food is a distant dream for the 29,567 prisoners lodged in Maharashtras jails. Data shows the Indian state spends as little as Rs 52.42 on every prisoner per day to arrange the three square meals prescribed in the diet charts of prison manuals. In 2015, Maharashtra spent Rs 34.22 per prisoner per day, the third lowest in the country. Only Goa (Rs 32.83) and Delhi (Rs 31.31) fared worse.In fact, Maharashtra has historically spent smaller sums on prisoners food than the national average. In 2000, the Indian average was around Rs 13.43 compared to Maharashtras spending of Rs 10.33 per day. Prisoners are served three times a day. They get breakfast at 7 am, lunch at 9 am and dinner by 3 pm. The food is prepared by a revolving team of 25 prisoners who work in two shifts rolling out nearly 18,000 chappatis in one day.As per the law, the food is supposed to be prepared under hygienic conditions under strict supervision of a committee headed by the jail superintendent, but the conditions do not meet even basic hygienic requirements in reality. If you see the place where food is cooked, I promise you will not touch that food again. From rats to insects, almost everything can be found in the kitchen as well as the food. The workers who cook have been allotted a small room in the kitchen where they relieve themselves. Imagine your food being prepared where people piss and defecate, says Shaikh.Over the last 15 years while the average spending on prison food has increased by 290 per cent from Rs 13.43 per prisoner per day to Rs 52.42 in 2015, the rise in Maharashtra has been only 195 per cent  from Rs 10.33 to Rs 34.22. This mismatch led the Bombay High Court to take the Maharashtra government to task in 2017, directing it to appoint a three-member committee in each district to monitor prison food.Not much has changed since the HCs observations. Irfan Shaikh, a former convict who completed his sentence in 2017, says food inside a prison is a powerful reminder of a prisoners humanity and the person he used to be when outside. The retributive system of our prisons ensures that a prisoner does not have access to any worldly pleasures. Even food is cooked in such a way that it does not taste like food, it merely serves the nutritional purpose, he says. Only, the nutrition levels in Maharashtras jail are shocking too.In prison, a prisoners diet crashes significantly, lowering their immunity and intake of micronutrients. Stress levels are high. The latent TB bacteria in the body gets active. In a day, an infected prisoner may cough 50 to 100 times. The bacteria in droplets remains suspended in air in an enclosed area infecting other prisoners if the cell is poorly ventilated, says Dr Lalitkumar Anande, senior medical officer at Sewri TB hospital. According to him, even jail staff is at the risk of developing TB infection due to the poor living conditions.Data analysed by The Indian Express showed that prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in Mumbai prisons is eight times higher, at an average 14 per 1,000 population, than in general population, which stands at 1.67 per 1,000 people. The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), which provides free TB treatment to patients, provided DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment, Short-Course) treatment to 24 TB prisoners in 2013, which increased to 26 in 2014 and 35 in 2015 at the Arthur Road prison. Apart from living conditions, nutrition levels are directly to blame for the high TB incidence in Mumbais prisons.The Model Prison Manual drafted by the Union Ministry for Home Affairs prescribes that a male prisoner should have an intake of 2,320 to 2,730 kilo calorie (kcal) per day. For female prisoners, it is stipulated to be between 1,900 and 2,830 kcal/day. Prison administration being a federal subject, every state has the right to decide on its food menu, provided it adheres to the nutritional requirements laid down by the prison manual. While prison manuals specify the exact weightage of pulses and vegetables that a prisoner should get, the quality of food served leaves a lot to be desired.The food in prison parlance is called bhatta. It is watery and tasteless. There have been times where I have seen prisoners break down in frustration after having to eat those meals day after day, says a former convicted prisoner who spent time in various jails in Maharashtra. Food accounts for nearly 60 per cent of the total money spent on prisoners in India. This also makes it one of the major expense heads, which is susceptible when officials decide to cut corners.The only way that prisoners could have access to better food was through jail canteens. Every prisoner is allowed to receive a sum of Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,200 per month from family, which he or she could spend in the jail canteen. But this facility was shut down in Maharashtra around 2008. Prisoners cant buy food from the canteen any longer. The only time prisoners have access to outside food is during festival days where there is a provision of canteens selling food.Prisoners also access food through the home cooked meal that certain prisoners are allowed to have on the directions of a court. Earlier, under the provisions of home cooked food, huge food containers would be slipped in by rich inmates to feed dozens of fellow inmates. Certain jails have now laid down rules that say an individual cant get more than 850 grams of home cooked food per day inside the prison.Incidentally, barring Northeast and Southern states, besides West Bengal and Jammu & Kashmir, non-vegetarian food is not given free to prisoners in any other state. Certain states have a provision of allowing certain prisoners to access non-vegetarian food from jail canteens on limited days in a year. The administration believes prisoners are sub human and do not have right to enjoy even basic facilities. My experience in prison was that whenever prisoners got access to decent food on certain special days, the entire day passed peacefully without any incident. It does not take much for a caged prisoner to go crazy. However, the days people had access to decent food even the looniest among us would be normal, recalls Shaikh.As a direct consequence of poor nutrition, health problems are routine occurrences for prisoners. A recent survey of 24 sub-jails in Maharashtra by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) observed that prisoners are not medically examined at the time of admission and there are no regular medical check-ups.In Byculla jail, where the women inmates rioted to demand better food and living conditions following Shetyes death last month, almost all inmates suffer from skin infections. The two other most common ailments among the women inmates are TB and HIV. Skin diseases are contagious in nature. In jail, as hygiene conditions are poor, this spreads rapidly as they use the common toilets and in some cases even share their soap and towels. Almost all the inmates complain of this, says a senior official.A former medical officer who was attached with the Arthur Road prison in 2016 says 300 prisoners visit the prison out-patient department on an average every day. Of these, one-third would have skin infections. Most prisoners have rashes on their body for a range of reasons. Prisoners share the same bedsheets, do not wash their clothes often and share soap bars, he says.According to him, fungal infection, measles and herpes were most common. There was usually a shortage of anti-fungal cream and tablets for skin infections. Since treatment usually got delayed, the infection would spread to other body parts, says the former medical officer. With overcrowding and skin infections common, the medical officer says, prisoners need a skin specialist for regular consultation in jails. This is not a life threatening disease. So, jail authority would not send prisoners to hospital for merely skin consultation. What we need is a regular consultant in the prison itself, he adds.According to the CHRI report, Conditions in the sub-jails are extremely unhygienic due to the lack of proper cleaning facilities, which exacerbates health challenges inside prisons. The cells are cleaned by inmates, who lack the necessary supply of phenol and water.(With Rashmi Rajput)For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wis. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya)In a unique protest, over 30 US Congresswomen on both sides of the aisle wore sleeveless dresses to support their right to bare arms in parts of Washington DCs Capitol building. The lawmakers staged the protest on Friday against the dress code in the Speakers Lobby, a room bordering the House chamber where lawmakers congregate between votes and where reporters conduct interviews.The long-standing code for the room has required women reporters and lawmakers  to wear dresses and blouses with sleeves if they want to enter. The rule also requires men to wear jackets and ties, CNN reported.Its 2017 and women vote, hold office, and choose their own style. Time to update House Rules to reflect the times! tweeted Congress member Chellie Pingree. The rules are kind of archaic  if we just went by tradition in this chamber then we wouldnt have a womens bathroom off the floor, California Democrat Linda Sanchez said, referring to the lack of a womens bathroom off the floor until recent years.But its 2017 and women vote, hold office, + choose their own style. Time to update House Rules to reflect the times! #SleevelessFriday pic.twitter.com/hSJarEsKKy  Chellie Pingree (@chelliepingree) July 14, 2017A recent CBS news report about the uneven adherence to the dress code and the story of an unnamed young, female reporter barred from the room because her dress did not have sleeves kicked off an online debate, particularly among journalists. On Wednesday, Martha McSally, a Republican lawmaker from Arizona, made reference to the strict dress code in the Speakers Lobby at the end of remarks on the House floor about first responders in her state.Before I yield back, I want to point out Im standing here in my professional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes, McSally said on the House floor. With that, Mr Speaker, I yield back. McSallys comments helped spark Fridays bipartisan response, which California Democratic Representative Jackie Speier promoted among the Democratic caucus.New York Democratic Representative Kathleen Rice used the sleeveless Friday protest to make her case for more cooperation between female Democrats and Republicans in the House.Any issue like this that can bring people together I think is a good opportunity to remind us that we really are here to work together and theres more that unites us than divides us, said Rice. Women are such problem-solvers  not that men arent, but women just have such a different sensibility. On Thursday, Speaker Paul Ryans office responded to the controversy by agreeing that the dress code could stand to be a bit modernised.Ryan said to look for a change on that soon. In a tweet, Ryans national press secretary AshLee Strong urged members to focus on substantive issues after pointing to Ryans announcement about a forthcoming policy change. Ryan did not specifically detail what would change about the dress code.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi applauded Ryans announcement about changing the rule. Glad to see @SpeakerRyan is updating the dress code for the House Floor. These unwritten rules are in desperate need of updates, she tweeted on Thursday.In the UK, a similar debate recently erupted when House of Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was happy to relax the rules, the BBC reported. In June, he accepted a question from a member of parliament who was not wearing a tie. He also said members should wear business like attire.Yet what this constitutes in 2017  especially with the rise of more casual media and tech companies  is not always clear, the report said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational image) According to the report, Asia has the highest number of people exposed to flooding from possible storm surge events, particularly in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. (Representational image)Climate change would bring devastating consequences to countries in the Pacific and Asia, a new report has warned and said Southern India may witness a decline in rice yields by five per cent in 2030s. Unabated climate change could severely affect the future growth of these countries, reverse current development gains, and degrade quality of life, the report by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) claimed.According to the report, Asia has the highest number of people exposed to flooding from possible storm surge events, particularly in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), India, Bangladesh, and Indonesia. It said meanwhile, 130 million people in low-elevation coastal zones in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, are at risk of being displaced by the end of the century in worst-case scenarios. While rice yields could potentially increase in the northern states of India, rice yields may decline by 5 per cent in the 2030s, 14.5 per cent in the 2050s and 17 per cent in the 2080s in the southern states, it said.The report, titled A region at risk: The human dimensions of climate change in Asia and the Pacific, also said different modeling approaches are relatively consistent in terms of projecting a yield reduction in wheat production of 8 per cent in India. Flood exposure is apparently increasing in coastal cities due to growing populations and assets and subsidence, it said.Studying the 136 largest coastal cities, the authors estimate that the average global flood losses in 2005 were approximately USD 6 billion per year and will increase to USD 52 billion by 2050. Of the top 20 cities with the largest increase of annual losses between 2005 and 2050, 13 are located in Asia-Guangzhou (PRC), Mumbai, Kolkata, Shenzhen (PRC), Tianjin (PRC), Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam), Jakarta (Indonesia), Chennai, Surat, Zhanjiang (PRC), Bangkok (Thailand), Xiamen (PRC), and Nagoya (Japan), it said.The report said recent studies reveal that flood risk is projected to increase significantly in Southeast Asia and India under global warming. The global climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge human civilisation faces in the 21st century, with the Asia and Pacific region at the heart of it all, said Bambang Susantono, ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development.Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, PIK Director said that the Asian countries hold Earths future in their hands. Noting that the challenge is two-fold, he said Asian greenhouse-gas emissions have to be reduced in a way that the global community can limit planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in Paris 2015 while on the other. Yet even adapting to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise is a major task.So, on the other hand, Asian countries have to find strategies for ensuring prosperity and security under unavoidable climate change within a healthy global development, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

This forced the state Irrigation and Flood Control (IFC) department officials to monitor the situation closely.Meanwhile, Thoubal river and tributaries of some rivers including Manipur river overflowed at various locations due to the sudden increase of water levels in the wake of heavy rains in upper hills of Ukhrul and Senapati districts.Two houses were washed away in Rikhumai Taphou in Senapati on Tuesday.The situation was also bad in Lamlai area in Imphal East district where more than 14,000 hectares of paddy fields were submerged in the third round of flood.Were facing untold miseries after the flood water destroying our crops for the second time.Floods hit the first plantation in June first week, says S Gambhir Mangang, a resident of Lamlai area. Now we do not know what to do as were yet to get any support from the government.Manipur has been suffering from flash floods and landslides due to intense rainfall in the state after Cyclone Mora, which hit the state in May this year.So far nearly 40,000 hectares of agricultural land, which is about 20% of Manipurs total agriculture area (1.95 lakh hectare), has been affected by floods. In view of the development, state agriculture department had assured that the short duration (100 days) rice variety seeds (RCM-10 and RCM-12) will be distributed to the needy flood affected farmers in the state.State Agriculture department officials also informed that theyll have to purchase other alternative crops if the flood water continues to remain till August.The continuous rain in the state also damaged the Imphal-Jiribam sector of the National Highway 37, connecting the state capital with rest of the country, at Sinam village and affecting movement of trucks on Saturday. But the vehicular movement was resumed following short-term measures on Monday.Most of the low lying areas in Manipur valley which comprises of five districts  Imphal West, Imphal East, Bishnupur,Kakching and Thoubal  have been inundated.Akampat, Lamphelpat, Porompat,Takyelpat and Yaralpat  located in and around the greater Imphal areas which were once the popular wetlands and now converted into governments institutional areas,quarters, buildings etc  are becoming wetlands again this rainy season due to lack of proper drainage system and the continuous rainfall.So far Manipur has witnessed 1388.7 mm of rainfall as on July 11 against last years record of 1852.4 mm, according to the Manipur centre of Indian Council of Agricultural Research.Now time has come to formulate a major long-term plan to prevent frequent flooding (in Takyelpat), says former social welfare Minister and local MLA AK Mirabai."

The production of seeds started in the model farms of the Agriculture Department and Kerala State Seed Development Authority.Reena Mathew, professor at the Rice Research Station (RRS) in Mankombu said, The Uma variety is vulnerable to various pest attacks and it has been causing losses in paddy cultivation in the last few seasons. So we have started to spread the new variety of paddy developed in the station.The Shreyas is more resistant, with a yield comparatively higher than the Uma and with the growing period decreased by five days. The seed was developed from parent varieties Pavithra and Thriguna by scientists Leena Kumari and Devika in 2015, said Reena.The Uma was also developed in the station in 1998 and its use was started extensively in 2000. In the decade and half since then, the seed was being used in more than 80 per cent of the paddy fields in Kerala and in other states, including Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.We started to think about a new variety after the Uma paddy started to show signs of easily vulnerable to diseases, said Reena. A disease, false smut (Lakshmi ), widely appeared in the state in 2012-14 and the production of paddy reduced drastically during the period.The content of black-coloured rice was also high in the rice after processing. Another pest, gall fly (goleecha), also widely affected the paddy cultivation. The studies curried out in the RRS found the resistance of the Uma had decreased, causing pest attacks, said Reena.Till 1998, the farmers of the state grew a variety named Jyothi, also developed in the station.When this showed symptoms of pest attack, it was replaced with Uma.Reena said, the quality of Shreyas is better than Uma. However, the rice flour from Uma is better.At full growth, the Shreyas is taller than the Uma, so the chance of stalks of paddy bending and breaking off is higher, so the RRS is advising farmers to use manure with lesser quantities of nitrogen content.Why Shreyas?Shreyas has given the same yield as that of Uma; the former has been found to be less susceptible to false smut disease, which results in discolouration and up to 20 per cent damage to the crop. Uma yields 8 to 9 tonnes of paddy per hectare."

Everyone seems to be having a good time and it must have to do with the smiling waiters.We are served Caribbean Cooler and Beach Bum in cocktails. The first comes in a tender coconut shell and has vodka, Caribbean rum, tender coconut water, pineapple juice and blue curacao liquer. This is mild with a distant note of the rum and its sweetness balances out with the sharpness of pineapple and the liquer. Beach Bum has a too eager-to-please sweetness -- there are candied pieces of fruit, Grenadine syrup, vodka and seltzer water. We mention our disappointment with the syrupyness of Beach Bum to the waiter and are served Dead Reckoning as a comeback.Pollo Mozarella in CorozzaThe Reckoning is generous with the alcohol  white rum and wine  and tops it with spice syrup and vanilla syrup.

This is mildly flavoured with lemon and coriander, and would have been perfect if the chef had gone easy with the salt. It is not cringingly salty but enough to hijack the soup.In starters, there are Vegetable Croquettes, Green Chicken Kabab and Polynesian baked fish. The first starter is essentially a mild mash of potatoes with chillies, the second is well-cooked chicken which is short of juicy and, the third is the best, spiced with fresh red chilli paste and raw onion.Sauces on the side are mayo-based with interesting variations  with braised beetroot, paprika, mint and wasabi. The last mayo-dip stands out with its sharp flavour, the rest tastes like regular mayo with flavours as a passing shadow.Then comes the vegetable and chicken dumplings, which are thick-skinned and doughy, with well-cooked insides. On the scale of five, it could be a three. The dip with chilli, salt, ginger and groundnut goes well with it.For the mains, we try Hungarian Paprika Chicken. The meat is cooked in spicy paprika and served with rice and baked potato, served with onion, dried chilli and olives. The next is Vegetable Tangine with Cous Cous; the cous cous is perfectly cooked with a bite but the veggies taste a bit soggy with anoverwhelming taste of turmeric and coriander.The dessert is Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream, topped with a cherry and basil.

Rains across the country have affected supply of vegetables to Bengaluru.Abdul Hafiz, a vegetable supplier, points out, We get a lot of tomatoes from Nashik in Maharashtra. But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month. We see supply of close to 150 truckloads of vegetables every day, but now hardly 50 of them are arriving. Again, this is a month of marriages and functions, so a lot of supply is going there. This have invariably pushed up prices.Idrees Chaudhary, general secretary of Russell Market Traders Association says, Even at places like Devanahalli, Kolar, Bangarpet in Karnataka, from where we get vegetables, most of the crops have been damaged by rain.Interestingly, for several months, tomatoes were being sold for anywhere between `7 and a maximum of `20. Consumers are perplexed with the sudden rise.Tomato is something that we use almost in every recipe. With the prices shooting up, it has become very difficult for middle class people like us. We cannot limit our consumption, neither is our income going high any time soon. I guess we have no other option but to bear the brunt, said Nikhil Kumar, a software engineer.Venkat Krishna, a manager at the online food-startup hungermeals.com in HSR Layout, points out, We deliver meals at very affordable prices to offices and homes. With the sudden increase in vegetable prices, we cannot hike the rates of our meals. Our customers will not understand and we will end up losing them. Despite the loss, we have to serve the same quality of food to our consumers. We are hoping for prices to come down.A vendor at KR Market said, A lot of vegetables like capsicum, tomato, beans and other greens have been diverted for exports this year.

For the average Malayali Karkidakam used to be the month of incessant downpour, a time you find sanctuary in age-old therapeutic indulgences. The season may not be the same anymore, but being true Keralites we do follow our traditions. The last leg of monsoon and the last month of Malayalam calendar, this season preceding spring calls for an array of customs and rituals.A steam chamber  ExpressDetoxing your soulKarkidakam is the month of Ramayana, a time to read verses from the sacred epic to ward off miseries. During the month we read Adhyatma Ramayana, not Valmiki Ramayana. Here we are not trying to enjoy a work of literature, but introspect. Its an attempt to asses our values and redefine our ethics.This practice also shows our intellectual affinity, says M G Sasibhooshan, historian. Karkidakam with its volley of rites and rituals including the vavu bali, is also a time to explore ones spiritual self. However, rational or refined we are, we are not willing to let go of our traditions and customs. It may seem like a contradiction, at least for a few, he says.Karkidakam dietKarkidaka kanji, the medicinal gruel custom-made for the season, is one thing you shouldnt miss. Consisting of rice and herbs, its a great detox drink to go with your rejuvenating treatments. If you are undergoing ayurvedic treatments you should have karkidaka kanji at least once a day as it immensely helps our digestive system. Even otherwise its a time to go green and ditch your regular oily menu, especially non-veg, adds Dr Chandrakumar.Rejuvenating your bodyAfter 11 months of reckless lifestyle and repeated cycles of junk food, its time to give your system some rest to reboot. An ideal season for rejuvenation therapies, you can go for the customary sukha chikilsa during the season. Normally it can be done during the entire month and involves a handful of therapies. But if you take a five-day session, it will be just abhyangam (oil massage) and steam bath, says Dr Chandrakumar. According to the ancient science of ayurveda, its a time to cleanse your body of its toxins and to bring back the three bio-energies of vata, pitta and kapha to a balanced state. Others in the regime are nasyam, dhara, udhvarthanam and virechanam. But to complete the whole set of treatments you need more days, he says.Kalari treatmentsApart from the traditional hand massages, you get an array of insensitive treatments at kalaris. The body will be highly receptive this month due to the change in climate. If you undergo the treatment and stick to a specific diet the result can be incredible, says Amabreesh, the guru of VKM Kalari. Kalari uzhichial mainly helps to gain flexibility and cure a volley of recurring or recent ailments. It can help you stay trim, boost immunity and flush out all the impurities of the body. At the kalari we have this chavitti uzhichil, massage done using foot that increases blood circulation stimulating your body in a much deeper level, he adds. But if you want to take the kalari treatment keep in mind it demands total rest. You should also follow a particular menu and take rest, he adds."

While the private miller has failed to deliver the rice to the corporation, the cost of the CMR has not been recovered till date.The Civil Supplies Corporation has identified three officers, who were posted as Civil Supplies Officer-cum-District Manager for Khurda during the period, responsible for recovery of the cost.As per the findings of the audit report, Assistant Civil Supply Officer Abhimanyu Mohanty was the authorised officer of the mill. While he failed to discharge his duties, the CSO-cum-DM of the district is equally responsible for short delivery of the custom milled rice by the miller, the report stated.The other three officers found negligent were Amar Mohapatra, Sudhakar Pradhan and Sarat Chandra Das. While Mohapatra was in-charge of CSO-cum-DM of the district from May 19, 2010 to July 16, 2013, Pradhan was in-charge for nearly two months. However, Das was the district manager till the date of audit.Since these officials are under the administrative control of the Principal Secretary of the FS&CW Department, it is requested to take suitable action against the officials responsible for misappropriation of CMR by the miller, said an official note of the OSCSC Managing Director.Earlier, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has rapped the department for showing undue favour to private rice millers for custom milling of paddy despite huge arrears pending against them.The CAG in its report for General and Social Sector for year ending March 2015 said despite default in delivery of 2,594 tonne of custom milled rice valued at `5.44 crore, personal property of the millers could not be attached as per terms and conditions of the agreement due to non-availability of property details."

The Intellectual Property Rights Cell of Kerala Agricultural University has begun steps to collect the details of farmers who cultivate the almost extinct two rice varieties of Kerala.We have started collecting the details of farmers who cultivate 'Rakthashali' rice and 'Kunkumashali' rice varieties and the details of farming practices of the varieties, along with 'Njavara' rice, which has already been given GI tag by the registry, in Kerala, says C R Elsy, coordinator, Intellectual Property Rights Cell.The move is aimed at creating a data bank of these traditional rice varieties along with holding further studies on the medicinal properties attributed to the varieties. Besides, the IPR Cell will coordinate and do the paper work required for securing the GI tag for the rice varieties, she says.P N Chandrasekharan of Malappuram, an entrepreneur who cultivates the largest tract of 'Rakthashali,' one of the rarest red rice varieties with high medicinal value and which is believed to be extinct in Kerala, says there are only around 100 acres of 'Rakthashali' cultivation in parts of Malappuram, Thrissur and Palakkad districts.Rakthashali, which is also known as Chennellu, also finds mention in the Puranas and the ancient texts of ayurveda due to its curing properties. It is said the rice helps cure ailments like cancer and kidney-related disorders, he says. He cultivates around 40 acres of Rakthashali in parts of Malappuram. It is a low-yielding rice variety as the farmer gets only an average 1,200-1,300 kg of rice per acre.The rice variety once used to be widely cultivated in the northern districts of Kerala in the past. But when paddy farming shrunk to one crop from three crops a year in the 80s and 90s, it started to become extinct. The shelf-life of Rakthashali seed is around five to six months. So the rice variety naturally disappeared from the paddy fields of Kerala when paddy farming was reduced to one-crop system, he says.The Kunkumashali rice variety also almost disappeared from the paddy fields of Kerala almost in a similar way as the seed of this variety too has only a short shelf-life.Chandrasekharan, who cultivates around five acres of Kunkumashali rice, which claims to have all properties of saffron, says the farming of the variety which was once prevalent in North Kerala has almost disappeared now. He sourced the seeds of this variety from Davangere in Karnataka. Chandrasekharan, who has sought patent for the rice varieties under the provisions of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act 2001, has raised apprehension over registering these rice varieties with the GI Registry citing previous experience. He says the Njavara rice variety was given GI tag but the farmers are not getting any benefit out of this tag as there is large-scale adulteration in the sale of the variety. In fact, middlemen in the industry are reaping the benefit of the tag, he says.unique to keralaThere are only around 100 acres of Rakthashali rice farming in the stateThe average yield of Rakthashali is 1,200-1,300 kg per acreKunkumashali rice is said to have properties of saffron"

Struggle of Rebati Kanhar (23), however, is far from over.Rebati as a teenaged tribal girl of Khalisahi village in Harbhanga block of the district had hit the headlines in 2008. She suffered from swelling of the gums giving her an ape-like look and abnormal growth of hair across body and face. In medical terms, her case was rarest of rare deformity known as Idiopathic Gingival Enlargement (swelling of the gums) with hypertrichosis (abnormal growth of hair) .Her father, Balakrushna Kanhar, suffered from a milder form of gingival enlargement while her brother, who had passed away a few years back, suffered from the same condition as Rebati.After she caught the attention of the media, the SCB Medical administration took up the challenge to treat her and decided to bear all expenses of her treatment. A series of surgeries was performed on her and even a genetic analysis and research was conducted under the guidance of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and in collaboration with the Institute of Immunology in Mumbai.Although the State Government and the district administration had announced largesse for her rehabilitation, help has not reached her yet.The quota of rice that she was promised was stopped after it was doled out by the gram panchayat for a few months. No one ensured whether she ever went to school. She awaits the money assured under Harischandra Yojana.Her father Balakrushna, who weaved bamboo baskets to sustain family, died on June 7. Eleven days later, her mother Umadei also passed away.Rebati now works as a daily wager to become economically independent and stays with her brother, who is already struggling to support his family with three daughters and wife. Collector Madhusudan Mishra assured all help to Rebati and said he would find out if she has been provided support under Harischandra Yojana. In case she has not received any help, funds would be provided to her from Red Cross and if she desires, Rebati will be rehabilitated in Kanya Ashram or Swadhar Home, he said.He added that if Rebati is in possession of land, she will be provided with a house."

This innovative shop, is a brainchild of Vinod Subramaniam, founder of Alterneit. It was met with a lot of appreciation by the local panchayat, which has entrusted the project to the Kudumbasree.Soon, the serial entrepreneur received orders from various panchayats to set up similar shops.Pic:Manu R MavelilThe project is only one among the 100+ innovative solutions undertaken by Vinods Thiruvananthapuram-based company. Other innovations include geriartic toilets, hot and cool beverage counters, coconut dehuskers, solar fish drying units, solar ripening units, and hi-tech goat units. In fact, in the goat unit, 11 goats can be raised in a cage using cost-effective technologies.Vinods company has also devised a cooking machine which is connected to rice and vegetable cookers and idli containers.This machine was installed after a lot of study. We realised there were many hotels which were spending Rs 2,500 every day on gas for serving 600 idlis and rice. This steam cooking machine was purchased by a company in Alappuzha for Rs 4.5 lakh. Today, it is helping the company save Rs 17,500 per month, he said.Success storiesThe culture in Kerala is changing. People are looking for sustainable development and organic living. This is one of the reasons why we are focusing primarily on agri-based innovations, said Vinod. Also, we realised that many people want to start small businesses but they dont have the resources or the idea. We want to give these small-time entrepreneurs an opportunity to try something different than the usual soap and pickle-making processes. The panchayats are very eager to promote such unique entrepreneurships.The journeyVinod, an MBA and LLB graduate, was among the first batch of Akshaya project implementors in the state. I was the district coordinator in Malappuram in 2002-2005. During that time, I worked with people at the grassroots level and understood how small-time development was a key to growth. This interaction with people sowed the seeds of a social entrepreneur in me, he said. After this, Vinod worked with the IT mission. After a few years, he started a innovation-based company at Technopark called Rainconsult. After years of research, he decided to float Alternait. The company had its initial years of struggle. It was difficult for us to convince people to take up projects at the grassroots. However, today, after four years, I am glad it has found a footing, he said. Vinod is also in talks with the Sri Lankan and Tanzanian governments to emulate such a model there."

He carefully feeds the old destitute woman who cannot even sit up.T Periyasamy and his friends have been doing this without missing a single day for nearly six years. Wednesday was the 292nd week of feeding destitute on roads. What began as a rare human compassion has now become an obsession for Periyasamy and 30 volunteers of Amudhasurabi project.The project offers full meals with water packets every afternoon to 100 persons in Salem City and to 500 persons on Sundays for destitute in the city and rural areas. Periyasamy runs an electrical shop near the old bus stand while the volunteers are from various walks of life. But none, including Periyasamy, is well off financially but seem to have a rare resolve to help the most helpless.Thirty per cent of the cost is supported by non-volunteers while the rest is pooled by the volunteers. They have set up a dedicated kitchen at Seelanaickenpatti. A paid cook prepares the food every Sunday. The volunteers gather at the kitchen on Sunday at 5.30 am and share the work like cleaning, vegetable cutting and food packing.At 11.30 am they leave to give the food to the hungry. On week days food is out-sourced for cash from a reliable source. We ensure that the lunch reaches the people by 1.30 pm every day. We have not missed even a day till date since we started. Most of whom we serve have been deserted by family. We look for people who cant even take a step to receive the lunch packet.In many cases they cannot even eat on their own and volunteers have to feed them literally, not just give the food packet and move on to the next.Water packets were added to the lunch offer when one day I saw an old woman who gets food regularly from us crawled up to the nearby drainage to wash hands and shockingly she also drank the drain water, he says.Recounting the journey, Periyasamy said that initially he visited old age and destitute homes run by NGOs and charitable trusts to offer some help. But he found that help was never scarce for such institutions. But those are on the roads sides and pavements had none to help.First I started giving idlis to 20 persons. But I found many were keeping it for more than a day till it rot. Later I tried giving lime and tomato rice which too ended same way. We brain stormed and came with the idea of providing full meal lunch. This was well received and we saw people eating it instantly. Soon we noticed people waiting anxiously for us to come. That really motivated me to take the full plunge."

The Travelling Sushi Festival which commenced on July 11 has eight special maki rolls with equal vegetarian and non-vegetarian options created by Chef Paul Kinny.All the sushi on the menu had something different to offer. Here is my take on whats good, bad and ugly at the festival.What is Good?CHIANG MAI URAMAKIFrom the streets of Thailand, this one is a stunner. The avocado along with sriracha mayo and birds eye chillies plays along brilliantly to balance the texture of the overall dish. Not to forget the crunchy asparagus that lifts this sushi to another level.TUTTO FUNGHI URAMAKIAnother wonderful vegetarian sushi, this time its all the way from Italy. With a dream combination of wild mushrooms, shimeji tempura, kewpie and snow peas, this one is sure to sway the meat and seafood lovers. The clever use of chive blossoms not only gives an added dimension to the dish, it packs the flavour punch and beautifully bonds with other elements in the dish. This only reaffirms that there is so much magic you can do with greens.SRI LANKAN ROLLThis one is the most eye-pleasing sushi on the menu, one look at it and you would want to gulp it. By the looks, it can make even vegetarians go week on their knees. It has everything that makes it a great sushi. The powerful combination of spicy crabmeat, coconut cream and sambal gives the unmatchable flavour. The beetroot rice gives the beautiful pink colour and texture whereas the yam crisps bring in the crunch.PEKING DUCK MAKIThe main element of Peking Duck Maki from Beijing, China is the smoked duck. Hoisin, sweet-chilli glaze, cucumber, crunchy wonton strips and scallions beautifully compliments the smocked duck. This is undoubtedly, one of the best sushis I have had in a long time.What is Bad?There wasnt anything particularly bad but the Norwegian Salmon Maki didnt match up to the tastes of the other sushis. The Philadelphia cheese and cranberries dont really pack the punch, it disrupts the flavour of smoke salmon.Price: Rs 565 (Veg) Rs 665 (Non-Veg)Rating: 4.5/5The festival is on till July 18"

Addressing a roadshow here on Saturday, Secretary of Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) JP Meena said the eastern State has tremendous opportunity in the area of food production and processing.""But lack of processing and related infrastructure is resulting into a significant amount of food wastage. We have laid significant focus on food processing and are expecting the industry to witness an investment of about `60,000 crore in next three years,"" he said.He urged the Odisha Government to develop food processing industry in clusters as it requires special infrastructure and said if the infrastructure can be made available at a nominal rate then the industry will witness an exponential growth.""We are major producer of fruits, vegetable, milk, rice and wheat. Yet, we import tomato, pineapple and many other things. Because, the problem lies with the way we are managing our agro-production. Retail-end is fragmented as many do not have storing facilities. So far, only 10 per cent of the total production in the country is being processed,"" Meena maintained.The roadshow was organised by MoFPI in collaboration with the CII to invite Odisha-based industrialists to participate in the event. Speaking at the roadshow, State MSME Minister Prafulla Samal highlighted the growth prospects in Odisha. He expected the vibrant agro and food processing industry of the State will witness growth and generate many employment opportunities through the event.Additional Chief Secretary LN Gupta said Ministry of Food Processing has approved establishment of two mega food parks in the State to link agricultural production to the market by bringing together farmers and processors under one roof.""Odisha has made large strides in the food processing sector and the State's policy and regulations have made it easier for investors for doing business here,"" he said.Among others, Chairman of CII Odisha State Council and Nalco CMD Tapan Kumar Chand and Director of MoFPI Atul Saxena also spoke."

So we are trying to cut down on costs, he said, adding that the state government has ordered a manpower audit of all departments to restructure them.The manpower audit of a few departments has shown large discrepancies. The department does not know who is doing what, what is he being paid for and from where. It will help us restructure them, Manpreet said.Also, a part of the cost-cutting exercise, he said, is to settle pending litigation with the government.Our employees are in litigation with us. We are in litigation with rice shellers and other industrial units. We want to clear all pending liabilities and litigations by offering one-time settlement. Every department has pending liabilities  be it value added tax (VAT) dues or disputed C-forms. We are ready to waive off a part of it. As for litigation, why should our own employees be aggrieved with the government. We are ready to address their complaints against promotions or increments, the minister said.Manpreet, who as finance minister in the SAD-BJP government had advised the government against extending retirement age of employees to defer payment of retirement benefits, said he still believes it makes better economics to hire seven fresh faces than retain those on highest pay scale.The proposal is still under consideration of the government and the cabinet has yet to take a final call on it, he said.RBI has to tell banks to write off farm loansAsked when will the government notify the farm debt waiver, Manpreet said the expert group, headed by T Haque, has yet to give its final report. After we have the details, we will meet the state level bankers committee (SLBC) to work out a one-time settlement (OTS) for the government. Finally, it is the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) which has to tell banks to do it and convert the crop loans of farmers into term loan for the government, he added."

As the rice stock is more vulnerable to infestation, the CWC has requested the State-owned corporation for early liquidation of the stock to avoid damage.Sources in OSCSC said over 33,300 tonnes of rice are under storage for more than three months while about 56,800 tonnes of food grain are in stock for about three months in different godowns of the CWC.Meanwhile, General Manager, PDS, OSCSC has directed district managers for early utilisation of the rice stock under public distribution system.As the State Government has directed the civil supplies corporation and district collectors to provide PDS rice to all the beneficiaries under National Food Security Act for two months (July and August) by the end of July 25, the existing rice stocks in CWC godowns will be utilised, the sources said.Supply of two months ration in July is a precautionary measure by the State Government to avoid any dislocation in supply of food grains due to possible floods. With monsoon active and the State experiencing good rainfall, the Government has directed the corporation to keep adequate stock of food grains in districts vulnerable to floods.Minister for Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare SN Patro has directed supply inspectors of all the districts to visit PDS outlets to ensure that the Government directive is implemented."

The original format was conceptualised in Sydney, Australia, in 2002, where the short and sweet theatre will have 10-minute plays. Since then it has caught on world over, with local festivals being organised in a handful of countries.Meera Krishnan, festival director, says, We have got the highest number of entries by way of scripts and independent theatre companies this year. Australia sends in 50 scripts in English for local directors to choose from, but we received nearly 120 local scripts in English and Tamil this time!That is probably the reason for the equal share of dudes and machis in this years festival, meaning a mixed bag of English and Tamil plays. In the early years, the festival was perceived as wholly English one. But its the interesting format that involves storytelling in less than 10 minutes that pushed the language boundaries. We have seen a steady increase in the number of Tamil scripts over the last three years. The festival has sought to be inclusive always, but its only now that this image has been broken. We have more work to do to fully realise the South Indian locution by bringing in more languages, says Meera.Though some foreign scripts are chosen, it is only the local scripts that are considered by the jury for the Best Script award. This encourages local writers to submit their work, she adds. What the director does with the script is completely up to them. Many bring a local context to a foreign play. The award winning play of the first week, Rice Water, came to us as a page long English script. Director Regin translated it into Tamil and went on to bag the prize.So how does the audience take in plays that are foreign and local  those in English and in Tamil? Vinod Anand R, actor and director who taken part in all editions of the festival, believes that language and locales are hardly barriers. I have seen the audience profile change with more Tamil plays coming into the festival. From a fully English speaking audience, the festival has now evolved and is catering to a pan-language, pan-cultural audience that encourages quality theatre.A variety in the audience seems to keep creators on their feet, as actors and directors need to challenge their own sensibilities and make theatre that appeals to different palettes. For the audience, its a mixed bag of plays across themes and genres. For the makers of theatre this is a chance to innovate and experiment. This format brings in brilliant local content  the 10 minutes is a rush of adrenaline, a shot of perk, a wake-up call and great theatre. Short and Sweet South India is the sharpest and the sweetest of the lot, says Vinod.There are 10 plays each in the Top 40 and Wildcard shows lined up for this weekend.ON PAR WITH SYDNEYThis years edition in Chennai (presented by Mindscreen Film Institute) has 70 plays showing through the course of the month, the most in its seven-year history, and only 30 plays short of Sydneys festival. The Top 40 plays run four shows each, and the wildcard entries set aside for debutant directors have two shows. Each show has 10 plays, all sticking to the 10-minute time limit.Book your tickets at Eventjini.com (The writer is a columnist with The New Indian Express)"

Apparently, the agencies transporting MDM rice from godowns to the schools have been accused of embezzling the stocks.According to reports of the School and Mass Education Department, MDM is being implemented in 1,593 schools, including 722 upper primary schools. About 95,000 students are benefiting from the scheme annually in Jagatsinghpur district. As per MDM rules, each student of primary school is to be provided 100 grams of rice under noon meals.In upper primary school, a student has to get 150 grams of rice. Even as the State Government provides the required amount of MDM rice to godowns, the exact stock does not reach the schools. As a result, each child only gets 60 to 70 grams of rice. Although some villagers and educationists have informed the local officials concerned in this regard, no corrective measures are being taken.Currently, three transportation agencies are in charge of supplying MDM rice from the godowns to schools. One agency supplies rice to schools in four blocks of Balikuda, Kujang, Tirtol and Ersama while another provides the stock to schools in Jagatsinghpur block. The third agency supplies rice to schools in three blocks of Raghunathpur, Naugaon and Biridi.Locals alleged that these agencies, allegedly in connivance with school officials, are embezzling 4 to 5 kg of rice from each 50 kg rice bag.District Education Officer Kapilendra Mishra said although he is aware of such misappropriation, no official complaint in this regard has been filed yet."

However, there is another version of biryani in Hyderabadi cuisine, a white aromatic rice and meat preparation called Sofiyani Biryani, which was quite popular in yesteryears and still finds favour with select food lovers.Sofiyani Biryani has distinct Hyderabadi roots, though a version of this also exists in Pakistani cuisine. A story about its origin says that one of the Nizams had this recipe developed, as he was very fond of biryani but could not digest much of spices. Since then this flavourful dish was a regular feature for important dinners as well as festivals. There used to be a common mans version of this dish too, which was in the household menu for special occasions. Well-known food connoisseur Pradeep Khosla rates this as one of the hidden gems of Hyderabadi cuisine.The easy to digest Sofiyani Biryani uses lesser amount of ghee, the richness of the dish comes from use of khoya and malai. Strong spices like red chillies are mostly avoided in this preparation, and instead green chillies are used. The recipe does not use saffron, and to maintain the white colour, whole spices are often preferred to powdered ones. Green cardamom, coriander and mint leaves as well as cashew nuts, pistachios, and almonds are some other important ingredients used in the masala. The recipe is varied from place to place, for example, some chefs still prefer to use kesar to for better presentation.Today the dish is no longer commercially popular. Noor and Ahaanaz Kitchen, a home based delivery service, is one of the few home chefs with Sofiyani on their menu. According to Noor Sahil from this outlet, the demand for this subtler version of biryani is low, as the taste buds of most of the food lovers in Hyderabad have been fashioned by the spicy biryani which is available in the Irani cafes and restaurants. However, people who are fond of milder flavours still like his version of Sofiyani, using almond and cashew paste and without fried onions.Quite a few wedding caterers still have it on their list of items, as some discerning customers still want this item as part of their walima menu.Zaiqa-E-Hyderabad, a popular restaurant, occasionally serves Sofiyani Biryani. One hopes that Hyderabad revives its passion for this rich and flavourful dish.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast who blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

Over the years, the harmful effects of consuming tobacco in any form have become clear to the masses and there has been a fall in the number of people taking up smoking. However, there is an alarming lack of awareness about the effects of fat, sugar and salt on the body, or the addiction that they lead to.We thus have parents who are mortally scared of their children getting addicted to smoking due to peer pressure, but do not hesitate before putting on an extra spoonful of chocolate spread on their toasts; buying them another bottle of cola or its supposedly healthier alternative, packaged fruit juice; or packing noodles and chips for lunch. This high intake of fat, sugar and salt  FSS, as the deliciously deadly trio is commonly referred to  has a significant long-term impact on public health, but there has not yet been any study or survey conducted on the Indian population in this regard.There are, however, enough indicators that reveal worrying details. According to the World Health Organisation, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 60% of total deaths across all age groups in India. Now, the country has one of the largest number of people with diabetes, figures that shot up from 11.9 million persons in 1980 to 64.5 million in 2015 (study by Lancet released in 2016). Experts say the excess intake of fat, sugar and salt are the main causes for the rising incidence of NCDs like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension  these three alone cause an alarming 40% of deaths in India. Much of these are preventable. For instance, the WHO says that as many as 1.7 million deaths worldwide could be prevented every single year if salt consumption is reduced to the recommended level of fewer than 5 grammes a day.From a health perspective, salt, doctors say, is a needless ingredient, as sodium is present in almost everything that we eat. From vegetables to meat and fish, sodium is there in everything we eat. We may add a little for enhancing flavour but most people add a lot more than required. For instance, salt is added while cooking rice in Tamil Nadu, said Dr Milly Mathew, senior consultant nephrologist, Madras Medical Mission Hospital. This extra sodium can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, stroke, diabetes and many other complications, she said. Diet plays a major role in preventing NCDs, added Dr Mathew.This excess is at its worst when it comes to processed food. In most cases in the West, says WHO, the excess quantity of sodium comes from salt in processed food. This could be true in the case of most in urban India as well. A few food items that Express checked left little for doubt. The smallest packet of instant noodles has 1.424g of sodium. That is about 60% or a third of the daily allowance from just one tiny, 79g packet of noodles that can be termed single-serving only. Similarly, a 100gm pack of potato chips has 0.742g of sodium, while it is 0.946g in the case of another popular potato based snack, aloo bhujia.Processed food, savouries, pappad, pickles, nuts, pizza and other bakery foods are also packed with a high content of sodium, said Meenakshi Bajaj, head dietician at Government Multi Super-Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate, Chennai, pointing out how most people end up consuming much more than a days allowance of sodium by eating these foods.The WHO strongly recommends that sodium intake should not exceed 2g (equivalent to 5g of salt a day). Remember that this quantity is for an adult; it is correspondingly less for children based on energy requirement. That is where a small pack of noodles pumps enough sodium into your child, making even the natural sodium in regular food excess. Put another way, this is the equivalent of nicotine tar inside the lungs but without the dark and sticky poisons repulsiveness.Equally dangerous is sugar. There are no studies here to prove that high consumption of sugar has a direct effect on diabetes. However, sugar, both in the form of plain sugar and mixed in food, is harmful to those in pre-diabetic stage and children, said Dr V Mohan, director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. The normal diet  vegetables, fruits, milk, and carbohydrates in chapati, rice etc  have the necessary amount of sugar required for the body. Anything above that could be excess, more so in the case of aerated drinks.One cup of coffee or tea will not harm anyone, but consuming soft drinks that are loaded with sugar is dangerous. A 330ml drink of the popular cola contains 33g of sugar. This is one of the leading causes of obesity in children, added Dr Mohan, who is also the chairman of Dr Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre in Chennai.This is particularly significant in Tamil Nadu where the incidence of diabetes is alarming. In the State, 10% of adults in the rural population are diabetic. It is higher  15%  in urban areas excluding Chennai. In Chennai, 25% of adults above the age of 20 years are diabetic, and about 40% of diabetics are under 50 years old, said Dr Mohan, adding that the number of pre-diabetic persons would be double these numbers.The prescribed limit as per the basic calculation is that a person should consume about 30 calories for each kg of body weight, explained Dr K Kannan, president, Chennai Chapter Cardiology Society of India. A teaspoon of sugar is about 5g, which would give you 20 calories.It thus is no wonder that the bottles of cola that you drink are firmly deposited around the belly, leading to obesity, diabetes and heart diseases before long. Among the FSS trio, fat is an exceptional one as recent research has shown. There have been studies about the dangers of fat, and there is also better awareness when compared to sugar and salt. But what research has proven now goes beyond this layman understanding.When researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle added sugar to different types of dairy products ranging from skimmed to heavy cream mixed with safflower oil, the test subjects preferred the skimmed one the least. It had little or no fat. When mixed in the right measure with sugar and/or salt, fat becomes the X factor that takes the combination to the next level, the bliss point, the palate version of hitting the spot. It also creates an effect similar to any narcotic addiction.Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country. While there is a ban on advertising tobacco and liquor, there is no such restriction on advertising these FSS-rich foods that primarily target children.There is enough anecdotal information as well as direct conjunctures that raise concerns. But in the absence of scientific data, a policy decision cannot be taken, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).We in India lack good data on the dietary pattern of consumption of fat, salt and sugar, and there is no data available on trans-fat consumption or its level in the blood. This is really a risk, she added. The council is moving towards surveying the dietary pattern of the population for a better understanding of the effect of FSS. That would be the starting point.Death by fats Death by fats Death by fats Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country.

The proposals mooted under the plan include setting up of a seed bank to extend pokkali farming to 2,000 hectares by 2018.The decisions were taken at the general council meeting of Pokkali Field Development Committee (PFDC) held at the district administration headquarters here on Monday. The integrated plan for development of pokkali farming will be submitted before the state government. Before unveiling the plan, a decision on various aspects will be taken at the next council meeting, said District Collector K Mohammed Y Safeerulla.The council will look into various steps required for protection of traditional pokkali farming and the issues faced by farmers. The suggestions and recommendations of members will be incorporated in the draft plan which will be submitted before the Planning Committee.Once the Planning Committee gives its nod, the proposal will be submitted before the pre-budget session. The aim is to get pokkali development scheme included in the next annual budget of the government and get necessary budget allocation, said Safeerulla. The council meeting was also attended by MLAs, S Sarma and K J Maxi, as well as PFDC vice chairman Dinakaran.Sarma said the pokkali farming development agency will take the initiative to set up a seed bank this year. The seed bank will be set up with the help of Kerala State Seed Development Authority and Rice Research Station, Vyttila. The seed bank will chiefly aim to procure seeds for cultivation next year. The pokkali farmers should get a support price of `150. We also proposed a separate plan for protection of traditional farming sector. Every year, pokkali farmers should get a minimum subsidy of `4-5 crore, Sarma said.The council meeting also demanded the subsidy for pokkali farming should be increased toRs 20,000 per hectare.  Presently pokkali farmers use the field for shrimp farming in the interim. This must change. The farmers should be made self-sufficient with the help of pokkali cultivation alone, Sarma said.The meeting looked into the tourism potential of some of the areas at Goshree islands where pokkali farming is widely practised. Vypeen and Kadamakkudi islands have immense potential to be developed into Agri-Tourism destinations. The scope should be fully utilised so as to increase the flow of domestic and international tourists to these destinations, he said.Meanwhile, Safeerulla said though the original plan was to undertake pokkali farming in 1,000 hectares this year, until now pokkali farming has been carried out only in 635 hectares. Next year, we are confident of carrying out pokkali cultivation in 2,000 hectares. Hence, this years main target will be procurement of enough seeds to extend cultivation to 2,000 hectares, he said. Of the nearly 17,000 hectares of pokkali fields situated in Ernakulam and Thrissur, Ernakulam, Aroor and Kodungalloor account for a majority of them.Farming on 1,000 acres plannedOf the nearly 17,000 hectares of pokkali fields situated in Ernakulam and Thrissur, Ernakulam, Aroor and Kodungalloor account for majority of them.Though the original plan was to undertake pokkali farming in 1,000 hectares this year, until now pokkali farming has been carried out only in 635 hectares."

The unpopular leftist leader is pressing ahead with the vote for a Constitutional Assembly on Sunday despite the opposition of most Venezuelans, a crescendo of international criticism, and some dissent within his ruling Socialist Party. Critics say the assembly, whose election rules appear designed to ensure a majority for Maduro, is intended to institutionalize dictatorship in the South American nation, a member of OPEC.But Maduro, 54, whose term runs until early 2019, insists it is the only way to empower the people and bring peace after four months of anti-government unrest that has killed more than 100 people and further hammered an imploding economy. Knots of opposition supporters gathered at various centers where Venezuelans will vote on the assembly to leave messages, chant slogans and wave banners.

The people are saying No!The opposition, which has now won majority backing after years in the doldrums during the rule of Maduros predecessor Hugo Chavez, also held nationwide rallies in the afternoon in honor of protesters slain during the crisis. Fatalities have included opposition and government supporters, bystanders and security officials. Mourners gathered in Caracas with rosaries, candles and flags but National Guard soldiers on motorbikes interrupted the ceremony by lobbing tear gas at the crowd. The National Guard represses us even when were praying for our fallen ones, opposition lawmaker Delsa Solorzano said on Twitter.Later on Monday, rights group Penal Forum reported that lawyer Angel Zerpa, one of the new Supreme Court magistrates sworn in by the opposition in defiance of the government, had been charged with treason in a military court. Zerpa, who was first detained on Saturday, has gone on a hunger strike, Penal Forum director Alfredo Romero said.48-HOUR NATIONAL SHUTDOWNThe Democratic Unity coalition has raised the stakes by calling a two-day national strike for Wednesday and Thursday, after millions participated in a 24-hour shutdown last week. Young members of a self-styled Resistance movement said the moves by the formal opposition were not tough enough, and are threatening armed action. For months, youths have blockaded streets and used slingshots, stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails to battle National Guard troops.Soldiers have been shooting tear gas canisters straight at the protesters, and also using rubber bullets and water cannons to disperse them in near-daily running battles.At the weekend, Maduro said his government was ready for any scenario and blasted his foes as terrorists servile to Washington. Were not surrendering to anyone! he said. The government has declared election centers zones of special protection and planned to deploy more than 230,000 soldiers to keep the peace on Sunday. On Monday, National Guard troops pulled down posters at some election centers to shouts of murderers from opposition supporters.With U.S. President Donald Trump threatening economic sanctions on Venezuela, potentially aimed at the oil sector accounting for 95 percent of its export revenues, Maduro said he could count on great friends like China and India if needs be. But the threat of sanctions on an already vulnerable Venezuela has spooked investors. Venezuelan bonds dropped on Monday on fears about the vote and possible sanctions.Many families have been stocking up on food in preparation for trouble and shops being closed during a tumultuous-looking week. Its traumatic what were going through, but if it means an end to this nightmare, it will all be worth it, said Nancy Ramirez, 33, lining up for rice at a store in Caracas. Details have been scarce on what Maduros Constituent Assembly would actually do, but it would have power to rewrite the national charter  written under Chavez in 1999  and override all other institutions.Officials have said it would immediately replace the existing National Assembly legislature where the opposition won a majority in 2015 elections.Consultancy Teneo Intelligence said the Constituent Assembly would be unlikely to change economic policy or the governments approach to foreign debt. This is primarily a political gambit to keep Chavismo in power, not an ideological or policy pivot, wrote analyst Nicholas Watson, in reference to the ruling socialist movement founded by Chavez.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5a07242e9855b76bf13c815d,"Next to flashpoint, home tension bigger headache than China chill",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-china-bhutan-border-standoff-kupup-sikkim-4765776/,2017-07-24,"On way to Kupup. Partha Paul On way to Kupup. Partha PaulJust over 60 km east of Gangtok and 13,025 feet above sea level, lies the hamlet of Kupup. With a population of about 550, Kupup stands close to the trijunction, tucked in between the mountains of the eastern Himalayas where India, China and Bhutan meet.South of Kupup lies the popular Elephant Lake, its tail pointing towards the village and its tapering trunk towards the Dolam plateau, barely 5 km in a straight line on the other side of the rain-drenched hills. Located near Nathula at 14,400 feet, this 89 sq-km pasture land, to which Bhutanese shepherds take their yaks for grazing, has been at the centre of a standoff between Indian and Chinese troops for more than a month now.But for the people of Kupup, a 1.5 sq-km patch, the India-China tension is not of paramount importance, its the Gorkhaland agitation and the frequent landslides thats disrupting their lives. As for China, they say, its business as usual. We go to Rinchengang, 9 km ahead of Nathula in Tibet, where we trade with the Chinese. The market is open from Monday to Thursday, from 10 am to 4 pm. We are still going. The trading hasnt stopped, says Chunzey Bhutia, 38, who owns and runs a small shop with her brother, a registered trader permitted to trade with the Chinese.While Bhutias family lives in Gangtok to ensure a good education for her children ? the only government school in Kupup shut in 2005 without enough students ? she travels to Sikkims capital every month, ferrying Chinese goods. Her shop stores stacks of Chinese blankets, shoes, umbrellas, jackets and other goods. The blankets are the most popular, says Bhutia.Kupup residents say this informal trade between India and China operates for seven months every year ? between May and November, when heavy snowfall brings the shutters down. There are five families who trade with the Chinese. Most others in the village work as labourers with the Border Roads Organisation. The road to Kupup is being widened. The roads are constantly getting either repaired or widened, says a resident.In this cluster of far-flung villages ? Kupup, Gnangthang, Lungthung, Zuluk ? road construction and repair is the main source of employment. With heavy rains and soft soil, landslides are common, and a road worker makes Rs 440 a day for an eight-hour shift. These days, the shortest route to Kupup from Gangtok via Changu lake is closed as a part of the highway has caved in after a landslide. Its the longer route that remains open.A stones throw from Bhutias shop is another, run by Dola Sherpa. Sherpa, 51, says the landslides have slowed trade, with less goods coming from Gangtok. Most of the traders belong to Gangtok, and its not easy to get here now, he says.It is also difficult to make phone calls. The government recently set up a cell phone tower here, but its restricted. Only 30 people can make calls, and they belong to the Army. We cant. We get reception intermittently, says Sherpa Business has been hit, he says, not by the border tension with China but the Gorkhaland agitation in Darjeeling that has shut down the region for over a month. The tourists have stopped coming. The shops clientele now mostly comprises Army jawans, says Sherpa.However, despite the claims in Kupup that trade between the two countries continues unabated, the general secretary of the Indo-China Border Trade Association Rajesh Rai says the Chinese have halted business in the last two weeks. They (the Chinese) told us its because their road drainage system, he says.There are 1,000 registered Indians who trade with China. But in reality, there are around 250 active traders. These traders mostly belong to Gangtok, and a handful to the surrounding villages here. We have a border haat (market) at Sherathang on the Indian side where Chinese traders come the Indian traders go to Rinchengang in Tibet. The Chinese goods are taken to Gangtok, our goods are taken to Lhasa, he says.We dont want the trade to be formalised as most of the traders are small-time, especially from the villages. If big players enter, these people will lose their income, says Rai.The trade occurs in Chinese currency, he says, and the going rate is Rs 9.3 per Yuan. Indias exports to China is more than its imports in this region, with traders selling rice, flour, wheat, Dalda, sugar, biscuits and matches to small-time Chinese businessmen. Rice is the most popular item for the Chinese, so much so that prices have risen steadily, from Rs 900 for 25 kg several years ago to Rs 2,200 now. We dont have any border haats with Bhutan, says Rai.Unlike Indias other international borders, the relationship between people in the villages between India, China and Bhutan is almost unemotional, with little connect. Bhutia says there is no interaction with neighbouring Bhutanese villages, and with the Chinese its one of trade. The language is different. And so is the culture, she says.A 32-km descent from Kupup leads to Zuluk, at 9,400 feet. Here, 51-year-old Gopal Pradhans wife, who died earlier this year, was the gram panchayat head. Pradhans daughter is married to a Bhutanese national. There is a point on the hill from where I can see her in-laws village, says Pradhan.But marriages between Bhutanese and Indian nationals are rare, and virtually none between Indians and Chinese, says Pradhan. With barely 85 homes and a population of 326, tourism is the main source of income at Zuluk, with as many as 32 homestays.People laughed at me when I started (the first homestay in 2008). They couldnt imagine that tourism could be a viable income. There is a high rate of unemployment here, but with these homestays, everyone has a good income, says Pradhan.Like Sherpa, Pradhan says it is the Gorkhaland agitation and not the India-China tension which has hit the village. We havent got any tourists this season. I had to make a number of cancellations. Lets see what happens in October, our next tourist season, he says.This was a part of the Silk Route, till the time Tibet was a separate country. The Silk Route began from Kalimpong and ended in Lhasa. My father would carry kerosene oil, HMT watches, food and spare parts to Lhasa, and bring back silk thread. He would trek for 25 days to get to Lhasa and would be paid 75 paise a day for it, he says.In Kupup, Bhutia points to the hazy outline of a structure on a hilltop in the distance. Its a Chinese watchtower, she says. I keep hearing reports of this so-called tension when I get calls from relatives or friends in GangtokSometimes they get alarmed, as if there are bombs dropping on Kupup. As you can see, there is nothing of the sort here, says Bhutia.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We are also not allowed to work in the ponds belonging to the people from the upper caste, G Rajesh, a Dalit youth, who has been spearheading the movement against the social boycott, said.The families say they are angered by the paradox of a Dalit leader becoming the President as caste-based hatred continuing unabated.While we proudly claim to have a Dalit as President of India, unfortunately atrocities on Dalits have been on the rise. The ostracisation of Dalits in Garagaparru just for installing the statue of Ambedkar is a classic example of this caste discrimination, observed Andre Malyadri, general secretary of Struggle Committee against Caste Discrimination that is leading the protests.The villagers say when they informed the district administration about the boycott, they were given some rice and other provisions, but no concrete steps to resolve the situation were taken.Some of the Dalit farmers, who had taken lands of upper caste people on lease for cultivation, were also driven away and their leases were cancelled. Our womenfolk, who used to work in their houses, have been sacked.The villagers now want two acres for each Dalit family and monetary compensation of Rs 1 lakh.We want the land so that we can live with dignity, rather than depending on the mercy of the upper caste people, Rajesh said."

Fresh seeding of the seasons paddy and all investments along it are lost to the floods. However, a lot of fishes from the two rivers have come into our inundated fields. So youngsters from affected families venture out since morning to fish in the flood-waters. While we keep the major catch with us, we sell the surplus in Arambagh market to buy oil and salt, said Sheikh Nasir Ali of Saora village near Arambagh town.However, rice is scant to have fish curry with. We are sharing among ourselves whatever little rice of the previous season is left with us, said Asgar Ali of Muktarpur village. According to local estimates, some 5,000-7,000 people rendered homeless by floods have taken shelter in school buildings of Saora and Muktarpur.People are sharing whatever food they could gather before moving to the school shelters which are on higher grounds. No officials and ministers have not come or sent any relief, said Mukhtarpur resident Sheikh Asgar Ali.The entire lowland region of Saora-Nokunda-Mukhtarpur in Arambagh and Ghatal-Kharar region have been cut off by floods. Some 30-40 villages in Ghatal-Kharar are inundated. People are reaching upland through makeshift boats. Still, no relief is reaching us, lamented Shantanu Mondal, a resident of Harisinghpur village near Ghatal town.Many of the affected villagers alleged that they heard some relief was sent to the panchayat offices but never saw them. We heard that plastic sheets were sent to our village but have not seen any, said 64-year-old Moidul Hussain of Nokunda village.Those most in need have not been given any relief. Many of the panchayat members have distributed relief material among their kin, alleged another villager, Radhakanta Sikdar.Though the incessant rains that lashed south Bengal districts for the last 72 hours subsided to a drizzle on Tuesday, worries are far from over. With heavy rains in neighbouring Jharkhand, Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has released 33,000 cusecs of water from its barrages and dams on Monday and 18,000 cusecs more on Tuesday.While chief minister Mamata Banerjee indirectly blamed the DVC for worsening the situation, state irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that DVC is releasing more water despite having the capacity to hold it. Sources in DVC said they are forced to open the floodgates fearing collapse of dams and barrages.The Maithon Dam, Durgapur barrage, Masanjore and Panchet Dams do not have great storage capacity. If the danger levels are crossed, DVC has to open the floodgates so that the dams and barrages dont break down, which may lead to hundreds of deaths in South Bengal, a senior DVC official told the New Indian Express.As rains subsided, long queues were witnessed at gas centres and residents from upland area s were seen thronging markets for vegetables, rice and other essential commodities."

(File Photo) Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. (File Photo)The Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday traded blame in the Rajya Sabha over distress in the agriculture community due to which farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers. As the House took up a discussion on the agrarian crisis, the Opposition blamed the government for the problem, accusing it of being insensitive towards the farmers issues. They also sought to find faults in various policies of the government. The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

To our surprise, it melted like plastic,"" said Daljit Singh, a resident of Abul Khair.He alleged plastic 'phulli prasad' was widely sold in Gurdaspur.After getting suspicious of the quality of 'prasad,' they alerted devotees from the gurdwara public address system not to buy 'phulli prasad' and offer them in gurdwaras.Gurdaspur civil surgeon Dr H S Ghai said there was no formal complaint of plastic 'phulli prasad' being sold in the market.However, he said, on Monday he had ordered collection of samples for testing. ""I think these rumours have been triggered by social media but we will still verify such claims,"" he said.Sources seeking anonymity told TOI that 'suspicious' rice was being supplied from Delhi and was sold in small towns and villages through stockists in Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana. Several videos have been circulated on social media, showing manufacturing of plastic rice and bouncing rice balls.However, both Agriculture and Processed Foods Export Development Agency (APEDA) and the government's food safety department have refuted claims of presence of plastic rice in the market after conducing random checks."

Only if one takes a car across, a permission from the Nepal police becomes mandatory and, that too, can be managed without any hassle. Hundreds make journey of some 30km, crossing over the porous border, to reach the town to buy groceries ranging from rice and lentils to whiskey and soft drinks.""Every day, hundreds from Darjeeling come to buy goods such as rice, lentils, vegetables, meat and even liquor bottles and crates of soft drinks,"" said a Nepali police officer posted at the border. Usually, there is a bar on the amount of goods one can carry past the border, but given the prevalent crisis in Darjeeling, the cops are being lenient, he said.Kalyan Lepcha (name changed), who runs a homestay in Ghoom, was found buying groceries the Pashupatinagar market. While he bargained over the price of tomatoes and brinjals at the market, he was also carrying a crate of beer. ""This is the only place where I can get my daily essentials. Before the strike, we used to visit Pashupatinagar only on weekends for recreation or to buy cheap jackets and shoes,"" he said, adding, he got there in his friend's milk van and would hide his goods in the milk drums while returning.There were many like Lepcha shopping and crowding the local liquor shops. Some shops also allowed the shoppers use their Wi-Fi. ""We understand the Darjeeling situation and have friends there. Many of them travel here everyday to shop and use the internet, that we are providing for free,"" said Pramod Rai, who runs a liquor shop at Pashupatinagar in Ilam District in Nepal.The petrol pump at Pashupatinagar has become a top draw among hill residents who have been visiting the border town with jerrycans on bikes and cars to refill their vehicle tanks and store for future. ""I am trying to stock enough for the next few weeks, as we have no clue when the strike would finally end. It is impossible to move around the town during the strike without a bike"" said a Darjeeling resident in his early 30s, who had filled his bike tank to maximum capacity and carried another 10ltr jerrycan back home.Pashupatinagar is also a hub for cheap clothes and cosmetics imported from Thailand, where traders from Darjeeling, Mirik and other places buy goods at wholesale prices.""Our godowns are filled with stocks of jackets and trousers ordered by Darjeeling traders but due to the strike, they have refused to take the order now,"" said Aroop Pradhan, who runs a wholesale shop for mens' garments."

""The purpose is to ensure that farmers from whom paddy is procured by the PACS during the harvest season also get money from the PACS concerned for the milled rice and, thereby, the farmers are not cheated and their interests are also protected. Further, the rice so milled from procured paddy would be stored in the godown of the PACS concerned,"" sources said.From the 2016-17 financial year, the state government empowered PACS to procure paddy from farmers for which the cooperative department was made the nodal department. At present, there are 8,463 PACSs in the state, but 1,600 of them have been blacklisted for indulging in irregularities.The cooperative department has made the ambitious move to let the active PACS open their rice mills and run their godowns, as the state made record production of paddy during 2016 Kharif season and, accordingly, the proposal is deemed to be highly viable. Further, the move is aimed at promoting agri-based industry in the state.Most importantly, it would free the farmers from the nefarious activities of private rice millers who, as the recent experiences of paddy procurement and consequent milling of paddy by rice millers recently showed, procured paddy from farmers, but did not pay them money.The farmers were put to an estimated loss of around Rs1,000 crore, although the actual figures would be calculated only after the investigation of the defaulting rice millers is completed. Meanwhile, on the direction of the government, the state vigilance department constituted a team of 22 police officers to investigate the cases and arrest the culprits."

However, both the governments are yet to strike a deal as price negotiations are still going on. Ahead of Onam celebrations, Kerala Civil Supplies Minister P Thilothaman came to the Interim Government Complex in Velagapudi on Thursday and met Revenue Minister K E Krishna Murthy and Civil Supplies Minister P Pulla Rao and sought the AP government to supply the rice to Kerala.Saying that Kerala with thick population has its own limitations to set apart more land for paddy cultivation and is depending largely on allocation from the Central pool, Thilothaman urged the AP government to supply Jaya variety rice being produced in Twin Godavari, Krishna and Guntur districts of AP to Kerala. Thilothaman said that as there is no tie-up between government of Kerala and government of AP in the matter, private individuals, mainly the rice merchants, are taking undue advantage of the situation and selling rice at exorbitant prices after paying less money to farmers in AP.He underscored the need to have a government-to-government communication to supply rice to Kerala.Krishna Murthy and Pulla Rao said that the Kerala government sought AP to supply Jaya variety rice at Rs35 per kg.However, with rice millers citing that the cost of each kg will be around Rs 44 per kg, the price sought by Kerala government is not viable and the ministers decided to conduct another meeting to take a final call over the issue. The ministers of AP and Kerala opined that an understanding between the Civil Supplies Corporation of both the states regarding the supply of rice will help elimination of middlemen and ensure benefit the farmers of AP. The Kerala Minister, though, initially sought AP to supply 6,500 tonnes of rice ahead of Onam festival, however, said that they will purchase 72,000 metric tonnes of rice per year after striking a deal."

One of the factors for the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria in Musi is unscientific dumping of animal waste there.The team noticed many plastic bags containing human anatomical waste kept in the open outside the room meant for bio-hazardous waste. HRF leader and senior scientist Dr K Babu Rao , who was a part of the fact-finding team, told TOI that several practices ban ned under bio-medical waste (management and handling) rules, 2016, were followed by hospital authorities.""Bio-medical waste (management and handling) rules prescribe handling biomedical waste on the premises of generation. Human anatomical waste is categorized in Schedule 1. It is the duty of the hospital authorities to take steps to ensure that bio-medical waste is handled without any adverse effect to human health and environment,"" he said. Dr Babu Rao said that unsafe open space storage is a violation of the bio-medical waste (management and handling) rules.He said that the team noticed two bundles of postmortem linen on the side of the road leading to the mortuary . Quoting WHO guidelines, Dr Babu Rao said that soiled linen should be placed in clearly-labelled, leakproof bags or buckets at the site of use.""We saw a choked drain adjacent to the old mortua ry , presently used as storage for unclaimed bodies. The bodies are in various stages of decomposition producing liquid discharges that enter the open drain outside the building. We also saw blood and body fats in the drain,"" he said, adding that it's the duty of authorities concerned to treat waste before letting it into the drain.The team found that the building housing the mortuary was discharging waste generated directly into sewers, that include blood."

Social entrepreneur Sheela Balaji has been instrumental in bringing heritage rice  almost seven varieties that were regularly consumed till a few decades ago  back into the market. Having set up a 40-acre farm in Manjakkudi, in Tiruvarur district, she grows these ancient grains  each of which comes with its own distinct flavour when cooked, and interesting names and stories related to it. Sheela throws more light on these non-hybrid varieties. ""Annam is so important in our tradition. Starting from when one is just born, to when they give rice kanji to old people, to being used in weddings for blessing the couple, till you die, rice plays an important part in all stages of our life. It is only lately that rice has been getting a bad rap for containing carbs, etc. Fact is, rice is the oldest grain one can remember, and people are still eating rice,"" says Sheela.While there have been numerous varieties, the knowledge surrounding it is less among people. ""Most of them only know about raw, boiled and Basmati rice. Today, most of us consume only polished rice from which all vitamins and nutrients have been washed away, leaving only starch and sugar,"" says Sheela.Food traveller and musician Rakesh Raghunathan, who has been associated with Sheela in this, adds, ""Earlier, they used to treat ailments using food. And rice, has several medicinal properties. There is a popular saying, 'unnave marundhu, marundhe unnavu'. But unfortunately, people have very less knowledge about it."" And the sad part is, he says, ""Most of these speciality rice varieties are not available in your regular mandis.""And this is one of the reasons why Sheela decided to throw more light on the ancient grains. There is illuppai poo champa, kaatuyaanam (a crop that grows eight feet in height, where even an elephant can hide), mappillai champa (a tradition in Tirunelveli , where the newly married groom will be served a meal using this rice), karuppu kavuni (black rice), kalajeera (rice from Orissa), thooyamalli (resembles jasmine buds) and kichili champa (small grain rice).""People have several issues when it comes to food. They can't visualise any other colour apart from white. But karuppu kavuni has so many health benefits. Initially, people were used to eating white bread, but now, they have brown bread. So, I hope there will be a change,"" says Sheela, adding, ""Each of these has varied health benefits. The kind of manure which is being used is natural. I visit the farm every month to see the progress of these crops.""But when there's so much unrest revolving around farmers' issues and Tamil Nadu under a near-drought situation, how does she see the future for such crops?""It's been years since the government checked on the canals and dams. Other states have been upgrading it, but here, there has been a slow growth. Things can be better with regular cleaning and proper use of rain water harvesting. We need a proper political will to sort this issue,"" she notes. Having said that, Sheela avers there won't be a decline in the demand for crops or rice among farmers."

Apart from these, viral infections like cold and cough are also common.But what is worse is that doctors are warning against the rising number of cases of eye infections in the Capital.Corneal ulcers commonAditi Dusai, ophthalmologist at Sri Balaji Action Medical Institute, said that conjunctivitis (bacterial, viral and allergic), stye, chalazion (both inflamed and non-inflamed) and corneal ulcers are among common eye diseases that surface during the monsoon. Various indoor and outdoor allergens such as pollen and dust mites are retained in the atmosphere because of the moisture, which can cause severe allergic reactions.Redness and swelling are the initial signs that one might have an allergy, said Dr. Dusai, adding that it is important to wash your eyes and hands at least twice a day. Lubricating eyes also helps to keep dust particles from entering the eyes.Fungal infections risingMinal Kaur of PSRI Hospital said that major eye problems that occur during the monsoon are viral and allergic conjunctivitis. Vector-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and malaria have little or no effect on the eyes. However, in some cases, they might be responsible for corneal infections, said Dr. Kaur.Apart from this, doctors say that they are seeing several cases of diarrhoea, gastrointestinal infections and numerous cases of fungal infections that affect the toes and nails.Warning for diabeticsAlso, a general warning has been issued to those with diabetes. According to doctors, they should ensure that they take care of their feet and beware of infections affecting the toes and nails. Feet should always be kept dry and clean and one should avoid walking in dirty water. Those with asthma should take precautions to prevent dampness and growth of fungus in and around the house.During the monsoon, underground worms can surface and contaminate vegetables. In the presence of a weak digestive system, this can cause gastric disturbances. It is also better to avoid community lunches and marriages during monsoon. Eat light and include barley, rice and wheat in your diet. Water should be boiled before use. Adding ginger and greens to daily diet is a good idea, said R. N. Tandon of the Indian Medical Association (IMA).Dont neglect your skinSkincare is equally important in this season. Also, dandruff is very common during monsoon while breakouts, acne, and bacterial infections can be aggravated because of wet clothes. Fungal infections because of ringworms are common in armpits, groin, and between the toes.(With inputs from Vasundhara Dudeja)"

In this context, the notification clearly defines registered brand name as brand name or trade name, which is registered under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. In this regard, Section 2 (w) read with section 2 (t) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provide that a registered trade mark means a trade mark which is actually on the Register of Trade Marks and remaining in force.Thus, unless the brand name or trade name is actually on the Register of Trade Marks and is in force under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, CGST rate of 5% will not be applicable on the supply of such goods, the statement added.The GST rate on the supply of food items, such as channa or paneer , natural honey, wheat, rice and other cereals, pulses, and the flour of cereals and pulses, is nil. The rate on these items, when placed in a unit container and bearing a registered brand name, though, is 5%."

The godown and the rice mill are being established at a cost of Rs. 58.47 crore. Silos with a total capacity of 50,000 tonnes are being established in the complex. The silos would help store paddy for one to two years, safe from damage from rodents or natural causes. Two modern rice mills,which would process about 100 tonnes a day, were coming up.Since the godown was close to the railway line, paddy consignments could be transported trough conveyor belts directly to the godown from goods wagons in future, he said.Another storage godown was coming up at Edamanal. It would have a storage capacity of 40,000 tonnes. The facility is being established in an area of 34.76 acres at a cost of Rs. 58.75 crore with financial assistance from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. The godown would be established within one year.Once the projects were completed, about one lakh tonnes of paddy grown by farmers in and around Sirkazhi could be stored in them, he added."

The BBMP is confident that all the 198 canteens will be ready by August 4.""When the budget announcement was made, time was the biggest challenge. A team comprising chief engineers from PWD, BBMP, BDA and BWSSB was set up to look into how fast these structures could be set up and they suggested that the precast model would be the best option. The nearest facility that could make Building Information Model (BIM) structures was at Krishnagiri and parts of the canteen buildings are being transported from there. We will get all the canteens and kitchens ready by August 4,"" said Manoj Ranjan, special commissioner of BBMP in charge of the Indira Canteen project.For one canteen, nine trucks are required to transport the precast structures and it takes eight days for the contractor, KEF Infrastructure, to assemble and build it. The contractor surveys the land identified in each of the wards to approve if the canteen can come up on the same. So far, it has okayed 150 sites. Next, the land is levelled and excavated to insert an underground water tank, which too is a precast structure brought from the Krishnagiri factory.""Between third and eighth day, the entire structure is put up and fixed. It includes water pipelines, electric conduits, gas pipe network, furniture, etc.,"" said Ranjan. Each canteen is spread over 100 sqft and is worth Rs 28.5 lakh.

The Palike has drawn up an elaborate SOP which caterers and canteens have to adhere to.

Introduction of ePOS machines will address this issue, says Commissioner, Civil Supplies, C.V.Anand.The Android-based machines include features such as iris scanner, electronic weighing scale, voice player, digital payments facility, card swiping slot, and micro ATM.Issue of ration through iris scanner will rule out irregularities, and cards of those who do not draw rations consistently could be scrapped. The machines have been functioning in 1,545 FPS in GHMC, Rangareddy, and Medchal districts since March 2016. In 15 months period since then, GHMC alone has recorded returns of ration worth Rs. 330 crore, Mr.Anand says.Prior to introduction of ePOS, in February 2016, the monthly allotment of rice to the fair price shops was 27,253 metric tonnes (MT), of which 2,394 MT remained unlifted at the end of the month.After introduction of ePOS, in the first 10 months, the average monthly allotment was 27,748 MT, and the average monthly quantity of rice not lifted was 7,518 MT which was 29 per cent of the total issue, and over three times more than the previous unlifted stocks.In December 2016, the issued quantity was brought down to 25,748 MT, yet close to 5100 MT of rice was left unlifted, which amounted to 20 per cent of the whole.Encouraged by the results, the department extended ePOS terminals to more shops in Vikarabad and Mahabubnagar districts too, taking the number of total shops equipped with the machines to 3,600.Implementing the same throughout the state is expected to save 27,614 MT of rice per month, which would amount close to 16 per cent returns. Per annum, the savings would amount to Rs.828 crore in monetary terms, says Mr.Anand.Installation will be completed in Siddipet, Sangareddy and Medak districts this month, while Nizamabad, Kamareddy, Hanamkonda, Jayashankar Bhupalpally and Mahbubabad districts will be taken up next month. The rest of the districts will be taken up in the subsequent months, Mr.Anand said."

Recently, the government subsidised the prices for staff members, which will be enforced shortly. According to the new decision, the AP Secretariat Employees Cooperative Society Canteen will provide tiffin at `10 and meals at `25.Visitors to the secretariat can also avail the facility, government sources told Express.The government has taken the decision to provide meals to hundreds of employees of the Secretariat at low prices as many of them are staying away from home.Earlier, visitors, who hailed from underprivileged background, had requested the ministers concerned and administrative authorities to bring down the prices at the canteen.The Andhra Pradesh Secretariat Employees Cooperative Society had also appealed to the government for the same. Taking a serious note of the issue, the government has issued a government order on the subsided prices. The Secretariat Employees Association is gearing up with the arrangements for the inauguration of this scheme by the Chief Minister. AP Secretariat Cooperative Canteen president V Srinivasarao said, The government has responded quickly on the issue. It is a great initiative as it will bring relief to the employees and visitors alike.Meanwhile, Opposition leaders claimed that the measure was to pacify the employees who are furious with the government over the compulsory retirement scheme news which was doing the rounds for quite some time now.Rate chartIdly 4,(200 grams) - L10Vada 2 (120 grams) - L10Plain dosa (150 grams) - L10Mysore bajji (240 gms)- L10Sweet/snacks (100 gms) - L10Poori 2 (120 grams) - L15Tomato bath/ Upma (250 grams) - L10Chapati/Pulka (110 grams) - L15Onion Dosa, Pesarattu (150 grams) - L10Veg biryani (300 grams) - L15Special rice (250 grams) - L15Rice/ Pongal/ Lemon Rice/ Sambar Rice/ Curd Rice/ Tomato Rice(250 grams) - L10Ragi sankati (200 grams)- L10"

The standard supplies through PDS earlier included essential commodities such as sugar, oil, red gram, tamarind and kerosene, apart from rice.During the previous Congress regime under N. Kiran Kumar Reddy in the unified State, the bag of rations was raised to include nine commodities, though a few among them were offered at market price. Even after Telangana was formed as separate State, the commodities offered through the PDS at subsidised prices included rice, sugar, kerosene and pulses for about a year. The governments decision to raise the monthly ration of rice to 6 kg per person, and do away with the limit of 20 kg per family, eventually resulted in cutdown on other commodities. With the Central government doing away with levy of rice through Food Corporation of India, and also scrapping the subsidy on sugar, things have worsened for the beneficiaries. For the last three to four months, sugar has been stopped, and kerosene is issued only occasionally.At 2.74 crore, the State has 85 lakh beneficiaries more than specified under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), for whom the government is bearing the burden of additional rice subsidy to the tune of Rs. 1,700 crore. Further, while the Central government is allowing subsidy on only 5 kg of rice per person, the State government has been bearing the cost of the extra kilogram, which amounts to Rs. 400 crore. Bogged down by the cost, the State government is reluctant to restore the supply of commodities other than rice, an official source said on condition of anonymity. There has been tremendous pressure on the government to restore the commodities, but Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao is reportedly not willing to budge. The Civil Supplies Dept. too is facing wrath of the public for shedding its responsibility.Suggestions have been reportedly made by various sections for cutback in the quantity of rice supplied, to accommodate other commodities without additional cost, but Mr. Rao is apparently in no mood to dump his pet scheme.Only rice shopAt 2.74 crore, Telangana has 85 lakh beneficiaries more than specified under the National Food Security Act"
5a0759ef9855b76bf13c98b8,A hardy millet yields its genetic code,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/a-hardy-millet-yields-its-genetic-code/article19237777.ece,2017-07-08,"In a first, Karnatakas agricultural scientists have sequenced the genetic code of ragi, or finger millet, throwing light on the exact building blocks that make it drought-resistant and nutrition-rich.Scientists from the University of Agricultural Sciences-Bengaluru achieved the sequencing of the plant, which, the scientists say, was first domesticated from a wild species in Western Uganda and the Ethiopian highlands before being introduced to India around 3,000 BC. The key genetic information revealed by the four-year project will aid further research on ragi, the main crop of dry land farmers. Ragi occupies 12% of global millet cultivation area and Karnataka, which has the second largest drought-prone crop land after Rajasthan, leads in its cultivation.With a low glycemic index, ragi is a healthier alternative to polished cereals, rich in calcium, fibre and iron besides being gluten-free. Genome sequencing identifies the order of DNA nucleotides in a genome. The ragi project was pursued by an eight-member team headed by Dr. Shailaja Hittalmani, Professor and University Head of Genetics & Plant Breeding, and its report was published in BMC Genomics on June 15. The sequencing report, sponsored by the World Bank-funded watershed development programme, was published in the journal BMC Genomics on June 15. We have identified 2,866 drought-tolerant genes in ragi besides those responsible for its nutrients, Dr. Hittalmani said.Rice, wheat may gainKnowledge of specific genes would now help reduce the time needed for developing new and improved varieties. It would also be possible to expect more productive outcomes while developing improved and drought-tolerant varieties, she said.Potential gains to drought tolerance of rice and wheat through transfer of drought-tolerant genes found in ragi are possible. Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the scientific advance would help dry land farmers. Consumers would get nutrient-rich food through research involving a non-transgenic process. In fact the process of taking technology to dry-land farmers would now begin as the genome sequencing marks the beginning of focused research towards developing improved crop varieties, he observed."

National Park and Chamala valley ranges, considered highly vulnerable to the entry and exit errands of the woodcutters.As the Task Force is hit by 50% staff crunch, most of the combing activity is concentrated in the two districts of Chittoor and Kadapa, while the districts of Prakasam, Nellore and Kurnool are left to fend for themselves and even the skeletal staff is missing. Red sanders are present in about 12 lakh hectares in these five districts.Following instructions of the Task Force Inspector General of Police (IGP) M. Kantha Rao, the combing parties laid focus on the plain areas close to the foothills, leading to surveillance of the prime national and State highways and rural roads as well.RSASTF Inspector G. Ashok Kumar said continuous movement of the combing parties in the Seshachalam hill ranges could deter smugglers of the red sanders logs and rice bags of the Public Distribution System (PDS) on inter-State routes between A.P. and Tamil Nadu. As we are intercepting the suspiciously moving vehicles on the forest roads, the smugglers of contraband goods are forced to resort to direct modes on the national and State highways, resulting in their being caught on most occasions,"" the official said.The Task Force official said during that last two and half years, the traditional entry and exit points of the T.N. woodcutters between the Kalyani dam and Karakambadi passing through the SV Zoo Park and the Alipiri zones were completely sealed.Unseen protection wallThe Task Force movement along this stretch of the foothills had further led to formation of an unseen protection wall in the backdrop of the Alipiri bomb blast in 2003 targeting N. Chandrababu Naidu, who was the Chief Minister then. ""Our presence at the isolated spots in the forest areas and those close to vital footpaths to Tirumala could successfully prevent anti-social elements, creating fear of being caught in them. The lesser used and strategic footpaths to Tirumala from Kadapa district are also under our direct surveillance,"" the official said.Mr. Ashok Kumar said the search operations of the Task Force with sniffer dog squads at the railway stations and bus stations had instilled confidence among commuters.""Though our primary objective is to detect the presence of red sanders in the public transport modes, we are also successful in preventing the clandestine transportation of hazardous goods such as explosives,"" the official said.Task Force Inspector (Armed Reserve) Vasu said his team's presence along the Srivari Mettu footpath towards Tirumala would always make the pedestrian pilgrims moving in families happy and confident. ""As we see the pilgrims negotiating isolated areas with brimming confidence and a sense of security, it gives us immense satisfaction,"" he said."

When it rains, for instance, I instantly think of ghevar. Now thats a sweet I have often written about. Its eaten mostly in the north in the rainy season. I am greatly fond of it, though I find that not too many share my view on this.So, the moment the sky turned grey a few days ago, I went looking for ghevar. The closest stop was Kaleva, which used to be my favourite sweet-and-savoury eatery at some point of time. I used to be a regular there, but hadnt been to the sweet shop in Gole Market for quite a while. So I decided I would buy my ghevar there, and have a quick lunch of bedmi sabzi (Rs. 62 for a plate with two bedmis) and dahi vada (Rs. 75).This is a great place for a 15-minute lunch if you are in a hurry. Though the place is always crowded, especially at lunch time, food comes in minutes. And you cant linger in any case to contemplate life because Kaleva  unlike similar eateries in places such as Bengali Market  has no seating area; you have to stand at a counter and eat.I enjoyed my bedmi sabzi. The freshly fried bedmis were large and fluffy, and the potato curry it came with was spicy and nicely mashed. What disappointed me was the dahi vada, which I used to love once upon a time. Either my taste buds have changed since then, or their cook has, for I found the vada so hard that I had to leave half of it uneaten.They have the usual lunch menu that you find in north Indian vegetarian fast-food eateries  puri sabzi, chholey bhaturey, chaat, pao bhaji, special thhalis  consisting of dal makhni, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable rice, raita, sweet, salad and pickle  and rice combos (with chholey, sambhar, dal makhni or shahi paneer). There is a small south Indian section, with dosa and vada served with sambar, and you also get the usual vegetable chowmein, hakka noodles and chilli paneer gravy and so on. Their snacks have always been good. You get various kinds of kachoris (khasta, with peas and so on), pakoras, including green chilly ones, and dhoklas.Deliciously crispWhat I really enjoyed was the ghevar, which had just come off the stove. It had a soft malai layer, which added style and substance to the poor old ghevar. Actually, the dish  essentially a mix of ghee, maida and sugar  has to be prepared with great care for the right thickness and its honeycomb-like form. The ghevar that I carried back with me  and it was demolished before I could say rain  was deliciously crisp, despite the humid weather and the malai.Kaleva is essentially known for its sweets. I used to love their fruit kulfis  creamy kulfis frozen in fruits such as mangoes and apples. We were also very fond of a sweet called chak-a-chak  a light, lemon-coloured rasmalai, with tiny rasgullas in it.Despite all these years, Kaleva remains more or less the same (if you forget about the dahi vada). I shall go back for the ghevar the next time it rains. And the sooner, the better."

He turned angry when the officials reported that the miller concerned did not turn up despite intimation.Accompanied by AP Civil Supplies Corporation Managing Director Ram Gopal and other officials, the Minister went round the mill premises, which was mostly empty and there was no sign of the CMR paddy being still stored.Under the CMR scheme, the government supplies paddy to the miller who has to supply rice in return. This miller has not made the return supply so far and he owed Rs. 8.5 crore for the past two years. This is a serious offence and we will initiate criminal proceedings, said Mr. Pulla Rao.Stating that considerable time was given to such defiant millers on humanitarian grounds and due to political pressures, Mr. Pulla Rao said that this kind of attitude would not be tolerated and the government would take stringent action to protect sanctity of the programmes like CMR intended for farmers welfare.When the Minister enquired about the whereabouts and antecedents of the millers, the local residents of Podalakur said that the owner would not be available locally and that he had other businesses in Nellore surroundings.WarningMr. Pulla Rao said that some millers were found to have become defiant and headstrong to the extent that they were ignoring warnings from the government regarding recoveries. These millers happily sold out farmers rice and used that money to either buy property or make investments. This will not be tolerated, he added.About 23 millers owed Rs. 70 crore in CMR dues in Nellore district, the highest in the State. The overall dues in AP came to Rs. 103 crore."

The existing counters are located a few yards away from the Vendi Vakili and this is leading to congestion at the exit point hindering free movement of the devotees coming out of the temple. The area in the vicinity of Poola Bavi,  which served as prasadam distribution point about two decades ago, is seen as an ideal location. The presence of a massive godown in the area, where huge quantities of prasadam can be stored, is considered an added advantage. Every day, five to six quintals of rice and two quintals of green gram are used to prepare prasadam, which is served round the clock."

He called on the MPs to prevail upon the Centre to protect the interests of consumers.Mr. Vijayan stressed the need to set up State-level committees to monitor market prices. The State government, he said, was doing its best to check price rise.A system has been put in place to receive complaints from the public. The Centre has to publish the comparative tax rates in the GST regime and the previous period.Highlighting the impact of GST on various sectors, he underlined the need to reduce the new tax rate for restaurants, Ayurvedic medicines, and houseboats. He told the MPs that he would meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August to seek an end to the skyrocketing price of air tickets during the festival season.The government is yet to honour its commitment to increase the number of seats for foreign airlines during the festival season.Travellers to Kerala were forced to shell out inflated prices for tickets this Ramzan season. It is in this context that the State is seeking the Prime Ministers intervention.The MPs were asked to raise their voice in Parliament against the move to privatise Central PSUs like the Hindustan Newsprint, Hindustan Organic Chemicals, and HLL Lifecare.Mr. Vijayan also sought their intervention for the establishment of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, International Ayurveda Research Centre, and Institute of Tribal Health and to ensure Central funds for the Malabar Cancer Centre and the health insurance scheme for migrant workers.The meeting highlighted the need to speed up the work on the Angamaly-Sabari railway line and start work on the Guruvayur-Thirunavaya and Nilambur Road-Nanjancode rail line.Mr. Vijayan said the State was opposed to the Central Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill that was due to be taken up by the Rajya Sabha. The Bill, he explained, would make it difficult for State governments to operate bus services.The MPs were told to solicit assistance from the Centre for the rubber production incentive scheme and for promotion of paddy farming as well as to ensure enhanced allocation of rice and wheat for the public distribution system.Pointing out that the States quota of foodgrains under the National Food Security Act was inadequate, Mr. Vijayan sought an additional 9,00,000 tonnes. He called for a special quota of kerosene for distribution to fishermen at subsidised rate.Job schemeTimely disbursement of Central funds for the employment guarantee scheme was another demand highlighted at the meeting.Ministers, MPs, Planning Board Vice Chairman V.K.

The techie was identified as Muthukrishnan, 47, of Rice Mill Street in Tuticorin town. He was working in the United States and was a green-card holder. He was married to Muthulakshmi and had two children. He returned to Tuticorin a few years ago to settle a dispute with his wife.Police said Muthukrishnan left home on May 22 after informing his mother Ammumuthu. As he never returned, a man missing case was registered with Tuticorin South Police station. Meanwhile, a habeas corpus petition was filed in Madurai bench of Madras high court. Police who conducted investigation based on the call records of the deceased, picked up M Rajagopal, a truck driver from Rajavallipuram in Tirunelveli.Investigations with the suspect revealed that he along with his friends hacked Muthukrishnan to death and disposed the body in the stone quarry. Further investigation revealed the techie had developed a relationship with a woman lawyer, a relative of Rajagopal, who opposed it vehemently.There was dispute between the two on May 19 during which Rajagopal was beaten. He hatched a plan with his friends to murder the techie. When Muthukrishnan went to meet the lawyer on May 22 he was kidnapped in his car. He was then taken to a secluded place and murdered. The assailants then drove the vehicle to a stone quarry near Thalaiyuthu and disposed it along with the body. While Rajagopal has been arrested, search is on for the others."

Pay a visit to the building in the morning and you will witness horrifying scenes such as 130 students queuing up at the four toilets that dont even have water supply. The kitchen here prepares food for just 50.When TNIE visited the hostel premises on Thursday, a day after the students protested against the apathy of the Social Welfare Department in providing water to the hostel, officials were in a hurry taking up repair works. However, its not hard to miss the damaged flooring, scurrying rats and crammed rooms and leftover food dumped in the backyard of the hostel.Students at the hostel complained that they were facing severe hardships thanks to the lack of basic facilities such as toilets, lighting and ceiling fans. The smell of faeces emanating from toilets is a nightmare, a student said. The poor supply of quality food too makes life tough for the first generation college goers hailing from neighbouring districts including West Godavari, Guntur and Prakasam. Getting admission in social welfare hostels is in itself an arduous task for students. Though classes start in the first week of June, hostel rooms are allotted only during the first week of July.If a student knows someone in Vijayawada they stay with them, others sleep in the dormitories and use the corporation toilets during the period. The long wait for hostel allotment forces half of them to drop out and go back home, said Ch Madhu Babu, a second year degree student staying at the hostel for the last three years. A fresh set of problems is bound to occur after the admission process gets over. Nearly 10 to 20 students are accommodated in each of the small rooms. Half of them sleep on the terrace, while four to five sleep outside the room. Things get tough when it rains, he said. The hostel premises is unhygienic, toilets are in a dilapidated condition and waste is not collected on a daily basis. Mosquitoes breed in stagnating water and street dogs stray into the hostel rooms.There is hardly any water. Sometimes hostel authorities arrange a single water tanker for the entire hostel  about 130 students. With no option left, a majority of them use the sulabh complex and toilets at the Pandit Nehru Bus Station, said K Harish, a student at SRR and CVR college. Most of the time, there isnt food for even half of the students. The rice is sometimes half cooked, sometimes its overcooked and the curries are tasteless. Moreover, the food is stored and prepared in the most unhygienic manner. Both the store room and kitchen are infested with rats. We get the food only after rodents have had their share, said K Durga Prasad, another student.Most of the time, social welfare department officials will respond only if we agitate. We had to do a sit- in protest two days ago as there was water shortage at the hostel. To maintain status quo, we have to protest every six months, said S Lava Kumar another student.When contacted, assistant social welfare officer P Vijaya Kumari said, The joint director had ordered the estimation of cost for repair works in the hostel. Officials estimate that Rs 15 lakh will be required for repair works to meet the needs of the students. Works will be taken up in a phased manner soon after the budget allocation and will be completed in a month."

The nearest is the airport hotel, which is located at the parking facility. The new restaurant is right in front of the new terminal and is shaped like a butterfly in tune with Cial's environmentfriendly initiatives. In fact, Cochin airport is the world's first solarpowered airport.""For the restaurant, we supplied a significant amount of the building materials in order to reduce the tender quotation, which will also reflect in the pricing of the food at the restaurant,"" said a Cial official.Departing from the standard notion of overpricing at airport facilities, the new restaurant will provide food at nominal rates. As per Cail's requirements, a set of 10 essential food items will be provided at affordable rates in order to avoid fleecing the airport visitors.These items include rice meals for Rs 45 and tea for Rs 12. They have also worked out special rates for their 7,500 airport staffers who are not working directly under Cial's payroll. They can avail a rice meal for Rs 5 and a tea for just Rs 2.""There are many people work ing at Cial--from those earning Rs 5,000 to Rs 2 lakh a month-and it is important to provide them food which suit their budget,"" said the official. Once the new restaurant is opened, the existing airport hotel at the parking is expected to be shut down.Furthermore, Cial has also issued the tender for new snack bars at the arrival visitor's area and the departure check-in area for the new domestic terminal, which is set to be open by the end of 2017. As per the tender requirements, they are required to serve tea, coffee and Kerala snacks at affordable rates to the visitors."

They hired a fleet of luxury buses and went on a city tour.More than 4,500 personnel arrived in batches since Monday at popular shopping destinations in the city  Express Avenue, Phoenix Mall and T Nagar. While many stuck to the routine and waited for the shuttle buses to ferry them back to the port, a few others hired taxis or walked around to explore more.Fireman controlmen (second class surface) Daniel Taylor of Oakland California has bought a sapphire necklace for his wife and a cashmere rug for his house from an arts emporium on Anna Salai. ""I visited the Express Mall, Rain Tree Hotel on St Marys and Anna Salai, Cottage Arts Emporium, and Leela Palace Hotel. The weather was perfect. My friend and I spent quite a bit of time walking and since we had brought plenty of water we managed pretty well,"" he said.But before the outing, the American sailors took part in a friendly basketball match with students at YMCA which they lost 36-35.Reaching the shores after many months at sea, food, liquor and clothes interested the visiting sailors the most. Most of them could be seen trying out the food. A sailor who walked out of a mall for a smoke before going inside for coffee said, ""It is hot but I am enjoying the outing. I tried out the food."" While the men were found eating at multinational outlets, a few female personnel bought rice and curry from a local one.More than 35 navy personnel queued up before the only ATM machine working at the Express Avenue mall. The elite Tasmac outlet there hit a goldmine. ""The navy personnel were the only customers we got after we opened at 12pm,"" said a staff. Many showed interest in buying Indian brands. One sailor picked up a bottle of Jack Daniels' but settled for the cheaper Signature as his friends bought crate loads of Kingfisher beer.""It is one of the most interesting places I have ever been to and one of the most memorable because it was my birthday. The people have been helpful and welcoming. I can't wait to visit the temples, take pictures and immerse myself again in such a culturally rich place,"" Taylor said.Autorickshaw drivers and trinket sellers trying to peddle small drums and snake idols accosted them at the gate of a mall while agents came up with sightseeing packages. But the sailors seemed to be well-briefed about the 'risks' they may face on land. ""Rs50,"" said a sailor when a hawker asked Rs 2,000 for a small drum.Police posted plainsclothes personnel to ensure that the sailors did not get cheated. ""I told the sailors to be careful and warned cab drivers not to cheat them,"" a policeman said.And the outing went on till late. Some sailors were spotted outside the mall past 12am on Monday waiting for their shuttle bus to arrive. Adam, part of the group, said, ""I am visiting the city for the first time. I am part of the security service so I am here to ensure that all of them get into the bus.""Around 7,000 US navy personnel will take part in Malabar 2017 . The Nimitz aircraft carrier has not docked at the port but personnel from the ship are being ferried into the port using boats. More people are expected to come into the city in the coming days as they have shore classes and exercises till July 13 when all the ships will sail out to the sea for the war games.But in all this the Tamil Nadu Tourism seems to be sitting idle with no initiative taken to make the most of the opportunity. ""They are largely security personnel. We are not doing anything with the navy,"" said an official of the department."

Further, the apex court said, the trial should be concluded within next six months through special courts.The scam led to an estimated loss of Rs 1,573 crore to the state exchequer as the rice millers in connivance with government officials allegedly did not return the rice after milling to the state government. Instead, they allegedly sold the stocks in open market and made huge profits.""We have moved the court as the number of cases is high,"" said Bihar ADG (CID) Binay Kumar who is heading the SIT formed on the Patna high court's order to probe the scam.Kumar said their plea was yet to come for hearing in the apex court."

So, I am on the road to find what I can manage,"" said Pramod Rai (name changed), who has a foreign exchange shop in Darjeeling.There are others like Sanju Tamang, a cook at a hotel on HD Lama Road and a resident of Zakir Hussain bazaar who leaves home every night around 9pm with an empty sack, a torch and an umbrella and knocks outside every single shop that he finds illuminated under the shutters. ""I buy whatever there is on offer from cold drinks to peanuts and keep stocking it. But the real problem is that there is acute shortage of grains, which no one is ready to sell,"" he said.Hours after the all-party meeting at Pedong, around 20 kms from Kalimpong, TOI spotted a group of around 150 men and women at Chowkbazar around 10.30pm on Thursday demonstrating before three policeman, one of them a senior officer. The group was demanding food. The officer, on condition of anonymity , said three days ago he had arranged for some grains from his home and had given it to seven youths whom he had spotted running from one shop to another.

Saidapet DMK MLA and former Chennai mayor M Subramanian moved the motion followed by Congress legislature party leader K R Ramaswamy.Municipal administration and water supply minister SP Velumani said people will have to face the situation. ""Unless there is sufficient rainfall, the situation is unlikely to improve,"" he said.""There has never been such an occasion in the past when so many MLAs have jointly moved a calling attention motion. The situation is so bad that barring the minister and the vacant seat (R K Nagar), all 232 MLAs will surely want to move the motion on the drinking water situation,"" said Subramanian. He reeled out data on the number of panchayats, town panchayats, municipalities and corporations and said people across the state were suffering.He alleged that in his constituency people collected money and installed Sintex tanks. ""Each tank cost Rs 25,000 and they have been set up with public contribution. Even though we set up tanks, there was no water in it for the past 15 days. Only last night it was filled up,"" said Subramanian.Ramaswamy pleaded with the government to give water free of cost instead of freebies. ""You provide free rice and other goodies, but in villages in Sivaganga district people are forced to purchase water at Rs 15 per pot. Please provide water free of cost,"" said Ramasamy.The minister began his speech, describing the ""historical drought"" the state was facing. ""We are doing our best to mitigate the sufferings. But, nature has failed us. In Chennai for instance, in April we were providing 500 million litres. Now, 470 million litres are being provided,"" said Velumani.He said water was being sourced from wells in Tiruvallur and Neyveli and borewells in Paravalaru, using high powered borewells to draw water from Sholavaram and Red Hills reservoirs. ""The number of trucks with water tanks has been increased to 700 and they make 7,000 trips every day. Steps have been taken to install 150 India Mark 2 pumps in Chennai,"" said the minister.The poor storage situation in all the four reservoirs has worsened with water evaporating fast. Work has been taken up on a war footing at a total cost of Rs 105 crore to sink borewells in the reservoir beds.

With wild rumours spreading from hamlet to hamlet, there was tension in pockets around Basirhat railway station and in the marketplaces of Puratanbazar, Nutanbazar and Mayerbazar. However, the worst seems to be over. The police and paramilitary personnel have virtually cordoned off the troubled zone, preventing outsiders from entering the area.The hamlets and roadside shops in Basirhat town bore tell-tale scars of a confrontation they had never witnessed before. On Friday, passion was giving way to disgust, directed mostly at the administration, prompting the North 24 Parganas police to remove inspector-in-charge of Basirhat Nasim Akhtar.""I want to know where is the administration, where is the police? They are busy saving their own lives leaving us at the mercy of fate. I can't take my daughter to school. I can't even leave the house alone. People with whom I have lived for the last 19 years since my marriage have suddenly turned enemies,"" said Malati Das, a housewife at Kasaipara in Basirhat town.Across localities like Bhabla, Kholapota, Paschim Dandirhat and Harishpur , residents are yet to get over the trauma. Most shops in these areas remained closed even on Friday, fearing a backlash any moment.Most residents were taken aback at the communal flare-up as the town has for long been an island of peace and harmony.""This is close to Bangladesh and there are many porous areas in the border. People are coming from outside through different routes, particularly from Minakha and Malancha side. These men are provoking people. We are trying to plug these routes. We have asked the police to help us,"" said Mubinur Rahomon, the imam of Aminia mosque said.Abul Kasim Sardar walked out of Aminia mosque in Basirhat after the Friday namaz clutching a Tricolour. It was an effort to defy the ""jihadi"" stigma on the entire community.With an internet ban and prohibitory orders in place, most residents are cut off from their relatives in other parts of the town or state. Those who had fled their homes have also not returned yet. ""We have told the BDO, SDO and the local police station to hold peace meetings with representatives from political parties, NGOs and communities. This has not happened as yet. Even this morning, I purchased some rice and dal and gave it to the Duttas, my neighbour. They ran out of food four days ,"" said ward 12 Trinamool councillor Babu Gazi."
