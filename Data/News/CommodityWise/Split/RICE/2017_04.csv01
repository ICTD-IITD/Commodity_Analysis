It has also decided to stop distributing palm oil, sugar and salt.During the scheme's launch in 2013, chief minister Siddaramaiah had announced 30kg of rice per Below Poverty Line (BPL) family. Over the last four years, demand for variety , spike in black-marketing of rice and efforts to capture people's imagination drove the government to reinvent the scheme.In 2015-16, the government began publicizing that it'd add 2kg of ragiwheatjowar, based on regional staples, and cut down on the quantity of rice being supplied. It also promised a kilo of salt and sugar with a litre of palm oil.Beneficiaries of the scheme were getting all of these till early this year. However, now these add-ons have all been scrapped. Just a kilo of tur dal has been added to seven kilos of rice for every BPL card-holder.Food and civil supplies department officials claimed the government stopped lifting jo whar or ragi as there was no ""demand"" for them.Confirming that the government has decided to scrap ragi and jowar, minister U T Khader said: ""We have stopped supplying ragi and jowar to BPL families. We have also stopped providing some of the other items due to factors such as low price and non-availability of central government subsidy ."" The only other foodgrain which is available under Anna Bhagya is wheat, which, the minister said, is being provided on demand only in north Karnataka districts.So, has this move helped the government save money?Khader says though the state government might have saved on these add-ons, it'll have to bear the cost of increased quantity of rice (from 5 to 7kg), apart from the cost incurred on Anila Bhagya, a new scheme to provide free LPG connections and gas stoves to BPL families."

However, not in the fashion of a side accessory, but as a filling. The godd lonchem thus adds a wonderful dimension to chapatti, pao and even sandwiches, if you will.""In the pre-liberation era, before the wheat chapatti was introduced, Goans consumed the godd lonchem with the local 'polle' made from rice flour,"" said food-expert, Amita Salatri ""This simple but finger-licking delicious pickle served as a popular evening snack among senior citizens or as a breakfast option among fussy school-going children during that time,"" she said.For the sweet pickle, fresh ambade are peeled, cooked in sugar and tempered with basic spices, which give it a sweet and sour taste. Its flavour offers a counterpoint to the bold pungency of the mango pickle.Stored in sealed glass jars in a cool, dark place can give this pickle a shelf life . The relish can also be refrigerated.Recipe:Preparation Time:15 minutesIngredients:10 tender ambade of small sizeOne teaspoon mustard seedsHalf teaspoon hingOne teaspoon tumeric powderTwo teaspoon chili powderQuarter kilo jaggerySalt to tasteMethod of Preparation:Take tender ambade and skin them.

5a0782789855b76bf13cab19,Marching rupee: Profits of exporters under stress,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/marching-rupee-profits-of-exporters-under-stress/articleshow/59597425.cms,2017-07-15,"CHENNAI: The appreciating Indian rupee which has risen to Rs 64.54on Tuesday from Rs 67.95 on January 1, 2017 will impact exporters. Analysts say the rupee is showing strength against the US dollar on lower greenback demand and uncertainty in global markets.With the sharp risein Q1, analysts expect this to cut into the profits of exporters by 150-300 bps (100 bps=1%). ""Those having natural offsets such as sizeable imports, or foreign currency loans and currency hedges, would be less impacted,"" said ratings agency CRISIL. This comes even as the currency composition of FCNR(B) deposits has seen the share of the dollar decline to 70% from 83% between the third and fourth-quarter of 2016. As per RBI data, overseas investors are diversifying risk and pumping in fresh deposits in the pound-sterling, euros, riyals and the yen.CARE Ratings for instance recalls the impact of the 18-month slowdown from Dec 2014- Sept 2016 in exports. ""A stronger rupee would have a negative bearing on the export oriented sectors such as IT services, pharma, textiles, automobiles and ancillaries. It could impair the improvements in exports being seen in the recent months,"" said the agency in a report.""Sharp appreciation of the rupee against the dollar in recent months is likely to have dented the first-quarter profitability of exporters, who source locally and have limited pricing power,"" said CRISIL in a report, which said among the top-10 export sectors leather, textiles, meat, seafood and basmati rice were the most vulnerable to rupee strengthening.Foreign currency losses for these exporters assuming everything else was business as usual are estimated at 200-300 bps of net sales during the first quarter, given the 4% appreciation in the rupee. Exporters of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals might see a lower impact at 150 bps given that their imports provide a partial natural hedge. For the gems & jewellery sector, exports largely match imports leading to minimal impact.When it comes to IT companies, CRISIL, said, ""They would be the least affected given their extensive hedging; but the extent of hedge in terms of time period will determine the impact on individual companies. Some other effects of a stronger rupee would be according to CARE ratings, ""lower crude oil prices for the Indian economy. This in turn is expected to reduce the wholesale price inflation and benefit aviation sector (importer of crude oil) besides other related products. Companies having foreign denominated debt will also benefit from a stronger rupee.""But NRIs sending money back home will cause for concern, as ""overseas remittances will be negatively impacted as they will deliver lower value when converted to rupees."""

Not every change need be drastic, nor every decision life changing. It is in little changes that true magic lies. And it is these that are more sustainable.Internet overflows with articles suggesting how you need a major life change and the steps to achieve it. You are told you need a big changeover if you are undergoing a major upheaval, or feeling depressed, or going through a bad relationship! And how do you go about that? You are exhorted to recruit your inner warrior, develop a compelling vision, and forgive self-judgement or to follow your passion.Easier said than done. The very idea of upturning and changing your life completely sounds ridiculous and scary enough never to be attempted. But, what if you were to understand that no big changes are needed? All one is looking for after all is some happiness and peace and a measure of recognition. There is no need to overhaul your life or to chuck your present lifestyle for a new one. You just need to make small adjustments to realign your lives on the desired path!Think of the little things you can easily do in order to make yourself feel better. Start small, and the sense of achievement you feel in meeting the small goals will prod you along to the next goalpost, and the next, till without realizing you have arrived!For instance, if you are convinced that you need to be more outgoing, do not panic and enroll for personality grooming classes! Just practice to smile, chat more and show interest in people. Feeling stifled in a relationship? Talking about it may resolve the issue. Irritated because you have no time for yourself? Just a small change in your routine may do the trickAdvised to go on a diet and exercise? Dont jump to the other end of the spectrum and starve yourself! Weight lost through drastic measures has an uncanny ability to jump right back. Try the smaller stuff. Go slow on sugar, white flour, bread and rice and give up fried food. Start eating smaller meals at regular intervals.For exercise, do not start a punishing regimen that you will never be able to keep up. Start walking even if for just 20 minutes a day. Make sure you move around as much as you can. Make your own bed every morning; it gives you a surprising sense of purpose and a boost to the rest of your day. Get up from your desk every few minutes just to stretch, take a short walk or even just stand around. Get off the elevator a floor earlier rather than attempt the entire flight of stairs.These little changes in your everyday routine will seem easy to adopt. Soon you will start feeling lighter and more alert, and this in itself will be incentive enough for you to figure what needs to be done next. All you need to do is set the ball rolling in the right direction and it will soon pick up enough momentum to propel you to the desired goal. However, focus and dedication are critical.The idea of meditation always scared me because I thought of it as a one-hour exercise trying to chase away recalcitrant thoughts. Till I realized that even a few minutes of zoning out and focusing on a symbol or a sound achieves the desired effect. And I needed to just make a small adjustment in my routine!The same principle can be good at work too. Rather than fretting about the bigger goal, break it into smaller goalposts and focus on one at a time. Quit trying to please everyone; focus on work and ensure the key person knows it.It does indeed make sense to sweat the small stuff rather than run scared of bigger changes! What is most important is to know what you want and then focus on the small change that will help you get there!"
5a07873b9855b76bf13cad72,Punjab’s water stress foregrounds tough policy trade-offs,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/cash-flow/punjabs-water-stress-foregrounds-tough-policy-trade-offs/,2017-08-03,"A reply by Water Resources minister Uma Bharti to a Lok Sabha question on groundwater depletion foregrounds tough trade-offs facing Indias policymakers.According to Bharti, an assessment of groundwater resources and usage showed that 16% of 6,584 assessment units in India are overexploited.A table which accompanies her reply provides state-wise data. Here, Punjab stands out for the magnitude of overexploitation. If 16% of assessed units in India are overexploited, the figure rises to 76% in case of Punjab. It is the most water stressed Indian state.Punjab also happens to be Indias most important state in providing food security. It is a massive contributor to the cereal-dependent public distribution system.One way of looking at it is Indias food security is heavily dependent on a state which is perhaps the worst placed in terms of water stress. Punjabs impressive agricultural production is partly an outcome of its irrigation coverage. About 98.5% of Punjabs crop area is irrigated, mainly on account of groundwater irrigation. Without this supply of water, Punjab will surely not be a large contributor to rice procurement by state agencies.It is not just quantity where Punjabs farmers score. According to Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices, Punjab has the highest yield in paddy among states.This is where a policy maker will face difficult trade-offs.The easy solution will be to dramatically bring down electricity subsidies which will force farmers to divert to a crop which consumes less water than paddy. While this process takes place, how is it possible to guarantee that other states will offset the loss of rice procurement in Punjab?Without a simultaneous offset in rice procurement, there will be other complications such as a revival of cereal inflation. Introducing a rational pricing policy to preserve groundwater is essential. But the sequence of steps needed to get there without collateral damage is very difficult."

There are fears that if rains are insufficient, 25-30% of the total area under cultivation may have to be resown, said an official from the agriculture department.Officials say Gondia, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Beed are some of the worst-affected districts, which have received barely 50-75% of the average rainfall.Sowing has been completed on nearly 65% of the 139.64 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state  which adds up to 82 lakh hectares.""There has been an issue with sowing due to the long, dry spell and crops like soyabean, moong, tur, rice and sugarcane will be hit. Cotton which is grown on a large scale in the state will not see a lot of problems as it sustains on the moisture of the soil, but if the dry spell continues then cotton too will be affected,"" said a senior official.Resowing, if required, will increase the grower's input costs on seeds and labour and have a bearing on financial planning for the season ahead.Principal Secretary, Bijay Kumar said field officials are undertaking surveys to ascertain the damage. Relief measures will be undertaken based on their findings. ""We have ample supply of seeds ready. Whenever there is a requirement for resowing, the cost of the seeds are borne by the government. The same policy will be applicable in this case too,"" said Kumar who will himself undertake a statewide tour starting on Thursday.Officials said the state government has sent out advisories to farmers asking them to start sowing only next week and wait for clarity from the Indian Meterological Department.The agri department is also trying to convince farmers to sign up for the state's crop insurance scheme. ""After a good monsoon last year and with prediction of surplus rainfall this year, the tendency to pay premium for the insurance scheme is not there. And if rains fail this year and if they have not signed up for the insurance then they will not get anything,"" said another official."

With the new varieties yielding 800 kilograms per acre, consuming less water and withstanding yellow dermatology disease, the research centre has begun to popularise it among the farmers.VBN 6 and VBN 8 have been developed with resistance to yellow mosaic disease as a replacement for ADT 5 blackgram which was predominantly grown during the summer irrigated season. Similarly, VBN 6 has been inculcated with two to three blooming nature as that of ADT 5. The new variety would also be eligible for government subsidy related to pulses and solar-powered pumping system.Since ADT 5 variety was used by farmers for the last 10 years, the state government had stopped distributing subsidy. Following the repeated appeals made by the farming community for a new improved variety, the scientists in Vamban developed VBN 6 and 8, a senior faculty from NPRC said. As the new variety blackgram is eligible for getting subsidy from the government with high yielding potentiality, more farmers have come forward to cultivate the variety, he added.Progressive farmer Chandran said that he had obtained 800 kg per acre as yield by cultivating VBN 6 blackgram. The variety has multi-blooming nature as that of ADT 5 and is resistant to yellow mosaic virus disease, he said.Addressing the gathering, vice-chancellor of Tamil Nadu Agriculture University K Ramasamy requested the farmers to select and cultivate newly released high yielding yellow mosaic disease resistant varieties. Farmers should come forward to use solar powered pumping system for irrigation which are available under subsidy scheme from the government, he said.""The increase in cost of inputs and reduction in the price of farm produce are big challenges to the farmers.

Gautam added that the IRRI will help introduce new varieties of rice, increase production and encourage rice cultivation in countries like Africa where it is not produced.The IRRI consultant explained there are some states in the eastern parts, including eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa which failed to benefit from the Green Revolution as these parts had no irrigation facilities like in Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh.

But after the Constitution was amended and all other states started joining the new tax regime, we could not be out of GST,"" said Veeramani.The issue was raised by DMK MLAs E Ramar and J L Eswarappan during a debate on commercial taxes department. ""GST stinged traders as well as consumers like a scorpion after it was implemented. Many products and services which were out of the tax regime are now under GST. Some of them attract 28% tax,"" said Ramar. He said even pencils, pens and other commonly used products are taxed at high rates.Ramar said one of the reasons for poor tax receipt in Tamil Nadu was the existing vacancies in the commercial taxes department. He also faulted the government for not appointing a full-time commissioner for commercial taxes.Eswarappan said even rice was taxed if it was packed in bags. ""Traders and consumers are equally hit. Though GST is there in several other countries, only in India one finds five different tax slabs under GST. Consumers and traders are confused over the new tax system,"" said Eswarappan.He criticised the government for not educating traders and other stakeholders before GST was implemented. ""When VAT was implemented in 2007-08, DMK government under M Karunanidhi had 28 meetings with various stakeholders, but it is not known whether such meetings were held before rolling out GST,"" said Eswarappan.Veeramani as well as finance minister D Jayakumar said it was only due to TN's opposition that several products and services were not taxed. TN also forced the Centre to agree on allocating compensation to states that would lose revenue after the introduction of GST. ""It is only after implementing GST that we came to know about the tax rate on various products and services. Since July 1, several stakeholders are meeting us as they meet you. All these will be raised in the next GST council meeting in August,"" said Veeramani."

Tonnes of rice are being smuggled on a daily basis through Vellore, Tiruvallur and Krishnagiri districts in northern Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka and from Kanyakumari, Tirunelveli and Coimbatore to Kerala. Heavy presence of check posts on inter-state borders has not deterred the well-oiled network of rice smugglers who have started relying more on trains for the crime.In 2016, civil supplies CID officials seized 250 tonnes of smuggled rice and arrested 293 people in Coimbatore. But in 2017, in the first seven months alone, officials have seized around 210 tonnes of rice. Officials say it is not an indication of a spurt in smuggling activities, but the result of an increased vigil by their teams. They, however, admit that the seized quantity is just a fraction of what is being smuggled. Our estimate is that we are able to catch only one fifth of the smuggled rice, says a civil supplies officer.As vehicles crossing the inter-state check posts often come under scanner, smugglers have increasingly started using trains. Recently, flying squad officials of district supply office, Vellore, seized 2.2 tonnes of PDS rice while it was being smuggled in Kaveri Express and Lalbagh Superfast Express. The Katpadi-Tirupati Passenger, Bangalore Express, Sanghamitra Superfast trains, Kakinada Sarkar Express, Kacheguda Express and Pondicherry-New Delhi Express are the other trains used for smuggling ration rice.Kingpins of the racket engage women to smuggle 800kg to 1,200 kg of rice through trains. Women board unreserved compartments of night trains at Anvarthikhanpet, Sholinghur, Jolarpet and Arakkonam stations in Vellore district and Perambur in Chennai. They keep the rice bags in the toilet or under the seats, officials said. Suburban trains from Chennai travelling up to Sullurpeta or Arakkonam and Tiruttani are also used for transporting smuggled rice. Around 60% of the people arrested in the PDS rice smuggling are women, say sources in the Railway Protection Force (RPF).Around eight tonnes of PDS rice are smuggled on a daily basis. But only 10% of the smuggled rice is being seized by law enforcing agencies like government railway police (GRP), civil supplies-CID and district supply office, says a GRP personnel.Rice is also smuggled out of Chennai to neighbouring districts via Tondiarpet, Perambur, Korukkupet, Ennore and Central and Egmore railway stations. Due to tight vigil at Central and Egmore, suburban stations are used to load or unload rice. Every year, around 200 cases are filed by the food cell department in stations across Chennai division. The seizure is in the range of 50- 60 tonnes of PDS rice per year in the division, say officials.Palakkad civil supplies officials say close to 30 tonnes of rice smuggled from Coimbatore were seized by them in June alone.A new app launched by the state government to prevent syphoning of PDS products from the 34,000-odd ration shops in the state has also failed to curb smuggling. Card holders would get an SMS if a billing was made in their name. But activists say the SMS system is yet to become fully effective because of delay in issuance of smart cards. The government should start e-tracking the movement of PDS rice from main godowns in district to shops. In the shops, transparent stock details should be maintained, says T Sadagopan, president of Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre.(With inputs from A Subburaj and Siddharth Prabhakar)"

An old gramophone peeks out from the corner, presumably playing Engelbert Humperdinck or Cliff Richard.One rarely meets Anglo-In dians of this ilk anymore in Pune where this feisty community is fast dwindling result of mixed marriages and emigration. TOI revisited the few that remain, estimated at around 1200, and their quaint ways of life -jitterbug jigs and pound parties, ginger wine and ball curry , Engelbert and gramophones -some of them mere reminiscences for this mixed breed of British and Indian descent rooted in the country's colonial past.""You can sum us up in one word, `fun-loving'. Our lives were and still is about work, a few laughs and dance nights,"" says Byrd, 68, a retired accountant who teaches English to foreigners in Pune. ""It's our mother tongue and we have good command over it."" Something that held the community in good stead and fetched them teaching and secretarial jobs in post-Independent India.Even as the sun set on Britain's reign , Anglo-Indians with their mix of customs and complexions remained caught in its own challenges. ""Until the 40s, there was a colour di vide among us too - darkies and fairies,"" remembers BW Roberts, 88, who belonged to the first batch of college-going Anglo-Indians in free India and former principal of the 153year-old Bishop's School, a minority-run Anglo-Indian School in the lush green cantonment area of Pune that has been the scene for all their community celebrations - Tambola, May Queen Ball, barbeque and Elvis impersonator nights. The easy-going Anglo-Indi an loved his peg and his party.Doing the waltz, jive and foxtrot came easy to their nimble toes especially at pound parties, a potluck gathering where everyone brought a pound of chops, chips and cutlets for sharing.It was common to find strains of Jim Reeves, Tony Bennett and Elvis Presley wafting around areas like Fatimanagar, Wanowrie, Kondhwa, Camp, Kalyani Nagar and Khadki which housed most of Pune's Anglo Indians. ""The gramophone was usually our first indulgent buy ,"" says Byrd. Not surprising that most of Pune's original rock-n-rollers were ""bugger"" and ""men"" spouting Anglo-Indians. ""We had an inherent ear for music.There was always music and guitars in the house with people breaking into impromptu jams. My dad too was a musician,"" says Chris Fonseca, a guitarist with some of the country's top bands. Football, basketball and athletics were Anglo-Indian sports staples.Not so much now. ""Perhaps because children are so busy with academics,"" Roberts reasons.Their love for the good life involved good food even as the beef ban in Maharashtra hurt their palate. Food habits they cultivated could be hard to define but not for an Anglo-Indian. ""A bit of this and a bit of that -essentially European food with Indian flavours,"" explains Victoria Robins. The names often explain the confluence 'jalfrezi', a curry to use up leftover roast lamb or beef; 'Mulligatawny', a rich soup with black pepper; 'salt meat', a big lump of beef marinated in salt and lime for weeks; and the yellow rice and ball curry , a must at Sunday lunch.But whether one was lunching with friends or family , dining etiquette was essential.There was no getting the cutlery wrong. ""Our parents made sure we came to the dining table properly dressed, not in nighties. Tables had to be laid with fork, knives and serviette.No elbows on the table, no talking while eating and waiting till everyone finished,"" recalls Venetia, a school teacher comfortable in her salwar kurta unlike the 1920s to the 70s when women wore fluffy skirts and dresses in lace and taffeta. ""Gradually we adopted the attire of the region. But on Christmas and New Year's Eve, the older ladies still dress up in gowns with their hair in ringlets.""Beer and Beatles-loving Rose Seymour , 78, is the oldest serving Anglo-Indian nurse in Pune. ""Seventy-five per cent of Pune's nurses in the 60s were Anglo-Indians. Now, barely ,"" she rues.The community may be in the twilight zone but Darryl Pounde, of Pune's Anglo-Indian Association refutes it.""We're spread far and wide but people often return to connect with their roots because without India there would be no Anglo-Indians,"" he says."
5a0795229855b76bf13cb384,Food and civil supplies dept deleted 80k ration cards in April,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/food-and-civil-supplies-dept-deleted-80k-ration-cards-in-april/articleshow/59656036.cms,2017-07-19,"Mysuru: An en masse deletion of ration cards by the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department - nearly 80,000 cards that were not linked to Aadhaar were deleted across the seven taluks in Mysuru - has saved the exchequer from a monthly sum of nearly Rs 1.68 crore. The drive against unlinked ration cards was initiated in April by then Mysuru assistant commissioner CL Ananda, who was given additional responsibility as the in-charge deputy director for food and civil supplies department.Documents available with TOI indicate that the drive was started by Ananda on April 1, who managed to crack down on 80,000 fake ration card holders in the span of one month. Although it has been three months since the drive was held, none of the affected members has approached the food and civil supplies department seeking redressal, thereby raising suspicions over their Below Poverty Line (BPL) status.All BPL card holders are entitled to seven kilos of free rice each month. Even at the government's nominal prices, rice is sold at Rs 30 per kg. Consequently, the distribution of free rice to those not eligible for the benefit thus resulted in a loss amounting to Rs 1.68 crore.Ananda initiated the drive following the transfer of food and civil supplies deputy director K Rameshwarappa from Mysuru during the bypolls to the Nanjangud and Gundlupet assembly segments. Rameshwarappa was transferred after the BJP filed a complaint with the Election Commission of India (ECI). The ECI subsequently issued directions to the government to transfer the official during the polls.It was also learnt during the drive that, of the seven taluks in the district, KR Nagar taluk was receiving 42,000 litres of kerosense, while the other taluks were being supplied just 80 to 100 litres. The department immediately identified defaulters in KR Nagar and Periyapatna, who had LPG connections, but had been availing of kerosense at subsidised prices. Nearly 18,000 kerosene cards were annulled in the two taluks in April.It was also uncovered that nearly 3.45 lakh litres of palm oil, and 487 quintals of greengram, which were stored in godowns, were on the verge of expiry. To ensure that these commodities reached the rightful beneficiaries, Ananda wrote to the secretary of the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs secretary Harsh Gupta in May requesting him to distribute them to government hostels and schools towards mid-day meal schemes.However, the government appointed Rameshwarappa as deputy director for the department in Mysuru, citing administrative reasons. Ananda, meanwhile, was transferred to North Karnataka. Rameshwarappa told TOI, ""Nearly 19 lakh ration cards have been linked to Aadhaar in Mysuru. The department has received nearly 94,700 applications for new ration cards, which are being reviewed. We are expecting nearly three lakh new ration card holders in the next few months."""

The season won't be complete without the age-old tradition of having Karkidaka kanji , the bitter rice gruel mixed with herbs, that surprisingly is a hit with the youth too albeit in refreshed avatars.The special preparation, which was said to aid digestion and boost immunity, has been getting a modern twist - thanks to the ready mix varieties and food experimentation.Kochi-based food blogger Parvathy B Nair has been experimenting with different varieties of the Karkidakam kanji. ""It's not convenient for people or students to pack kanji to the office or school. So, the basic idea was to make it so that it's easier to carry in a lunch box,"" she says.For this purpose, the entrepreneur says that she's retained the navara rice, which is used for preparing the gruel, and use the herbs to make side dishes. ""I make thoran using the ingredients such as thalu (wild colocasia leaves), takara (cassia tora sickle pod), choriyanam (tragia involuvrate) and cow pea leaves - all of which are basically used in the karikada kanji,"" she says, adding that other forms such as smoothies and baked snacks using the items of ready mix karikidaka kanji kit too find many takers.Supporting her, wellness consultant Linda Rakesh from Thripunithura says, ""Right now, people are more conscious about their health and so they often seek healthy recipes."" As it's become tough to prepare karikadaka kanji like in the past, because it takes time to gather all the ingredients, Linda says more people now opt for the ready-mix packets that are supplied by health centres.Allaying fears that these may contain harmful substances as against the old style kanji, Dr K Madhusoodhanam, from Thrissur, says, ""The kanji can be made using different ingredients - upto 24 herbs were used in the past. Most of the ready mix varieties use ingredients which are available easily.""Each ingredient and the resulting version of the gruel will have its own benefit, he says. ""For instance, a kanji with a kanjithoova is good for healing external bruises while those with deshapushpam will improve your immunity and digestion,"" says the Ayurveda doctor.Dr Madhusoodhanan explains that homemade varieties of kanji are prepared using the juice of the crushed ingredients. ""This makes it more bitter, and hence people add jaggery to make it palatable for kids while the elders prefer the bitter taste. These days even kakkumkaya is used to make it more tasty,"" he says.Another popular version is the oushada kanji, which is now included in health packages for tourists. ""This variety uses all 24 herbs and hence is more beneficial as it improves the overall health,"" he says.For Thiruvananthapuram-based techie Anu Thulasi, who has Karkidaka kanji whenever she has digestive problems, says that this season is the best to have the rice porridge. ""I have it whenever I am ill as it's available at a health cafe in Thiruvananthapuram. However, in Karkidakom, the gruel tastes less bitter because the herbs are fresh,"" she says.The availability of the ready-mix variety throughout the year also reflects the lifestyle of the people. ""Earlier, people used to have the gruel only once a month and that was enough to detox their bodies. However, these days, regular detox is required because of the bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle,"" Linda says."

After informing them in advance, the employees organized peaceful dharnas outside their houses, attracting attention of neighbours and passers-by. The embarrassed defaulters finally came out and promised to settle their dues by Friday. The employees promised to adopt the same method for other defaulters as well.The UBI's Malda region office is in-charge of all branches in Malda, North and South Dinajpur districts. The regional headquarters also has a staggering NPA of Rs 134 crore. According to an official, more than 60% of this is owed by rich merchants and affluent entrepreneurs.""We served many notices to them but they paid no heed,"" said UBI chief regional manager A N Roy. Even legal notices weren't of much help. Officials realized that these defaulters could repay their loans easily but were not in the mood to do so. This was when they came up with the idea to strike where it would hurt the most - their social standings.In the morning, residents of Mangalbari witnessed a unique sight. Smartly-dressed bank officers stood in dharna in front of a well-to-do neighbour's house with placards. On enquiry, they were told that there are two defaulters who owe the bank Rs 60 lakh and Rs 20 lakh respectively. One of them owns a three-storeyed house, three rice mills and multiple vehicles.""Within an hour the businessman emerged and assured us that he would repay his loan on Friday. The issue that had been dragging on for nearly a year, was resolved within an hour. After the assurance, we left the spot,"" a bank officer said. The results were the same outside the other defaulter's house as well.""We shall continue to adopt this method with other defaulters,"" Roy added. While some bank officials said that similar methods have been adopted in the past in south Bengal, one of them said that financial institutions are going through severe financial crisis and have to adopt new strategies. ""We aren't receiving the kind of support from the government like before. In fact, we have got our backs against the wall and won't hesitate to go to any length to recover NPAs,"" he said."

However, the AP team expressed its inability to supply rice at that rate.Both the parties agreed to discuss the issue of price at another meeting.When the Kerala team asked for the supply of Guntur chillies, Pulla Rao suggested that the issue could be discussed after the deal over rice is finalised.Earlier, deputy CM K E Krishna Murthy told the media that Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had called him 20 days back seeking supply of rice from AP which has a lot of demand particularly during the Onam season which falls in September. He then took it to the notice of CM N Chandrababu Naidu who responded positively.Meanwhile, Pulla Rao warned rice shop owners of strict action if they sell pre-packed items at two prices post GST.

Nothing of this has been reaching Darjeeling town for the last three weeks.And, with ration shops closed since June, 670 ration dealers in Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts have their entire June allocation of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrain stacked in their now-shut stores. ""Some of the dealers tried to open ration shops but stopped after they were thrashed by bandh supporters,"" a worried state food and civil supplies minister Jyotipriya Mullick said in Kolkata on Thursday. ""This crisis is entirely man-made,"" he added.It's not that food supplies have stopped entirely. But the response of residents to the trickle that is reaching the Hills reveals their desperation: there was a stampede-like situation when small trucks laden with vegetables reached Darjeeling over the last weekend. The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, now spearheading the demand for a separate state, arranged for the vegetables to be distributed among people, well aware that a section was running out of patience. People mobbed these vehicles and GJM supporters had their hands full controlling the crowds.Susma Giri ran behind a truck, holding on to her two-year-old daughter tight in one hand and having a carry-bag in the other. The truck, laden with sacks of cabbage, reddish and squash, came to a halt in front of Darjeeling Municipality, where more than 200 men and women were already in the queue. Giri grudgingly took her position right at the back and waited for her turn.""There is no food at home. Give me some more vegetables,"" Sarita Lepcha , a homemaker who had queued up for two hours, cried out to the men on the lorry handing out the vegetables.The business community in Darjeeling is too scared to speak out but traders confirm not a single lorry containing edibles has been allowed to come up from Siliguri, the primary feeder to the Hills, since the GJM-sponsored total shutdown started on June 15. ""Every single shop is shut in Darjeeling and other towns. Trucks are not being allowed to cross Darjeeling More in Siliguri. There is no stock of food in Darjeeling,"" a senior office-bearer in the association of rice wholesalers of rice in Beech Gali said.The administration says it is monitoring the situation but there is very little it can do. ""Darjeeling has a monthly requirement of 9,550 tonnes of foodgrains, which caters to 8.75 lakh people. This translates to 11 kg of rice or wheat per head every week. We supplied the entire June-July quota by July 11. We have 52,000 tonnes of foodgrains stored in over 50 warehouses in Siliguri to meet further requirements. We have ensured that supplies have reached the three warehouses off Darjeeling,"" minister Mullick said in Kolkata. ""But there is very little we can do if the agitators are bent on inconveniencing the very people on whose behalf they claim to speak,"" he added.Chowkbazar near Darjeeling railway station is the main hub from where vegetables and edibles reach smaller towns like Sonada, Ghum, Tung Sung, Singmari, Aluabari, Patleybas and Dali. But the indefinite shutdown has cut off the entire supply chain and the food shortage in kitchens is gradually reflecting on the streets in the Hills."

Some have told of increasing hunger in Rakhine as well as of more mob attacks on Muslim villagers.Despite growing international condemnation of the refugee crisis, the military campaign is popular in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya, and for Muslims in general, and where Buddhist nationalism has surged in recent years.The party of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi took the first step towards trying to ease animosity with inter-faith prayers at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, Christians and others.Thousands of people packed the stands of the stadium, with Buddhist monks, Hindus, Christian nuns and Muslim men with beards and caps listening to religious leaders who took turns to appeal for friendship.Be free from killing one another, be free from torturing one another, be free from destroying or demolishing one another, the chief Buddhist monk of Yangon, Iddhibala, told the crowd.Stepping off the podium, he shook hands with Muslim leader Hafiz Mufti Ali.Citizens should collaborate in friendship and work for the country, Ali said, adding: Freedom of life, freedom of education, freedom of religion, it is absolutely necessary for the country to fulfil all these rights.The Rohingya had pinned hopes for change on Suu Kyis party but it has been wary of Buddhist nationalist pressure. Her party did not field a single Muslim candidate in the 2015 election that it swept.Rohingya are not classified as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so are denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity.Regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, they face restrictions and discrimination and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists in Rakhine, and by much of the wider population.The militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) who launched the Aug. 25 attacks that triggered the latest spasm of violence are demanding full citizenship rights and recognition as an indigenous community.Ceasefire endsA one-month ceasefire the insurgents called in September in order, they said, to ease aid deliveries to Rakhine, expired at midnight on Monday, but authorities said there was no sign of any new attacks.The government rebuffed the ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists.Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing. It says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them ARSA terrorists.Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA appeared only capable of hit-and-run raids and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army.The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though their ceasefire was ending.Reports of food shortages in Rakhine will add to the urgency of calls by aid agencies and the international community for unfettered humanitarian access to the conflict zone.Villagers said food was running out because rice crops were not ready for harvest and authorities had shut village markets and limited food transport, apparently to cut supplies to the militants.The government has cited worry about food as a main reason people have cited for leaving, but a senior state government official dismissed any suggestion of starvation.Among those fleeing were more than 30 people on a boat that capsized off Bangladesh on Sunday. Twenty-five people drowned, 13 of them children, police said."

The probe revealed that farmers showed their agricultural land as commercial property and got huge compensations. Rudrapur special land ceiling officer was suspended.The social welfare department released scholarships in the name of fake students in the Terai region and Haridwar.Investigations are on into the multilayered rice scam. Investigators found government officials in collusion with rice mill owners allegedly did not follow the rules set for paddy purchase, forcing farmers to sell their produce at rates lower than the minimum support price.The millers then sold the rice to the government at minimum support price, making a profit of Rs 400 per quintal. The vehicles used for transporting the rice from mills to Food Corporation of India godowns did not carry the registration number in challans.Linking the scams to regional imbalance, social activist Chandrahsekhar Kargeti said, Plain areas have been the focus of development; hill regions have been neglected, but Terai has witnessed development and concentration of funds. Real estate boom has also led to corruption.Kargeti, a lawyer at the Uttarakhand high court, said a system of checks and balances did not exist in the functioning of officials in the region. There is a nexus among officials here and there is a mindset against transparency, which has spawned the scams.Postings in the Terai area have been lucrative for officials because of the funds available, social activist Beena Joshi said. The government must focus on all areas for development so that such scams do not occur in future, she said."

We are surviving only on homegrown potatoes and rice as no supply of essentials like wheat, salt or onion, are reaching the village due to the road blockage, Digar Singh Pharswan, a villager said.Meanwhile, Pithoragarh District Magistrate C Ravishankar said supply department officers have not informed the administration about the dire food situation in the area.I have ordered an inquiry against the officers concerned and also instructed the PWD to complete damaged portion of the route in one weeks time, the DM said.According to the locals, at least five families have left the village due to non-availability of ration for the last two months and the thin possibility of the route being repaired in the near future.The Food Grain Inspector (FGI) at Madkot, who is responsible for supplying ration to high-altitude villages in this part of Munsiyari, acknowledged that ration was not dispatched to the village after July this year.No ration dealer from Golpha has come to lift PDS ration after July this year as it cannot be carried beyond Danibagar bridge due to blockage of the route to the village. Even mules cannot take ration to the village, FGI Madkot Jagdish Singh Rathod said.However, he said, the godowns at Madkot have enough ration to be supplied to the high altitude villages under the PDS system.The onus for repairing the road and bridges on the 10-km stretch rests on the district administration and the PWD. As far as we are concerned we have enough stock in our godowns in Madkot to cater to the needs of the people residing in high altitude villages, District Supply Officer Manoj Kumar Burman said."

The BJP had in a similar manner raised the issue of alleged impropriety by Congress president Sonia Gandhis son-in-law Robert Vadra.We will walk that extra mile to expose the true face of the BJP. We will take this issue to each household and every nook and corner of the country. Justice may be poetic. The jury is out.The people of India will decide, Congress spokesperson Tom Vadakkan said.The party sought Shahs resignation as the BJP chief till the probe was over in line with past precedents, citing BJP veterans LK Advani and Nitin Gadkari as examples. Apart from demanding an inquiry into the matter by sitting Supreme Court judges, it also wanted the Prime Minister to break his silence on the issue and immediately sack Shah.On Monday, the Congress held news conferences on the controversy in 12 cities across the country. While Anand Sharma held the fort in Delhi, Randeep Singh Surjewala and Sachin Pilot attacked the BJP in Jaipur.Raj Babbar raised the issue in Lucknow, RPN Singh in Ranchi, Rajni Patil, Pawan Khera abd Bhupesh Baghel were deputed to Raipur, Ajoy Kumar and Prasad Harichandan to Bhubaneswar, Gaurav Gogoi to Kolkata, Ripun Bora, Tarun Gogoi and Debbrat Saikia address the press conference in Guwahati, Prithviraj Chavan and Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil in Mumbai, Jairam Ramesh in Ahmedabad, Virbhadra Singh, Ranjeeta Ranjan and Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu in Shimla.On Tuesday, Babbar, Pritam Singh and Indira Hridayesh will address a news conference in Dehradun, Deepak Babaria and Arun Yadav in Bhopal, RPN Singh and Ashok Tanwar in Chandigarh, M Veerappa Moily in Mangalore, Surjewala and Nilesh Awasthi in Jabalpur.The Youth Congress is also organising a protest on the issue on Tuesday. We demand CBI and ED investigations on the matter. We also demand resignation of Amit Shah and want the PM to come out and give a statement on the issue, Youth Congress spokesperson Amrish Ranjan Pandey said.In the past, the Congress had sought to put the BJP on the mat by demanding the resignations of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and his Chhattisgarh counterpart Raman Singh over a multi-crore exam-rigging scandal, better known as Vyapam, and the rice scam respectively.It had also demanded the resignations of external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhra Raje for helping former IPL chief Lalit Modi get travel documents in the UK.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had launched an investigation against Modi in 2010 following the allegations of misconduct, indiscipline and financial irregularities, and banned him for life in 2013 after a committee found him guilty of these charges. He later moved to London.The Congress had also attacked the NDA government over the escape of liquor baron Vijay Mallya. He had left India in March last year after defaulting on repayment of loans worth several hundred crores that Kingfisher Airlines, now defunct, owed to banks.The party sought to Link the escape of Mallya and Lalit Modi to Modis failure to deliver his poll promise to bring back black money stashed abroad, alleging that the government had allowed them to flee the country and swindle thousands of crores of public money."

Congress has faced many allegations of corruption. Have they ever filed a criminal defamation or a Rs 100 crore civil defamation suit. Why could they not gather the courage to file such a suit? Shah asked at a programme organised by Aaj Tak channel here.Jay, he said, has filed a defamation suit and asked for an inquiry (by approaching the court) as had the BJP.As far as the company is concerned, it has not done business worth a rupee with the government. It has not got government land worth a rupee, it has not got any government contract worth even a rupee.The company has not taken commission like in the case of Bofors, Shah said, referring to Bofors gun pay-off scandal that had rocked the then Congress government in the 1990s.The company, he added, dealt in commodities like rice and millets.They are saying that the turnover of the company was Rs 80 crore, but they are not showing that it incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 crore. This is a high volume low profit business. Where is money laundering in it? Shah asked.Replying to a query on the loan given to the company, Shah said, You have to understand first that it was not a loan, but a letter of credit. We were given credit to lift material against cash deposits. Jays cash was lying in the bank and we have paid the loan with interest.The Congress has demanded a judicial inquiry into the matter and removal of Amit Shah as BJP president.The BJP has rejected the charges against its chiefs son, who has termed the report false, derogatory and defamatory.On October 9, he filed a criminal defamation suit in a metropolitan court in Ahmedabad against seven respondents, including the author of the article and editor of The Wire.The Congress raked up the issue during its recent campaigns in Gujarat, where elections are due in December.Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi repeatedly raised the issue during his roadshow in the state."

That is the real synergy we have with ASEAN,"" Indian Ambassador to Philippines Jaideep Mazumdar told PTI.The US, France and Japan have been pitching for a larger role by India in the strategically key Indo-Pacific region where China has been trying to increase its military presence.Mr Majumdar said terrorism is going to be one of the issues that will be discussed not only during the ASEAN summit but also at the East Asia summit. He said several documents are going to be adopted with an aim to contain terrorism including one on stopping money laundering for the purpose of terrorism.While ASEAN summit is likely to focus more on trade and investment related issues, leaders at the East Asia Summit are expected to delve deep into issues relating to maritime security, terrorism, non-proliferation and migration.Apart from the 10 ASEAN Member states, East Asia Summit includes India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Russia.PM Modi will address the ASEAN-India and East Asia summits on Tuesday.

India's investment in ASEAN during the same period has been more than USD 40 billion.India's proposal to host an international conference on countering radicalisation may also be discussed during the deliberations at Manila as New Delhi is now looking at finalising the dates for the conclave.Prime minister Modi will also participate in the ASEAN business and investment summit as well as a meeting of leaders of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).The RCEP, comprising 10-member ASEAN bloc and six other countries - India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand - is engaged in negotiations for a free trade pact.In his maiden visit to the Philippines as the prime minister, PM Modi will also attend a reception by the Indian community and visit the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and Mahavir Philippines Foundation."

This was decided during district paddy procurement meeting chaired by Collector Yamini Sarangi on Wednesday.Sources said the district requires minimum 40 rice millers to lift around 10 lakh quintals of paddy, but it has only two to three millers. Though last year, the administration had engaged 21 millers of nearby districts in the kharif paddy procurement season, it was not sufficient. As a result, many farmers failed to sell their produce and later they resorted to distress sale. In order to avoid a similar situation this year, the administration has taken several preventive measures.It was decided to open 100 paddy purchase centres under 96 Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) in the district. So far, 29,859 farmers have registered their names online to sell their produce. The State Government has fixed the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy at `1,550 for fair average quality (FAQ) and `1,590 for Grade-A.The Collector has been empowered to register the names of millers to participate in the paddy procurement and the administration will rope in millers from other districts to complete the task on time. The procurement centres will remain open from December 20 and the administration has already launched an awareness campaign for farmers to register their names, she added.Registrar of Cooperative Society Kulamani Padhi said online registration of farmers will continue till December 31. A committee comprising Revenue Inspector (RI), Village Level Workers (VLWs), Executive Officer of panchayat and farmers has been formed at block-level to expedite the work. Similarly, a squad, led by the Sub-Collector, has been tasked to check irregularities in lifting paddy, he added.Among others, Cuttack Central Cooperative Bank secretary Jayant Kumar Swain and other senior officials were present."

Kultali villager Gokul Naskar had realised early in life that honesty was not going to help him feed his 11brothers and sisters, a responsibility thrust on him with his father's death when he had barely turned 18. But a hundred violent robberies and several jail stints later, Daku Gokul (as he was better known) turned a sage and is now Gokul Maharaj of an ashram he set up in Kultali back in 2000.The eldest of 11 siblings, Gokul stepped into the underworld at 18. ""There were no jobs or any proper means of livelihood in Kultali when my father died in 1960. I had to look after the family and feed my brothers and sisters. I saw no other option but to take to dacoity as a livelihood,"" he said.For four long decades -from age 18 to 58 -Gokul lived alife looting gold jewellery, money , sacks of rice and just about anything of value. After his first dacoity , carried out after hiring a boat, Gokul felt the need to form a gang. He organized one with 12 members initially. The gang procured pipe guns and swords and made their own bombs as essential weapons to scare and, if necessary , maim or even kill, targeted victims.The gang that grew with time began carrying out a slew of violent robberies. After opening their account in their homeground of Kultali, the gang soon spread its tentacles to adjoining Basanti in the Sunderbans and even turned pirates, looting launch boats and fishing trawlers plying on the rivers separating islands of the delta. Emboldened by their success but not satisfied with the quantum of each loot in the Sunderbans, the gang ventured into the more dangerous underworld of Howrah and Hooghly .These forays landed Gokul and his partners-in-crime behind bars several times. The turning point for Gokul came after a betrayal by his associates towards the end of the last century . After their arrest, they named him as the mastermind for looting jewellery from a wedding hall in Kultali.""Though I was in no way involved in that mission, they planned and carried it out on their own,"" said Gokul, who nevertheless had to spend his longest stint (two years and 19 days) in jail ""for that false charge"". Once out of jail, he decided never to re-en ter the world of crime again and instead, bemit. Taking his came a hermit. Taking his `diksha' from Shri Shri Archana Burima of Jadavpur, Gokul returned to Kultali, where he collected funds to set up the Sri Sri Thakur Satyananda Krishna Kali Seva Ashram that also houses a temple and a school from Classes I-IV where volunteer teachers continue to teach alarge number of students.Local resident Shyamal Naskar said, ""This is a miraculous transformation. Gokul was always known as a notorious dacoit across Kultali and its adjoining islands. When he first set up the ashram, it was hard to believe how such a person could run a school. But over the years, hundreds of students from our area have attended the school."""

They also asked the commission to take steps to curb corruption prevalent in Tangedco. Other issues such as peak hour power tariff increase, decrease in solar power rates, power factor and LT industrial service connection were also discussed.SP Velliangiri, a resident of Peelamedu, said corruption is rampant in Tangedco and anyone who entered its offices for any work couldn't get them done without paying bribe.Former councillor M Krishnaswamy said as per RTI replies, several projects of the Tangedco are incomplete. ""The tender process in which Adani group was granted a 30-year contract for solar power generation should be reviewed and the rates checked,"" he said.Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Consumers Association K Ilango said, ""There are numerous steps taken by Tangedco which stifle the consumers who have to resort to litigation in order to get relief. In most of the cases, the courts have favored the consumers. The corporation should stop its anti-consumer approach so that consumers have confidence in its power utility and will support it in all respects. There are many aspects of the Electricity Act 2003 and the National Tariff Policy which are not followed in letter and spirit by the TNERC and .""President of the Coimbatore District Small Scale Industrial Association (CODISSIA) V Sundaram said if the government wanted the industries to survive, bribery should be removed. ""Better technologies should be adopted and efficiency in power generation should be improved,"" he said.K Natarajan, a farmer from Sulur, questioned the Tangedco for proposing to reduce the solar power tariff of consumers. ""Nearly 60 farmers in my village opted for it only to get the subsidy. But now if we won't get the rates promised, it will be a major setback,"" he said.Chairman of the Indian Wind Power Association K Kasturirangaiyan said that instead of increasing the tariff the corporation should first focus on clearing its outstanding bills and ensure monthly payments are made.

In the case of Amma canteens , the Greater Chennai Corporation's optimisation drive has not only brought the project's marginal revenue tumbling down but also affected the quality of food served.Though it took off to an impressive start, Amma canteens' decline over the past two years has been rapid. Of late, the brainchild of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa has been affected by, among other reasons, declining patronage, mounting debts and accusations of pilferage.While corporation officials maintain that Amma canteen is a not-for-profit initiative, the rate at which the local body's funds are drying up is forcing the administration to sit up and take notice. According to officials, the civic body will write off losses worth Rs 75.77 lakh incurred by the canteens during the one week period of mourning for J Jayalalithaa, between December 6 and 12, when the canteens supplied food free of cost.""On any given day, the best performing canteens in a ward can make up to one-third of the operating cost,"" said an official. Some of these ""best performing"" canteens are those operating in hospitals where the demand remains high.Under former mayor Saidai S Duraisamy, the corporation tried to double the number of canteens per ward. This move, coupled with falling demand, affected the quality of food served.In a recent review meeting, a senior state minister flayed the corporation for declining food quality. ""We received instructions to address the quality issues because the minister received several complaints,"" said a source.Why is the quality dipping? ""When it (canteens) was launched, we didn't hold back on purchasing flour and dal to make idlis,"" said an official. But this extravagance did not last. Declining patronage meant supply was exceeding demand. ""Procurement went down and the proportion was fiddled with. Any half decent cook will tell you that if the ratio of flour to dal is not maintained, then you can't make soft idlis,"" the official added.Optimisation has also brought to table the problem of pilferage. Senior officials admitted to receiving several complaints that canteen workers sell food to establishments outside. But this is happening so that ""targets can be met"", said a source. ""We have reduced the number of workers per canteen from the initial 18 to about 10 or 12 women now. There are instructions to roll back on workers in under-performing canteens,"" an official said.A canteen is judged under-performing when the required number of idlis, chapatis and rice items are not sold. Therefore, women workers sell the excess food to small eateries to meet the day's target. ""Else, her job is in jeopardy,"" the official added.The pressure to add footfalls has also dissolved the canteen's policy of giving away free food. When it launched, the day's leftover would be distributed among destitutes in the locality. ""Then people began to wait around the canteen's premise till it was late in the day to get free food. We have asked workers to dump excess food and not donate it,"" an official said.Apart from the mounting dues, sources in the civil supplies department, which supplies rice at one rupee per kilogram for the city's canteens, told TOI that it needs to increase the selling price as the present rate was not ""sustainable""."

The washermen said that the authorities would have to ensure proper water supply for the gana to make it a success in the wake of the water scarcity.The minister also inaugurated a bridge connecting Pallavan Nagar and Fatima Nagar constructed at a cost of Rs 3.60 lakhs. He said that all efforts were being made to improve the basic amenities in the region, including the replacement of the old drinking water pipelines at a cost of Rs 27.50 lakhs. Madurai corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar among others were present."

The registration under the Copyright Act or similar law abroad on or before May 15 will be treated as valid. While unbranded cereals pulses and several other food products do not attract GST, those sold in ""unit containers"" and sold under a registered brand name attract 5% levy. As a result, several brands, including some prominent basmati rice players, had deregistered some of the brands to avoid paying GST.Industry representatives have sought an end to the differential tax treatment, which the government is not keen on. The government believes that unbranded food products should not face a levy as they are consumed by the poor. While this had attracted the finance ministry's attention a couple of weeks ago, the issue has now been taken up at the level of the GST Council , headed by finance minister Arun Jaitley , with his counterpart from the states being members.On Saturday, Jaitley had said that the government had found a way to check avoidance but did not elaborate on the strategy. Sources said that the plan using May 15 as the cut-off date is expected to be finalised at the GST Council meeting next month."

The iron-efficient variety of paddy christened as 'Rajendra Neelam', has been developed with a view to coping with the problem of erratic rains in the state and the problem of water crisis. Aerobic rice is a production system in which especially developed rice varieties are grown in well-drained, non-puddled and non-saturated soils. With appropriate management, the system aims for yields of at least 4 to 6 tonne per hectare.Rajendra Neelam , the variety, which was found by Prof Lilanjay of plant reading and genetics department at RAU, have already been released by the State Variety Release Committee (SVRC) for Bihar and notified by the Central Variety Release Committee ( CVRC ), New Delhi.According to sources, the new variety of the crop is now being grown on two hectares of agricultural farm in RAU and is expected that 60 to 80 quintals of breeder seeds would be produced in October-November this year for marketing among farmers and government agencies. The seeds thus produced could be cultivated in June 2018, added sources.The overjoyed young scientist, Prof Lilanjay, told TOI that the new variety of aerobic rice has many advantages over conventional lowland irrigated type of cultivation. Since, direct seeding is recommended , nursery preparation , puddling and transplanting cost can be avoided.He, however warned that while opting for direct seeding, the soil should be in a saturated condition for the healthy sprouting of the seeds. ""Rajendra Neelam would be grown like wheat and maize,"" he added.The young professor also thanked the RAU research council which first recommended the proposal of research work on new variety of aerobic rice under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVP) in 2009, which witnessed the invention of the seeds in 2017.RAU VC RC Srivastava said, ""Farmers facing water scarcity would be hugely benefitted."""

His brother whispered that he had an accident after he and a few friends set out on their bikes in Bengaluru, where he was studying at the time.Doctors told Sujith's parents that he only had a 40% chance of survival; the spine had a T6 level injury while the skull had 18 fractures. Even if he survived, they warned, he would not be able to see with his right eye; he would only have a poor memory and would never walk again. ""They were wrong about the first two. And I am still trying to prove them wrong about the third,"" says Sujith, five years later, over the phone from his home in Mavelikkara. He is on a short visit from Dubai where he lives and studies. ""Because, the power to change any circumstance lies not with the doctors or other people but with the person himself.""The battle with fate continues even though the wheelchair-bound young man of 25 knows that as things stand today, modern medicine has no cure for his condition.He may be hoping against hope but he says that if he were to accept his 'fate', ""then I am done and would not progress"". ""Yes, there are moments when I think, 'Oh man, it is a spinal cord injury and nobody has discovered anything' and it does break me down. But I tell myself, there is a way, there has to be a way.""The thing about accidents is that while it happens in a flash, the full impact on a person's life unfolds bit by bit. ""It happened two weeks before my final B Com exams,"" he remembers. After about five weeks in the Bengaluru hospital where he had to undergo two major surgeries, he was moved to Vellore for rehabilitation. After a month there, Sujith and his mom came to their Mavelikkara home as the doctors said there was nothing else left to be done.Someone then told them about a vaidyan who was supposed to have worked wonders on many and they decided to give it a try. ""Just 20, I was into boxing and so active. I simply refused to accept that I was paralysed and was ready to do anything to get back on my feet."" But what followed was not massage but four months of daily torture. The vaidyan would apply oil and virtually hit him all over, promising that he would be alright soon. The pathyam (restrictive diet) was equally punishing; he was allowed wheat dosa and sugar in the morning and rice and bindi curry for lunch and nothing else.Not only did the diet sap him of all his strength but he also started developing pressure sores which turned septic when the quack applied oil on them. When he started shivering uncontrollably, they called in a nurse who was aghast at the infection level after doing a blood test. He was back in the ICU and the doctors then did a series of plastic surgeries to heal the wounds.""This was a big blow, to say the least. I recovered but had to face a lot of sympathy and negativity from everyone around me who kept saying that I can't do this or that while I wanted to be independent,"" he says. For instance, he wanted to sleep in his room upstairs but nobody liked the idea. But after wheeling himself to the steps, he climbed the 18 steps one by one before getting on to another wheelchair on top and went to his room. This routine was followed every single day of his stay in Kerala.His life brightened after his dad took him to Dubai. In one of the most crucial decisions, he signed up at a nearby gym and started exercising regularly though many were sceptical that he wouldn't be able to do much training. As his upper body gained strength, he got back his confidence too. If his mom took him there initially, he soon started going there all by himself. ""Today, I take the metro and go on my own,"" he says, proudly. He has even taken a plane journey without anyone to assist him. In 2015, he passed his B Com and is now studying for CFA and aspires to be an investment banker.Life took another turn when a radio jockey called Kris Fade saw one of the gym videos that he has been posting on Instagram and invited him to his show. Later, Kris also made him share his experiences at an event and the video got shared by many. He has already been invited by several corporates to speak to their employees.Is he on his way to become a motivational guru? ""Honestly, I do not know. But I tell people that if I can do what I have been doing from a wheelchair, for instance: fitness, they have no excuse not to do it. I also talk to them about the importance of not giving up,"" Sujith says.That's no empty boast. Besides hitting the gym every day, he also gets on to his cycle and his standing table where he tries to reactivate his legs. He has already tried acupuncture and chiropractic but in vain. ""Twenty years down the line, if I am alive and still on a wheelchair, then I'll know I have at least tried my 100%. Actually, I have just started."""

For more than 10 years now, this Chennaiite has not locked her apartment when she steps out  simply because she believes in the inherent goodness of people. I dont lock up anything in my house either, says Mahadevan, who works with two NGOs and is also one of the citys most vocal advocates during Octobers Daan Utsav, the countrys festival of giving.I started this practice years ago when it struck me one evening that I was leaving my children in the hands of my domestic help when I worked late but I would keep my valuables locked. I realised how little sense that made, says Mahadevan, who since then decided to unlock her doors and liberate herself.I own few valuables, hardly any jewellery, a little silver in the puja room maybe, but none of it is important. I cant carry it with me when I pass on, so why be so protective of it now, she says.Mahadevan has even taught her children not to lock the house. The only times we lock the house is when we are inside to maintain privacy but when we are out, the house is open, she says, adding that in the past decade since she started this practice, nothing has ever been stolen.On several occasions, things have been borrowed  but always returned. The apartment complex gardener for instance, has walked in to borrow a cycle pump when she was not at home. He knew where it was, so walked in and took it and came back the next day to return it. Thats when I even knew he had borrowed it, says Mahadevan. People have taken umbrellas, a former cook has taken rice and other staples because her husband had thrown her out of the house. I dont mind because I know people take things only when there is a need, says Mahadevan, who admits she doesnt carry her house keys, preferring to keep one with the security guard in case she finds herself accidentally locked out.While her domestic help found the situation rather confounding in the beginning, they have become accustomed to finding the house open. When madam is travelling I sometimes lock the house and leave because I get nervous for her, but she tells me not to, says Gita, who works in the Mahadevan household.Mahadevan says she also started leaving her house and everything in it unlocked because she does not believe in treating people based on their economic status. People lock up their valuables because they dont trust their domestic help who comes from, lets say, three notches below them in terms of financial status. How would the same people feel if they visited a person who was three times richer than them and locked up their valuables when the poorer guests arrived, says Mahadevan. When you learn to trust people, you will earn peoples trust, she adds."
5a0b40f79855b76bf13cd781,Why Indian farmers are distressed?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/info-nomics/why-indian-farmers-are-distressed/,2017-07-07,"On the eve of Uttar Pradesh (UP) election, Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi promised if Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wins then farm loan will be waived. BJP won, and the farm loan was waived-off. Sensing a case of political opportunism other states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and Karnataka  joined the farm loan waiver bandwagon. Farmers usually take loan to grow crops and to buy farm equipment. However, waiving off farm loan does not makes sense economically. The cause of farm distress lies somewhere else. We find reasons for a farmer not realizing the market price has to do with inefficient supply chain management, with farm distress getting augmented because of lower farm size holding and lack of irrigation facilities.Between 2012 and 2015 over 10,000 farmers committed suicide. Globally, India has second largest amount of arable land (next only to USA) but less than 35 per cent of this land comes under irrigation. Fluctuation in Indias agricultural output is due to supply-side shocks resulting from inadequate rainfall. Investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification, rain water harvesting, and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures. Additionally, other factors such as lack of reforms to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) Act, low bargaining power resulting from small farm size, and lack of warehousing facilities are also important.If various state governments can addresses these issues it will be beneficial for the farmers than waiving-off farm loan.In India, not only percapita agricultural income is low, and but at times it is not possible to sustain this low income. Also, agricultural output fluctuates more than the outputs of the industrial and services sectors. Official output data shows that during the period between 1991-1992 and 2013-2014, the coefficient of variation for agricultural output is 191.34, in comparison to 50.48 for industry, and 22.03 for services sector. This has led to unequal income distribution in India with rural-urban wage gap at 45 per cent in comparison to around 10 per cent for China and Indonesia. Some 850 million people still live in rural India. India has around 260 million people living in poverty and 80 per cent of them live in the countryside. Increasing and sustaining farm income is important if India wants to reduce poverty.Majority of farming(65 per cent) is rain-dependent. Volatile rainfall patterns lead to lower farm income. The median annual wage for a farmer in India is around US $290 which is barely two months minimum wage in Mumbai  the commercial capital of India. Because of lack of proper irrigation facilities, and weather insurance schemes, farmers typically get stuck to growing low-value crops such as rice and wheat, although there is an ever increasing demand for high-value stuffs such as fruits, and vegetables.Inefficient supply chain management equally contributes to farm distress.In India, if farmers are to sell their produce, they have two options. First is to sell directly to the government at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) in government outlets such as Food Corporation of India (FCI). MSP is the minimum price for a product established by the government and supported by payments to producers in the event of the market price falling below the specified minimum. The second option is to take their produce to the nearby government-designated mandi (market)where in front of state officers they can auction produce to the brokers. Mandis are the markets in smaller towns and cities to which farmers from nearby villages bring their agricultural produce to sell. There are around 7700 government designated mandis spread across India.Typically, MSP is higher than the market price, and one would assume that farmers gain every time the government announces the MSP. However, farmers are seldom able to sell their produce at the MSP. Every village does not have government outlets. FCI has a minimum presence in other major rice and wheat producing states like Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, and Orissa. Compared to all-India average of 7340 farmers suicide committed between 1995 and 2010, only West Bengal has higher suicides numbering 19331 between 1995 and 2010. The corresponding figures for Assam, Bihar, and Orissa are 3566, 1235, and 4460, respectively. And, even if there is a FCI outlet, the government may not procure if the farmers bring their produce before/after the dates of procurement. The farmers are at whim of local traders and are forced to sell their produce in the informal market.In India, as much as 83 per cent of the farmers are smallholders, with less than 1 hectare of landholding. These marginal farmers do not have access to cold storage, and have no option but to sell their produce to the middlemen or traders. It is impossible for them to get a space in the state storage facilities without any political connection, and also because the smaller farmers do not have wherewithal to book crate in warehouses. Lack of reforms in the APMC Act prevents these small farmers to sell directly to supermarkets, exporters, and agro-processors. This prevent contract farming which otherwise can entail better price realization for these farmers.Rather than waiving-off farm loans there is a need to rise above party-politics and ensure reforms in the APMC Act. According to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report move to waive-off farm loan is likely to cost various state exchequers a whopping $40 billion (around 2% of Indias GDP).Timely procurement through MSP and training for increasing agricultural productivity will also help. Indias neighbor China produces more wheat and rice in spite of having lesser area of land cultivated in comparison to India. Finally, instead of spending on blanket subsidies (favoring the big farmers), investment in rural infrastructure, such as electrification,rain water harvesting and building canals, will help to mitigate losses due to crop failures."

The policy aims at helping the farmers get higher return for their produce, Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout told mediapersons. The policy will be finalised in next two months.As there is very low or negligible consumption of chemical fertilisers in some areas of the State, the policy will provide support to the farmers of these areas for development of their organic farming and marketing of products.The Agriculture Minister said the State registered an all time record of food grain production last year, including 98.74 lakh tonne of rice. From an importing State, Odisha has now become the largest contributor to public distribution system and productivity has surpassed all-India average, he added.Fishery sector also witnessed a remarkable growth and the total fish production increased from 2.59 lakh tonne in 2000 to 5.21 lakh tonne in 2015-16 and 6.08 lakh tonne in 2016-17. Stating that steps have been initiated to create additional irrigation potential, the Minister said the mega lift irrigation scheme launched by the State Government in 2011-12 will create capacity to irrigate 65,000 hectares (ha) during 2017-18.The Agriculture Cabinet has decided to introduce mobile advisory service Krushi Paramarsha to provide necessary information to the farmers for improving their income. Rout said the Government has set up an extensive procurement system for rice by which payment is made directly to the bank accounts of farmers. With increase in the production of other crops like pulses and oilseeds, there is a need for such procurement system for pulses and oilseeds. He said steps will be taken in this regard in next procurement season."

I am willing to bring 1,000 farmers from other districts and let us fight till the end, he said.The relay fast was launched by the villagers and members of Anaithu Vivasayigal Padugappu Nala Sangam and Meenava Padugappu Koottamaippu on Saturday.Mr. Ayyakannu assured the farmers that he would lead a delegation of farmers to meet Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami if the authorities were bent upon establishing the proposed thermal power plant.The government could do nothing, ignoring the protests of the farmers, he said.He said Thiruvadanai block was the rice bowl of the district and the whole district would prosper if the State government linked Cauvery, Vaigai and Gundaru rivers.Nearly 25 TMC ft of flood water flowed waste into the sea every year and this quantum of water could be harvested if the rivers were linked, he said.The Chief Minister had given assurance to this project, he added.Former DMK Minister Suba. Thangavelan and his son and DMK district secretary Suba.Tha. Diwakaran were among those expressed solidarity with the farmers.R.

The farmers used to sow the seeds twice a year and it was reduced to once a year with the poor availability of water, he said.Palthoni is the endemic variety of Anakkara and its rice is a most preferred one for its unique taste, though the growth period and average production is less compared to the other rice varieties.An important feature of Palthoni is its large quantity of fodder compared to Uma or Jyothy'. Its straw grows high and cattle too prefer it.Mr. Joseph said that each family in Anakkara had one or two cows in addition to the bulls grown by them for ploughing the fields.The village was once considered a major centre of milk production, he said and added that with farmers abandoning rice cultivation, milk production too diminished.The total area of paddy is now confined to only 350 hectares of land, as per the official estimate. The effort is to sow paddy in shallow land and bring back the glory of Palthoni in Anakkara, he said.Sukumaran, another farmer said that Palthonis fame had crossed boundaries and many from outside had visited Anakkara to get the rice even at a higher price.The farmers have joined together to sow Palthoni in maximum hectares of land and the Agriculture Department has taken up the initiative to bring back rice cultivation to the area.A greenfield airport project was proposed at Anakkara nearly nine years back and the farmers were up in arms against the land takeover resulting in almost abandoning the project.A large area of paddy field was converted for other cultivation like tapioca and banana in addition to the new constructions took place on the converted land, said Mr. Sukumaran.The seeds were sown at the paddy field of Varghese Kulamalil on Saturday. The farmers say that the seedlings will be ready for transplanting in 25 days.The growth period of Palthoni is five months and by December the rice will be ready for harvest."

Vishwanath Bhat, convenor, BJP State Economic Cell, has said.Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, Mr. Bhat said that GST was a consumption-based taxation system and it would help ensure better collection of taxes in the coming days. Further, this uniform system of taxation would significantly bring down the cost of production.The cost of transportation too would come down as GST has done away with the check-post system. It would remove multiple taxation and help sell India-made goods at competitive prices in the international market, he said.To a query, Mr. Bhat said that GST was not harmful for the trading community as reported in a section of the media. Instead, it was a friendly taxation system for the merchant class.The government has made it clear that all trading activities up to Rs. 20 lakh annual turnover would not come under GST.In case of businesses with an annual turnover in the range of Rs. 20 lakh to Rs. 75 lakh, the tax fixed was 2 % for manufacturers, 5 % for hotel industry and 1 % of the total turnover for others. There may be some sort of confusion in the beginning. But everyone would realise its benefits gradually, he added.Mr. Bhat said that GST would prove beneficiary for the common people as it had imposed 0 % to 5 % tax on essential commodities. GST would help combat black market as it compels all private entrepreneurs to come under the orbit of taxation.All these days, nearly 50 % of the transactions in the private sector were done through cash and it was facilitating generation of black money.A report by the Federal Reserve of the U.S. has predicted 4 % GDP growth in the next four to five years due to the implementation of GST. It would help mitigate the rate of unemployment, he added.Mr. Bhat pointed out that the NDA Government at the Centre has taken some radical steps to boost economic growth. No scandals have been reported so far.The rate of inflation which was 12 % when the NDA Government came to power has come down to 3 % today. Most of the State governments schemes, including the popular Anna Bhagya scheme are run with the Centres assistance.In this scheme, the Centre bears Rs. 29 per one kg of rice whereas the States share was Rs. 3, Mr. Bhat said.BJP State vice-president M. Nagaraj and others were present."

They believe that things will become clear for them in a month.Prices of many items like food grains, atta, maida and others have come down. We could see a decrease of at least Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 on the final bill, said A. Koteswara Rao who bought grocery at a supermarket near Siddhartha Nagar.The overall burden on an average customer has come down to some extent. One can save about Rs. 3 to 4 on a kilogramme of rice and other grains. This is also benefiting a large number of the kirana store keepers who buy the unpacked items in bulk, said K. Vijay Kumar, a distributor and owner of a supermarket.But we are forced to sell the old stock, which was taxed earlier, with no tax now. Also, the taxes on some fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) have gone up and customers are benefiting by buying them at older prices. We could not hike the prices beyond the MRP, he added.To avoid the confusion, most of the traders are issuing manual bills unless the buyers insist on system generated billing.However, the price cut in the unpacked food grains is hardly helping the non-AC restaurants and hotels and their customers since the tax was increased from 5% to 12%.We can get the raw material at cheaper prices. That benefit is minute when compared to the loss we face due to the hike in the prices of the food items. We sell a plate of idly at Rs. 30 including 5% tax. Now the tax on it is 12%. If I increase the price, customers will prefer roadside vendors who have already become famous. If I bear the burden, I would incur loss, said the owner of a famous chain of tiffin and fast food eateries.Right now we are continuing the old prices as there is no other option. Only after a month, we would get a clear picture, he added.Meanwhile, sales of electronic goods came down due to the higher tax and also because people had bought products before the GST had come into effect.

The government is keen on taking control over the welfare board which is having thousands of crores, they alleged.Unproductive schemesThey criticised the government for spending crores of rupees on unproductive schemes and not showing interest in spending on the welfare of the workers. Workers in all sectors are living amid insecurity. There is no guarantee of proper wages, said senior trade union leader Donepudi Kasinath.He said the formation of new capital city has led to increase in the load of work for the construction and other segments, but the wages were not commensurate of the labour.Senior CITU leader Ch. Babu Rao said minimum wages were not revised for the past 12 years, thus enabling industrialists and owners to pay less to the workers. In 58 scheduled industries, the minimum wages were not revised, he added.Mr. Rao said over 1,50,000 contract and outsourcing employees were yet to be regularised and added that Anganwadi, midday meal employees, Asha workers were paid paltry salaries. The Anna Amrutha Hastham scheme has come as a curse to Anganwadi women. Even the rice supplied to them under this scheme is of poor quality.He said while the Telangana government has enhanced the pay scale of Anganwadi and Asha workers, it was unfortunate the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister was hesitant to address the issues. During Krishna pushkaramas and in the week-long Nava Nirmana Deeksha programme, the State government spent crores of rupees.The speakers demanded pension for workers above 60 years as a measure of social security and welfare boards for Hamali and auto workers."

Ninety per cent or more of each dish comprises jackfruit, he says.So be it Chakka Thoran made of the thorns or sweet Kichadi made of the ripe bulbs, one can be assured that there is ample jackfruit in them. Rafeek says the 20 curries served each day will not be repeated the next day. He makes sure that the jackfruit experience does not get limited to tucking into sambar, aviyal, erissery, pulissery, and pickle. Chakka Perattu, fish curry, beef fry, and biryani are all aimed at giving chakka a twist by incorporating non-vegetarian flavours, but keeping the dishes vegetarian.SnacksHe also dishes out snacks that include Chakka Pazhampori, Ada, Uniappam, Bajji, Therali, Modakam, Madhura Chilli, Vada, Puttu, and so on.Besides Chakka Aravana Payasam that he claims will not get spoilt for six months, Rafeek serves Chakka Payasams made of jaggery and sugar.

Sneha, a resident of Srikakulam district, is Rs. 2,000. However, this month she had to cut down on the list of items bought at the retail store as the total bill amount exceeded Rs. 2,400.Earlier, the monthly essential commodities never crossed Rs. 2,000 but this time I have to reduce the quantity of certain products such as butter packets, ghee, dry fruits and sugar syrups and place them back on the shelves after checking the final bill amount, as the tax component has gone up on these products, says Ms. Sneha.Price-conscious buyers who entered the supermarkets to refill the shelves with kitchen staples find it difficult to figure out item-wise price variation.While several outlets are trying their best to get familiarised with the GST structure, consumers heading to the retail outlets ended up staring at the bill for a longer time to figure out which items turned out to be costlier.Comparison not easySince the tax levied on each item varies, it is difficult to identify the expensive stuff by merely looking at the bill copy without having the last months invoice that features similar products, says S.P. Thakur, a naval employee.Those who stick to the strict monthly budget say it takes time for them to assess how much they have to set aside extra to meet their expenditure.This is primarily because certain essential commodities such as puffed rice and bread are tax exempted and some like cheese attract extra 6% tax (earlier 6%). Unless we get into a regular pattern of purchase, its hard to explain the actual difference and plan accordingly, reasons B. Raju, a resident of MVP Colony.With some of the retail stores offering cash back vouchers and special discounts on a range of products, not many are able to trace the variation between the earlier rates and the existing ones.Its business as usualEven in the daily transactions, we dont find any big change and its business as usual across the branches. With respect to the impact on GST rollout, I think it takes a while to get the real picture in terms of business volume, states K. Bhanu Prakash Reddy, store manger of Big Bazaar."

However, the decision to close many of these canteens has been deferred owing to worries about the political impact of such a move ahead of the local body elections.According to a study done by the Corporation Health Department, many of the canteens inaugurated in the second phase located in the vicinity of other canteens that were commissioned in the first phase, causing a dip in sale.The sales in many of the Amma canteens range from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000 per day. Though the rice purchased is subsidised, other expenses are met from the general fund of the Chennai Corporation. The expenditure, however, for such canteens is around Rs. 20,000 per day.The average revenue per day from canteens that have poor patronage is around Rs. 2,000. Each of the workers receives a wage of Rs. 300 per day.The number of workers in each of Amma canteens ranges from 10 to 40.

As they look up at the skies hoping for good rains, they are buying seeds and fertilizers and ploughing fields.Many in the rice bowl of the State have ploughed their fields to sow paddy seeds straight rather than prepare nurseries since most borewells have now gone defunct due to lack of water.People like V.K.V. Ravichandran, founder president, United Progressive Farmers Forum, Nannilam, said they were just waiting for an auspicious day to sow seeds.We have been having rains for the last few days. Most farmers in our forum are going for direct sowing since we can reduce about ten days from the duration of the crop. This will also do away with the need for a nursery and the required additional labour, he said.Farmer S. Ramanathan from Krishnagiri district said around 75% of farmers in his area who depended on the KRP dam for water had just finished one harvest and were getting ready for sowing. Since there has been good rains in Karnataka this time, we have received good water. As far as Hosur is concerned, farmers there are into floriculture and they are using borewell water for the flowers, he said. He said farmers who are dependent on the rains are yet to start work since they havent had any rain so far.Banking on vegetablesPonn Vilaindha Kalathur farmer V. Parasuraman said farmers in his area were banking on ladies finger and other vegetable crops.Ladies fingers are doing well. The rate has not dipped below Rs. 30 a kg this year. Though there has not been much rain, we can surely make a profit of Rs. 70,000 per acre. Hybrids will do well this time of the year, he said, adding that auspicious days are those during which there is good rain.Meanwhile, since farmers prefer to sow seeds in the Tamil month of Aadi when the weather conditions are said to be conducive for agricultural activities, the Agriculture Department has moved seeds of paddy, vegetables, pulses, millets and oil seeds to agriculture extension centres across the State. We have ensured that the seeds are certified for quality and for good yield, explained an official."

Harpal SinghS. HARPAL SINGH;S. HARPAL SINGH - S_ HARPAL SINGHThere is hardly any adivasi ritual or festival in Adilabad and neighbouring districts which does not connect the local ethnic tribes with nature.Each of the rituals and festivals indicate that the aboriginal Raj Gonds and Kolams understanding of the nuances of their environment was perfect.Take for instance, the Akadi puja which is performed by the Raj Gonds during July that heralds certain changes in the diet of humans and cattle.It is after this ritual that they begin eating leafy vegetables and believe that their animals develop the ability to digest green fodder.The puja also heralds the dandari dance season for the Raj Gonds who dance and sing in their villages in the evenings until Diwali.The Dandari Pen puja or the puja of the traditional musical instruments is performed in the night and usually follows the Akadi puja performed in the afternoon.Consumption of fresh green fodder or fresh vegetables at the start of monsoon is considered to be unsafe as it could result in spread of certain diseases. The period of danger to health of humans and animals through the vegetarian diet is over soon after the Akadi amavasya and the Raj Gonds perform Akadi puja for a period of about a week starting on the fourth day after the amavasya.The special prayers are a simple task as the menfolk in villages reach close to the nearest forest and perform the puja. A stone symbolises Akadi Pen or god who is offered sweet rice as prasadam besides a chicken in sacrifice.The most interesting part of the puja however, is the datudi ritual which involves men and animals crossing the geeta (line) drawn with a mixture of turmeric and vermilion. The line symbolises the divide between habitation and forest and needs to be crossed ritually signifying the entry into the forest and return to home.Today we cook some of the wild plants indicating the lifting of ban on consumption of leafy vegetables since the beginning of monsoon, revealed Sidam Tulsiram, the Patel of Pataguda village in Indervelli mandal where Akadi puja was performed on Tuesday, the last day for performing puja this season.As the greenery in the forest undergoes changes, animals will be able to digest green fodder properly from now on, he added."

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"

5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

In the stocks allocated under the Ramzan Tohfa scheme, 17 kg excess sugar, 15 kg excess wheat flour, 11 kg excess semolina and 800 ml less ghee was detected. The officials had also seized 28 LPG cylinders. The food safety wing officials visited the Anganwadi centres at Challapalli and Avanigadda, collected food samples and sent them for analysis.Officials of the drug control wing raided 71 shops in Vidyadharapuram, Ramarajyanagar, Eluru Road and Patamata in Vijayawada besides Guntupalli, Paritala, Pedana, Gampalagudem and a few other places and issued suspension orders to the owners for violation of norms."

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

The banks were charging compound interest on defaulted loans. The terms were not the same even among the public sector banks. The interest component on defaulted loans was too high. It was unjustifiable, especially as the farmers were unable to repay the loans due to reasons beyond their control. The union government or RBI should evolve a policy on dealing with the defaulted loans of farmers, he said.Both the central and State governments were yet to clear dues running into crores of rupees for the paddy procured from the farmers after March this year. Though the State government has reportedly released its share a few days ago, the amount has not yet reached farmers. But the central share was yet to be released.The farmers who pledged their land are unable to get any other loan without repaying the farm loan. It is again unjust as the banks are paying a farm loan of about Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000 per acre of agricultural land which has a market value of Rs. 8 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh. The farmers have to depend on private money lenders for needs such as childrens education and marriage. The situation would push them further into penury, he said.The Samithi is demanding that the government formulate a scheme for disbursal of multi-purpose loans at 4 per cent interest to the farmers. It also wants the government to freeze the recovery proceedings on old loans.Suffered lossesThe farmers who had suffered losses under various strenuous farm conditions were not being compensated. Compensation promised by the government for the weedy rice component during harvest, had not been received by the farmers. There had been disputes between farmers and millers over the weed and moisture content in the procured paddy. Drought and army worm attack had caused severe harm to many farm fields. Bunds at several padasekharams had breached in the monsoon rains and many farmers had lost the investment on the crop."

The integrated farming programme includes cultivation of vegetables, rice, aquaculture, poultry farming and dairying.The Palliyakkal bank, near Ezhikkara, has been in the forefront of organic cultivation of vegetables and self-reliance in food production over the last 17 years with the initiative having been launched in 2000.Mr. Vijayan said the stalls selling vegetables produced by farmers under the banks care had good response.The bank has around 9,400 members and a deposit base of Rs. 58 crore and Rs. 40 outstanding loan. Farming activities are spread over 28 groups in six zones. There are around 1,200 farmers under the banks care.Meanwhile, sources in the district unit of the CPI(M) said that around 1,500 acres are being brought under vegetable cultivation ahead of Onam.

The dealers, in turn, used to put the blame on those manning the MLS points.Their claim was that they were getting lesser quantity thus forcing them to adjust the same among the beneficiaries.Win-win situationThe interlinking of the ePoS machines and the weighing machines at the MLS points, however, brings in transparency in the entire supply chain and minimises the scope for pilferage . It is going to be a win-win for the dealers and to the public as well. It gives scope for transparency in the civil supplies system, says Joint Collector A. Mallikarjuna, who has formally inaugurated the new system at the MLS point at Jaggampeta.Now, the weighing of commodities will be done in an accurate manner at every level. Be it the MLS point or the ration shop point, we will get the electronic data and review it periodically, he said.It may be recalled that East Godavari district pioneered the linking of Aadhaar to the Public Distribution System way back in September, 2012, and the success of the pilot project enabled the Central government to replicate the same in the rest of the country.This is going to be another milestone project in the civil supplies, as we are aiming at supplying the right quantities to the end users by curtailing the pilferage, points out Dr. Mallikarjuna."

Rajendran said a university-level evaluation committee had recommended these varieties after assessing their performances on experimental plots and farmers fields.The new varieties will be officially released after approval from the State Variety Release Committee headed by the Agricultural Production Commissioner, according to Director of Research P. Indiradevi.Of the five rice varieties, VTL 10 is a saline-tolerant variety for high saline coastal ecosystems. While Manuratna, a short-duration variety, is meant for wetlands, Suvarna is a semi-tall short-duration variety resistant to gall midge.Two varieties developed at the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS), Pattambi, are of long duration and suited for rabi season.Three ginger varieties have been developed at the College of Horticulture, Vellanikkara. Chandraka has high gingenol content and is suitable for fresh and dried use. Ardraka is less fibrous and Chithraka has higher starch content. The plumbago variety Swathi has higher root yield than all released varieties.KPCH-1, the F1 hybrid of seedless salad cucumber variety developed at Vellanikkara, offers a cheaper alternative to imported varieties. It is resistant to mildew syndrome and offers appreciable productivity in polyhouse cultivation.The culinary melon Vellayani Vishal has medium-sized and green-striped creamy white fruits. The cowpea variety Manjari is tolerant to mosaic virus and suitable for pure as well as inter-cropping. The five improved varieties of nutmeg were identified from farmers fields.

It will be held in Ranipet on Wednesday and in Tirupattur on Thursday. Officials of the Revenue, Rural Development, Police and Labour Welfare Departments will take part in the training programme.This sensitisation programme is being organised across 11 districts and 22 sub-divisions in the State. We already conducted the programme in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram districts, said Mathew Joji of IJM.The programme will cover training on what is bonded labourer system and how to identify the labourers. They are also being informed about the changes brought in the scheme meant for bonded labourers  Central Sector Scheme for Rehabilitation of Bonded Labourers 2016. Earlier, the bonded labourers have to be given Rs. 1,000 as immediate assistance on being rescued. The total rehabilitation amount was Rs. 20,000.

We had a young visitor from Vietnam, and one day we persuaded her to cook for us. She did  and what a meal it was.She had come carrying rice paper from Hanoi, and we went to INA Market to buy some shrimps, greens, peppers and ripe mango. And then she prepared a roll that was as much a visual delight as it was a treat for the palate. At the bottom of the translucent rolled rice paper was a thick strip of red mangoes, then some thinly cut green and red capsicum, shreds of basil and mint leaves and finally a layer of steamed shrimps.I was reminded of those rolls when I went to a lovely little restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Phone: 9650260408 and 9599450879) one afternoon. Its really little, so you have to book a table if you can.Still nostalgic about those rolls, we asked for a plate of pancakes with chicken (Rs. 220). They were different from the ones I had eaten, but rather good, nevertheless. The pancakes came with a helping of lettuce leaves, and we were urged to wrap a leaf around the pancake and eat it. There was a light fish sauce, which we could smear on the pancake if we wished to. The difference was in the casing  Chef Hana, who runs Little Hanoi, makes her batter with rice powder and beaten egg  so it looked and tasted a bit different.The fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat (Rs. 220) and with tofu and vegetables (Rs. 170) were little rolls of rice paper, stuffed with all the good stuff. I didnt try out the veggie one, but quite enjoyed my crunchy non-veg roll.Superb curryOur main dish was sticky rice with braised pork (Rs. 540) and yellow chicken curry (Rs. 330). The pork had a sharp taste, mildly sweet but piquant. The yellow curry gravy was simply superb, light and mildly flavoured, with little chunks of onion and carrot in them. The chicken pieces in the gravy, however, did not appeal to me much. I found them a bit too hard, and thought that the excellent flavours of the curry had not seeped into the meat.The vegetable aromatic rice noodle soup (Rs. 270) that a friend had asked for needed some more greens, and the server topped it accordingly. It was perhaps a bit bland, because of which we asked for the grilled fish Saigon (Rs. 320), which was very good. The fish was crisp, the flesh was firm, and the flavours were strong.We had our meal with some artichoke iced tea and hot tea (Rs. 95). And we ended with a delicious coconut ice cream with jelly (Rs. 120).This is one of the few places where you get Vietnamese food in Delhi, for strangely enough, there are hardly any Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Taj Palace had a Vietnam cuisine special called the Blue Ginger, but that shut shop, too. I find that surprising, for Vietnamese food is a rage across the world, and one of the best cuisines that you can have.I love Vietnamese food for two main reasons. One, the food is lighter than other cuisines for most dishes are steamed, grilled or boiled. And, second, the cuisine marks the coming together of many diverse influences. China and South East Asian nations have added to the cauldron, of course, but what sets it apart is the French influence, for France ruled Vietnam for almost a century from the middle of the 19th Century.But I am sure the food will catch on soon. And for the small group of die-hard Vietnamese food lovers in the city, there is always Little Saigon."

This academic year alone, the district authorities closed down 127 primary schools as the enrolment was less than 20 students. Given this, the chances of other government schools surviving are bleak.Recently, the government teachers had asked the elected representatives to take a firm decision to increase the enrolment rate in the government schools. Responding to their request, the local bodies representatives at Jubileenagar village in Karimnagar rural mandal gave a list of parents, who are the beneficiaries of Rs. 1-a-kg rice scheme, to the ration shop dealer to stop rationing out rice to them who have not been sending their children to government schools. There have also been instances of parents being forced by the local elected representatives to admit their children in government schools. The parents were told that they would not be extended the benefits of any welfare scheme if they fail to do so. The local leaders have even gone to the extent of stopping the private school buses from entering villages in Jagtial region. The Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) State general secretary, Y. Shekhar Rao, found fault with the authorities threatening the parents and forcibly making them send their children to the government schools against their wishes.I ask the leaders to send their children to government schools first and then ask others to follow suit. I want to know if government teachers themselves send their children to the State-run schools, he asked.Threatening the parents in such a way was undemocratic, he said and added that the association was planning to approach the State Human Rights Commission for suppressing the rights of people. Even the president of Telangana Rashtra Teachers Federation (TRTF) M. Prathap Reddy, who is also a government school headmaster, opposed the forcible enrolment of children. The government schools should win over the confidence of parents with quality education. The forcible enrolment of students would not strengthen the State-run schools, he opined."
5a0b60e29855b76bf13cec9e,When too much is too little,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-too-much-is-too-little/article19291293.ece,2017-07-17,"When Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought up the issue of food wastage on his Mann Ki Baat programme about two months ago, he endorsed a valid point when he asked people not to waste food. Though he raised an extremely critical issue of national importance, he could also have used the occasion to propose some government-led mechanism to handle it.He was right to an extent when he linked food wastage to peoples behaviour. However, there are wastages which happen in any case due to foods perishability and the absence of an effective distribution mechanism and legal framework. Looking at the scale of problems, it is wise to frame a comprehensive strategy by combining the efforts of the government and private sectors and civil society. The government can create a time-bound task force under Niti Aayog, with experts from different sectors, to frame a national policy to tackle this gigantic issue, which can recommend the legal framework to support initiatives to reduce food loss and waste. As a nation, we need to give priority to tackling this issue so that we can handle the social, economic and environmental ill-effects of wastage of food.One third of food wastedAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), One third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted globally, which amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year. It also states: Food is lost or wasted throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural production to final household consumption. The losses, it says, represent a waste of resources used in production such as land, water, energy and inputs, increasing the green gas emissions in vain.Food wastage has multiple socio-economic and environmental impacts. In a country like India, not only is food scarce for many poor families, it is a luxury for many others. Though hunger cannot be tackled directly by preventing food wastage, a substantial amount of food that is wasted in our country can feed many hungry people. India ranked 97th among 118 countries in the Global Hunger Index for 2016. About 20 crore people go to bed hungry and 7,000 people die of hunger every day; wastage of food is not less than a social delinquency. According to one estimate, 21 million tonnes of wheat are wasted in India every year. A recent study by the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, revealed that only 10% of food is covered by cold storage facilities in India. This, coupled with poor supply-chain management, results in significant wastage, both at pre- and post-harvest stages, of cereals, pulses, fruits and vegetables.The wastage of food entails loss of considerable amount of resources in the form of inputs used during production. For example, 25% of fresh water and nearly 300 million barrels of oil used to produce food are ultimately wasted.The increasing wastage also results in land degradation by about 45%, mainly due to deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices, and excessive groundwater extraction. Wastage results in national economic loss. To put a monetary value to the loss in terms of wastage, India loses Rs. 58,000 crore every year, to quote The CSR Journal .The energy spent over wasted food results in 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide production every year. Decay also leads to harmful emission of other gases in the atmosphere; for instance, decaying of rice produces methane. Food waste emissions have a major impact on climate change and result in greater carbon footprint.Laws to encourage donationMany countries have legislation providing for global best practices, such as the 1996 Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act in the U.S., which was intended to encourage donation of food and grocery products that meet quality and labelling standards by protecting the donor and the recipient agency against liability, except in the case of gross negligence and/or intentional misconduct. France has taken a lead by becoming the first country in the world to ban supermarkets from destroying unsold food, forcing them instead to donate it to charities or food banks or send it to the farmers to be used as fertilisers in crop production.In India, there are many civil society, private sector and community initiatives aimed at distributing food among the poor. The government is also committed to securing availability of food grains for two-thirds of the 1.3 billion population, under the National Food Security Act, 2013. While securing food for all or feeding them through such initiatives is important, addressing wastage of food in all forms is equally critical to complete the cycle of food sufficiency and food sustainability. There are initiatives such as India Food Banking Network (IFBN), which is promoting the concept of collaborative consumption with support from the private sector and civil society organisations. Such initiatives, creating networks and channels of distribution between those who have surplus food and those who are in need of them, are necessary.The government needs to do more and should play a larger facilitating role. The Prime Ministers call to the nation needs to be followed up with further interventions. There is an urgent need to understand the complexity of the problem and then to devise a national-level strategy to combat it so that surplus of food can be turned into an advantage instead of resulting in wastage. Hunger and food wastage are two sides of the coin. The cycle of hunger cannot be broken without channelising the wasted food to help the needy. Without stopping wastage of food, we cannot do justice to millions of hungry people, our economy and the planet.Sanjay Kumar is the India Country Director of Harvard South Asia Institute.

The Cherpu start-up will promote value addition, digitisation and a market-centred approach while protecting the interests of producers, said Director of Entrepreneurship, KVASU, T.P. Sethumadhavan.Entrepreneurs can expect up to 40 per cent premium price when compared to the prevalent rate in the market. This system will integrate agriculture, livestock, poultry and fisheries sector and implement good agricultural practices. The products will be marketed as safe-to-eat products under the label KASAVU, he added.The university will soon launch safe-to-eat goat meat (Chevon). The instrumentation laboratory of the university at Mannuthy will do periodical residue monitoring. The project proposes to produce milk, meat, chicken, egg, fish, rice and vegetables with less than permissible or zero level of pesticide, antibiotic, heavy metals or chemical residues.The products will be marketed through start-up outlets. The KVASU will help launch three sales outlets at Cherpu and Thrissur. A separate sales outlet is proposed to be established on the Civil Station campus at Ayyanthole. A seminar for 50 entrepreneurs was held at Cherpu recently.

If monsoon is well distributed, production will be good. If it is not, then it leads to distress in agriculture, although technologies are available to tackle it, said Himanshu Pathak, chairman, Global Technology Watch Group (GTWG) under the Climate Change Programme of the Technology Information, Processing and Assessment Council (TIFAC), Department of Science and Technology (DST).He was addressing a gathering at the two-day Second Stakeholders Consultation Meeting at the ICAR-National Academy of Agricultural Research Management here on Friday. Dr. Pathak, also the Director of the ICAR-National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, said: Rainfall intensity has changed. We have more rain in less period of time without distribution. Though there are technologies available, we have to minimise the effects of climate change by adapting these technologies. ICAR-NAARM Director Ch.

The audience loved these performances.But the major attraction was the lunch with mouth-watering dishes of Tulunadu. These dishes were prepared by about 30 mahila mandals of Udupi taluk.The dishes included moode, arasina yele kadabu, tojinka palya, halasina kadabu, patrode, kasuvina chutney, timare chutney, hurali saaru, chilimbida adde, saute padangi gasi, tojink vade, uppad pacchir palya, halasina mulka, halasina toley, kanile kadle gasi, tevu padape gasi, pejakayi chutney, along with rice and buttermilk. The dessert was a tasty payasa.Sheela K. Shetty, vice-president of the Udupi Zilla Panchayat and president of Udupi Taluk Mahila Mandaligala Okkota, said that a few decades ago, the months of Aashada and Shravana were regarded as difficult or tough in Tulunadu. Despite this, people collected nutritious vegetables found during these months and cooked dishes from them.However, now the standard of living had improved and these months were no longer considered tough. Our intention in organising this event is to see that the younger generation does not forget our traditional, tasty and healthy dishes. Hence, we have been holding this programme for over 17 years now, she said.Inaugurating the programme, K. Jayaprakash Hegde, former MP, said that the most of the dishes prepared by the mandal here were not available in any hotel. These dishes were unique to Tulunadu.These dishes should be documented as with passing times, there was a fear of some of them being forgotten. So too the younger generation should be made aware of the indoor game of chennamane, he said.V. Manohar, music director, said that even the padadanas and folk songs sung in Tulu should be documented. He also sang a few lines of a couple of songs to the delight of the audience.Vidyalata U. Shetty, district convener, Lions, Girija S. Shetty, president of Lions Club, Malpe, K.J.

Ravichandran (47) of Aruppukottai just needs Rs. 40 to have a non-vegetarian unlimited meal on a roadside eatery on V. O. Chidambaram road near the Central Bus Stand in Tiruchi. On Sunday, while he was being served a curry, a layer of dust kicked up by a swirling wind fell on his plate. A layer of dust also covered the omelettes and parottas being made by the food stall owner. But neither he nor Ravichandran bothered much about the dust and Ravichandran continued to enjoy his lunch, as the owner went on cooking.Ravichandran was not a lone customer having lunch at the roadside eatery. Similar was the scene at most of the roadside push cart eateries at Central Bus Stand. At least 50 customers were seen eating at different stalls on VOC road. Most of them were having lunch as they waited for buses to various destinations.Some of them were drivers and conductors of State owned transport corporation buses and private buses.They get one parotta at Rs. 10 and kuska and varieties of rice at just Rs. 20 per plate. One plate of mutton biriyani was being sold at Rs. 70.Most of the restaurants charge Rs. 100 for a vegetarian meal. In addition, I have to pay Rs. 10 to Rs. 18 to the government on Goods and Service Tax. I cannot afford it. Hence I prefer to eat at a roadside eatery, says Ravichandran.Surprisingly many are aware that most of the food stall owners pay little attention to ensure hygienic environment and hygienic methods of food preparation.We know well that we eat food items prepared in a poor hygienic condition. But, we can afford only to eat at roadside eateries, says a woman, a Thiruverumbur bound passenger from Erode, who was having lunch at a roadside eatery.A owner of a roadside eatery said that he was giving top priority for hygienic preparation of foods but the windy season was making the job difficult.Sounding an alert on possible outbreak of diarrhoea and cholera, M. A. Aleem, former Vice Principal, K. A. P. Viswanatham Medical College, said that most of the roadside eateries were transacting business in an unhealthy and unhygienic environment. The windy season would make the food quality worse. It was important for the health officials to ensure good environment surrounding eateries.While acknowledging that roadside eateries have come to stay in the city, Dr. Aleem further said that the Tiruchi Corporation, Public Health and Food Safety officials should conduct an awareness programme for all owners, cooks and other employees of these eateries."

This is the first time Patnaik would address the constituency of children as questions are being raised about his 17-year legacy.While the opposition BJP and Congress have flayed his move, the BJP on Monday launched a satirical website www.studenttips.in that pokes fun at the governments claims. Taking a swipe at essay topics like Naveen best administrator, the website said BJD utfullita, but Odia samasyare jarjarita (BJD delirious, but Odia people are torn apart by problems).It hosts a 10-page booklet titled Abhyas Pustika (Revision book) that lists governments failures on various fronts, including education, health infrastructure, sanitation, drinking water supply, agriculture and irrigation -- suggesting the kids to look at the facts while debating and writing essays. But the website may have come a little late as the essay and debate competitions are already over. The school and mass education department had suggested debate topics like Proud Odisha - Our CM got best administrator award for students of Class 8-10.In another section titled Ama kama kahe katha (works speaks louder) the site hosts several newsclips starting from teachers usurping mid day meal rice to pregnant women being carried on cots. Using cartoons, the site shows how a teacher in a village school doubles up as math and literature teacher.The government is spending Rs 200 crore just for its publicity on Childrens Day. After destroying the education system over 17 years, the CM is now resorting to drama, alleged BJP spokesperson Sameer Mohanty. The site would be a factchecker for students and their teachers against the tall claims of the government.BJD spokesman Sameer Dash said BJPs website has many untruths which people would not digest. The allegation that the State government is spending Rs 200 crore for the Childrens Day function is pure lie, he said."

Earlier, Rout had accused the Centre of violating federal principle and interfering in State matters.Responding to a query on Routs comments, the Union Minister said, While 14 districts of the State are reeling under drought, paddy crops in Bargarh district which is considered to be the rice bowl of the State is severely affected by pest attack. As distress farmers are committing suicide over crop loss, it is our duty to assist them in this hour of their crisis.Since the Centre is providing major chunk of financial assistance to the State for agriculture, it is our responsibility to identify the problems of the farmers through review meetings with the State Government. We have come here to understand the farmers problems. After the field visit, we will be in a position to decide how to support the State Government in the best possible way to resolve the crisis, he said.However, after reviewing the situation with senior officers of the State Government, the Union Minister said this is not the time to find fault with one another. It is the time to extend all possible assistance to the farmers to instill confidence in them.We will try our best to meet as many farmers of the affected areas as possible and discuss their problems. We will also visit the families of the farmers of Bargarh district who committed suicide over crop loss, Shekhawat said.The Union Minister said Director General of Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) who is also Secretary of Department of Agricultural Research and Education Trilochan Mohapatra will visit Ganjam district shortly to assess the ground situation.Once the field study is over, we will be in a better position to decide next course of action, he said.Shekhawat commentsAs distress farmers are committing suicide over crop loss, it is our duty to assist them in this hour of their crisisSince the Centre is providing major chunk of financial assistance to the State for agriculture, it is our responsibility to identify the problems of the farmersThis is not the time to find fault with one another.

The areas, known as the rice bowl of the state, are hit by drought-like situation and pest menace,"" said Shekhawat, who is on a two-day visit to the state to review the problems facing the farmers.Describing farmers as ""annadata"" (food providers), he said this is not the time to indulge in blame game and find fault with each other. It is necessary to hold the hand of the distressed farmers in order to give succour to them, he said.The minister, who held a preliminary review meeting with state government officials here on crop loss caused by drought and pest attacks, said his visit is aimed at understanding the problems faced by the farmers and find solutions.The Centre would also find ways and means of extending assistance and cooperation to the state government to enable it to deal with the farmers' woes, said Shekhawat, who is accompanied by a central team comprising experts.Stating that he would visit the affected areas including Bargarh till tomorrow, the minister said he would also meet affected farmers and family members of those who have committed suicide.The Director General of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is scheduled to visit Ganjam district, where paddy crops have been severely hit due to pest attack, he said.Replying to charges levelled by a section of the BJD leaders that his visit is an interference on state affairs, the minister said it is the duty of the Centre to address the farmers issues and the visit of the central team is aimed at reviewing the situation and working together with the state to end peasants' miseries.During the meeting between the central team and state officials today, the state government urged the union minister to take steps for modifying guidelines and hike compensation by 50 per cent to affected farmers.As the affected farmers are now getting compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare in rain-fed areas, the union minister was requested to raise the amount by at least 50 per cent, Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told reporters.Since the state is following Centre's guidelines, these can be changed by them, he said adding, even if the state wants to revive lift irrigation (LI) points to provide irrigation facilities to the farmers, it is not possible because there are no provisions for such mitigation in State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).The state has written to the Centre to give powers to repair and revive LI points during drought, Sethi said.Agriculture Secretary Saurabh Garg said the central team was apprised about the situation in areas affected by pest attacks and steps taken to deal with the problem.""We also told them about the the package announced by the Chief Minister for the affected farmers,"" he said.Central help was sought in undertaking measures for pest surveillance, setting up of insecticide laboratory and having deeper bore wells and tube wells to include more areas under irrigation for a permanent solution to the issue, said Garg.A delegation of the state BJP also met the union minister here and urged him to take necessary steps to mitigate the plight of farmers."
5a0cf24f9855b76bf13d0002,Hole in farm finance forcing sharecroppers to end lives,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/nov/11/hole-in-farm-finance-forcing-sharecroppers-to-end-lives-1698243.html,2017-11-11,"BARGARH:Its private credit rather than institutional finance to blame for the spate of farmer suicides across the State. While the benefits of bank credits are availed by land owners, the sharecroppers fall back on private lenders who provide loans at the doorsteps without the hassles of paperwork but charge a high rate of interest. This turns fatal for the landless or marginal farmers in case of crop loss.At a time when Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme, launched in 1998, offers easy loan and flexible repayment option which even tenants and sharecroppers can avail, suicide by farmers under debt burden has become a baffling trend. But there is more to it than meets the eye.A senior bank official revealed that 90 per cent of agriculture loans disbursed under Kisaan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been placed under non-performing asset (NPA). He further said the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002 has excluded agricultural land. Hence, it ensures that banks cannot keep, seize or auction agricultural land in case of default in agricultural loan.According to sources, the land owners avail the bank loans but are not interested in paying it back. With political parties choosing farm loan waiver for electoral gains, these land owners wait for this benefit to be announced. Moreover, there are middlemen who know the trick to facilitate agriculture loans from banks and they do it on a 50:50 sharing basis. The land owners do not mind sharing the loan as they do not have to repay it or lose their land.More than the original land owners, who are distancing themselves from agricultural activities due to lack of adequate workforce, courtesy the State Governments `1 per kg rice scheme, the sharecroppers are into cultivation. With the proposed Land Tenancy Act hanging fire, the sharecroppers, mostly landless, small or marginal farmers, get into verbal agreement with the land owner and have to pay seven to 12 bags of paddy each weighing 75 kg. At times, they take the pain to dispose of the paddy in Market Yard and pay the land owner in cash as per the prevailing minimum support price. However, the truth is that there is no written agreement between land owners and sharecroppers, which deprives the latter of the benefits being rolled out under KCC.Hence, the sharecroppers are forced to depend on non-institutionalised credit as they hardly have enough liquid cash to purchase seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and harvest the crop. With no other income source other than agriculture, crop loss leaves the sharecroppers devastated as they cannot escape from repaying loans to private lenders or settling the dues of the land owner.Sources in the banking industry said just like `1 per kg rice scheme which has hit the rural economy, farm loan waivers are affecting agriculture and the banks. Several States like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have written off loans of the farmers in the past. With voters aware that the general elections are slated in 2019, farmers in Odisha are hopeful of yet another round of waiver."

North Korea has not fired a rocket or tested a nuclear weapon since it launched a ballistic missile over Japan on Sept. 15.The break in testing matches lulls at similar times in past years and North Korea is almost certainly continuing its push for more capable nuclear weapons, South Korean officials say.But the renewed focus on economic development could be a bid to unify North Koreans and strengthen support for the leadership, said Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry.""While North Korea still shows the will to continue developing its nuclear and missile programme, their focus on the economy is also helping the North Korean people come together,"" Baik said.North Korea may be starting to feel the pinch of sanctions, tightened after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September, and its leadership could be under pressure to limit their impact, said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul.""Kim Jong Un has been simply doing what he does best - encouraging his people to achieve rapid economic growth and boost production,"" Nam said. ""Taking care of the economy and his people are the top priorities.""'Vicious Sanctions'Since taking the reins of the reclusive regime after the death of his father at the end of 2011, Kim has embraced a goal of simultaneously pursing economic development and advanced nuclear weapons.New U.N. Security Council sanctions in August and September banned imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while restricting oil shipments to the North.North Korean officials have said in state media the sanctions were causing a ""colossal amount of damage"" to ordinary North Koreans, while leaders have shown defiance, arguing that self-reliance can overcome international pressure.""The main key to foiling the extremely vicious sanctions and pressure of the U.S. imperialists and their vassal forces and turning misfortune into a blessing is just self-reliance and the sci-tech strength,"" Kim said in an Oct. 7 speech to leaders of his ruling Workers' Party of Korea, according to state media.Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a researcher with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks North Korea's economy, said there was a push to expand manufacturing and decrease reliance on imports of a wide range of goods.North Korea was also looking to expand exports of products not covered by sanctions, such as tractors, Silberstein added.While analysts say there is anecdotal evidence the sanctions are beginning to the North's economy, it is not clear to what degree.Prices of petrol and diesel have spiked, but the cost of foods likes corn and rice have remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website."

Seeding of Aadhaar cards of all family members with the ration card was meant to enable any member collect rations by getting his/her fingerprints read. Beena and Munna, working for the Sarva Janara Prarthanalaya, which describes itself as a gypsy charitable trust, said almost 150 families in the colony have been affected due to an erratic public distribution system.""Only 50-odd families of the 208 are successfully receiving rations. It's not as if they don't know the procedure for seeding, yet they are suffering. Aadhaar has made their lives difficult by excluding them from the benefits of PDS,"" said Beena.Maligehu, 56, said she hasn't been getting her monthly allocation of rice for five months now; her four-member family is entitled to 20 kg of rice. ""The person at the ration shop told me that my card has been cancelled. I went to the nearest BangaloreOne centre and the food and civil supplies office in Rajajinagar, but in vain. I haven't eaten properly in months. Sometimes, we rely on our neighbours and don't know where the next meal will come from,"" she said.Residents of the colony say life was much better earlier, when all they had to do was show their ration cards to get supplies. Before Aadhaar seeding, Vajara, 28, and her husband Ramakrishna, 37, used to get 20kg rice per month, five each for the couple and their two kids. But for the last few months, the PoS machine at the fair price depot has been unable to read her and her husband's fingerprints. Result: they have been losing out on half the allocated amount of rice.Some residents also claimed that not collecting ration for even a month resulted in cards being declared 'dead'. Most residents of the colony travel as far as Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra to sell their wares. Reetha, a doll-maker, travels frequently for work and is away for several days at a stretch. In her absence, her friend would take her daughter Archana to the fair price shop to collect rations for the family. However, six months ago, Reetha's family, which couldn't collect rations for a couple of months, was told that their card is no longer valid. Rajendra Bai , another resident entitled to 20 kg rice, too hasn't been receiving anything from the shop. She was told her card has been cancelled.""We have to buy rice from other provision stores for Rs 30-40 per kg. The average income of most families in the Hakki Pikki Colony is Rs 3,000-5,000 per month. How can we buy overpriced rice when we can barely sustain ourselves with what we earn,"" asked Rajendra Bai. Also, in some cases, only the ration card-holder's fingerprint is considered valid. Ration shops too are open only for a few days a month when supplies come. If residents miss that window, they are helpless till the next month, said Bai. And then there are some like 32-year-old Chandra who, despite raising a request for Aadhaar seeding, hasn't received the activation message from the food office.""If rice is not meant for the poor, then where is it going? The owners must be hoarding and selling them for higher rates,"" said Sumalatha, another resident."

The drive is intended to improve the lakes fish resources.Excavation by the BritishDuring the infamous famine, known as Na-anka Durbhikya in 1866, the Palur canal was dug up by the British by engaging locals who toiled hard to get rice for their labour. The excavation of the canal was done on the recommendation of the then Famine Commission to make the channel navigable.The 21-km-long canal is environmentally significant because it is one of three major links that connect Chilika with the sea.The canal was an engineering marvel. During tidal surges, the height of tide was the same both at the mouth as also the tail-end. It was a zero-gravity canal. A lot of fish varieties used to migrate from the sea into Chilika through the canal making the lagoon rich in fish resources, said Sushant Nanda, Chief Executive of CDA.Findings of a research conducted by the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute (CIFRI), Barrackpore, say that the Palur canal was another important route for highly priced mullets and other migratory species.The canal was almost choked with barrier nets for fishing and fish got caught before gaining entry into the lake. The encroachment also did not allow fish to reach the sea for breeding as in the case of highly priced mullet. The canal used to facilitate free exchange of saline water to maintain the salinity regime of the lake, the CIFRI found.Satellite imagesWe have cleared major encroachments along the canal. We hope the fish migration from the sea would now improve. This would contribute to improvement of fish resources in lakes southern sector benefiting the local fishing communities, said Mr. Nanda.The ongoing exercise has been undertaken after satellite images found 14,590 hectares of Chilika lagoon under man-made gheries for illegal prawn cultivation. As of now, more than 2,000 hectares of gheries have been removed.As per CIFRI findings, quite often hatchery-produced prawn and fish seeds are used for stocking in these gheries. During cyclones and rough weather conditions, these enclosures break and the captive stock escape into the lake, making the lake biota vulnerable to transmission of disease as well as genetic contamination.Underwater wallsThe institute had recommended that all illegal gheries set up by mafias who reap profits from the aquaculture be cleared.The CDA has deployed a barge and a barge-mount excavator to remove underwater walls made using sand bags.Spread over a 950 sq km area, Chilika boasts 325 fish varieties. Over the years the fish catch has dropped drastically due to decrease in fish migration from sea. The gheri removal drive will continue for a longer period. We hope to make Chilika free from illegal gheries, said the official.To ensure that illegal gheries do not come up again after demolition, the CDA is planning to procure a drone which would keep track of any development on the vast water areas of Chilika. Besides, plans are afoot to raise a dedicated force for patrolling the Chilika waters.The CDA has also proposed a fishing ban period in Chilika for conservation of fish resources."

These equipments earlier attracted an effective tax burden of 17.5 % that included 5.5% Value Added Tax and 12.5% excise duty.""The new tax rate on agri-electricals has dealt a body blow to both the farm sector and the small-scale industry manufacturing units these appliances,"" Ratnaraj Pirgal, taxation committee head, Bengaluru Switchgear Manufacturers Association (BSMA).The new tax burden comes at a time when farmers in Karnataka are staring at the fourth successive drought year. The input cost of cultivation has gone up because of the increase in tax burden on various other commodities apart from electrical appliances. The drip and sprinkler irrigation equipment, which attracted 5% VAT, has been taxed at 18% in the GST regime. The tax burden on pesticide sprayers has gone up from 6% to 18%.The price of a 50-kg bag of urea has been increased from Rs 298 to Rs 334. Similarly, the cost of other fertilizers like di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and potash has gone up by Rs 224 and Rs 70 respectively.""We are perturbed by this taxation. Instead of supporting the farm sector, the government has unscientifically hiked the tax burden on farmers,"" said Kuruburu Shanthakumar, president, All-India Sugarcane Growers Association.He pointed out that government policies are doing little to help distressed farmers. For instance, the support price fixed for 1 quintal of rice is between Rs 750 and Rs 900, while the cost to produce is more than Rs 1,000. ""The cost to produce has been further increased due to GST. It'll worsen the situation where farmers are resorting to suicide,"" Shanthakumar added.Twenty-eight of the 30 districts in Karnataka have reported farmers'suicides with even districts in Cauvery basin  Mandya, Mysuru, Chamarajanagara  also recording a high number. Chikkamagaluru in Malnad region saw the highest number of suicides.Jayant Mutha, office-bearer, BSMA, said his association has sent representations to both the Union finance minister and GST Council seeking reduction of GST rate on electrical farm appliances. ""We demand the capital goods and commodities used in the farm sector should be taxed at the lowest at 5%,"" Mutha said.""The GST Council has received many representations seeking revision of tax rates. The council will discuss them in its next meeting on August 5,"" said Ritvik Ranjanam Pandey, commissioner of commercial taxes and secretary (finance)."

More than 20 cases have been registered in the last six months.According to officials, offenders use well-maintained medium range cars and SUVs to smuggle PDS rice to Kerala. Meanwhile, smuggling of PDS rice in large volume in trains has come down due to counter measures taken, including installation of surveillance cameras at railway stations.Agents from Kerala as well as Tamil Nadu are engaged in smuggling. While large scale smuggling in train has come down, usage of private and goods vehicles to smuggle rice is yet to come under control, says an official.Smugglers widely choose Nattukal-Velanthavalam, Kozhinjampara-Velanthavalam, and Kinarpallam-Veerappagoundenpudur roads to smuggle PDS rice to Kerala. Officials say that smuggling through Walayar has become rare due to checking by various departments.*****According to officials, the smuggling network can be eliminated with the support of public from whom the agents procure PDS rice at cheap rates. Operation of the smuggling rackets will naturally dwindle if people refuse to sell the rice. On the enforcement side, Civil Supplies CID wing was invoking provisions of Goondas Act against repeated offenders.This year alone, 10 persons were detained under Goondas Act for repeated smuggling of PDS rice. A 67-year-old man was detained under Goondas Act after he was arrested with 1,400 kg of PDS rice earlier this month.The man was actively smuggling PDS rice to Kerala since 2015.Reporting by Wilson Thomas thcbereporting@gmail.com"

At Thakatty Panchayat in Thally block of Krishnagiri district, the locals complained about the dealer at their local shop demanding cash for seeding of ration cards with Aadhaar.In the same breath, Thakatty villagers talked about how Nagarajan had been a supervisor at their shop a few years ago, and how he would alert them to the arrival of their rations and tracked them to ensure they collected their entitlements before the last date. For a population constantly out on wage labour in far-off places, such information was critical.Fifty-three-year-old B. Nagarajan, supervisor of the Public Distribution System (PDS) outlet in Natrampalayam, has earned much goodwill in the area for the way he runs his PDS outlet servicing over 1,350 households in Thally block  ensuring smooth and efficient delivery of food grains in one of the poorest parts of the district. When the PDS is beleaguered by complaints of leakage and pilferage of entitlements meant for the poor, Nagarajans outlet stands out as a beacon of human goodness.Every day, he boards the bus at 7.30 a.m. from Denkanikottai, some 40 km away, and reaches Natrampalayam at 8.45 a.m. At 9, his shop is open and remains open till past 6 p.m., says Rudran, a villager.Serving the poorIn most places, cardholders make several trips for each commodity. But in Nagarajans outlet, he measures all the entitlements for a card and hands them out at one go.Many trek 5 km to come here. They need not travel back and forth, he reasons.He keeps the phone numbers of all cardholders to alert them to collect their entitlements, if the last date approaches.They are the poorest of the poor, and depend on these rations. No one should go hungry, he says.Nagarajan had assisted eligible households to get the Antayodya Anna Yojana cards that offer 35 kg of rice per household under the PDS  a help that went beyond his call of duty. There is a huge tribal population in these parts. If they dont get this, they will go without food, he says.An anecdote speaks of the man. It was a Sunday, and the year was perhaps 2009, recollects Sanke Gowdu, a local.Sundays, back then, were off days for PDS outlets. Nagarajan was tending to his sick son when the then Collector of Dharmapuri, who was on an inspection tour, had found the shop closed and ordered it to be sealed.When officials asked for a lock from the villagers to seal the shop, they refused to give one, says Sanke Gowdu. We told the Collector we had no complaints against this shop or the supervisor, and that we will not allow it to be sealed. Then they bought their own lock and sealed the shop, he says.When I met the Collector later at the guest house, she just smiled and handed over the key, says Nagarajan."

Garib-sal, one of 505 types of rice plants tested by scientists, is capable of absorbing silver found naturally in soil and accumulating it in the grain to unusually high levels of 15 mg per kg.The rice was able to accumulate high quantities of silver even when the soil contained only about 0.15 mg per kg.The unusual accumulation of silver in the grain and other parts of the plant, researchers say, throws open the possibility of commercial extraction of the metal through farming.The maximum concentration of silver in the plant is in the grains. Silver accumulation is largely in the bran of the rice grain, and once polished, the silver in the grain is reduced significantly.Polishing grain is crucialIt is not, however, for consumption as food. We do not advocate consumption of the unpolished rice as staple food. If the rice is polished very well then it may not lead to silver toxicity, says Prof. T. Pradeep from the Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, who authored the research.Silver is not known to accumulate in the reproductive tissues of any cereal, and in agricultural crops the amount of silver that gets accumulated is less than 1 mg per kg of dry weight of the plant.Researchers at IIT Madras stumbled upon the rice variety while screening for different metal ions in the 505 rice varieties. Only nine showed high silver accumulation, with Garib-sal the highest.The rice varieties are maintained by Dr. Debal Deb, head, Centre of Interdisciplinary Studies, Kolkata, as part of rice variety conservation efforts. Garib-sal used to be grown by farmers in Purulia, West Bengal. The researchers tested Garib-sals ability to accumulate silver even when grown in soils with very low silver concentration. Even when the soil contains only about 0.01 mg of silver per kg, the rice plant was able to concentrate 0.20 mg of silver per kg in the grains.The rice variety has the ability to accumulate silver about 100 times more than any other rice, says Prof. T. Pradeep. The variety was cultivated in the farm for three successive years in soil containing about 0.15 mg per kg and the uptake and accumulation of the noble metal was nearly the same.Garib-sal accumulated 50 times more silver than another type in control tests."

He needed to clock 150 km on the final day on Sunday, after falling behind schedule through illness.But the 44-year-old could only complete 114 km, falling agonisingly short of his target  which was the equivalent of about a quarter of the Earths circumference.He was plagued by gastro-intestinal infections and contracted viral fever but has run 9,964.19 kms in 100 days, said Vikram Bhatti, who handled Mr. Singhs campaign.Dressed in a blue sports vest, Mr. Singh started each day in the early hours from the northern Mumbai slums and headed to the business district in the citys south.Untiring spiritMy journey of running 100 kilometres per day is very challenging but I wanted to show the endurance limit of human spirit, Mr. Singh said ahead of the final run.Friends mocked the man from Madhya Pradesh for taking on the challenge, but it became an attempt that caught the public imagination.I survived without a job for the last nine months and people have come forward and supported me with donations, shoes, clothes and equipment, Mr. Singh said.He had a GPS watch, a basic mobile phone for emergencies and Rs. 200 a day.

So, we have been running a Facebook campaign to create awareness and generate funds for Samir, said Vandana Bhatti.Fans joined him for several stretches of his run each day.Mr. Singhs run was longer than the Great Wall of China (5,500km) and further than the distance from Mumbai to London (7,200km). He went to a temple to pray on Monday, giving up a plan to complete the last 36 km.Mr. Singh said he would now rest, and then starting mapping out a new challenge  this time over 40,000 kilometres.I have not met my mother for a while as she would be heartbroken looking at my sunken face.

Swaminathan, plant geneticist, who is acknowledged as the Father of Indias Green Revolution, underscored the importance of adopting a nutrition-centric approach to agriculture in India, where it was not enough to just produce enough food grains but also address the nutritional quality of the grain produced.At the Founding Day celebration of M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, which was set up on August 7, 1988, various experts from the field of agriculture and food security on Monday highlighted the need to eradicate hunger in India.Recommending that India expand its food basket to include nutri-millets, Dr. Swaminathan said doing so would help people overcome nutritional deficiencies due to the dominance of rice and wheat on Indian plates.The need of the hour is to improve our culinary diversity to include millets and other highly nutritious food in our diet, he said, adding that under-nutrition in India could be addressed by implementing the provisions of the Right to Food law (National Food Security Act, 2013). The government should also include pulses in the PDS system, as has been done in Chhattisgarh.Krishna Byregowda, Karnatakas Agriculture Minister, spoke about the interventions made in the State to include nutri-millets in the food basket. We have procured millets for the State PDS system in Karnataka and are also paying a higher price to farmers supplying them, he said, adding that agricultural scientists should focus on improving the yields of nutritional crops and make them remunerative for farmers to encourage them to grow these.Climate resilientGiven the challenge of climate change affecting agricultural prospects, Mr. Byregowda said nutritional millets could help resolve the hunger challenge and prove to be climate resilient as well. In Karnataka, we have seen a rainfall deficit of 50% and more and droughts in the past three years. Therefore, food crops that have been responsible for creating this ecological imbalance should be replaced with crops such as millets that require less water to grow, he said. He also criticised scientists for calling millets as coarse cereals as it conveyed a dismissive attitude towards these food crops, though that may not have been the intention.The conference is on until August 9.The government should also include pulses in the PDS systemM.S.
