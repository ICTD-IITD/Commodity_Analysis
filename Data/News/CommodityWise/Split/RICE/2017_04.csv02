Kathirmathiyon sent a registered notice to the State and Central governments.In his notice, he alleged that the State government was adopting discriminatory public distribution system and not universal PDS or targeted PDS system.The government had violated the norms and guidelines issued under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) by denying supply of essential commodities to the ration card holders classified as NPHH, while non-PHH card holders who had opted for rice continued to get all the other commodities including free rice, wheat, dhal, palm oil etc, said the activist.Mr. Kathirmathiyon ridiculed the governments claim that the families that opted for sugar were multimillionaires and those who had opted for rice were poor.Classification of cards as PHH and NPHH was itself a misnomer, he alleged.The activist questioned why the government claims to have been following the universal PDS system.The activist also cautioned that if the union government failed to treat the citizens equally and not acted as per the guidelines of NFSA, the CCC would be constrained to move court, he added."

Because of this, there are apprehensions among the white card holders.Adilabad district Civil Supply officer Thanuja told Express that only 201 dealers had so far paid the Demand Drafts to lift their stocks for August, out of the total 355 fair price shops in the district.She made it clear that government was making alternative arrangements to distribute rice through IKP groups at places where ration shop dealers are not ready to call off their stir.In the Adilabad district, a total of 355 fair price shops are there. 1,82,187 people have white ration cards including Anthyodaya cards. For them, 4,013 MT of rice is distributed every month.Because of the ongoing strike, 40 per cent of the dealers have not yet paid money to the civil supplies department to lift stocks for August. In fact, every month the government allots quota of rice and other essentials online before 18th of every month, depending on the payment made by each dealer.For the fair dealers, who do not pay the DD in time, the civil supply officials will extend the payment deadline till 30th. This fair price shop dealers distribute rice and other essentials from 1 to 15 to the beneficiaries.Now, there is a break in this cycle, because of the ongoing strike. Adilabad district Ration Dealers Association president N Venugopal said, We put the demands in front of government. Our demands are each dealer be considered as a government employee and get job security. If government fails to accept our demands, we will not distribute rice from our shops from August 1.In Mancherial district only 6 fair shop dealers paid DD to government to lift their stocks for August, out of the 424 ration shops. In this district also, the civil supplies officials are making efforts to distribute rice and other essentials to ration card holders with the help of women Self Help Groups (SHGs)."

All the girls were rushed to the area hospital for treatment. Three girls were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital as their condition was serious. All the students are said to be stable now.The girls who consumed hostel food in the evening started vomiting around midnight and they were immediately shifted in 108 ambulances to area hospital by the hostel authorities. It is learnt that they reportedly consumed potato and tomato curry with rice for dinner in the hostel mess after which they began to show signs of uneasiness.Parents of the girls, who reached the hospital after learning about the incident, alleged that the students had been complaining about the hostel mess' poor quality of food for a long time but the management ignored their complaints.According to sources, the students of the gurukul are not happy with the hostel mess food and in the past too such incidents have taken place, but of a lesser magnitude, and the matter was kept a secret. Students told reporters that though they have been complaining about the poor quality of food to the school principal, no action was taken to improve the quality.""Worms are found in the food often. We complained about it to the principal many times but he did nothing. The cook always makes unhygienic food,"" a student said.Though the students were rushed to the area hospital for treatment there were not enough doctors to attend them. The hospital superintendent had to request Bayyaram government hospital doctors to rush immediately to help them in treating the girls.Local MLA Shankar Naik, who rushed to hospital after learning about the incident, fumed at hospital authorities as doctors were not available to treat the girls. Joint collector and DEO, who also reached the hospital to take stock of the situation, expressed displeasure over the way the hospital was functioning. They pulled up the hospital superintendent for non-availability of doctors in the hospital during night hours.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, who also holds education minister's portfolio, expressed anger over the incident and directed his department officials to immediately cancel the contract of the caterers. He directed district collector Preeti Meena to take steps to provide proper treatment to the girls.The deputy chief minister, who is touring Warangal rural district, also spoke to the hospital superintendent, who informed him that the condition of all the girls was stable and that they would be discharged by evening. He also directed the collector to take stringent action against the persons responsible for the incident.Meanwhile, Congress, CPI and students' union activists gathered in front of the hospital and demanded that the government take stringent action against the gurukul warden, principal and cook. They also wanted the collector to take action against the doctors for staying away from duty.The police have registered a case and are investigating. Food inspectors have collected samples consumed by the students for testing them in labs."

(Representational photo) The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) mandate is agriculture education, research and farm extension. (Representational photo)Although autarky on Indian farms is a distant dream, as the 71st year of Independence dawns, penury-ridden farmers are still committing suicide by the thousands a consequence of decades of short-sightedness, while economists and scientists are still equating food sufficiency to farmer sustainability.The occasion merits introspection on the core issues of farmers distress. We must begin at the apex. The Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) mandate is agriculture education, research and farm extension. It contributed during the most challenging years of food scarcity. Though that success came at an environmental cost we didnt understand that when we were succeeding. The Green Revolution and a few small triumphs arent enough to justify the status quo.ICAR is no more the holy cow it once was, it can be safely taken to the slaughter house. Far from being an autonomous body, ICAR has become an extension of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. It should be transformed into a truly autonomous body reporting directly to the prime minister like the Atomic Energy Commission. Its functions should be restricted to farm research, education and oversight of non-ICAR agriculture institutes. Farm extension services should be completely delegated to the state governments.ICAR has historically evolved with a strong bias in favour of crop sciences at the cost of animal husbandry. Research that focuses on agriculture productivity without an alignment to its socio-economic consequences and farmer prosperity is pass. Yields for irrigated crops like rice and wheat are comparable with the best in the world, but research on rain-fed farms, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables lags considerably. Evolving consumer preferences, changing the narrative from farm to food, environmental impact, climate resilient agriculture require a reorientation of priorities and mindsets. The capacities for market intelligence and forecasting models have not been cultivated.The deterioration in agriculture education is deplorable. Some state agriculture universities (SAU) are even conducting courses in fashion design. More appalling are the over 1,000 unregulated private agriculture colleges which have sprouted across the nation churning out degrees like street food. Many are without proper labs, infrastructure or farm land. As agriculture is a state subject ICAR/Central government jurisdiction doesnt apply to these proliferating private profiteers. They thrive because states havent enacted a regulatory framework. The Punjab government has notified a regulatory act; other states must follow.Of the three activities of ICAR, technology transfer or farm extension is shared with the states and is the biggest disappointment of all. Since India became a cereal secure nation, complacency set in and public extension collapsed. The abdication by the state public extension system has allowed the private shopkeepers to usurp the role of farm advisories to disastrous consequences for farmers, human health and the ecology.ICAR and the states exercise authority and jointly fund SAU activities. Around 700 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVK) funded by the ICAR are designated for capacity building and technology refinement and transfer but are neither fully staffed nor equipped.Practically, state governments barely manage to fund the SAUs. To offset the constant paucity of funds, SAUs are forced to augment their resources by seeking research grants irrespective of the states priorities. For example, a particular state may want to focus on diversification from paddy in the kharif season, while much of the coordinated research is for the Rabi season crops. This happens because centre and state objectives differ.Convergence between ICAR and state agriculture agencies has failed. If the PMO accepted the responsibility of agriculture research and education, SAU salaries would fall into the Central government basket and the KVKs could be transferred to the states. That would free up resources for states to focus exclusively on farm extension.ICAR cannot escape its share of culpability  recruitments are manipulated, inbreeding and nepotism are rampant. Salary structures based on government promotion rules of time-bound promotion do not recognise research output and talent is ignored. Most farmhands are women, but women are not even recruited in equal numbers. Inter-departmental coordination is lacking within the 71 agriculture universities and the whopping 101 institutes across India. Its time to prune the institute numbers by a third. Worse still, research is routinely stolen from ICAR institutes by private companies. Thus, IPR registrations and internal resource generation like that in the developed world universities is improbable.To reach the promised land, apart from the stroke of the axe, budget allocations for agriculture R&D must be pegged as 2 per cent of the GDP from the less than 1 per cent at present. But, most importantly, a metric to audit outcomes and establish accountability is needed to resolve the crisis. Unfortunately, when decisions are made, the theoretical knowledge of policymakers supersedes the grounded experience of the practitioner, allowing these crises to fester indefinitely.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0dbb2b9855b76bf13d11c4,Food poisoning in government schools a regular affair,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/jul/11/food-poisoning-in-government-schools-a-regular-affair-1627093.html,2017-07-11,"ADILABAD/WARANGAL/KHAMMAM/KARIMNAGAR: Despite Telangana governments claim of providing quality food in state-run residential schools, cases of food poisoning and poor quality of food being served in these hostels are been reported on a regular basis in the state. In the last two days, two cases of food poisoning were reported from Mahabubabad and Adilabad district.About 31 students of Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalay(KGBV) Gurukul in Nellikuduru village were taken ill on July 8 due to suspected food poisoning. Within 48 hours, a similar incident took place in KGBV Gurukul in Koutala mandal where 42 students were taken ill due to food poisoning. Recently, 29 students of KGBV in Penuballi mandal headquarters in Khammam district were also taken ill due to food poisoning.Such incidents have become frequent in the state-run residential schools. Such incidents mostly occur as caterers use sub-standard items for cooking to make a profit. Sources say that the mess monitoring committee of residential schools to get a commission in the purchasing of food materials compromise with the quality of materials procured.Its an open secret that mess monitoring committee members collude with suppliers and prepare food for children with sub-standard materials. Everyone is aware of it. It has been happening for a long time and will continue if the government doesnt take steps to streamline the entire system, says Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU) state secretary E Vijay Kanna.Unhygienic kitchen and contaminated waterApart from the sub-standard food materials, unhygienic kitchen and contaminated water used for cooking have been being cited as a reason for food poisoning in residential schools. During the rains, the problem multiplies as the entire surrounding becomes dirty and water-borne diseases spread. Worms in rice and dishes have become a common phenomenon in residential schools.Girls residential schools more patheticThe condition of girls residential schools are even more pathetic. Apart from the issue of unhygienic food, they have to deal with poor sanitation facilities. They become prone to various diseases due to dirty toilets and surroundings. Students feel that until the government improve facilities in these residential schools and depute substantial dedicated staff, such incidents would keep occurring and the children would continue to face problem.Food served is monitored on regular basisMeanwhile, district education officials claim that they monitor food served in residential schools on a regular basis and that they are of good quality. We have a district coordinating officer who monitors facilities available in residential schools. Even collector on a regular basis reviews the conditions of these schools. Hence, just because some isolated incident had taken place, blaming school authorities is not correct, an official of education department said.Incidents of food poisoningIn erstwhile Warangal incidents of food poisoning occurred in residential schools located at Elkurthy, Madikonda, Dornakal in past.Food served in the 36 KGBV in Khammam, Kothagudem districts is of poor qualityIt is learnt that menu was not being implemented in KGBV situated in Bonkal, Chintakani, Yerrupalem, Enkoor, Mudigonda, Konijerla, Tirumalayapalem mandals"

The demands of Tamil Nadu government are under the consideration of the GST council.Answering queries of media persons at Delhi after attending the monthly meeting of the GST Council, the minister said exemption of GST was sought for the following items: clothes made of silk, thirumangalyam, kolusu, metti and araignan kayiru (string worn around waist) made of silver, mat made of bulrush, nutritious flour used for anganwadi children, outsourcing services offered by educational institutions, life insurance services, spectacles and its accessories, minor works relating to printing, sago, dried fish, rice bran, fried groundnuts, idli and dosa batter, fishing nets, 20 litre drinking water cans, handloom weaving, powerloom weaving and job works in weaving sector.The Minister urged the GST Council to reduce the tax on all job works in textile industry from 18 per cent to five per cent. Similarly, the 28 per cent GST on cracker industry should be reduced, considering the fact that higher tax rate would affect many small units involved in cracker making. He said uniform tax should be fixed for all kinds of match boxes. The GST on kadalai mittai (sweet candy made of groundnut) should be reduced from 18 per cent to five per cent. The tax on unbranded candies and pickles should be brought down to five per cent. The tax on micro-nutrients used for agriculture should be reduced from 12 to 5 per cent.Stating that the tax on pumpsets should be reduced to 5 per cent, he said biscuits sold above `100 should be taxed at 18 per cent while those below `100 should be taxed at 5 per cent. Since wet grinder is one of the equipment used in all houses, the tax on it should be slashed from 28 to 12 per cent. Tax on compressor, steel, plastic furniture and electronic weighing machines should be reduced from 28 to 18 per cent. The tax on recycled plastic should also be reduced from 18 to 12 per cent."

Earlier, three similar incidents had taken place at these government-run schools for children of BCs. At Koutala in Komarambheem district, some students fell ill after eating stale dal in breakfast. At least 50 fell ill after eating worm-filled rice for almost a week in Nellikuduru mandal in Mahbubabad district. In Thorrur mandal, about 20 girls fell sick after drinking borewell water.An Express team visited the two Vidyalayas in Mahbubabad district to know the causes. The food poisoning in Nellikuduru was blamed on the cooks negligence. As for the Thorrur incident, children had to drink borewell water as the RO plant did not work.KGBV schemeThe KGBV scheme was launched by the Centre in 2004 to ensure that girls, specifically belonging to SCs, STs and OBCs, have access to quality education. The upper primary residential school reserves 75 pc seats for these communities and the rest for BPL children. KGBV was merged with Sarva Shikshya Abhiyan on April 1, 2007 and has been being managed by state governments in some areas and by NGOs in some others. Telangana is one of the states where children are admitted to Classes higher than Class 8. There are plans to include Intermediate education in KGBVs.According to a Niti Aayog analysis done in 18 states in 2015, children would not have opted for KGBVs had there been no residential facility. Most principals and teachers said free hostel was the main motivation for the girls to join the schools. District collector is in charge of the overall implementation of KGBV scheme and a specially-appointed sectoral officer oversees its implementation at ground level. The school principal also acts as special officer.Govt rattledRattled by three incidents which occurred in a span of 15 days, officials took some action. The two teachers who were on duty on the day of the incident at Koutala were transferred to KGBV in Sirpur mandal while two from Sirpur were moved to Koutala. At Nellikuduru, the principal and the cook were suspended and currently, two women who take care of midday meals in the local government school have been given the additional responsibility at KGBV. Mineral water will be bought for Thorrur KGBV till the RO plant is revived. A paediatrician in Mahbubabad said the number of cases rises during monsoon.SSA director G Kishan said, These incidents occur only during monsoon. We asked all the in-charge offices to avoid leafy vegetables and keep RO plants working. Cooking has to be completed only half an hour before food is served.Sectoral officers were told to carefully procure materials. We generally procure essentials from civil supplies and other certified departments  eggs from NACO and milk from the Dairy Development Corporation. These incidents occur when workers are lax, he explained. Fourteen persons cary out various duties at the school  a watchman on 24-hour duty, two cooks and three helpers in the kitchen and seven teachers including the principal. Besides, an ANM attends to the children at all times. They are appointed on contract basis and are underpaid. We double up as in-charge at night and caretakers when there is need. It is overburdening and there is no guarantee of job, said a teacher at Nellikuduru.Nearly 84 new English-medium KGBVs will be set up in addition to the existing 398 in Telangana.Express findingsBesides the questionable quality of food, Express has found several other aspects that need authorities attention. All KGBVs have a single building plan. The ground floor of the spacious one-storeyed building with a central courtyard, has classrooms and the first floor is the residential area. At least 40 girls are crammed in a single, medium-sized room. They sleep on the floor alongside their belongings which include a huge trunk, books, school bags and clothes.The monsoon and winter are fine but summers are uncomfortable, said the girls at the Thorrur KGBV. Washrooms at Nellikuduru KGBV are in horrible condition. Dysfunctional taps and broken doors are the common sight. The other washrooms are hardly sufficient for 200 girls. Those having monthly period have to wake up as early as 5 am to finish their morning ablutions. Fights and arguments erupt quite often, said a student."
5a0dbb639855b76bf13d11ed,State fully committed to providing Universal PDS,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2017/aug/03/state-fully-committed-to-providing-universal-pds-1637522.html,2017-08-03,"CHENNAI: The State government is committed to continuing the Universal Public Distribution System even after implementation of National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA), Pradeep Yadav, Principal Secretary, Co-operation, Food and Consumer Protection Department told Express. He added that the State had to implement the Act, only after the Centre agreed to supply rice at a subsidised cost of `3 for people Below Poverty Line (BPL) and at a tie-over agreement of `8.30 for people Above Poverty line (APL).That is, Tamil Nadu would have lost the Centres subsidy toward purchasing essential commodities and wouldve had to bear `2,730 crore more annually if it had failed to implement National Food Security Act (NFSA). Implementing it does not translate to narrowing the scheme to Targeted PDS as Section 32 of the Act permits any State Government to enhance entitlements or extend coverage under the scheme at their expenses.The State government recently issued a notification with regulations for implementation of the Act, creating a widespread panic that Tamil Nadu may scrap the Universal PDS and adopt Targeted PDS instead. Several political oppositions condemned the regulations fearing that it may lead to hunger deaths and exclusion of the needy. The anxiety remained among public despite Food Minister, R Kamaraj clarifying that the Universal PDS will continue.Failing the implementation of NFSA, States had to purchase rice at an exorbitant rate of `22.54 for the above poverty line (APL). The State succumbed to this ultimatum and adopted the NFSA on November 01, 2016. The Centre is now said to protect the average demand of last three years in Tamil Nadu. Out of 36 lakh metric tonnes average demand for rice 24 lakh metric tonnes will be supplied to people below poverty line and the remaining 12 lakh metric tonnes will be purchased at the tie-over price and the State will meet any additional demand.Why were priority households (PHH) identified then? The Act requires all States to earmark PHH based on their financial stability. The Civil Supplies Corporation of the State began door-to-door verification of ration cards and linked the Aadhaar numbers of beneficiaries.A single member cardholder would continue to get 12 kg even though NFSA prescribes only 5 kg per unit. The ceiling of 20 kg per card has also been waived. A family with 10 members in ration card would be eligible for 50 kg of rice per month, a statement from Kamaraj said.How are PHH identified?PHHs will comprise all BPL families, those benefitted under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), families headed by women or differently-abled persons and households of agricultural labourers."

This they did as all their earlier pleas to officials fell on deaf ears. They staged a protest in front of the ITDA in Utnoor. The hostel authorities are not providing us quality food and the hostel too is not properly maintained, they alleged.They also alleged that they are not served rice that is cooked with sanna biyyam (fine rice) as assured by the government. ITDA chairman Lakke Rao assured them that he would look into the issue. Later, deputy director of tribal welfare Pocham led the students back to the school.A report will be submitted to the project director and district collector, he said and added that a letter would be written to the civil supplies officials about the quality of rice. More than 310 students are studying at the ashram school."

By the days end, the team seized around 3,300 kg of rice, supplied through Tamil Nadus Public Distribution System (PDS), being smuggled into Andhra Pradesh. Elsewhere, a combined team of RPF and civil supplies department officials in Vellore district recovered a similar quantity of PDS rice from two trains on the Chennai-Bengaluru route.It is not just passengers and paid freight that Railways is carrying. Trains have become a mode of choice for smugglers looking to take PDS rice beyond State borders. The incidence of smuggling has now become so significant yet common that RPF (Chennai division) is well on track to beat last years record haul of 1.3 lakh kg. Till July 26, 2017, 75,452 kg of rice, worth a market value of around `3.77 lakh, has been seized from local and express trains. It is an offence under Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, 1980.However, they admit to facing a challenge in finding a link to the larger group behind such activities because individuals involved in smuggling easily escape the flying squad, leaving behind several unclaimed bags of rice.Explaining the modus operandi, an RPF inspector, on condition of anonymity, said several individuals are involved. The rice, packed in bags of varying quantities, is kept under seats and near toilets. Upon seeing a patrol team, the culprits feign knowledge and leave the place. We merely recover the bags and hand them over to the civil supplies department, the inspector added.Civil supplies department officials said there is less manpower to contain incidents of smuggling. But the core issue, they revealed, concerns the abuse of TNs universal PDS wherein everyone is entitled to a monthly quota.For commercial purposes, individuals divert PDS rice meant for domestic consumption. This is evident from bags of different quantities being found in trains, a food supply officer told Express. He added that it was normal to see an increase in smuggling during the first and second weeks of every month when rice is distributed through the PDS network.The officer suggested strengthening the presence of RPF or Government Railway Police (GRP) personnel at entry and exit points of stations, apart from increasing regular patrolling.Senior divisional Security Commissioner (RPF), Chennai division, Louis Amudan, said steps are being taken to discourage smuggling through trains. Permanent teams, consisting of four personnel, have been set up and deployed on two routes, namely Chennai-Gummidipoondi and Arakonnam-Renigunta, he said.RPF recovery of rice bags2016: 4,748 bags, containing 1.36 lakh kg. Total seizure is valued at C6.80 lakh (market rate)2017 (up to July 26): 2,657 bags, containing 75,452 kg. Total seizure is valued at C3.77 lakh (market rate)"

Youre back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix, chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an acute gastrointestinal event, happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually dont occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While its hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future. People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but its probably the thing before the last thing they ate, said Dr Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.It takes the stomach around four to six hours to empty a full meal, and then the small intestine takes about six to eight hours to squeeze out all the nutrients and empty into the colon. The remains linger there for another one to three days, fermenting and being formed into what ultimately is flushed down the toilet. The so-called bowel transit time varies significantly from person to person, but gastroenterologists said you can easily find out whats normal for you by eating corn and watching for when the indigestible kernels appear in your stool.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, youll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and dont have diarrhoea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhoea, its more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Most food-borne illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria, such as norovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, E coli and Bacillus cereus. So in addition to figuring out the correct time-frame of consumption, also consider what foods are more likely to be contaminated. Items cited frequently on the Food and Drug Administrations food recall list include leafy greens, culinary herbs, melons with textured surfaces like cantaloupe, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapeo peppers, nut butters, shellfish, frozen peas, cheese and ice cream.Also suspicious are any foods left out for several hours, like the classic potato salad at the family picnic or fried rice at a Chinese buffet.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. A fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows, Fisher said, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. The eggs in your two-egg omelette were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens, she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Lets not forget about germs on your own hands if youre not diligent about washing them with soap and water. Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop  or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom  and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract dont always come from food.And sometimes your gut distress isnt caused by a germ at all. It could be an overdose of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, known in public health circles as Fodmaps. These are essentially carbohydrates that, eaten in excess, are not well absorbed in the small intestine and then make their way into your colon to cause all kinds of trouble. They include myriad things were encouraged to eat including broccoli, brussels sprouts, radicchio, asparagus, avocados, mushrooms, peaches, whole grains and legumes.People are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps, said Dr Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. You could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your systems capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.Gastrointestinal eventsDrugs are also a common source of acute gastrointestinal events. Fisher mentioned the story of an otherwise healthy and active patient who had bouts of GI distress every few months or so. After many tests came back negative, she finally determined it was the ACE inhibitor he was taking to control his blood pressure.A side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions, Fisher said. He would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now hes fine.Medications used to treat depression, allergies and gastrointestinal reflux can also make you more vulnerable to intense, short duration attacks of vomiting or diarrhoea, or both. Recreational drugs could also be the culprit. Were starting to see more cyclic vomiting syndrome called cannabis hyperemesis because THC content of marijuana now is so high, Gabbard said, referring to psychoactive component of marijuana.Finally, theres stress. Whats going on in your head has an enormous impact on your gut and vice versa. The human brain and nervous system is very intimately mixed with another nervous system that is present in the walls of the intestine, said D Santhi Swaroop Vege, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic.So instead of something that you ate, it could be youve swallowed your fear, anxiety, anger or sadness and its wreaking havoc on the nerves, chemical secretions and microbiota that keep your bowels operating smoothly. Gastroenterologists as well as psychiatrists said its not uncommon for acute gastrointestinal events to cease or become less frequent after a patient quits a bad job or leaves a bad relationship. Thats why, when making a difficult decision, you might just want to trust your gut."

The agency is taking additional measures to make sure the entire stock is free from adulteration by launching prime quality-check procedures, said managing director M Ramanunni and chairman M Mehboob.The stringent quality-check mechanism is being launched following increasing reports on fake and adulterated products in the market.We have entered into an agreement with the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India to use their laboratory for checking the quality of products supplied by various suppliers, said Ramanunni.Essentials like rice and chilly will undergo additional quality checks and only products which meet nationally-stipulated parameters will be sold through our outlets.The essentials - 43 items out of which 13 of them will be sold at subsidised rates - a family requires for Onam will be available at the fairs. This year we have added more products to the list, said Ramanunni.Last year, the agency has conducted 1,264 Onam trade fairs. The state government has already allotted a subsidy of Rs 60 crore to Consumerfed, out of which Rs 40 crore will be provided in advance. Apart from Triveni outlets, the primary agricultural, consumer, SC/ST and fishermens societies will join hands with Consumerfed for the Onam Fairs.We have already settled arrears of Rs 182 crore to various suppliers who were hesitant to provide goods because of the non payment of dues by the previous administration, said Ramanunni.Now, we are paying 60 per cent of the total cost at the time of delivery of goods and the rest will be paid within 25 days. This has helped us to regain the confidence of suppliers.Order online from Consumerfed for OnamKochi: Consumerfeds online facility enabling home delivery of goods will be launched this Onam. However, the facility will initially be restricted to bulk orders by residents associations, active societies and related agencies. The pilot phase will be launched in Thiruvananthapuram. The consumer can place orders through Consumerfeds official website. Once the online payment is made, the goods will be delivered, said Consumerfed managing director M Ramanunni. The agencys vehicles will be used for the delivery. To ensure timely delivery, Consumerfed is planning to appoint people on the basis of a self-employment scheme by which they will paid for each delivery. After assessing the result of the primary phase, the online services will be extended to other districts, he said."

(Express Photo/Ravi Kanojia, File) There was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over the alleged association of Hindu deities with alcohol. (Express Photo/Ravi Kanojia, File)I was amused to read in the media that there was a ruckus in the Rajya Sabha over the alleged association of Hindu deities with alcohol. Since the objectionable remarks were expunged, I am not able to refer specifically to the god or to the MP who mentioned him. Our politicians may not be well versed in all our ancient lore specially because and knowledge of the past is not their strong point; but it is not too much to expect that they should have the basic idea of the qualities and activities of the divinities whom they worship and defend. For constraints of space it is not possible to discuss here the traits of all those gods and goddesses who used alcohol, but I would like to draw the attention of readers to only few of them who binged on intoxicating drinks.In the Vedic texts soma was the name of a god as well as of a plant from which a heady drink of that name was derived and was offered to gods in most of the sacrifices; according to one opinion it was different from another intoxicating drink, sura, which was meant for the common people. Soma was a favourite beverage of the Vedic deities and was offered in most of the sacrifices performed to please gods like Indra, Agni, Varun, Maruts and so on, whose names occur frequently in the Rig Veda. Of them Indra, who is known by 45 epithets and to whom the largest number of Rig Vedic hymns  250 out of more than a thousand  are dedicated, was the most important. A god of war and wielder of thunderbolt, rowdy and adulterous, potbellied from excessive drinking, he is described in Vedic passages as a great boozer and dipsomaniac; he is said to have drunk three lakes of soma before slaying the dragon Vritra. Like Indra, many other Vedic gods were soma drinkers but they do not seem to have been tipplers. Agni, for example, may have drunk moderately though a detailed analysis will show that teetotalism was unknown to the Vedic gods and drinking was an essential feature of sacrifices performed in their honour. In a ritual performed at the beginning of the Vajapeya sacrifice, a collective drinking took place in which a sacrificer offered five cups to Indra as well as 17 cups of soma and 17 cups of sura to 34 gods.Like the Vedic texts, the epics provide evidence of the use of intoxicating drinks by those who enjoy godly status in Hindu religion. In the Mahabharata, for example, Sanjay describes Krishna (an incarnation of the god Vishnu) and Arjuna in the company of Draupadi and Satyabhama (wife of Krishna and an incarnation of Bhudevi), exhilarated by Bassia wine. In the Harivamsa, which is an appendix to the Mahabharata, Balarama, an avatara of Vishnu, is described as inflamed by plentiful libations of kadamba liquor dancing with his wife. And in the Ramayana, Rama, an avatara of Vishnu, is described as embracing Sita and making her drink pure maireya wine. Sita, incidentally, seems to have a great fascination for wine: While crossing the river Ganga, she promises to offer her rice cooked with meat (shall we call it biryani!) and thousands of jars of wine, and while being ferried across the Yamuna, she says that she will worship the river with a thousand cows and 100 jars of wine when her husband accomplishes his vow. The use of alcohol by the gods is not confined to the Vedic and epic traditions. In the Puranic mythology, Varuni, who emerged from the samudramanthana (churning of the ocean), is the Indian goddess of wine; Varuni was also the name of a variety of strong liquor.The Tantric religion is characterised by the use of five makaras  madya (wine), mamsa (meat), matsya (fish), mudra (gesture) and maithuna (sexual intercourse)  and these were offered to gods, though only the followers of Vamachara were entitled to the use of panchamakara (five Ms). Much can be said about the Tantric affiliation of the goddess Kali and her various manifestations but it should suffice to refer to a goddess called Chandamari, a form of Kali and described in an 11th century text as using human skulls as drinking vessels. In the Kularnavatantra, an early medieval text, it is stated that wine and meat are the symbols of Shakti and Shiva respectively and their consumer is Bhairava. Not surprisingly, liquor was offered to Bhairava in early India. The practice has continued in our own times and one can see this at Bhairava temple in Delhi and at Kala Bhairava temple in Ujjain. According to a practice current in Birbhum, a gigantic vessel of wine is brought in front of the deity called Dharma who is carried in a procession to the house of a Sundi, who belongs to the wine-making caste. In both Tantric and tribal religions, the divinities are often associated with alcohol in various ways. These few examples cited here clearly show that some gods and goddesses were fond of alcohol and their worship would remain incomplete without it.It may be pointed out that there were a large variety of intoxicating drinks, nearly 50 types of them, available in ancient India. The use of alcohol by men was quite common, despite occasional dharmashatric objections in the case of Brahmins; and instances of drinking among women were not rare. Buddhist Jataka literature mentions many instances of drunkenness. Sanskrit literature is replete with references to intoxicating drinks. The works of Kalidasa and other poets speak frequently of alcoholic drinks. Ancient Indians were bon vivant in a sense. If their gods were fond of good things of life, our politicians need not be offended by the divine hedonism.

5a0dd9449855b76bf13d18da,"GST Council approves e-way bill, cuts textile job levy; Finance Minister appeals to pass on tax benefits",http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/aug/05/gst-council-approves-e-way-bill-cuts-textile-job-levy-finance-minister-appeals-to-pass-on-tax-bene-1638918.html,2017-08-05,"NEW DELHI: The GST rates on textile job works like stitching and embroidery, and tractor parts were today cut while e-way bill provisions relating to online pre-registration of goods before transportation were relaxed.The all-powerful GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising representatives of all states, decided to tax all job works in the textile sector, from embroidery to weaving, at 5 per cent instead of previously decided 18 per cent. This 5 per cent rate will be applicable for job works in apparel, shawls and carpets.To make farm equipment cheaper, tractor parts would attract the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate of 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent previously.Government work contracts would attract 12 per cent GST with input tax credit, Jaitley said.The Council also gave in-principle approval to anti-profiteering measures and setting up of a Screening Committee in 15 days to see if tax reductions after implementation of GST have been passed on to consumers.Briefing reporters after the 20th meeting of the Council, Jaitley said all goods worth over Rs 50,000 will have to be pre-registered online before they are moved for sale beyond 10 km.GST-exempted goods have been kept out of the purview of e-way bill-- a minor relaxation from draft rules which required for all goods to be pre-registered under the e-way bill provision. The e-way bill mechanism is likely to come into force by October 1.The permits thus issued would be valid for one day for movement of goods for 100 km and in same proportion for following days.As per the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on distance to be travelled -- one day for 100 km, 3 days (100 to less than 300 km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km) and 10 days (500- less than 1,000 km). He said more than 71 lakh central and state taxpayers have migrated to the GST system and have completed registration. Another 15.67 lakh new applications for registration have been received.He appealed to businesses to pass on the benefit of the reduced tax under the GST to consumers, failing which the anti-profiteering mechanism will be triggered.The Council will meet next on September 9 in Hyderabad during which it will take up the issue of many rice millers deregistering their brands to escape taxation under the GST.As per the GST rates, unbranded food items are exempted, where as branded and packed food items attract 5 per cent rate.Jaitley said that the GST Council has given in-principle approval to pan India e-way bill. ""There will be no check post. The process will be technology-driven and human intervention would be minimised. It will be reviewed going forward,"" he said.With regard to anti-profiteering provision, Jaitley said many businesses are not passing the benefit of tax rate reduction under GST. The market mechanism should compel that they give benefit of input credit,"" he said, hoping that there would be ""minimal"" use of anti profiteering provision and the provision should itself act as a deterrent.Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said that states will set up their respective screening committee within 15 days and the Centre will also set up the Standing Committee in same time frame. These committees would be the first point for receiving profiteering complaints.The Council in its meeting today also decided to exempt goods and services related to Junior FIFA World Cup which will be hosted by India. Besides, aggregators who are offering small housekeeping services like plumbing or others will have to pay GST under Reverse Charge Mechanism. Besides, Cab service providers will have to pay 12 per cent GST if they claim input credit, and without input credit it would be 5 per cent.Commenting on the decision, Pratik Jain, Partner and Leader Indirect Tax, PwC said exemption from e-way bill for exempted products or transportation within 10 km provides some relief to the industry. ""However, for real benefit of GST to be realised, it is important that supply chain bottlenecks are reduced. It is debatable as to whether e-way bill is required at all or transport documents including copy of the invoice should suffice,"" he said.Also, reduction of rate on job work relating to textile sector is a good news for the industry and would reduce the invested duty structure in the sector.The Finance Minister also talked about the issue of registered trademark on food products where 5 per cent tax is being avoided. ""Hopefully, this issue will be sorted out in the next meeting,"" he said.On the appeal made to industry to pass on the benefit of input credt, he said it is good to see that the Government has taken a more consultative approach on anti-profiteering measures and for avoiding price increase. However, industry would expect a clear guideline as how the profit on account of GST needs to be computed, he said.Vishal Raheja, Senior Consultant, Taxmann said currently, taxpayers are facing difficult in absence of centralised way bill as every State has made its own rules but after e-way bill rules are notified, there will be common procedure all- over India.""The major relief is that dealers engaged in supply of only exempted goods are not required pre-registration for movement of their goods,"" he said."

As return for investment, FCI guarantees hiring of the godown constructed by a private party for 10 years.The guarantee period for CWC or state government agencies is nine years. The location and capacity for godowns are identified as per storage requirements by State Level Committees (SLC) and finally approved by the High Level Committee (HLC) headed by Chairman and Managing Director, FCI.Under PEG scheme, investment for construction of godowns is done by private parties, CWC, SWCs and other state agencies by arranging their own funds and land.No funds are allocated by the government for construction of godowns, he said.Paswan said following a initiative of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the employees of the FCI would now get pension and post retirement medical benefits."

Crossing the mouth of the Buckingham Canal, the trees lining the highway give way to expansive panoramic fields with row upon row of square water patches. Spread over 4,000 acres, the Marakkanam salt pans are the third largest producer of salt in Tamil Nadu.As we walk towards the grey and pale blue landscape, broken by small piles of white crystal salt shimmering in the sun  the pretty picture does well to hide a not-so-pretty condition of salt production here.Abinaya Kalyanasundaram walks through the mounds taking pictures and giving you an account of the towns history of what was once the most important currency during trade (salt) and see lives of those who are steeped every day in the corrosive, scorching evaporation ponds raking out crystal salt.Whats in a name?Right at the entrance to the town is Bhoomeswarar temple, a 1,000-year old Shiva shrine. The myth goes that a devotee, on his way to to Kasi on a pilgrimage, stayed in the area for a while. He placed a marakka  a pot used to measure rice and grains  and prayed to it considering it Shiva. Over the years, the marakka disappeared  some say stolen, while others claim it was buried. While digging up the place where it was known to stand, they discovered a lingam. The word marakka kaanom, which means the maraka is missing, became Marakkanam. There are even myths that say recent excavations near the Bhoomeswarar temple turned up copper coins and rings, and other objects from the medieval periods.From water to saltSalt pan work begins during early January. Preparatory works take around two months, to undo the damage of the rains to the pans.Firstly, the land will be levelled. Sea sand will be brought in and labourers stamp in the sand and mud for days to bring it to a levelled state. The furrows and bunds will be repaired and built again.Salt water stored in a separate reservoir is opened and allowed to flow into the separate pans through a connected pipe system; once water is filed halfway in each pan, the pipes are sealed.Water is exposed to sunlight which allows the temperature to rise. The salt settles at temperatures of 24-25 degrees.After three to four days of standing, the settled salt is raked in. Its a laborious long process, and the collected salt is taken to bigger piles, covered under blue tarpaulin sheets.Life of a salt pan workerOver 4,000 acres of Marakkanam salt pans are leased out to individuals, who hire their own workers. Around 1,000 workers can be seen working every day during peak season. Daily work starts from 6 am and goes on till 2 pm with breaks for meals in between. The men rake while the women carry piles from the pans to the large collective pile, but this divide is now blurred with both doing all jobs. The payment divide is, however, stark and clear. Men receive `400 per day, while women get a mere `150 a day, a salary determined on the assumption that men work for five hours a day, while women work for two.How it beganSalt was a very valuable commodity in ancient times. In fact, the word salary is believed to have its origin from the word salt. In Marakkanam, all land under salt production belonged to the temple, until the East India Company brought it under its control. The government established monopoly on salt trade under which manufacturers were required to sell salt to the Government at a fixed rate. There was a port here during the Sangam period, and historic references indicate trade was carried out here during the Nalliyakondans rule. A few kilometres from Marakkanam are the ruins of Alamparai Fort, which served as a port during the 1700s, and salt being a prime commodity of trade, many traders. settled in the region.Seasons of saltSalt production in Marakkanam starts from January and goes on till August, peaking during the agni natchathiram months  April and May (peak summer). While farmers look up expectantly for rain, salt pan workers look up fearfully when grey clouds approach. During rainy season, water temperature drops to 6 or 7 degrees and rains disturb the settled salt in the pans. And once the Buckingham canal floods, the entire area is submerged in water. During rainy seasons, salt pan workers find other odd jobs to survive.Marakkanams declineWith a rise in prawn fishing culture in the region, the wastewater from these culture farms are disposed into the backwaters, which adversely affects the water used for salt production. There is also a decreasing number of salt labourers owing to the adverse working conditions, lack of incentives and unpredictable weather which affects production.Wholesale rateMarakkanam produces only common edible salt. The common salt thats collected is distributed wholesale to Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The raw crystal salt, or kallu uppu, is sold wholesale to nearby towns as well. The cost of salt is determined by its whiteness. Good white salt gets sold for over`120 per bag which is around 100 kg; thats approximately 1 kilo of salt for `1!Other salt pans in TNTamil Nadu is the second largest producer of salt in India next to Gujarat. Salt pans are possible in swampy areas, where sand and mud co-exist, called kazhivelli in Tamil. Proximity to the sea is an obvious mandate. Tamil Nadus major salt production areas are Thoothukudi and Vedaranyam, followed by Marakkanam. There are also small pans that produce industrial salt near Mahabalipuram, and in Chooonambedu and Cheyyur in sparse quantities."

According to tradition, a farmer of this village promised this deity a share of the produce from his land. Though rewarded with a bountiful yield, the farmer did not keep up his promise. The rice grains, heaped like a hill, suddenly changed to a hill of stone. Accepting the apology of the repentant farmer, the deity took a single rice grain with two fingers and gave back the rest to the farmer. It is believed that this is reason why Vaikunthavasa Perumal is seen holding a rice grain in his left hand and that Nemili is the changed form of the word Nelmalai or hill of grains.The main sanctum houses the large image of Vaikunthavasa Perumal in a seated posture on Adisesha under the Pushpakoti Vimana. Also known as Veetrinunda Perumal, the deity holds the sankha (conch) and the prayoga chakra (discus ready to be hurled at the foes of his loyal devotees). The lower right hand is positioned in abhaya, which assures protection, while two fingers of the left hand hold a single grain of rice. Seated on either side of the deity are Goddesses Sridevi and Bhudevi. The utsava-murti or the bronze processional image here is called Nitya Kalyana Perumal.Numerous donative epigraphs in Tamil are inscribed here, the oldest belonging to the reign of Aparajitavarman, one of the last Pallava kings who ruled from Kanchipuram.

There was total dereliction of duty on the part of various government officials. No valid licence was given to owner of the shop to sell the crackers. As the venue was congested due to Deepavali rush and there was no adequate entry and exit facilities, 32 people were charred to death on October 16, the judge noted.The judge fixed the compensation ranging from Rs 6 lakh to Rs 17 lakh each.

He rinsed out the previous nights dal and scooped a fist full of wet mud to use as detergent: to scrape off any stubborn remains. Minutes later, he arrived at the langar to pick up lunch for the Tamil farmers, who have been camping at Jantar Mantar for the past 10 days.Modi is just one of several names that 28-year-old Prakash Chidambaram goes by. His Facebook name, for instance, is Aksharp  inspired by the jumbled letter game in an English newspaper from the South.He was named after Indias Prime Minister after the first day of protests by Tamil farmers at Jantar Mantar. I wore a Modi mask when we were protesting and the name stuck.Fifteen minutes earlier, Prakash and Ramalingam had collected the two tins  vessels given to them by volunteers who dish out the langar at the gurdwara. After collecting the vessels, they began the one-kilometre walk from Jantar Mantar.This is how they recognise us when we go back each day, the men told The Indian Express, while pointing at the vessels. They said they will take an auto-rickshaw back  the contents of the tin too hot to balance on their heads even for a short walk.At the hand pump, where the men stop every day to rinse out the tins, Ramalingam cut his finger due to the sharp edges of the tin can. This would become the topic of conversation later between the Hindi-speaking volunteers and the Tamil-speaking farmers inside the gurdwara  past the ration storeroom stacked high with grains.Be careful of the edges, hold the tin from the top, advises 61-year-old Amarjeet Singh Taneja. The Tamil men nodded, unable to comprehend a word.The menu on Wednesday is mixed dal, aloo soya bean sabzi, rice and chapati  the wheat flat bread that Tamil stomachs find unfamiliar and hard to digest. The oil, which is different from the one they use back home, doesnt suit their palate either, they said.Prakash is invited to have a closer look at the choice. He picks the aloo soya bean sabzi over the dal and rice over the chapati.This wont be enough, scolds the older Ramaligam. How will this be enough for all of us? Go, ask for more Prakash does, and also picks up a small stack of chapatis on his way out. Some of his colleagues have acquired a taste, he admitted.During the walk, Prakash reminisced about home  how his younger brother would steal the TV remote and how his mother would cook food.The problem here (in Delhi) is the side-dish, he said, adding, Its not spicy enough. I miss my mothers cooking. I have never eaten out back home in Tiruchi.P Krishnan, 65, agreed. He was lying on his side on a plastic sheet at Jantar Mantar thinking about idlis. Its chapati for breakfast, chapati for lunch, and chapati for dinner, he laughed. I went to the Kerala House mess nearby and paid money and ate a plate of idlis.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

Identifying illegal immigrants from authentic Bengali-speaking Muslims living for generations in Assam has been a herculean task which neither the Asom Gana Parishad and Congress nor the present BJP government has taken any initiative into.With no traditional land holdings in Assam, many of the newer immigrants take shelter in the Brahmaputras river islets. However, with erosion gradually reducing land, many of them have shifted to the mainland of the districts, creating a rift with the local populace who fear being reduced to a minority.Over the past two years, we have lost some 16 sq km (over 50 per cent of total land) of our islet to the Brahmaputra due to which over 35 per cent of the total population has left our islet to settle in the mainland where it is much safer, said Samsul Haq of Bolodmari islet north of Goalpara town.Despite the reduction in numbers, Bolodmari still boasts of a population of 19,500 spread over seven revenue villages, of which two are dominated by Bengali Dalits and the remaining five by Bengali Muslims.Nagor Ali (45) goes to relief camps every year during the floods. When he built a pucca house near the main road of the islet in 2014, he never imagined that the Brahmaputra bank some 2 km away would come 10 metres from his door and devour the main road. I would soon have to leave with just the tin roof of my house, laments Ali.The Rabha and Rajbongshi indigenous communities of the 3,000-strong Kokira village are scared of Nagor Alis arrival. They live in dual fear of being washed by flash floods from Meghalaya and of the influx of Muslim migration from the Brahmaputra bank.Surviving the 2004 deluge was a challenge. All our cattle died and we took shelter on roofs. All the kuccha houses had collapsed but we somehow faced no human casualty. But on the other side of the Bongaigaon-Guwahati National Highway 31 in Bolbolla village, more than 200 people died. Many of the deceased were immigrants from the islets who did not know that our area was prone to flash floods from Meghalaya, said Kamal Roy, a primary school teacher in Kokira village.We fear that the residents of the islets may soon cross over the national highway and encroach our lands near the foothills, said Ajay Rabha of Kokira village.On the other hand, the residents of Bolbolla village say giving shelter to the migrants is a good deed. A closer look at the structure of houses differentiates old residents and those recently migrated from the islets. While the old residents have pucca and Assam-style houses made of mud and bamboo, the newer entrants have mostly constructed their houses with tin.According to Islam, we ought to provide shelter to asylum-seekers. The economically stronger people of our village helped the migrants build houses. We lost a lot of people in the 2004 deluge. Hence, during the 2014 floods we were well prepared and saw minimal loss of human life, said Mohammad Ashraful of Bolbolla.Deluge differences between the indigenous communities and the migrants have paved way to cooperation and camaraderie. We owe a lot to the residents of Kokira who alerted us beforehand during the 2014 floods. We prepared ourselves accordingly overnight which helped us prevent a repeat situation of 2004, added Ashraful.Kokira resident Tarun Roy, who goes to relief camps annually during floods after his kuccha house is washed away and he cannot afford a pucca structure, says floods unite the communities and pushes animosity to the side.In the relief camps, all of us are flood victims. We dont see Assamese or Rajbongshi or Muslim at the camps. We share the scant khichdi (stew of rice and pulses) and the biscuits given to us by government agencies and NGOs.We dont hesitate to share spaces with people of other communities which would have never happened during normal times, Roy says."

I graduated from the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Nagpur, in 2000 and then a six-month training with Le Meridien, Pune, sealed my entry into the industry.Later, I moved to Mumbai where I worked in two different places for around four years before moving to Dubai, where I worked in an Indian restaurant for another two years. I went back to Hyderabad. But soon I moved to Singapore, and 18 months later flew to Dammam, Saudi Arabia, where I cooked Italian, Chinese, Indian, and of course, Lebanese dishes. And now I have been with Le Royal Meridien, Chennai for the last three months.Though I have been to so many places and cooked a variety of cuisines, my speciality is definitely Indian cuisine. I have always loved Indian food. Firstly, this is what we have been eating in our families from our childhood, so it is familiar food. Secondly, in Indian cuisine, there is a burst of flavours in every single dish. Since I have worked abroad in Indian kitchens, I have seen the kind of love and respect people have for Indian food, and especially when there is a fusion of Indian and another cuisine.I am very particular about the ingredients I use. In Singapore, 40% of the people are Indian, so finding our ingredients wasnt difficult. But in other places, the ingredients would be shipped down to us. Like I said, flavours are very important in Indian cuisine; even if you miss out one, the taste will change, and you dont want to compromise on that.My best dishes have to be my Galouti Kebab  a lamb preparation, Paneer Kurkure Tikka, Awadi Murgh Kali Mirch and of course my biryanis. My favourite however is the Lucknowi biryani. What I love most about it is that the flavours are so mild. Unlike the Hyderabadi biryani which is spicier and has a richer infusion of ingredients, the Lucknowi biryani has no vegetables in it, but just the chicken or meat and rice, but still it is full of flavours.An important thing about cooking is checking the temperature. You can be a good cook, ifyou know how to make that judgement. For example, when making biryani, the rice needs a low temperature to cook but the lamb needs to be cooked at a high temperature. So the magic truly is in the balance.Though my speciality is Indian food, I have also worked with other cuisines...I would love to explore more of the Spanish cuisine. I know a couple of popular Spanish dishes  Spanish Ratatouille, Chorizo, Spanish Omelette etc. but I would love to learn how to prepare more dishes. Out of the guests who visit the hotel, around 20% are non-Indians and sometimes they ask for Spanish food. I dont like refusing any of my guests."

See what Kerala's Binesh Balan braved to get to London,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/aug/07/so-st-students-have-it-easy-see-what-keralas-binesh-balan-braved-to-get-to-london-1639749.html,2017-08-07,"KASARGOD: Last week, Binesh Balan (25) touched down in London to pursue a master's degree in anthropology at the University of Sussex. It was a dream come true for the son of daily-wagers from a community classified as a Scheduled Tribe in Kerala.The passage to England, a matter of ease for students from more privileged classes, was a hard-fought one for him. For four years, Binesh Balan fought a casteist bureaucracy that was determined to fail him. But his resolve carried him through.When New Indian Express reached out to him on phone, it was 5.30 pm in London, and Balan was unwinding in his hostel room after his third day at the university. ""In the end, everything fell in place. It is liberating to be here,"" he said.Balan, a member of the Mavilan community from Kolichal village in Kasargod, is in London today on a National Overseas Scholarships for Scheduled Tribe students given by the Union government. The scholarship is given to only 20 students and Balan was the only one from Kerala to get it.Bitter battleIt had Balans dream since 2014 to go to London to study. He first got admission in the University of Sussex in November 2014 for classes starting in September 2015. He approached the Directorate of Scheduled Tribe Development for financial support.The department funds students from ST communities going to study abroad. ""I came to know of it when I saw an order of the directorate sanctioning Rs 20 lakh to the son of a PSC (Public Service Commission) member. That students family was well-off but he still got public money to study in France. So I knew I was deserving,"" says Balan, whose parents were daily wage labourers and had to give up work because of bad health.But the section officer in the directorate rejected Balans application, saying he would not get more than Rs 5 lakh. ""When I mentioned the PSC member's sons case as a precedent, the officer told me they had influence to pull it off,"" he recalls. And the file was closed.Not one to give up, Balan met the then minister for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes P K Jayalakshmi with the help of the then MLA V S Sunil Kumar, who is now a minister. ""She was encouraging and cleared a Rs 27 lakh scholarship for my education and other expenses,"" he says.But the officers refused to accept the ministers recommendation and sought clearance from the cabinet itself.As classes were to start in September, Balan wrote to the university seeking more time to secure funding, and was given an extension till January 2016.On October 15, 2015, the Oommen Chandy cabinet took up his application as a special case and cleared the minister's recommendation of Rs 27 lakh. But the higher officials in the directorate knew how to stonewall even the cabinets decision and Balan did not get any money.More than the denial of funding, the officials sniggering and casteist remarks were wounding to Balan. ""I met all their conditions for funding. Yet they could not help smirking at me because I was an Adivasi,"" Balan said.The student lodged a complaint with the Kerala State Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. ""But when I went to the directorate to ask about the status of my file, the undersecretary was derisive. He wanted to know why I had approached the commission,"" Balan said.The undersecretary reportedly told him he knew how to reply to a notice from the commission. Later, he called the section officer to his chamber and ""the two officials together harassed and humiliated me"".After denying him the opportunity, the officials reportedly told him: ""Now that you cannot go to London, why don't you try in some local universities?""Balan went home and applied again, and got admission for the next academic year in the same university.By then the LDF had replaced the UDF in government but the attitude of the officials did not change. He missed out on going to London again.LSE dreamsThen Binesh Balan decided to give it a go to land the central government's National Overseas Scholarship. ""I attended the interview in Delhi on February 12, 2016 and the result came out in the same month. I was among 20 persons selected.""This time, he applied to the London School of Economics. He had scored only 55 per cent in his bachelor's degree against the requisite 70 per cent. ""But I had published a paper in the Asian Journal of Multidisciplinary Studies, and had a few unpublished works in my kitty,"" he says. That could have made a difference and he got admission in LSE for 2017.But he had to change his home university to Sussex as his overseas scholarship of Rs 47 lakh per year was falling short of the expense he would incur in the city.By then the media had taken up his cause and minister for Scheduled Tribes A K Balan immediately cleared Rs 1.5 lakh for his IELTS training at the British Council in Chennai and for his air tickets to London. ""I could not use the money for the air ticket because my visa was cancelled again,"" he says.This year too Balan was not expecting his visa to be cleared, but it came through on July 21, a Friday, and he had to join classes on July 31. ""A well-wisher in Wayanad booked me an air ticket to Delhi. Officials in the Ministry of External Affairs were very supportive and cleared my papers in four days,"" he says.The same well-wisher, who Balan calls Amachi he never met, booked him an air ticket to London too.Unnoticed childhoodBalan had a tough childhood. Rice was a luxury, and jackfruit seed was the staple food at home. ""I started working to support myself in class 4 by picking arecanut for farmers. I did labour work till my under-graduation,"" he says. Only when he joined MBA did he have the confidence to give tuitions to students to earn money.He says he was discriminated against on a daily basis by teachers, neighbours and schoolmates. ""No one noticed me in my school. But once after class 7, I happened to stumble on an internet cafe during a vacation and that changed my life,"" he says.After the vacation in class 8, he was a star because he knew computers'. ""I used the internet to learn programming and even Michael Jackson's moves,"" he says. He realised technology was a great leveller.After class 12, when he wanted to pursue computer education in Bengaluru, a local politician scuttled his hope of getting funding and he joined St Pius X College in Rajapuram to study for a degree in development economics.Now, Balan says, he will return to India only after getting a PhD from Harvard or Oxford or from any of top universities of the world. ""I do not want their money. I will come back and hope to make a difference."""

(File | PTI)DARJEELING: Clashes between the police and Gorkhaland supporters today resulted in injuries to several persons on both sides at Jaigoan in Alipurduar district, bordering Bhutan.The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) and the other hill parties took out a rally at Jaigaon on the 46th day of an indefinite strike called by the GJM in the hills.According to the police, clashes broke out between the securitymen and the Gorkhaland supporters after the participants in the rally, carrying kukris (Gorkha knives), hurled stones and petrol bombs at the police personnel.The police tried to convince the GJM supporters to refrain from attacking, but the agitators remained defiant and broke the first two barricades. They kept hurling stones at the police, who then resorted to using water cannons and firing tear gas shells, besides using batons to disperse the crowd.At this, the protesters turned violent and set a few vehicles, including those of the police, afire.Several police personnel and Gorkhaland supporters were injured in the clashes, the police said.The GJM claimed that the police resorted to indiscriminate firing. The police, however, denied the allegation.Similar processions were taken out at Kalchini.GJM supporters took out rallies at the Chowkbazar area of the hills, carrying black flags as a mark of protest against police action on Gorkhaland supporters.Shouting slogans against the West Bengal government, they demanded an immediate intervention by the Centre.Gorkhaland supporters, armed with knives, swords and kukris, had tried to forcibly enter Siliguri yesterday, demanding that the town be included into the separate state of Gorkhaland.In the Naxalbari area of Darjeeling, the locals took out a rally against the GJM and their demand for Gorkhaland and set tyres on fire as a mark of protest against the ongoing agitation in the hills.In the Sukna area of the hills, which is close to Siliguri, the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the state took out an anti-GJM rally.The GJM and the other hill parties held an 'Anna Dan' (rice donation) rally during the day as a mark of protest against vehicles, carrying food supplies to the hills, being set ablaze in Siliguri.Each participant in the rally carried a handful of rice and other grains and donated it in a box, which will be handed over to the district administration and, in turn, will be sent to the West Bengal secretariat as a mark of protest.The police and security forces patrolled the streets of the hills and kept a tight vigil at all the entry and exit routes.Barring the medicine shops, all other business establishments, restaurants, hotels, schools and colleges remained closed.The workers of the GJM and various NGOs of the hills were seen distributing food among the people as the food supply has been severely hit due to the ongoing shutdown."
5a0de9209855b76bf13d220a,UP farmers in trouble as brick kiln units take over fertile land,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/jul/30/up-farmers-in-trouble-as-brick-kiln-units-take-over-fertile-land-1635781.html,2017-07-30,"ALIGARH: Farmer Ghayasuddin needed Rs 30,000 to get his daughter married. But weighed down by three successive years of drought and mounting debts, he found it impossible to put the money aside for the wedding.So, when a brick kiln unit offered to lease an acre of his land for three years, the farmer thought he had struck gold. When he was offered three times more than what he earned from his crops, he immediately gave his nod to the proposal.The farmer at Kodiyaganj Village in West Uttar Pradesh's Aligarh district was the first in his village to lease out fertile land to a brick kiln owner for Rs 45,000 a year.Today he regrets the day he said yes. For what he didn't know was after the unit had dug out four feet of the top soil, the land was no longer as fertile as it used to be.""The land I got back was less fertile. I tried to grow some crops but they were of poor quality and the yield was also low,"" Ghayasuddin said.With a construction boom across India, brick-making is a lucrative business in Uttar Pradesh villages, with hundreds of furnaces baking millions of bricks day and night.The story of Ghayasuddin turns the spotlight on many such hamlets in the region. Over 250 farmers in six villages Kodiyaganj, Sikanderpur, Akrabad, Sakra, Gabhana, Dadaun and Pilakhana - in Aligarh have leased out about 200 acres of land to around 100 brick kiln units in the last four years.Some farmers said they were forced to do it because the prolonged drought had pushed them to the brink of starvation.""The proposal by the brick kiln industries came when we were in desperate need of money. We were making Rs 12,000 per acre by growing crops and for the same acre we were paid Rs 45,000-60,000,"" said Imran Khan, a farmer from Sikandrabad who grew rice and wheat alternately on his field.A few farmers said they were forced to lease out their land when their surrounding fields were dug out, leaving their field at a higher level, which led to their soil being washed off to the neighbouring, quarried fields.Those who still held on found it increasingly difficult to irrigate their elevated land.Ramesh Singh, a resident of Pilakhana village, said he was against leasing out his land to brick kiln units but had to yield to them when his crops started dying because water couldn't reach his raised land.""On all three sides, there was quarried land, which made it impossible for water to reach my field. I know the degradation the quarrying will cause to my land, but I am helpless as my crops are dying either way,"" Singh said.Singh leased out four acres of land to Kamal Udyog for three years for Rs 50,000 per acre per year.The owner of the industry, Kamal Agarwal, however, stressed he was helping farmers of the area.""Without our industries, farmers would have starved. We are paying them nearly three times of what they would have got by selling their crops. Moreover, each brick kiln industry gives employment to at least 50 labourers,"" Agarwal said.The brick kiln industries operating in these six villages manufacture around 70-80 lakh bricks per month, he said.Smoke emissions from brick kilns contribute 9 per cent of the total emissions in India, studies say.""There is a huge environmental cost involved - from smoke emission and local air pollution to the loss of valuable topsoil,"" said Khurram Ahmed, a social activist.India, the second largest producer of bricks in the world after China, manufactures nearly 200 billion bricks a year, a 2015 CSE report said.About 70 per cent of these bricks are produced in the Indo-Gangetic plains, which have one of the world's most fertile alluvial plains, Punjab State Council for Science and Technology said in a 2009 report.""Brick fields are mostly situated on riverine fertile agricultural land as they need clayish, silty, loamy, clay loam or silt loam soil with good texture,"" Ahmed added.After the brick kiln industries have excavated the top soil, farmers are forced to grow either rice or millet, crops that require more water. Because of water-logging in their fields, they find it difficult to grow vegetables and other crops such as wheat and corn on their once fertile land.""Water logging in the quarried land is a common problem.farmers are forced to grow crops that require excess water. In some cases, water logging makes it impossible for them to grow any other kind of crop,"" Ahmed said.Building construction in India is estimated to grow at a rate of 6.6 per cent per year between 2005 and 2030 providing a steady demand for bricks. The brick making industry is utilising 2.5 crore tonnes of coal and other biomass fuels per year, government reports have said.Brick kiln industries consumed 25,20,000 cubic metres soil during 1995-2010, said a 2015 report in the International Journal of Innovative Research Development. The industry has been closed in many big cities of India for polluting the environment but has started mushrooming in the countryside.Although the government is encouraging the use of ecofriendly fly ash bricks, it will be a while before red bricks are replaced because of lack of awareness about the harmful effects of brick kiln units on the environment, he said.""The construction boom is feeding the brick kiln industries across the country but the cost being paid is too high. Shrinking of agriculture land is pushing us towards a dooming agrarian crisis and there is a dire need to switch to more environment-friendly options,"" Ahmed said."

Dilip Kagda Vanita grows ladys fingers, cluster beans, cucumbers, pumpkins and bitter gourd. Dilip KagdaWhile farmers continue to feature in news and television debates, Vanita Thakre, a tribal from the Warli community living in the forests of the Aarey Milk Colony, may not be among those that come to mind at once. On the green patch surrounded by concrete-riddled western suburbs of Mumbai, the Aarey Milk Colony is home to families who farm for a living. And like the farming community elsewhere in the state, they look forward to every monsoon.Thakre, like most of the tribals in Aarey, grows vegetables in her small farm and sells them in the nearby market in Andheri (East). Starting May, Thakre begins preparing the seeds for sowing and as the monsoon approaches she sows them in her vegetable farm.In two-three months, the vegetables are ready and I get a good harvest for at least three to four months until the plant dies, says Thakre. Among the different vegetables she grows are ladys finger, cluster beans, cucumber, pumpkin and bitter gourd. She harvests them early morning and takes them on her head to the Vijay Nagar market. Selling around 10 kg in a day, she makes around Rs 500 per day.I have to reach there by 9 am otherwise, there is no space left to sit. We sell there until 1 pm when the crowd begins to thin. If we still have vegetables left, then we walk around in the neighbourhood, calling out to people to buy them at cheaper prices, adds the 35-year-old farmer.Thakre uses only natural fertilisers and pesticides. She uses cow dung as fertiliser and the burnt ash from the kitchen firewood as pesticide. We are not aware of the other medicines that can be used. These are natural products that farmers have traditionally used for their crops. We do not even procure the seeds from outside and instead collect them from our own harvest, she says.The tribal community in Aarey has demarcated different markets for selling their produce according to their area. Tribals living at Picnic Point sell at Marol, those at Keltipada go to Jogeshwari and others like us from Khambachapada go to Vijay Nagar, she explains.Thakre also does paddy cultivation. Sowing them in the monsoon, she harvests them by Diwali. I do not sell the rice in the market and only grow it for the family. Since our land is not too big, we do not manage to grow for the whole years need, but it suffices for at least three to four months. It is still cheaper and better when it is grown at home, she says. Farming is a family affair for the Thakres, with her three children also helping in the field. Her husband works as a gardener in an apartment complex in Aarey but he also pitches in on his off days. Owing to a lack of irrigation system, Vanita can indulge in farming activities only during the monsoon. During the rest of the year, she takes on odd jobs, like collecting firewood from the forests, cutting grass for the stables or working at a construction site.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It's very hot inside but cheap to rebuild after the floods. Being poor people, we can't afford to build strong structures. Also, heavy buildings will collapse in the soft soil.""The only things permanent in the islets are the boats, fishing nets, the plough and the spirit to carry on. Mostly engaged in fishing and farming for a livelihood, the residents of the islets take utmost care to repair their family boats which rescue them every year when flood water submerges their lands.Delawar Hussain of Aminerchar islet southwest of Dhubri town said, ""Almost every year we are rendered homeless during monsoon and have to either take shelter in the 'mainland' near Dhubri town or search for newer destinations in the islets. Many times we return to find our houses beyond repair after the floods. We either have to rebuild them or move to new areas.""""Ferrying humans is easy during floods but transporting livestock is difficult because of which many of us sell our cattle during Eid because of approaching monsoon,"" he added.With Bangladesh at a stone's throw, where beef costs Rs 500-Rs 700 every kilogram, selling off cattle before monsoon also helps the residents sustain through the rains. With a porous riverine border, many of the islets' residents may also be involved in cattle smuggling.According to the dominant narrative of temporary shelters in islets, elected representatives also don't think beyond giving temporary relief. ""Char residents demand that something be done. But, we can't build RCC embankments in chars as the river changes its course every year. While the river submerges an area, it gives rise to another piece of land somewhere else. So, people who lost their houses move to that new land. Char residents don't think of living in one area for more than two years,"" said Mohoruddin Sheikh, president of Falimari Gram Panchayat which has around 10 villages with 35,000 population. Half of the 10 villages are revenue villages and the other half are river islets.Sheikh, said, ""Besides giving food for flood-affected people and their livestock, we attempt to divert the current of Brahmaputra away from the chars by establishing rows of bamboo embankments. But, we know that such temporary measures won't work.""What can possibly work in protecting from the annual deluge of Brahmaputra is strong continuous embankments. Sheikh said, ""We had demanded a 20 kilometer-long road-cum-bund from Patharghat in Gauripur town to Zila Parishad office in Dhubri town. The bund would protect a lot of villages and prevent them from getting cut off. The project was estimated to be worth around Rs 56 crore but later estimation was hiked to Rs 100 crore. If the bund is not created, subsequent floods would break into Dhubri town as well.""However, many of the flood victims are vexed with verbal assurances and know where their power lies. Mohammad Atif Hussain of Dhubirchar islet said, ""We hear assurances of politicians during elections but don't see them during floods. Hence, we have decided to boycott the next elections and will mobilise people in mosques to not vote. Probably then, administration would listen to us.""Residents of islets lying near the border of Bangladesh don't even have the option of boycotting votes in protest against government apathy. ""Voters ID cards are the proof of our Indian nationality and voting during elections is like giving attendance of presence on Indian soil. We definitely have to vote in each and every election,"" said Mohammad Kader (name changed), a resident of Muthakhowa part II islet near the border.Receiving no or scant relief, many want answers from the government. ""We heard that Modi gave Rs 2,500 crore. But, we did not receive even plastic sheets. We got only some rice and husk for our cattle. Where is all the money going?"" said Shoaib Ali of Moslabari islet."

(Express)LAKHIMPUR: His life is wedded to floods. They have been a common reality, all through his 76 years of life. Sibaram Das migrated to Amtola Milanpur in Assams North Lakhimpur district 20 years ago, from his native Gualgaon Molabindha, which is about 30 km away in the river island of Majuli.Majuli has a history of floods and I grew up being ravaged by them, says Das. In 1997, I decided to migrate to Amtola Milanpur, which was considered a safer place, along with my wife Memsi, seven sons and two daughters. We settled on a piece of government land beside the Ronganadi river.But life here has been no different. Floods wash away our house and livestock every year, he says, while the cavalcade of Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi passes behind him. Gandhi visited a nearby village which turned into a virtual desert after the angry Ronganadi breached its embankment for about 200 meters.Memsi and their son Jone are excited about the Gandhi scions visit. They have been waiting since morning by the riverside, where the leader is expected to speak to flood-ravaged villagers. Das house was also washed away in the floods. The family is among the many lodged in a makeshift enclosure on the embankment. District authorities provide them rice and pulses, which help them get by. Jone is a daily wage labourer. So are six of his other children; but they live elsewhere. Both his daughters have been married off.I dont know how I will rebuild the thatched house. I have no savings, says Das helplessly. In its current form, the house stands on bamboo poles without a roof or any side fences. Jone had collected bamboo poles from a neighbour to erect the poles.Das says he was into agriculture at one point of time, back in his native in Majuli. But I had to give up due to floods and soil erosion. After I migrated, I maintained the family for almost two years selling firewood that I collected from the forest. Later, I sold fish. But now, it has been three years since my health failed and I stopped working, says Das.Das hopes are pinned on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sarbananda Sonowal cannot solve this problem. But Modi can, for he is the PM. I appeal to him to rescue us from this perennial problem. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi, who had spent 10 minutes there, had left for another site.RaGa vows to fight for flood-hitCongress vice president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday visited Assams Lakhimpur district, the worst affected in the flood-ravaged state. I thought I must come to hear about your pain and understand the situation. I will fight for compensation; its is your right, he said"

""Yet even adapting to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise is a major task.""So, on the other hand, Asian countries have to find strategies for ensuring prosperity and security under unavoidable climate change within a healthy global development,"" he said."

Fresh seeding of the seasons paddy and all investments along it are lost to the floods. However, a lot of fishes from the two rivers have come into our inundated fields. So youngsters from affected families venture out since morning to fish in the flood-waters. While we keep the major catch with us, we sell the surplus in Arambagh market to buy oil and salt, said Sheikh Nasir Ali of Saora village near Arambagh town.However, rice is scant to have fish curry with. We are sharing among ourselves whatever little rice of the previous season is left with us, said Asgar Ali of Muktarpur village. According to local estimates, some 5,000-7,000 people rendered homeless by floods have taken shelter in school buildings of Saora and Muktarpur.People are sharing whatever food they could gather before moving to the school shelters which are on higher grounds. No officials and ministers have not come or sent any relief, said Mukhtarpur resident Sheikh Asgar Ali.The entire lowland region of Saora-Nokunda-Mukhtarpur in Arambagh and Ghatal-Kharar region have been cut off by floods. Some 30-40 villages in Ghatal-Kharar are inundated. People are reaching upland through makeshift boats. Still, no relief is reaching us, lamented Shantanu Mondal, a resident of Harisinghpur village near Ghatal town.Many of the affected villagers alleged that they heard some relief was sent to the panchayat offices but never saw them. We heard that plastic sheets were sent to our village but have not seen any, said 64-year-old Moidul Hussain of Nokunda village.Those most in need have not been given any relief. Many of the panchayat members have distributed relief material among their kin, alleged another villager, Radhakanta Sikdar.Though the incessant rains that lashed south Bengal districts for the last 72 hours subsided to a drizzle on Tuesday, worries are far from over. With heavy rains in neighbouring Jharkhand, Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) has released 33,000 cusecs of water from its barrages and dams on Monday and 18,000 cusecs more on Tuesday.While chief minister Mamata Banerjee indirectly blamed the DVC for worsening the situation, state irrigation minister Rajib Banerjee said that DVC is releasing more water despite having the capacity to hold it. Sources in DVC said they are forced to open the floodgates fearing collapse of dams and barrages.The Maithon Dam, Durgapur barrage, Masanjore and Panchet Dams do not have great storage capacity. If the danger levels are crossed, DVC has to open the floodgates so that the dams and barrages dont break down, which may lead to hundreds of deaths in South Bengal, a senior DVC official told the New Indian Express.As rains subsided, long queues were witnessed at gas centres and residents from upland area s were seen thronging markets for vegetables, rice and other essential commodities."

Express BJP president Amit Shah, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others have lunch at Sonu Yadavs home, in Lucknow on Sunday. ExpressA day after he asked his party workers to induct Yadav and Jatav voters into the party to increase its community base, BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday had lunch at the residence of Sonu Yadav, party chief of Badi Jugauli polling booth, an area in Lucknow Central dominated by Yadavs. While in the past Shah had dined with Dalits during his tours to different states, this was the first time that his host was a Yadav OBC worker.State Law Minister Brijesh Pathak, who is the local MLA, however, denied any political angle in the decision to dine with a Yadav family. He (Sonu Yadav) is a dedicated party worker associated with the BJP for a long time. The party national president has said that people from all communities are welcome in the BJP.On Sunday afternoon, Shah and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who also joined him for lunch at Yadavs home, drove through the narrow lanes of Badi Jugauli area to reach Yadavs double-storey and well-furnished house. Just opposite Sonu Yadavs house was a plaque stating that the road that Shah and Adityanath took was developed by Samajwadi Party chief and former CM Akhilesh Yadav.Inside the house, preparations were still on to welcome the guests, which also included deputy CMs Keshav Prasad Maurya and Dinesh Sharma, party national vice-president Om Prakash Mathur, national general secretaries Arun Singh and Anil Jain and joint general secretary (organisation) Shiv Prakash.Sonu Yadav, 33, said he got word of the leaders plans only on Sunday morning. Another party office bearer, however, said he was informed Saturday night. Either way, the whole Yadav family was engaged in preparations, so much so that a source said they couldnt dine with the dignitaries themselves.My mother and wife cooked dal, sabji, raita, roti and rice for the guests, Yadav said. Chhach was also served.Sitting on the ground, Yadav served food in wooden disposal plates and kulhad to the guests.Shah also spoke to Yadav about his family, met them and even obliged with requests for a photograph. The dignitaries stayed there for nearly 40 minutes.Yadav said that he has been with the BJP for 14 years. He said that there are around 1,250 voters in Badi Jugauli polling booth and nearly 800 of them are Yadavs.The Yadav community is considered a strong vote base of the Samajwadi Party, which has been reduced to just 47 seats in the 403 seat-strong Assembly.Now when the SP is weak, this is the ideal time to attract Yadav voters and convince them that the BJP is the party for every section of the society, said a BJP leader.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"

Through economic valuation of ecosystem services from six tiger reserves in India, we demonstrate that enhanced investment in these tiger reserves is economically rational,"" he says.The team analysed the economic benefits accruing to the country from Corbett Tiger Reserve that is home to 215 tigers, Kanha Reserve (80 tigers), Kaziranga (106), Periyar Reserve (35), Ranthambore (46), and the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve (76).The tiger estimates are all from 2014 when the National Tiger Conservation Authority gave its last countrywide census figures.A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that each tiger has a flow benefit of about USD 2.19 million per year.This can be viewed as the interest one earns annually by conserving each tiger. Towards this, the total annual expenditure to maintain these six tiger reserves was just about Rs 23 crore.A very crass economic cost benefit analysis suggests that the return on investment for saving each tiger is of the order 356 times the investment.No industry or service can boast of such a high rate of return.""This new way of green accounting is seldom considered by traditional economists,"" says Rajesh Gopal, former head of Project Tiger and currently Secretary-General of the Global Tiger Forum in New Delhi.India is currently home to 60 per cent of the world's tigers and through the establishment of 50 tiger reserves, the numbers of adult tigers living in the wild has been steadily increasing from a low of 1,411 tigers in 2006 to reaching a peak of 2,226 in 2015 when the last estimate was made.The next countrywide census will be carried out in 2018.Making a case for increased investments for tiger conservation, Gopal says, ""In the last 35 years of tiger conservation in India, the government has spent close to Rs 1,200 crore or about USD 180 million and the simple stock benefits from the six tiger reserves that have been analysed comes to USD 23,056 million per year.""This is an eye opener.Today, 2.3 per cent of the geographical area of the country is covered under protected tiger reserves and to drive home his point of economic benefits Gopal says some 300 small and big rivers originate from the protected forests, whose downstream benefits are invaluable.Gopal, who is a co-author of this unique study, says ""estimating the anthropocentric benefits of a natural ecosystem is almost impossible as there are many-many intangible benefits"".To expand the same, Verma adds, ""We still do not have adequate information or understanding about ecosystems, all the species, and the various ways in which these enhance human well-being that we can objectively estimate a value for each of them.""There are also ethical issues inherent in the process, the intrinsic value i.e., the value of wild species in their own right.""""However"", he says ""recognition of even a conservative estimate of some of these intangible benefits from tiger reserves is likely to demonstrate their significance and provide adequate justification for conservation of these tiger habitats. The underlying objective of the initiative was to make the hidden benefits emanating from and embedded in tiger reserves visible to economies and society.""Tiger conservationists point out that the rice plant that saved India from near starvation in the last century was a variety called IR-8. This high-yielding rice variety was bred using wild rice plants collected from the tiger habitats now part of Chhattisgarh.""The tiger is an umbrella species under whose shadow millions of other organisms are being saved,"" says Gopal.He says one of the objectives of establishing Project Tiger was ""to ensure continuity of natural evolutionary processes"".Now green accounting is giving conservation a whole new dimension for conserving tigers.""The need of the hour is green planning,"" asserts Gopal."

The canteens will be launched in Bengaluru on August 15.A senior official of the Urban Development Department told Express, We are getting pre-fabricated concrete slabs from Krishnagiri in Tamil Nadu to build these canteens.Minister for Municipal Administration Eshwar Khandre said this novel initiative will be extended to other parts of the state soon. We want to start similar canteens in tier-II and tier-III cities to cater to the urban poor, he said.Khandre added that the menu will be designed keeping in mind the local cuisine. There will be jowar roti for cities in North Karnataka, ragi mudde and rice items for Mysuru, Mandya and Hassan regions, and fish curry for coastal regions, he said.Sources in the Department of Municipal Administration said BBMP limits will have more canteens as compared to other districts and towns. A source said, We will take feedback from BBMP on running the canteens. We want to launch the canteens in other parts of the state by Gandhi Jayanti."

(Photo| AP)BANGKOK: Former Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra declared her innocence and asked for ""kindness"" from a court Tuesday during her final statement in a criminal negligence trial that could land her in prison for 10 years if she is convicted.The case centers around a rice subsidy that Thailand's current military government says she grossly mishandled. Yingluck's bank accounts were frozen after an administrative ruling held her responsible for about $1 billion in losses from the subsidy.""I beg the court for kindness and please dismiss the charge,"" Yingluck said in her closing statement, according to prepared remarks. The verdict is to be issued Aug. 25.Yingluck's supporters believe she is being persecuted by opponents of her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 coup for alleged corruption and disrespect to the monarchy. The telecommunications mogul has been in self-imposed exile since 2008 to escape a prison sentence for corruption. His ouster set off sometimes-violent battles for power in Thailand, and supporters say the political establishment opposes Thaksin because his electoral popularity threatens their entrenched privileges.Yingluck led the last elected government in Thailand before being ousted as prime minister in 2014 when a court ruled that a personnel transfer involved nepotism. The army initiated a coup soon afterward and a military-led government has remained in power since.Hundreds of Yingluck's supporters outside the packed court Tuesday shouted, ""Prime minister, fight, fight!""After another court appearance late last month, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup, warned Yingluck's supporters to tread carefully. He said the government would not prevent people from gathering, but that ""everyone must show restraint"" and let the court decide the matter.The rice subsidy was a flagship policy that helped Yingluck's party win the 2011 general election. It paid Thai farmers about 50 percent above what they would have received on the world market, but instead of driving up prices, the subsidy drove the world's demand for rice to cheaper producers. Vietnam as a result replaced Thailand as the world's leading rice exporter.The government bought and stored 13.3 million tons of rice, but exported less than 1 million tons. It cost the government billions of dollars."

But here I was at The Lalit Ashok Bangalore to try my luck and I wasnt disappointed at all.Their Unified Flavours of The Lalit- Mharo Rajasthan festival captures the aroma and flavours of Rajasthani spice to the tee in an array of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The dessert state is known to hinge on its spices instead of fresh herbs for its falvours. And the festival did the same with a special chef flown in from The Lalit Ashok Udaipur.We started off with papdi chaat that was crispy, tangy and played the roles of the chataak appetiser really well. The Mushroom Tawa Kimchi had coatings of achari flavours served with green chutney.The Paneer Tikka has the charred tandoor flavours on the top and cooked with a smooth coating of masalas. The Chicken Tikka is grilled well retaining the flavours of the meat and has a crunchy coating from the masalas.The Dal Batti Churma is served as the traditional combination of semi-sweet churma, spicy dal and deep-fried baati. And my God is this Rajwadi daal to swear by. The daal was definitely the highlight of the evening. I relished another cup of it with pulav later.The Gutta curry has a thick texture with a heavy dose of cooked besan. For a gutta curry fan, this will be a soothing accompaniment to rice, pulav and butter garlic naan.The Gosht Biriyani is flavoursome and aromatic. The rice is flaky and the mutton is cooked well to seep in the falvours of the biryani.No Rajasthani food festival is complete without Laal Maas. The red gravy mutton dish that look heavy on the red chillies isnt exactly too spicy and sits right on the spice palate too. The mutton is juicy and cooked well. The desserts included the delicious dalia, ghewar and badam halwa.The festival is on till July 30."

It is interesting because it is a country still recovering from a genocide and, this fictional account, is told through the eyes of a UN staffer Joseph.The book is an intimate sketch of a country and its people, and it weaves their history into this narrative seamlessly. For example, you meet the driver Tulong and know that his slowness in responding to answers could come from a cunning. He may not have forgotten that a wrong answer -- like confessing to having read a piece of stray paper or taking an extra serving of watery rice gruel -- once had resulted in days of lashing and being chained to a plank. But Tulongs kindness and capacity for affection have survived the horrors, and he like other Cambodians sees aid agencies as deliverers.Cambodia was one of UNs success stories, says the author. The agency was key in transforming the country, after the Paris Peace Accords in 1991.But Joseph does not deny the historic injustice done to the country by the very same agency, when it allowed Khmer Rouge to represent the country in the UN. The agencys policies where largely driven by the US, says Joseph, who served 20 years with the international agency. Since Cambodia was liberated from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese, arch enemies of US at that time, the UN sided with the genocidal group. As the saying goes, my enemys enemy is my friend.One observation the author makes is that none of the people he spoke to, during his decade in Cambodia, ever admitted to being part of the Khmer Rouge regime. They always spoke as victims, he says. But I got the sense that few of them were actually perpetrators of the horrors.There was a man who told Joseph about betraying friends to save yourself. They were served rice gruel twice every day and occasionally, like when there is an anniversary, they are given a piece of potato with it. A seven year old saw a piece of potato fall to the ground and picked it up. He was being watched and, before he could be caught, he dropped it into his neighours bowl. The other boy was locked up and beaten for a week. The author got the feeling that the narrator was the boy who betrayed the other.Knowing that they might have been the perpetrators did not change my attitude to them, he says, it changed my attitude to me. I realised that even you and I are capable of such evil. If we are asked to arm ourselves, and control and abuse our fellow men, we might do it to.The book is mostly written in a light-hearted tone and even has jokes about UN staffers making up mission reports even before boarding the flight to the destination. This is an exagerration, says Joseph, adding with a laugh, it does happen... but not as often.Joseph, who wrote the book to get people to know Cambodia, says that the toughest thing about writing ficiton is to make it interesting. I also keep taking lanes and bye-lanes (turning away from the main narrative) and then I have to keep coming back to the main road, he says. He does this effectively, without breaking away from the central theme. oseph is the son-in-law of former Kerala minister KM Mani. He was reported to have been dismissed from government service while on one of UNs missions. But he vehemently denies this. I was not dismissed, but I was deemed to have resigned... there is a world of difference, says Joseph. He says that he had referred a dated IAS manual (printed in 1988) and believed that he had a leave extension. But the government informed him, much later and abruptly, that his resignation has been noted. In 1992, the leave rules had changed. I was shocked, a tragedy of circumstances, he says."

The work is hard in this impoverished part of northern Nigeria but the harvest will be good.""In the last two years my yield has jumped to 35 bags of rice against the 20 I was getting in previous years,"" Haruna, who is in his 40s with craggy features and a wooden hoe over his shoulder.""Rice farming has greatly improved. I have had better yield and better price in the market,"" he told AFP at his farm at Dawakin Tofa, on the outskirts of Kano.Rising rice production is one of the few positives of Nigeria's recession, which is the west African country's worst in 25 years. Today about 5.7 million tonnes of rice being are produced every year - three times as much as a decade ago.""We are now living a white gold revolution,"" said Francis Nwilene, the Nigeria director of the AfricaRice research centre.""People understand that oil is not something Nigeria can depend on anymore.""The potential is undeniable. But despite having vast tracts of fertile land, Nigeria - the largest consumer of rice in Africa - is also one of the world's biggest importers of the food staple.In the Kano region, the GreenPro factory shifted from specialising in flour and poultry to white cereals four years ago. ""Rice processing is by far more profitable than flour and chicken feed,"" said production manager Salisu Saleh.""Rice is a major food staple in our society which only few can live without.""In a sign of rice's paramount role in Nigerian society, a ""Jollof price index"" - named after a popular savoury fried rice dish - was launched by an advisory firm in June to measure food inflation.With domestic demand approaching 7.8 million tonnes per year, almost a quarter of Nigeria's rice comes from abroad, mainly India and Thailand.Rice is shipped through the Lagos port or by road from neighbouring Benin, which shares nearly 800 kilometres (500 miles) of porous borders.""Smuggling is a major issue which discourages local production,"" explained Nwilene. The government has said it believes Nigeria can be self-sufficient in rice production within a couple of years and is trying to plug gaps from cheaper imports.Small-scale farmers, who make up the majority of the rice producers, face numerous challenges, not least access to land.Production facilities are also inefficient and costs high, while there are not enough ways for farmers to commercialise their products. With fertilisers and machinery, Haruna estimates he could farm ""four times the current field"".""I have a large farm but I can only cultivate a fraction because of my limited resources,"" he explained. To boost local production, Abuja banned rice imports by land in 2015 and launched an ambitious aid programme overseen by the central bank targeting some 600,000 farmers."

The answer of the ACB officials is simple, the number of officials of these hostels indulging in corrupt practices is high.According to ACB Inspector K Pratap Reddy, they first raided the BC Welfare Hostel at Nuthimadugu in Kalyandurg last year, where there were discrepancies pertaining to number of students, facilities being provided and funds utilised.Following it, the ACB has been closely monitoring the functioning of welfare hostels in the district. Based on reliable information, it has been conducting raids quite frequently.In Anantapur district, there are 194 social welfare hostels and out of which 108 are BC welfare hostels and 76 SC welfare hostels. The total number of students as per the records is 15,120.The field level officials, who were supposed to inspect these hostels frequently, were reported to be hand in glove with these wardens, hence the true picture of the extent of corruption in the social welfare hostels cannot be assessed accurately.Our hotel warden rarely turns up and even the few occasions he comes, he is least bothered about the welfare of students.

B Saroja says in her hostel there are 130 girls, but the number of rooms are very limited and in those limited number of rooms, many girls have to adjust in the available space.Food they provide is very bad. The rice is of very low quality and the quality of the curry is bad. Shortage of drinking water is another big problem, she said.AISF district secretary K Johnson said negligence of the government with regard to running of welfare hostels was evident."

(File Photo | AP)DUBAI: Qatar has hired a Washington influence firm founded by President Donald Trump's former campaign manager and another specialized in digging up dirt on U.S. politicians, signaling it wants to challenge Saudi Arabia's massive lobbying efforts in America's capital amid a diplomatic dispute among Arab nations.The Gulf rift already has seen slogan-plastered taxicabs in London, television attack ads in the U.S. and competing messages flooding the internet and state-linked media on both sides since the crisis began June 5.Hiring a firm associated with former Trump aide Corey Lewandowski shows Qatar wants access to a White House with close ties to Saudi Arabia.But matching Saudi Arabia, which scored a diplomatic coup by hosting Trump's first overseas trip, could be a tough battle for Qatar even if it does boast the world's highest per-capita income due to its natural gas deposits.""The Qataris are belatedly working up to the scale of the challenge they face,"" said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who lives in Seattle. ""This whole crisis, now that it's kind of settled down into a prolonged confrontation or standoff, it's become almost a struggle to win the hearts and minds in D.C.""Qatar, in the midst of building stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, isn't afraid to spend its money. Since the crisis began, Qatar paid $2.5 million to the law firm of former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft to audit its efforts at stopping terrorism funding, among the allegations levied by the Saudi-led nations.According to documents newly filed to the U.S. Justice Department, Qatar has hired Avenue Strategies Global for $150,000 a month to ""provide research, government relations and strategic consulting services."" The contract also says that activity ""may include communications with members of Congress and Congressional staff, executive branch officials, the media and other individuals.""Lewandowski founded Avenue Strategies just after the November election that put Trump in the White House. Lewandowski resigned from the firm in May, saying he was troubled by a firm-related project he hadn't sanctioned. Others tied to Avenue Strategies had started a firm of their own, pitching Eastern European clients with promises of access to Trump and high-ranking White House officials.The firm, which includes a former chief of staff to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.Qatar also signed a three-month, $1.1 million renewable contract with the opposition research firm Information Management Services, according to a Justice Department filing .The firm, run by Jeff Klueter, a former researcher for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. It advertises itself as doing so-called ""oppo,"" which includes digging into political opponents' past and comments for incriminating or simply embarrassing material.Qatar did not respond to a request for comment about the lobbying contracts. But it may serve as recognition that while Qatar has had success in speaking with the State Department and the Pentagon, it needs to make inroads to the Trump White House, Ulrichsen said.Despite hosting a major U.S. military base, Qatar has been a target of Trump over its alleged funding of extremists, something Doha denies. Saudi Arabia enjoys close relations to Trump, as well as his son-in-law Jared Kushner.In Washington, Saudi Arabia spends millions of dollars on lobbying, including a most-recent push to oppose a law allowing Sept. 11 victims' families to sue the ultraconservative Muslim nation in U.S. courts . Its lobbying firms have been putting out memos on Qatar.Meanwhile, an organization called the Saudi American Public Relation Affairs Committee launched an online campaign called the Qatar Insider highlighting material critical of Doha. The committee also paid $138,000 to air an anti-Qatar attack ad on a local Washington television station, according to the Qatar-funded satellite news network Al-Jazeera.""Our aim is to show the American people that Qatar has been employing a foreign policy that harms its neighbors and contributes to regional instability,"" said Reem Daffa, the executive director of the committee, known by the acronym SAPRAC.But while Daffa said SAPRAC does no lobbying, it has registered as a lobbying firm with Congress and tweeted a Qatar attack ad at Trump . It also has not filed paperwork with the Justice Department despite the committee being listed as entirely owned by a Saudi national .The Foreign Agents Registration Act, first put in place over concerns about Nazi propagandists operating in the U.S. ahead of World War II, requires those working on behalf of other countries or their citizens to file regular reports to the Justice Department.There aren't similar rules in Britain, though the crisis recently could be seen on the streets of London. Pro-Qatar ads appeared on the city's famous black taxis, bearing the message: ""Lift the Blockade Against the People of Qatar."" Al-Jazeera Arabic even did a story about them.But whether any of it will sway policy makers remains unclear.""The prevailing view is that there are no perfect allies,"" recently wrote Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. ""So whatever money the Gulf countries are spending in Washington, they should know it is not very well spent."

Soon, she saw a post by a friend of hers about a cast iron fish that had been invented by a Canadian Dr. Christopher Charles. The idea is that you drop the iron fish while cooking is taking place, so that the iron seeps into the food. All humans need a bit of iron in their diet. Soon, Radhika saw a comment: Once upon a time we used to cook in cast iron pots!Immediately Radhika typed, I still do, the way my grandmother did. Then she posted a few pictures of her cast iron dosa pan and kadai. This was shared in a foodie group. Thereafter, many asked where they could get this.It suddenly struck me that this could be a business, says Radhika at Kochi. She decided to team up with her friend, Priya Deepak and thus was born the Village Fair.Today, the duo sells all types of traditional cookware, ranging from clay pots, kadais, tavas, pans, skillets, grinding stones, and traditional stoneware.The USP is the seasoning. This is being done by a 20 member group of men and women on Vypeen island. In fact, their first volunteeer was Radhikas house help, Lalitha. She knew how to do it, says Radhika. We began with a few orders. When the numbers became big, Lalitha included other family members.The group gets the raw utensils from factories and kilns. Then they wash it in cold water to remove all the mud and the grime. Then it is immersed in rice and starch water for four days. Thereafter, the vessels are scrubbed clean and sandpaper is used to smooth out the rough edges.After that it is placed on the fire and cured with vegetable oil. If it is a kadai, oil is applied inside, and on a dosa pan it is on the outside, says Priya. We then make one or two dosas to check whether the seasoning has happened correctly. The prices range from Rs 1500 to Rs 2500 for cast iron, bronze, from Rs 4000 to Rs 5000, depending on the weight, soapstone is from Rs 1700 to Rs 2000 and clay pots from Rs 680 to Rs 1500.Asked whether it is a bit on the expensive side, Priya says, You are paying for the cookware as well as the seasoning efforts. It is not an easy thing to do.Anyway, owing to a rising health consciousness, there is a growing demand for traditional cookware. People have realised that in modern utensils, once the non-stick wears off, food can become toxic, says Radhika. The advantage of traditional cookware is that once you buy it, you can use it forever.And the food is tastier. There are far more flavours in the food, says Radhika. You have to try it to know the difference.Today, thanks to a thriving online presence, the Village Fair has customers from Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and many other cities. Their first international customer was a couple from New Zealand, Tim and Suzie Hunt. They had come to India earlier, says Priya. And they ordered a dosa pan.In fact, the dosa pan is one of their most popular items. Because people like to cook a nice crisp dosa, and it is much tastier than when you use a non-stick cookware pan, says Radhika.The duo say they have a lot of satisfied customers. They call us a God-send, says Priya. Our business has grown through word of mouth."

Anju Acharya (who prefers to use this name) is one such artist who has used natural materials like flower extract, charcoal, human hair and thread to create masterpieces.Anju says she fell in love with the concept of paintings during her childhood. Born to a blacksmith family, the artist was always fascinated by the works her father used to do. When I was a child, I used to watch my father work. It taught me how to do quality art, one needs to work hard, said Anju. I work on mediums like rice paper-base which is very delicate, I feel I am working on my skin. The rice paper base lends transparency to these materials and the art is reflected by the use of these materials. I tend to think and re-think an image, draw and redraw it over and over again. There is always an element of surprise in the outcome of the image, said Anju.For her unique artistic works, she has won many awards such as the Prafulla Foundation South zone bronze-ceramic category, Prafulla Foundation merit award for drawing and the students Biennale National Award in 2017. She never puts titles for her work. I do not like to title my work because I feel they tend to limit, frame and suffocate my works unnecessarily.

(Photo| AP)KUALA LUMPUR: Two women accused of poisoning the estranged half brother of North Korea's ruler in a bizarre airport assassination are expected to plead innocent when they appear in a Malaysian court on Friday, their lawyers said.Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong are suspected of smearing Kim Jong Nam's face with the banned VX nerve agent at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur on Feb. 13. The women, who face the death penalty if convicted, say they were duped into thinking they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera show.They are the only suspects in custody in a killing that South Korea's spy agency said was part of a five-year plot by reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to kill a brother he reportedly never met. Four North Korean suspects fled the country, police say.The women's lawyers say their clients are expected to plead not guilty at the High Court Friday.Here's a look at the significance of Kim's death and the two suspects:WHY WAS KIM JONG NAM ASSASSINATED?North Korea has a long history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime. While Kim Jong Nam was not thought to be seeking influence, his position as eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding could have made him appear to be a danger. Kim had also spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic control of the reclusive, nuclear-armed nation.North Korea has refused to accept the dead man was leader Kim Jong Un's half brother and has suggested the victim died of a heart attack. It has accused Malaysia of working with South Korean and other ""hostile forces"" in blaming Pyongyang.Kim Jong Nam died while en route to a hospital after he fell ill at a budget terminal of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport while waiting for a flight to Macao. He told medical workers before he died that he had been attacked with a chemical spray that Malaysian officials later identified as the deadly VX nerve agent.Kim Jong Nam, who was 45 or 46, had been living abroad for years. He reportedly fell out of favor when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport in 2001, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.INDONESIAN SUSPECTSiti Aisyah, 25, was recruited in early January by a North Korean man, known as James, to star in his video prank shows, according to her lawyer Gooi Soon Seong.The two met at a pub in downtown Kuala Lumpur and over the course of several days, James had Siti rub oil or pepper sauce on a victim's face from forehead downwards which he would film on his phone, the lawyer said. They practiced at malls, hotels and airports. Gooi said Aisyah was paid $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as a social escort.In late January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia where James introduced her to Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who left Malaysia on the day of the killing. Hong had introduced himself as Chang, a Chinese who produces video prank shows for the Chinese market, the lawyer said.Gooi said Hong asked Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days before Kim was attacked. He said that Hong identified Kim to Aisyah at the airport and allegedly put the poison on her hand.James, identified by police as Ri Ji U, was among seven North Korean suspects wanted by Malaysian police. Four fled the country on Feb. 13 and the other three, including James, hid inside their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur to avoid questioning.The three were later allowed to fly home in exchange for nine Malaysians held in Pyongyang, as part of a deal to ease a diplomatic spat between the two countries.

Everybody these days want to follow the current trends. This is because of the influence of cinema and internet, said a 36-year-old Rajamallu, a barber from Peddapalli, who was in the city to participate in demonstration-cum-exhibition of Modern Hairstyle organised by state Backward Castes Welfare Department on Tuesday.We have to adopt modern skills to facilitate our customers to earn our bread and butter, he said. Tuesday being a general holiday for all the barbers shops in the state, nearly 700 people from Nayee Brahmins (barber) community attended the event.Things were completely different in our days, said a barber Bakkanna from Khammam district. There were no barber shops in our village, we use to go door-to-door for giving an haircut to people. But things have changed now, people need a swanky, hi-tech saloons, he said, adding that back in the 1960s he used to charge 20 paise or a kilogram of rice for both haircut and shaving.Even in towns, our business is growing by leaps and bounds and many of us are getting trained in cities to learn new trends, said Raghu Babu from Karimnagar.We are the most important but disrespected community here, rued one Srinivas from Adilabad.

The hostels, which are to provide shelter to the socially and economically backward students, seem to have forgotten that basic objective though crores of rupees is being spent by the government per annum.The welfare provisions in the hostels include nutritious food, cosmetics, clothes, education material apart from accommodation.In West Godavari, there are 80 pre-matric SC boys and girls hostels and 22 post-matric hostels. Out of them, 29 hostels were closed down last year due to low strength. Apart from pre and post-matric hostels, there are four integrated hostels, two each for boys and girls. There are three wardens in each hostel. One warden looks after the administration, one takes care of housekeeping and the other is meant to concentrate on education of students. However, the wardens are not attending their duties properly.The Assistant Social Welfare Officer has to visit the hostels and enquire students about the conditions, but it is not happening. It came to light during the ACB raid that the hostel wardens were not only neglecting their duties, but also resorting to unethical practices like registering high number of students. There was also no implementation of the biometric attendance system. Officials say it is mainly due to cover up of the irregularities. To divert funds meant for food, the hostel wardens were supplying poor quality food.The most annoying fact is the students were not provided medical treatment when they fell ill. Instead of calling doctors for treatment, the students would be asked to consume tablets from nearby pharmacy.When Express visited the Integrated SC Boys Hostel at Kovvali, no warden was there except the watchman. Though there are 250 students registered in the hostel, the actual number of inmates in the hostel was 211 only. All the 211 inmates are accommodated in just eight rooms, that means 40 per room. Toilets and bathrooms are in a bad shape with virtually no maintenance.Annapoornaiah who was nabbed by the ACB, had in fact rejected promotion to continue as the hostel warden.The wardens should spend on an average Rs 750 each per month on students of 3rd to 7th standard and Rs 850 on students of 8th to 10th standard and Rs 1,050 on students of Intermediate and degree. The average expenditure involved on students of professional courses per month is Rs 1,250. But, many hostel wardens are not spending even half of the amount on inmates.Wardens Y Aruna and P Balamma of SC Girls Hostel at Bhimadole were suspended for not serving adequate food to the inmates. Due to food poisoning, some students also fell ill. Eluru SC Girls Hostel warden D Prabhavathi was also suspended for diverting rice meant for students to the blackmarket."

Complaints pertaining to storage issues are coming mainly from Peddapalli, Jagityal, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, and Nalgonda districts, he said, and brought it to their notice that the department will face losses if CMR submission is delayed.This Rabi, the department has purchased 37.15 lakh Metric Tonnes of paddy from farmers and handed over to the rice millers for milling. For this, millers should surrender 26 lakh MTs of rice to the government by August 31. Till now 8.76 lakh MTs boiled and 44,000 MTs raw rice is surrendered to FCI, a note from the department said.Rice millers expressed concern as the rice is stocked in lorry for days laying outside FCI godowns and getting wet due to rains.Deputy General Managers of FCI, Prem Singh, Ratna Prasad, and Bipin Chakravarthy were among those who attended the meeting."

In an interview with Meera Vankipuram, IJM founder and CEO Gary Haugen, and regional director for South Asia Saju Mathew, reveal that Tamil Nadu has a 29% prevalence of bonded labour and assert that trafficking will reduce only if perpetrators know that they face a serious risk of going to jail.Can you tell us about the United States End Modern Slavery Initiative?Haugen| It is a global fund to address slavery around the world. It seeks to end impunity, engage businesses in cleaning up supply chain and to achieve sustainable freedom for survivors.Slavery has been abolished in several countries. Can you define it in the modern context?Haugen|Slavery is when you compel someone to do work by force, fraud or coercion. When you try to make money off the work of another person and compel them by threats, coercion, force or fraud that constitutes slavery under laws around the world.What is IJMs estimate of the number of trafficking victims worldwide?Haugen|The Global Slavery Index estimates that there are more than 45 million slaves around the world. The International Labour Organisation puts it at more than 20 million.IJM has faced criticism in the past for its brothel raids. Will you continue with such raids?Haugen|IJM doesnt ever do raids. Only the local law enforcement agency is authorised to do that. Fifteen years ago, when IJM started providing information to law enforcement agencies, some forces in the commercial sex industry that didnt want police involvement in their trade may have complained against us. But Ive never seen such complaints in India. We provide information to law enforcement agencies where victims of crime are hidden. And we will continue to train and upgrade the capacity for them to do that in an effective manner, but also in a way that protects the dignity of everyone involved.What are the local agencies that you work with in India?Mathew|We work with the district magistrate, collector, revenue divisional officers, tehsildars and the police among other. Often the referral information comes from the victim community.How does IJM help rehabilitate survivors?Mathew|It could be providing emergency medical care, or if someone is returning to their native community, helping them with housing, food and provisions. There is also long-term aftercare like schooling for children, opening bank accounts for people to help them save and invest; and counselling and trauma care for victims.Do you have any data on bonded labour in TN?Mathew| A recent study we conducted showed a prevalence of 29% of bonded labour in TN, across 13 industries. This means, 29% of the labour force in each district in industries that require extreme manual labour such as brick kilns, rock quarries, rice mills, agricultural farms, and textiles, is bonded labour. IJM has been working in Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Vellore and Tiruvannamalai districts. We have supported police in rescue operations, and there have been many arrests and convictions. As a result, bonded labour in these districts has come down to 6%.Haugen|When perpetrators of bonded labour are unable to get away with the crime, they stop doing it. Our experience across the world shows that slavery and trafficking drops dramatically when impunity is eliminated and when people know they face a serious risk of going to jail."

Then, one night in June, he was summoned to a palace in Mecca, held against his will and pressured for hours to give up his claim to the throne.By dawn, he had given in, and Saudi Arabia woke to the news that it had a new Crown Prince: the kings 31-year-old son, Mohammed bin Salman.The young princes supporters have lauded his elevation as the seamless empowerment of an ambitious leader. But since he was promoted on June 21, indications have emerged that Mohammed bin Salman plotted the ouster and that the transition was rockier than has been publicly portrayed, according to current and former U.S. officials and associates of the royal family.To strengthen support for the change in the line of succession, some senior princes were told that Mohammed bin Nayef was unfit to be King because of a drug problem, according to an associate of the royal family.The decision to oust Mr. Nayef and some of his closest colleagues has spread concern among counter-terrorism officials in the U.S., who saw their most trusted Saudi contacts disappear and have struggled to build new ties. And the collection of so much power by one young royal, Prince Mohammad bin Salman, has unsettled a royal family long guided by consensus and deference to elders.You may have now such a concentration of power within one branch and within one individual who is also younger than so many of the cousins and sons of former kings that it may begin to create a situation where the family is out of whack, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow for the West Asia at Rice Universitys Baker Institute for Public Policy.Similar accountsBut since The New York Times reported last month that Mohammed bin Nayef had been confined to his palace, U.S. officials and associates of senior royals have provided similar accounts of how the elder Prince was pressured to step aside by his nephew.In response to questions from The Times , a written statement by a senior Saudi official denied that Mohammed bin Nayef had been pressured and said the Allegiance Council, a body of senior Princes, had approved the change in the best interest of the nation. It said Mohammed bin Nayef was the first to pledge allegiance to the new crown prince and had insisted that the moment be filmed and broadcast. The former crown prince receives guests daily in his palace in Jiddah and has visited the king and the crown prince more than once, the statement said.The rivalry between the princes began in 2015, when King Salman ascended the throne and bestowed tremendous power on his favourite son. Mohammed bin Salman was named Deputy Crown Prince, or second in line to become King, as well as Defence Minister; put in charge of a powerful economic council; and given oversight of the state oil monopoly, Saudi Aramco."

Such dealers will be suspended, and the shops will be handed over to the IKP groups.Three different associations of ration dealers, each attributing to itself highest membership, are demanding honorarium of Rs. 30,000 per month in lieu of the losses suffered due to cut down in the number of commodities being supplied through fair price shops. Also alleged are discrepancies in the weight of rice at the time of delivery.Mr.Anand tried to dissuade the dealers from strike, during successive meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday, saying a decision by government was in the offing.He assured that the income of the dealers would go up after the introduction of the electronic point of sale machines at all fair price shops.In order to rule out weight discrepancies, weigh bridges will be set up at all the 171 warehouses from where the commodities are lifted. In a day or two, orders will be issued for allowing 1.5 % variation on the whole stock, he said through a press statement."

The deities, Sri Kalabhairava, Sri Amma and Naga, were worshipped at the shrine. The rituals were being conducted by a family belonging to the Jogi community (Natha sect) since centuries.He said that though there was a historical relation of this shrine with the nearby temple, the conduct of rituals at the shrine was the exclusive preserve of the Jogi community. There is a connection between the shrine and the Halavari Mutt (affiliated to Gorakhpur Moola Mutt) located at Yeddamogge, about seven kilometres from the shrine. Till recently, the shrine used to receive 10 murras of rice from the Halavari Mutt.At present, Basava Jogi and his son, Raghavendra Jogi, are looking after the shrine. Since Basava Jogi was old, Raghavendra Jogi takes care of the shrine. A few years ago, the latter began taking devotees who came to the village to the shrine. This was the source of livelihood for the family, he said.But as the shrine started attracting more devotees and adventure tourists, the temple authorities installed a hundi (money box) for temple renovation, he said and added that the family did not object to it. But recently, the temple authorities went a step ahead and appointed salaried workers to guide the devotees to the shrine. This affected the earnings of the family.When the family questioned the temple authorities and tried to resolve the matter amicably, they were ignored. We approached government officers and Gopal Poojary, Byndoor MLA, but they washed their hands off the issue. We want our rights to be preserved. The hundi and temple guides should be removed, he said.The samiti would hold a Guppi Guhalaya Chalo at Kamalashile on Saturday. If the matter is still not resolved, we will intensify the agitation and even approach Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Mr. Koteshwar said."

However, the state government has not responded positively to this demand so far. Over 1.20 lakh people have availed the portability facility in the various FP shops located in the limits of Greater Hyderabad in just the month of June.Officials said portability is not only a facility to card-holders to pick FP shops of their choice but also initiates a competition among dealers to offer better service to consumers. Presently , the portability facility is applicable only in FP shops in Hyderabad. The officials of Civil Supplies Corporation are making arrangements to extend it to all shops in the state in a phased man ner. However, the dealers are firm on their demands with their Association leader Bathula Ramesh Babu stating that there is no question of going back on the strike call if their demands were not met.Speaking to TOI over phone from Warangal, where the dealers organised a massive rally on Wednesday demanding monthly honorarium, Ramesh Babu said, "" Almost all the dealers will stop selling subsidised rice through FP shops from August 1 if our demands are not met. The government should formally announce payment of a monthly honorarium to us before July 31,"" he asserted.Stating that their income from such shops has come down drastically as the government has been withdrawing essential commodities from the public distribution system (PDS), such as sugar, edible oil and wheat, he said that even the price of per quintal rice has not been enhanced for several years now. As a result, it has become difficult for FP shop dealers to earn even Rs 5,000 per month.""One of the FP shop dealers in Sircilla recently committed suicide owing to financial problems. Let the government do anything they want with PDS. All we want is monthly honorarium of Rs 30,000 replacing the commission, so that we can feed our family members at least twice a day . We will accept e-pos machines and all other reforms of the government if we are given the honorarium,"" Ramesh Babu said.On their part, the officials of civil supplies department said that there are plans to transform these shops into super markets and mini-banks and then, dealers would get their commission on every transaction.

Now everything is brought from outside, she says.Though she doesnt know her exact age or date of birth, people of the Muthuvan settlement confirm she is the oldest woman in the community. She may be over 110, they say.In her tribal attire with nose ring, earrings, chains and bangles in metals and plastic, she is still energetic as ever and part of the farming activities of the community.Mother of 12Paattiyamma, who has 12 children from two marriages, of whom only five are alive now, lives with her daughter, Lessamma. She came to Kurathikudy from Chickanamkudy in the Mankulam forests.She recollects the changes in the communitys lifestyle that transformed them from those fully dependent on forest produce to those who now depend on rations and food items provided by the government and shops.Wild animals destroy our crops and other cultivation. Lack of fodder and water has forced wild animals to enter human-inhabited areas, she says.According to Paattiyamma, they followed jhum cultivation and had traditional rice varieties. However, keppa (ragi) was their staple food. We reared cattle and farming was the main activity.She also remembers the initial days of settling at Kurathikudy when they were fully dependent on the forest for food.Honey, wild tubers and fruits were the main items and the menfolk went to collect them from the forest.It provided food to both animals and forest settlers. Now the animals too come out of the forest seeking food and water., she adds.Though we cultivated vegetables, rice and keppa, wild elephants never raided our crops. They did not even come close to our settlement areas, she adds. She is concerned about the increased threat by wild animals and says they turn violent because they too face threat to their existence.Change in climatePaattiyamma says the two things she noticed were change in climate  from severe cold to the extended summer season.There were days on end when the settlement was completely enveloped in fog. The long rainy days have also disappeared.Pointing to a river near the settlement, she says the entire area, which was once covered with water during the rains, now has a dried riverbank.The river without a name close to its place of origin, is the mute witness to the severe rainfall shortage in the forest areas, she says.A river near my settlement is a mute witness to the severe rainfall shortage in the forest areas.PaattiyammaTribal woman from Kurathikudy"

Lists are being prepared that will enumerate Priority Households (PHH) and non-priority households, as per the National Food Security Act (NFSA) stipulation that only 50.55% of the States population can be eligible for entitlements.Officials say that the State is going through the process merely because it is required by the NFSA but there is no legal bar on the Tamil Nadu government from keeping the PDS universal and applicable to all.A top official of the food department says that there is no change in the State governments policy of universal PDS.The government will not discriminate between priority households and the general category of ration card holders with regard to providing entitlements such as free rice.It was in October last year that the State government decided to implement the NFSA, after fighting with the Centre for many years over a host of issues.At the time of enacting the law in 2013, the Centre assured all the States that it would not disturb the annual allotment of foodgrains (rice or wheat, as the case may be), which was prevalent at that point of time.In respect of Tamil Nadu, this was 36.78 lakh tonnes of rice. In addition, the State government procures, on an average, nearly 28,000 tonnes of rice every year. The State governments rice subsidy bill is now Rs. 3,458.50 crore, an increase of about Rs. 1,100 crore more than the previous year.Exclusion criteriaAs per the new rules, those families having at least one member as income tax payer, having an air-conditioner, owning a car or having an annual income of Rs. 1 lakh will all have to be excluded, while preparing lists of PHH.Also, the rule of exclusion will apply to those households paying professional tax or owning over five acres of land. If any family has a retired or serving government official, it will also be considered non-priority.Hereafter, types of cards such as Antyodaya Anna Yojana (representing the poorest of the poor) and Below Poverty Line (BPL) will all be clubbed and brought under the category of PHH.Likewise, those families headed by widows, single women or differently-abled will come under this category. In rural areas, households consisting of agricultural workers will be brought under PHH."

Valarmathi, for refusing to take any action towards their long-pending demand for reclassifying them as Denotified Tribes (DNT) from the current classification of Denotified Communities (DNC).With the government order 1310 of the State government issued in 1979, the State government at one stroke of a pen classified as DNCs from DNTs. As DNTs, who were persecuted under the British rule through the Criminal Tribes Act and continued to live under backward socio-economic conditions, we were eligible for welfare benefits from the Central government. Due to GO 1310, we lost all that, said A.V. Marimuthu, general secretary of the association.Stating that different communities, now classified as DNCs, have been fighting for reclassification as DNTs for nearly 40 years now, he said that successive State governments failed to address their concerns.B. Thavamani Devi, general secretary of the womens wing of the association, blamed the BC Welfare Minister for citing a case pending in the Supreme Court regarding the reservation of 69 % allocated to different SC, ST, BC, MBC communities in the State.This case was not a hurdle when previous governments gave separate reservations for Arunthathiyar community and Muslims within the 69 % reservation and included the Nari Kurava community as Scheduled Tribes. Then, why is it becoming a problem for us alone, she asked.Moreover, the members claimed that their primary objective of getting them reclassified as DNTs was not to avail the benefits of the reservation policy of the State government, but to get various benefits provided by the union government."

It turns out that Andhra Pradesh has stopped growing Jaya variety of rice. As Andhra Pradesh officials asked their counterparts to send a few samples of rice, which Kerala presumed as Jaya variety, it appears that Kerala knocked the doors of a wrong State ahead of Onam festival in September.Farmers in East Godavari district cultivate MTU 3626 ( Bondalu in local parlance) in large area. Cultivation of Jaya, a variety from International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), was introduced way back in 1965 and was discontinued long back following introduction of many other high yield varieties. Farmers in East Godavari district prefer cultivating MTU 3626, which is also known as Prabhat, in view of high yield and returns.Keralas preferenceKerala prefers boiled rice for variety of reasons, including long shelf life after cooking. The prices of boiled rice have shot up significantly in view of fast approaching festival. It necessitated a meeting between Kerala Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman and his team with their counterparts here a week ago.The Supplyco, a grocery arm of Kerala government, is procuring boiled rice through e-tenders at Rs. 35 a kg, and if Andhra Pradesh supplies the same at a lesser price, it is ready to sign an agreement with AP Civil Supplies Corporation.When contacted, Special Chief Secretary (Agriculture, Civil Supplies) B. Rajasekhar said, Jaya is a very old variety. It is not being cultivated now. What they (Kerala) refer to Jaya could be MTU 3626. We asked them to send a few samples so that we can compare it with the rice grown here.Andhra Pradesh was one of the States that used to grow Jaya variety and process and despatch it as Jaya boiled rice to Kerala.Bondalu has taken over its place many years ago and that is what is being sent to Kerala.The farmers have switched over to the Prabhat or Bondalu variety, which is grown in large area in East Godavari district. Lodging resistant varieties such as MTU 1061, MTU 1075 are gaining momentum in Godavari delta, explained Agriculture Deputy Director (Planning) Z. Venkateswara Rao.However, Andhra Pradesh Rice Millers Association (APRMA), Upland Area Rice Millers Association (UARMA) disagree. APRMA president Gummadi Venkateswara Rao and UARMA president Valluri Suribabu continue to contend that Jaya variety of rice is being sent to Kerala.

But, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was hopeful at Wednesdays media meet that there were another 60 days for the revival of monsoon.In Nizamabad, while farmers are very much worried about the withering of crop the agriculture officers are of the opinion that there is no immediate threat to the standing crop except paddy.On the other hand, reports reaching here say that damage to the paddy has already set in. It is healthy where water is plenty in bore wells and wilting where it was transplanted early in canal areas. Even if electricity is supplied uninterrupted for nine hours, paddy is drying since there is no water in borewells.In the current kharif the crop sowing area has not yet crossed 60 per cent of the normal sowing area and paddy was transplanted in a little over 40 per cent. Transplantation is still continuing in certain areas.Agriculture authorities say that as of now there is no problem to cotton, soyabean and other ID crops as they can survive another 15 days without rains, but threat looms large to the paddy. If rain plays truant for one more week paddy would start withering where ground water is not available, they feel.KARIMNAGARFarmers of erstwhile Karimnagar district, which is considered as the rice bowl of Telangana state, are worried lot over prevailing dry weather conditions with deficit rainfall as the existing rainfed crops such as maize and cotton have started withering.On the other hand, the farmers have not taken up cultivation of the paddy crop following low ground water table and no inflows into any of the irrigation projects including the minor irrigation tanks in the district. Against the normal area of cultivation of paddy in 37,096 hectares, the paddy was cultivated only in 18,257 hectares which is only 22.25 per cent of coverage of cultivation.Expecting bumper harvest and good market support price to the cotton produce, the farmers had cultivated cotton in 53,282 hectares during this season against the normal area of 55,937 hectares. Reports reaching here said that following the deficit rainfall, the maize and cotton crops have started withering in Ramadugu, Manakondur and Kesavapatnam mandals. District Agriculture Officer V Sreedhar told on Friday that the situation is very alarming due to continuous dry spell.WARANGAL (URBAN DT)With rain playing truant, the farmers are a worried lot as the paddy crop was showing signs of withering in rural parts of the district. Many of the farmers were trying to save the crop watering them manually but in vain.In the Warangal urban district, there was 51,000 hectares of cultivable land with 73,000 farmers. In June and July as against the average of 642 mm of rainfall, the district witnessed only 392 mm of rainfall. The farmers hoping for a good rainfall increased their crop extent. Of the 31,100 heactares of cotton, this time farmers sowed cotton in 37,308 hectares. Paddy is sown in 6,147 hectares, maize in 7,076 hectares and other pulses in over 300 hectares.Agricultural scientist R Uma Reddy said they have warned the farmers not to hurry for sowing paddy without witnessing a good steady rainfall. There was time till August first week. But many farmers started sowing after the first rainfall. It proved costly to them.(with inputs from P. Rammohan in Nizamabad, K.M.

Our friends had called us over, but I  down with a nasty bug  couldnt make it. So they packed for me a big consignment of biryani from Behrouz. You may recall that I wrote about Behrouzs biryani once. It had been delivered home even before we could say gosht, and I remember how I enjoyed their kofta biryani  peppered with little mince balls.The friends generous package carried us over the weekend. And it also reminded me of the biryani that I had eaten just a few days before that  at the Press Club of India.The Club had a biryani festival. And I had some exceptional biryani there. I discovered that the biryani had been catered especially for the club by the Corporate Master Chef of the Clarks Inn Group of Hotels, Sunil Soni, and his able assistant, Junaid, who comes from a bawarchi family of Aligarh.I know biryani lovers are the most quarrelsome group that you can ever find in India, perhaps even more than mango aficionados who can never agree on what could be crowned as the king of the fruit. Likewise, those who like their Hyderabadi kachchey gosht biryani have nothing but scorn for the Awadhi biryani fan club, which, in turn, thinks the Kolkata biryani lovers should get their heads examined. And then there are those who know and love their south Indian biryanis, and shrug and say, Oh these northerners.I think the time has come to judge the biryani not just by its origins, but by the taste. Not everybody who does kachchey gosht ki biryani does it well, and some of the so-called Kolkata biryani outlets in Chittaranjan Park should be told that one potato does not maketh a Kolkata biryani. The true test lies in how good the biryani tastes.And the ones that had been prepared by Soni, Junaid and their men were simply outstanding. I had some of the Hyderabadi gosht biryani and Awadhi chicken biryani. Both were finger-licking good, and that was the unanimous opinion of our four-member household.One reason, of course, was the rice, which was of exceptional quality  long-grained and aromatic, as well as cooked to perfection, which each grain occupying its own glistening space. The meat had been cooked and spiced just right. The rich flavours came from the yakhni  stock  that had been used while the rice was being cooked. And Chef Soni tells me that some stock was also used while the meat  chicken or lamb  was being marinated with spices.The flavours of the biryanis had been enhanced with a touch of pan ki jad, which is powdered and added to the dish, and ittar. And the mildly sweet flavour came from rose petals and plump raisins.I also had the most delicious dessert I have eaten in recent times. Its called gulatthi, and is prepared with thickened milk, khoya, nuts and a bit of saffron. Unlike phirni, it doesnt have rice in it. So the flavours and texture come from the nuts and the khoya. This is a dish that is especially popular in the Aligarh-Rampur area.The biryani at the club was offered at subsidised rates, but Chef Soni (9810380519) and his team can cater for large parties, where a plate of biryani may cost Rs. 400-500, depending on the number of people and other such factors.Now that in every corner of the city you have someone selling some kind of biryani, the dish has been losing its appeal because of the substandard offerings in many of these places. These days, for instance, the moment I see a sign that says Moradabadi Biryani, I am reminded of the flavour of pickle in the rice. And let me tell you its not a happy thought.But this biryani has strengthened my belief that there are unknown jewels still waiting to be discovered. Seek, and we shall find."

Prices have increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg in less than 10 says, said Mr. Sharma.He, however, refused to speculate on far the prices might go up in the near future.Common phenomenonThe prices of seasonal vegetables, such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd and okra, have also doubled over the past fortnight.Hemant, a commission agent who deals in vegetables, however, argued that the rise in prices of vegetables was a common phenomenon during this part of the year.Crops are damaged due to heavy rain during monsoon, which in turn affects supply. The prices will continue to remain high for another two months, said Mr. Hemant.However, before the vegetables reach the kitchen, the prices go up by another 30-40%, making them unaffordable for the common man.Ram Pal, a squatter near Shani Mandir in Sector 37, argued that despite selling the vegetables at a rate 30-40% higher than the wholesale price, he ended up making only a marginal profit.I need to make up for the damaged and unsold vegetables and also recover the transportation cost. So, I end up making just Rs. 3-4 per kg after a hard days hard work, said Mr.Pal.Potato prices, however, continue to hover around Rs. 4-5 per kg on account of overproduction this year."

""So, no cultivation of GM mustard will take place as the sowing season for mustard is in October,"" it said.Narasimha said the government was ready for judicial scrutiny of its decision on GM mustard, which was subjected to rigorous regulatory mechanism and closed field testing. ""I am ready to argue the case even before the Centre takes the final decision,"" he said.Petitioner NGO, Gene Campaign, through advocate Prashant Bhushan , had red-flagged the proposal to allow commercial cultivation of GM mustard.Bhushan had recounted the perilous experience of GM rice in Texas, US, which contaminated production of long-grained rice, leading to a ban on its import by EU countries and Russia.""The stage today is not closed greenhouse experimentation on growing GM mustard. If the government permits greenhouse experimentation, we have no problem.But the moment it is cultivated in open field, one does not know what effect it would have on nearly 5,000 varieties of indigenous varieties of mustard grown in India.The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (of the government) is riddled with conflict of interest and cannot be trusted for an independent evaluation of the grave risk posed by GM mustard,"" he had said."

Since the sowing period is already over, need for rain for crops' growth has become urgent, officials from the department said.The officials added that crops have begun to dry in Daund, Baramati, Purandar, and Indapur in Pune district. The situation is no better in almost all blocks in Ahmednagar, south and north Solapur, Paithan, Gangapur as well as the blocks in Beed, Latur , Nanded, Parbhani, among others.In short, the crops in all divisions, except Konkan, have begun to face water stress over the last few days.

Thulasingam, vice-president, Federation of All India Rice Millers Associations.Addressing a press meet here on Sunday, office-bearers of the Federation said that the Centre should consider withdrawing the tax as it would unnecessarily burden the consumer.A total of 16 States produce rice and among those Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, Puducherry, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have the most number of brands. If the government continues to impose GST, consumers would soon give up brands that will stand to lose their market, Mr. Thulasingam said.Sales misconceptionFederation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Association secretary A.C. Mohan said there was a misconception that branded rice was sold at a premium which was not correct.Only Basmati, which is not consumed in large quantities by the common man is usually in the higher price bracket.

About 10,000 hectares is expected to move to DRS method in the present kharif season.Though DRS technology was introduced in 2013, only a few had taken to it and the total area under the method in 2016 stood at around 1,100 hectares.A farmer will be able to save an estimated minimum 25% on his input cost and there will be reduced dependence on water under DRS. As the State stares at yet another drought and agricultural labour is scarce, this is a particularly relevant, say Agriculture Department officials.The Tungabhadra dam has not been filled owing to failure of rain for two years, resulting in reduced flow in the river. Water was not let into canal for raising the second crop in the Tungabhadra command area.SwitchoverThere has been lot of enthusiasm among farmers to switch over to the DRS method. The department has been extending assistance and guidance to farmers, besides giving them an incentive of Rs. 4,000 per ha with a ceiling of only 2 ha. Going by the pace, we hope that the technology will be adopted in about 10,000 ha, Shivanagouda Patil, Deputy Director Agriculture, told The Hindu .There is a transformation in the command areas and in areas were paddy cultivation is being done through lift irrigation in Ballari, Sirguppa and Hosapete taluks of the district. Farmers who have reaped benefits under DRS are doubling the area, while more are keen to adopt it.All these years, we followed the traditional practice of transplantation for cultivating paddy with lift irrigation facility. The Tungabhadra was our main source of water. In 2015, we faced water shortage. In 2016, I switched to DRS to cultivate paddy in about 8 ha and it turned out to be a wise decision. I will cultivate 16 ha this year, said S. Ramakrishna, a farmer in Hatcholli village"

But, down here in Chennai, the German International School has traded in the sausages for the lentils and the salami for the broccoli.The school, located in Palavakkam , has declared itself completely vegan from this school year, serving its students breakfast, lunch and snacks that are only plantbased.The school was inspired to cut out all animal products after it began throwing open its gates to injured and abandoned animals. As Thomas A Pallushek, advisor for international schools, Asia Pacific, puts it, it became tough to eat mutton with a pet goat on the lawns nearby. ""We felt it was ethically not right. We wanted to reduce the human impact on the environment and eating less meat is the simplest way,"" he says, adding that turning vegan is also healthier.So from the middle of 2016, the school that had been serving chicken, beef, fish and cheese, decided to first cut down on the consumption, even while increasing awareness among students. ""We watched a couple of informative documentaries on veganism with the students and also included it in our ethics classes,"" says Pallushek. Parents were informed and invited to a vegan buffet in December last year. ""They were very surprised to find it both delicious and nutritious,"" he says.The school, now 100% vegan, makes its own mock meat, produces vegan cheese from cashews, and bakes its own bread. Care is taken to see that nutritional requirements are met, by substituting animal products with protein-rich food such as quinoa, lentils, seitan, beans and hemp seeds. The menu ranges from cucumber avocado toast, zucchini bread and apple sauce, to ratatouille, flavoured rice with dal curry, pumpkin spice muffins and fruit smoothies.Neha Banerjee, whose daughter Tishta, 9, studies in the school, is happy that she is being introduced to healthy fare. ""We are a nonvegetarian family. At home, I can't get her to eat vegetables. But in school, she is eating a variety of vegetables and also other grains such as ragi and barley, and getting wholesome nutrition,"" says Banerjee, adding that they continue to eat non-veg at home."
5a0ed68a9855b76bf13d46b7,Goans love affair with Pao and breads,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/pao-erful-love-affair/articleshow/60042538.cms,2017-08-13,"Forget about snazzy alarms, for most Goans, it is the incessant honking of the bread vendor (poder as he is locally called) that is the much-needed early morning wake-up call.When it comes to culinary habits, Goa can quite simply be called the land of bread eaters. Such is the symbiotic relationship we share with this simple baked delight, that Goans living in Mumbai are often referred to as 'macapao' or even just 'pao'. In fact, it was Goans who set up the first bakeries in then Bombay and introduced bread to the rest of India. Goa still has the largest variety of bread as compared to the rest of the country.From the first meal of the day - breakfast - to the last - dinner - the humble pao, which is almost always baked traditionally in hole-in-the-wall coal or wood-fired ovens, is part and parcel of our staple diet. Despite the onset of electric ovens, traditional bakers prefer to use wood/coal-fired ovens for baking bread, the element, most of them say, that gives each variety of bread its distinctive texture, characteristic look and that deliciously smoked flavour and aroma.The fine art of baking bread may have been brought to Goa by the Portuguese missionaries, but like many other Goan delicacies , our nifty Goan bakers adapted the recipe, adding local ingredients, such as using toddy for leavening instead of yeast, to give the bread its distinct Goan flavour. Unfortunately, over time, the use of toddy has almost diminished, mainly due to the difficulty in sourcing it and the consequent escalating prices. Today most bakers use fresh yeast.Traditional bread is available in varied forms. The most commonly available are pao, unddo, katro pao, kankonn and the polli, also pronounced as poyi/poiee. The poyi itself has two varieties, kunddeachi poyi (husk poyi) and the godd poyi (sweet poyi). Interestingly, each of these varieties have their own timing in meal schedules.""Most Goans prefer the light and fluffy pao to the heavy chapattis. The best part of the pao is that it makes for an ideal accompaniment to be dipped and eaten, be it in tea or the Goan favourite 'kaalchi kodi' (quite literally, the previous day's curry, which is cooked out till it thickens) enjoyed as a mid-morning snack, or a bhaaji or the variety of typical Goan gravies,"" says Nuvem-based Steven Dias whose family has been in the bread-baking business ever since his grandfather started it off.Usually square-shaped and with a golden brown crust, the pao, which is a hugely popular bread variety, is famed for its pillow soft texture. The bread has a fine crumb and a natural spring to it that makes it an ideal accompaniment to soak up all our lip-smacking Goan gravies and curries. It lends itself just as well to being stuffed with meats and veggies of one's choice. From the popular evening snack of the bhaaji plate to the ros omlette, the pao rules.This bread, usually a breakfast favourite, is characterized by its distinctive butterfly shape. Interestingly, the bread gets its name from the Konkani word for scissor, 'kator' which is used to cut the dough into its shape.Unlike the kunddeachi poyi, this one is made with all-purpose flour (maida) thus giving it a soft texture. Bigger in size as compared to the husk variety, this one has an element of sweetness which makes it a top choice on the breakfast table or for evening tea. It is most often sliced open, slathered with butter and then dipped in piping hot tea and enjoyed.This donut-shaped bread, which gets its name from the Konkani word for bangle, 'kankonn', has a crusty exterior and is relished as a tea-time snack. Traditionally the kankonn, which has a slightly dry exterior would be bought and stored during the rainy season to be enjoyed with a hot cup of tea or bowl of soup. The shape of this bread also makes it a top favourite among children.This one's a top favourite with the health conscious and those told to stay off rice for medical reasons, and rightly so. The poyi has two defining features - its flat, disc-like shape and hollow inside and its wheat bran outer coating. Texture wise, the bread, which is made using a higher proportion of wholewheat flour and less of all-purpose flour (maida) (80:20), is a bit denser and consequently chewy.Slightly smaller is size than the pao, the differentiating factors between the two varieties is the round shape of the bread, its coarse crumb and its crust. The unddo is usually baked at a low temperature on the floor of the oven and this gives it a crunchy crust which shatters when you bite into the bread, only to reveal its soft insides which can soak up gravies like a sponge while allowing the bread to retain its shape. Little wonder then that this is the choice of bread for the king of Goan street food , the cutlet pao"

It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

The delay was because the consumers had not provided details like date of birth, Aadhaar card details, change of address and other details or because there were discrepancies.He said they had received over 200 complaints in the last four months about misuse of the system, where the people had received SMSs saying they had purchased goods, when they had not. Inquiries have been conducted and the respective supervisor and salesman of the shops were slapped with fines of Rs 25 for each kg of rice, Rs 50 for kg palmoil, Rs 50 for a kg of sugar and Rs 75 for every kg of dals purchased through fake bills.The DSO said that people who have no commodity cards, which they did not use to purchase also have to get their cards upgraded into smart cards, which they could do so by approaching the e-service centres in the district, by the end of this month.How to complain wrong billing:If the consumers of the PDS system receive SMSs for goods not purchased by them on their ration card or smart card, they can lodge a complaint by dialling the toll free numbers 1967 or 1800 425 5901."

As of August 9, agriculture department data shows zero paddy activity in the district.In fact, the time has passed for farmers to plant the regular, long-term variety of the crop. If there is sufficient rain in the coming days, the department may issue a short term variety of seeds which take 3-4 months to harvest.""The time to plant the regular variety ended on July 8.There hasn't been enough rain to sow even ragi, which consumes only a portion of the water needed for paddy,"" joint director (agriculture) MN Rajasulochana told TOI.""This is for the first time in decades that there is absolutely no paddy in the district, according to farmers and officers who have served here. There had been some paddy in all previous droughts,"" she added.Ragi should have been sown in 65,859 hectares, but only 4% of the target has been sown as of August 9.Sugarcane plantation looks better with 11.5% (2,878 hectares of targeted 24,829) of the target having been achieved, hoping sugar factories will pick up stock.Rajasulochana said the new variety of paddy seeds will be supplied if there is rain or water is released from Krishna Raja Sagar reservoir. The targeted area of ragi, paddy and other crops was devised by t h e g o ve r n m e n t , which supplies the seeds, based on rain predictions.With tanks, wells and borewells dry and no water from KRS, Mandya district is dependent on rain this season.""Officials may say they are yet to take stock of borewell-fed land, but they will find nothing,"" Induvalu Chandrashekhar, a farmer leader, said.Mandya is spread over 4.98 lakh hectares, of which 2.48 lakh hectares are the sown area. Of the 1.17 lakh hectares of irrigated area, 88,000 hectares get water from KRS and 16,000 from Hemavathi reservoir. The rest is irrigated by tanks, wells and borewells.In villages like Ganadahosuru and Ankanahalli, farmers have committed suicide due to failure of borewells.The few working borewells are laid low by lack of power. ""The power minister makes announcements in Bengaluru about continuous power supply, but what we get is 4-6 hours of interrupted supply,"" said Siddegowda, 75, who owns an acre in Ankanahalli.Of the total targeted area of over 2 lakh hectares, only 19.4% have been sown. ""This is achieved largely because of alasande (cowpea),"" Rajasulochana said. Data shows the district has sown it in 22,047 hectares.Sunanda Jayaram, another farmer leader, said: ""The approach to agriculture must change if the government wants to prevent farmers' suicides. Every strata of our society borrows money, but why do only farmers commit suicide?"" The government has been encouraging farmers to move away from paddy and sugarcane -two water-guzzling commercial crops -but they have been apprehensive because these two crops have fetched them marketable surplus.The district has 35 rice mills and four sugar factories, besides 532 jaggery units, which also consume sugarcane produced in the district."

The price of goat meat ('mutton', in local parlance) has gone down in the past month. And you can thank the friendly neighbourhood chicken seller for providing stiff competition, which has caused the price dip.While goat meat is selling at Rs 520 at Manicktala and Rs 530 at Rahmania in Kidderpore, it is as low as Rs 480 and even Rs 450 at markets in Gariahat and Behala. Till last month, the price was upwards of Rs 550.Meat traders blame chicken, which is selling for prices as low as Rs 120 across markets. Also, during monsoon, goats tend to develop fatal diseases (pneumonia, enterotoxemia and foot-and-mouth disease) and so, most sellers try to get the goats sold as quickly as possible.Food-loving Bengalis are overjoyed at the uncharacteristically 'downwardly mobile' prices.""At a time when all vegetables  from tomatoes to onions  are getting pricey, chicken and mutton prices have suddenly gone down. We are eating mutton at least twice or thrice a week these days. Earlier, mutton was only a Sunday treat,"" said Gariahat resident Arup Chakraborty Meat sellers at Gariahat said the price of goat meat was Rs 530 till end-June. Since then, there was a gradual decrease in the price, and now it's selling for Rs 480. ""The price has gone down since we are getting goats cheaper. Goat sellers are selling off the animals quickly fearing the animals would contract fatal diseases,"" said Md Asif, a seller at Gariahat.At Rahmania in Kidderpore, the price was hovering near the Rs 570 mark, but it has now come down to around Rs 530.However, 'reyaji mutton (goat meat with just the right amount of fat)', a delicacy and a speciality at their shop, is still priced at Rs 550. ""There has been a slight drop in price across the city. Apart from the cattle disease, another reason is stiff competition from chicken,"" said an employee at the shop.To make the most of the occasion, families of would-be brides and grooms in the upcoming wedding season are in a hurry to change their chicken platters with mutton items. ""We have been receiving requests to alter our price or change chicken items with mutton, but we have told our customers that the current price cannot affect our rate chart in any manner, as when we actually buy the meat, the prices are definitely going to rise again. We have a fixed rate chart and are charging our clients accordingly, irrespective of the changing prices,"" said Dwaraka Dutt of Diamond Caterers.Restaurants across the city, too, are following the same norm but some roadside eateries have slashed the prices of mutton rolls and mutton keema by around Rs 2 to Rs 5 to lure more customers. Industry sources said the prices are sure to increase a week before Viswakarma Puja on September 17 and again before the start of the wedding season.During monsoon, goats are prone to acquiring a number of parasite and bacteria-borne diseases that remain dormant during dry season. With arrival of wet weather, the parasites get the upper hand and their populations explode. The common diseases being pneumonia, foot and mouth disease  fatal contagious disease on the hoofs and mouth  and enterotoxemia  a disease that occurs due to toxin produced by bacteria of clostridium species."

He added that pertinently, these employees had been allegedly resorting to misappropriation or pilferage by taking out from 30kg bags and filling the same in 50kg bags. ""The wheat was also being made to gain moisture/weight by spraying water on it,"" the statement added.The spokesperson said the Department of Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affairs had always shown zero tolerance to any kind of pilferage or misappropriation of foodgrains at any stage. He added that the department had already taken similar action in such cases earlier also in Amritsar district, where four assistant food and supply officers (AFSOs) and 14 inspectors were placed under suspension, and disciplinary action initiated against 22 officials, including deputy director, Food and Civil Supplies, (now reverted to DFSC rank).He further said: ""Likewise, at various centres of Tarn Taran, the wheat stored in open plinths during 2010-11, 2011-12, and 2012-13 had got damaged.

Consequently, orders were issued to lodge an FIR against delinquent employees, namely inspector Jaspreet Singh Gill, Harvarinder Singh, Jaswinder Kumar, Rajwinder Singh, and Rahul Kumar.""""All these inspectors have been charge-sheeted after placing their services under suspension. Continuing its crackdown on such fraudulent and unscrupulous employees, the department, in another complaint case, has also suspended and charge-sheeted an inspector and the AFSO concerned for irregularities in distribution of wheat under PDS in Barnala district,"" added the spokesperson, saying the state government was committed to bringing these cases to a logical conclusion and recovering the financial loss caused due to such misconduct by delinquent officials."

They claim that at the time of inspections, the push carts will remain shut or or they change their places.Speaking to Express, N Poornachandar Rao, Assistant food controller, said, In a short span, we are going to raid all the food carts in the city -- both licensed and unlicensed. We have received many complaints from the public regarding unhygienic conditions of street food centres. In fact, many of these carts are unlicensed. Many of them are on encroached spaces or on the drains. In many cases, we found that these joints are using adulterated ingredients like used oil, unsafe water and rotten vegetables.He warned that people must be careful in choosing a food cart especially when it is not located in a clean environment.Fast food joints like noodles and fried rice stalls generally use adulterated oil and spices. In some cases, noodles and rice are cooked in wastewater.

A thousand kms away, the Karnataka government was grappling with solving the issue of land that the tribals from Diddadahalli had occupied and were claiming as their rightful due.Around the same time, we had Prime Minister Narendra Modi announce just after the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections that he would like to see a new India arise where the poor and marginalised had access to opportunities and not mere government doles.While each of these give conflicting signals, one is sad that despite 70 years of independence, the country is still grappling with how to strategise and undertake development of indigenous tribals who constitute a little more than 8% of the nations population.Article 366 (25) of the Constitution refers to Scheduled Tribes (STs) as those communities which are scheduled in accordance with Article 342 of the Constitution. The STs are mainly the indigenous population that the Government of India identifies as socially and economically backward and in need of special protection from social injustice and exploitation.The tribals are identified by the government based on a communitys primitive traits, distinctive culture, shyness with the public at large, geographical isolation and social and economic backwardness.Tribal communities live in about 15% of the countrys areas in various ecological and geo-climatic conditions ranging from plains to forests, hills and inaccessible areas. There are 705 ethnic groups notified as Scheduled Tribes in India who live across 30 states and Union Territories. Tribal groups are at different stages of social, economic and educational development.While some tribal communities have adopted a mainstream way of life at one end of the spectrum, there are 75 Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) at the other who are characterised by a pre-agriculture level of technology, a stagnant or declining population, extremely low literacy and a subsistence level of economy.The central government created the Ministry of Tribal Affairs in the year 1999 to give focused attention to the social and economic development of these indigenous communities and has planned to spend close to Rs 5,300 crore in the current fiscal year on tribal development.While millions of rupees are being spent by the government, the non-government organisations and the corporates under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes across the country, one finds it difficult to explain why the development of the se indigenous communities has not been to the levels expected.To understand this, we need to appreciate that programmes are currently designed by non-tribal people who seem to be deciding on what tribal development should be. It is unfortunate that many of these experts and bureaucrats are designing and delivering programmes that many a time seems to be disconnected from the ground realities.Across India today, the tribals are at the crossroads and are neither able to move away from their dependence on traditional economies nor are they able to integrate with the demands of the market. They are wrestling with change  both at the individual and at the community level and are neither able to let go off the past nor are they able to embrace the present.Programmes that are thrust on them are forcing them to accept lifestyles that are unsustainable socially, economically and culturally. Caught between the devil and the deep sea, they are left vulnerable to the forces that continue to exploit them and are living a life of merely coping with the poverty that surrounds them.To make matters worse, most tribal areas are also rich in natural resources and they suffer the collateral damage created by large irrigation projects and extractive industries.Interventions to develop the indigenous communities needs to begin with an understanding of the tribals themselves. One needs to appreciate that these are communities who have traditionally lived in communes under the leadership of chieftains and have operated in the traditional economy.Moving from a hunter-gatherer situation to a mixed economy is culturally jarring and can have shocking consequences if not handled sensitively.The states planning and executing machinery has little time, patience or competence to understand the dynamics and power structures in the tribal areas and little appreciation of attitudinal and behavioural dimensions.Shoddy implementationThis results in shoddy implementation of schemes and does not provide enough space for meaningful participation of the people. What is further disturbing is that all these schemes are not dynamic or responsive, and seem to be urban solutions to tribal problems.Precious little consideration is given to the skills, knowledge and practices that could help in addressing tribal issues through grassroots perspectives. Seven decades of rapid acculturation and shoddy integration into the mainstream culture has left these communities in confusion.Forest conservation laws that they can neither understand nor find relevance in, has left them at a crossroad with neither a coping mechanism nor an alternate lifestyle.Economic and social demands of mainstream culture and life is forcing them to abandon their traditional methods which kept things simple and sustainable and adopt more expensive, government and NGO-driven coping strategies which are neither culturally appropriate nor contextually relevant.These indigenous tribals can neither go back to the past nor have they successfully integrated with the present. The skills that they traditionally had no longer meet the demands of modern existence. All that exists is an insensitive and patronising system that talks of their development bereft of the dignity that they deserve.(The writer, founder of Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, has lived and worked with indigenous tribal communities for more than three decades)"

With the government likely to place orders for 750-1,000 loads (1 load equals 10 tonnes) of rice from Andhra Pradesh for Onam to sell it through Consumerfed/SupplyCo, the prices are likely to remain subdued for another couple of months at least, say dealers.The state imports its branded rice from Andhra Pradesh, especially its preferred Jaya variety. The government purchases the rice at wholesale prices and sells it at subsidized rates of around Rs 25-26/kg during the festive season. Due to this, prices will remain lower, said Gangadaran, a leading rice broker. However, compared to last Onam, when the rice prices were in the Rs 26-27 range, the prices this year are higher. The state consumes nearly 40 lakh tonnes of rice per annum, of which the Jaya and Surekha varieties account for at least 22 lakh tonnes. Around 70 per cent of the states populace consumes the two rice varieties.Venkatesh Divakaran, another rice dealer, said rice production has been good this season in Andhra Pradesh. The lack of domestic demand will ensure the prices continue to be lower in the coming months. There has not been a major hike or fall in prices in recent months. We expect it to rule steady until the end of Onam season, he said.The spike in prices during January-March was attributed to large-scale rice exports from Andhra Pradesh to Africa and south Indian states, which led to a reduction in arrivals from Andhra Pradesh."

These are grown in kharif (summer) and rabi (winter) season and already been harvested.As per the data, rice output is estimated to be a record 110.15 million tonnes in 2016-17 as against 104.41 million tonnes in the previous year.

The situation is much worse in northern districts, where the rain shortfall could be as high as 50 per cent.Experts reckoned there would be at least 20 per cent decline in production in cardamom, pepper and coffee this year in Kerala. As far as paddy is concerned, the farmers in north Kerala are on the edge as they are pumping water into the fields from nearby brook for the ongoing paddy replanting season.Kanjirappally-based planter Joshy Joseph Manniparambil, who is big time into pepper and cardamom cultivation in Tamil Nadu, said the scanty rains this year would spell trouble for Kerala. Being a cardamom farmer, I can say for sure the production will be lower by at least 20 per cent, said Joshy. But thankfully, the prices are high at Rs 1,200/kg, compared to Rs 600/kg in 2014. Pepper farmers have been hit hard as they are faced with less production and lower prices due to the spices big imports from Vietnam, he said.Kerala Agriculture University Research Director P Indira Devi said the state had to realign to the new water-deficit reality. Weve been used to abundant supply of water, splurging it not just in our daily use but also in our agricultural practices, said Indira Devi.The patchy rain is affecting the states agriculture sector in more ways than one. For one, there is an increase in the irrigated area in the state in the last 3-4 years, Indira Devi said.AS per the Economic Review, the agriculture and allied sectors, which recorded a growth rate of 1.43 per cent in 2011-12 witnessed a negative growth rate of (-) 6.31 per cent in 2013-14, (-) 1.09 per cent in 2014-15 and (-) 2.9 per cent in 2015-16.The share of agriculture and allied Sectors in the total GSDP of Kerala has also declined from 14.38 per cent in 2011-12 to 11.48 per cent in 2014-15 and to 10.38 per cent in 2015-16.We need to popularise new crop-water technology for most efficient irrigation, given the reality of unpredictable monsoon, said Indira Devi. In 2016, the monsoon deficiency in Kerala was 36 per cent.Rajesh Nair, a farmer in Wayanad who quit the Greenpeace to plunge full-time into organic cultivation of ethnic rice varieties, said it was going to be hard times for farmers like him. The paddy-rice replantation (njaru nadeel) is done during July-August in north Kerala while the process will be complete in south by June.We (in Wayanad) are pumping water into the paddy fields from the nearby small canals. But due to scanty rains, the springs havent broken out from the brooks and canals so far, which is a cause for big worry, said Rajesh.Not just paddy, the shortage of rains is also affecting coffee and pepper production too, he said. The pollination in pepper happens during the rains, and this is same with coffee, Rajesh explained.This means, there will be a sharp decline in production of not just paddy, but pepper and coffee too this year.Due to the use of water pumps, investment has gone over the roof this year. Further, the untimely returning monsoon or Northeast monsoon (mid-October) during the paddy flowering season will increase the chaff, and reduce the production.DOWNPOOR34 per cent deficit in 201630 per cent deficit so far in 2017Last years north-west monsoon (retreating monsoon) was also poorAgri sector showed a negative growth rate of (-) 6.31 per cent in 2013-14, (-) 1.09 per cent in 2014-15 and (-) 2.9 per cent in 2015-16Share of agriculture in the total GSDP of Kerala fell from 14.38 per cent in 2011-12 to 11.48 per cent in 2014-15 and to 10.38 per cent in 2015-16"

The chief minister accused the BJP of trying to scuttle the rights of states on deciding on reservation for communities by proposing to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Other Backward Classes.He sought to know how many times BJP president Amit Shah had spoken in favour of reservation. Even senior BJP leaders such as L K Advani had opposed the recommendations of the Mandal Commission, he said.Kharge even accused the BJP to trying to tamper with the Constitution to do away with reservation.Siddaramaiah accused the BJP of opposing pro-people and pro-poor policies of the state government such as Anna Bhagya scheme of providing free rice to BPL families and Indira canteen set up to help the poor get meals at affordable rates.No Indira canteen has come up in areas declared as play grounds or parks as claimed by the BJP.

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

Last week, we shipped 10 tonnes of bananas to Dubai in a controlled environment in a week's time. It cost the exporter just Rs 10 per kg while the air freight would have been at Rs 60 per kg,"" Apeda Chairman D.K. Singh told IANS.""We are also going to send one more consignment soon. We are trying to develop a set protocol for shipping bananas. Once we establish it, the water transport mode will be introduced for other fruits and vegetables.""Incidentally, Apeda has been using water transport for export of non-perishable products such as basmati rice and processed items but it could not be used for perishable items due to their very short shelf-life.Apeda funded the study by the National Research Centre for Banana (NRCB) to decide various aspects such as preserving the fruit in long-duration ship journeys in a controlled environment, in which specific temperature, humidity and pH level have to be maintained.""We also sent two of our scientists with the consignment to check the quality of bananas on their arrival in Dubai,"" Singh said.In the first consignment, Apeda sent the Nendran variety that has a relatively good shelf-life.""Now, we are planning to export two different varieties as each variety requires a different set of controlled environment conditions. Subsequently, we will notify the standards for banana exports,"" Singh said.Apeda is planning to focus on transporting mangoes and fresh vegetables using the water route once the banana plan is in place.Apeda had tried to venture into water transport in the past but the plan could never take off.According to the Apeda's export statement of principal products, export of fresh fruits went up in 2015-16 by almost 40 per cent to 7,98,755 tonnes compared to the previous year. However, it went down by almost 80 per cent to 1,65,103 in 2016-17.Similarly, export of fresh vegetables saw a hike in 2015-16 by 94 per cent to 36,31,973 tonnes compared to that in 2014-15 but it fell by 86 per cent to 4,87,316 tonnes in 2016-17.In 2017-18 (April- June), fruit export reached to 2,17,901 tonnes while fresh vegetable was pegged at 7,53,704 tonnes."

The average price index given by the state Economics and Statistics Department attests to the soaring price levels, he said.Thilothaman stated the prices of many provision items like pulses and cereals have fallen drastically in recent weeks. As a follow-up to the talks Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had with the CM and Deputy CM of Andhra Pradesh, he continued the exercise and the Andhra Civil Supplies Minister has agreed to directly provide rice to Kerala, sans middlemen.Through this move itself, rice price has begun to decline in the state, he said. A MoU has been signed with the Andhra Pradesh Government, he said.Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala sought details of the MoU and the date of signing as well as quoted price for the deal, but Thilothaman dithered. Papers are in the process of being exchanged. It will be signed shortly, he said. In view of the Onam festival, 1,470 Onam fairs will be opened by Supplyco this time. Consumerfed will operate 3,500 Onam fairs and Horticrop will add 2,000 vegetable stalls. Currently, there is a price rise in the case of a few vegetable items, though not exorbitant. Through various measures including the proposed Onam fairs, the government is keen to ensure a festival season free from the price hike, he said.A price monitoring cell is functioning in the state now.

The great Green Revolution actually created a Grain Revolution at the expense of the greens we consumed. Except for the Northeastern states, average Indian plate is now at least half grains and at the max, a quarter greens whereas the diabetes associations recommended plate is at least half greens and only a quarter grains.Dr Aseem Malhotra, Cardiologist and author of Pioppi Diet makes a strong case in his book on how health services across the world can save trillions of dollars if doctors recommend the low-grain-high-green plate of the people of Pioppi, Italy, where the average lifespan is 89 years and many live beyond 100. Just like Kerala, Pioppi is tucked between the coast and the Mediterranean hills and the vegetation is rich in green vegetables and olives like green fruits and coconuts for Kerala.In order for India to reverse its alarming rate of growth in diabetes, we need a Greener Revolution from our young agro-entrepreneurs by significantly increasing the yield of green fruits and leafy vegetables like Swaminathan and his team did with grains. This requires breakthrough startup ideas in agriculture production, harvesting tools and food processing technologies so that greens can arrive on our plate as affordable and convenient to eat as grains.We shouldnt leave this 73 billion dollar market opportunity to medicines and to the likes of quinoa from South America or oats from Australia. If the Green Revolution began from the plains of Punjab, the ideal place to start the Greener Revolution is from the Western Ghats of Kerala, which is now known only for the struggling rubber and tea plantations, once rich with leafy vegetables and fruit like jackfruit, banana, papaya, guava, etc.(Founder, Jackfruit365.com)"

When neighbouring villages get inundated, residents come in boats to seek shelter in the four gurdwaras and schools of Barkola. We provide free food to the victims in the langars of the four gurdwaras of the village. As government relief comes late and in scant amount, we villagers ourselves share whatever food we have. We survive because of this cooperation, said Kartara Singh, president of Nanak Sahi gurdwara in the village.Located some 15 km south of Nagaon town, Barkola boats 10,000 residents out of which 2,000 are Sikhs, mostly Dalit Mazhabis. Tiwa and Koch tribals, Assamese Dalit communities such as Hiras and Kaibartyas and OBC Nath Jugis make up rest of the population.Prolonged isolation from Punjab has made the Sikhs closer to Assamese communities that with other Sikhs.We speak Assamese, call ourselves Assamese Sikhs and intermarry with Assamese Hindus. The then Punjab chief minister Giani Jail Singh along with Surjit Singh Barnala had visited Assam in 1975 to meet us. Learning that we cant speak Punjabi, he had requisitioned Siromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) of Amritsar and sent one Giani Bhajan Singh of Anandpur Sahib to teach us Gurumukhi script in 1979. He married a local Assamese Sikh woman, lived with us for 30 years and died recently after retirement, Kartara Singh added. However, since then the SGPC has not assisted the Assamese Sikhs in the maintenance of gurdwaras or development of the community kitchens.Narrating the history of the Assamese Sikhs, Assamese Sikh Association general secretary and principal of the lone higher secondary school in Barkola, Pratap Singh said: Ahom king Swargadeo Chandrakanta Singha requested help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh to fight Burmese invaders in Assam. Some 500 Sikh soldiers fought the Burmese in Hadirasokhi in Goalpara out of which only a dozen survived. They sailed across Brahmaputra in a boat through its tributary Kopili to Chaparmukh in Nagaon district. Of the survivors, one Subedar Ram Singh left Chaparmukh for Barkola, married a local Assamese woman and established our roots. From Barkola, few families established communities in Helem in Sonitpur district, Hathipara in Nagaon district and Lanka in Hojai district.Over the years, the Assamese Sikhs have assimilated into the Assamese identity so much so that till 1980s, they used to call the gurdwaras as naamghar or traditional Assamese temple. The village also has its share into Assamese nationalism.Three sons of Barkola, Chandan Singh, Karam Singh and Banindra Mazumdar laid down their lives during 1983 Assam agitation. All of us took out silent marches during that period. The men were all geared up to fight against illegal immigration of Bangladeshis. They were all agitated. We spent sleepless nights, Harbansh Kaur added.However, the village still feels neglected despite contributing top police officials, army officers and Assamese language literatures.We have been demanding construction of embankment along the Kopili river as permanent solution to provide relief to us from recurring floods. Work began but has remained incomplete for the past 30 years, Pratap Singh added.Facing inundation of agricultural fields every year, the village has lost its expertise in making the famous Barkola jaggery.Sugarcane cultivation has massively reduced due to recurring floods. Our jaggery was famous throughout Northeast. Now, most people are indulged only in rice and vegetable cultivation. Some 80% of Barkola residents are cultivators and the remaining 20% have government jobs, said Dakhinpat Gaon panchayat president Tutumoni Saikia Laskar.Though the Assamese Sikhs have been included in the minority board and get some benefit of government schemes, their demand for Assamese Sikh Development Council for the past 20 years has been ignored.We are too scattered and too divided politically to matter as an electorate, Pratap Singh added."

With the Centre turning back to the statehood demand, the Mamata Banerjee administration has also continued with total isolation of the hills by cutting off Internet.IN PICTURES: Gorkhaland protests in DarjeelingLPG cylinder prices have touched high of Rs1,800 per cylinder and availability of food in markets have touched new low. Food supplies from the plains have been stopped by Bengali organisations of Siliguri, allegedly supported by the police.Though GJM has often distributed eatables to residents of tea gardens where cultivation does not take place, it has never been sufficient.However, one word has kept the indefinite strike going is indigenous knowledge.The indigenous knowledge orally passed down through generations has allowed the consumerism-struck residents of the two hill districts to fall back to their roots.This indigenous knowledge has enabled the residents to scourge the correct locations in the forests for shoots and roots and cultivate indigenous varieties of crop after supplies from the plains stopped. The indefinite strike has also led to increased cooperation between people -- including age-old barter system -- which had faded away as consumerism crept in.""Many of us had started to depend on rice from the plains and stopped cultivating our locally-grown indigenous varieties. Now, many farmers in our village and neighbouring villages are cultivating maize and local varieties of rice and are also fetching bamboo shoots and wild mushrooms from the forests. Many are also preparing fermented soyabean, a must with every meal that was earlier available in the markets, at their homes,"" said Man Bahadur of Yokprintam village, 25 km from Kalimpong town.The soil of this part of the Himalayas also supports cultivation of a variety of vegetables including potatoes, ladies finger, brinjals, tomatoes, beans, bitter gourd among others.With currency notes rendered useless in the wake of the complete shutdown, availability of farm workers has also gone down the abyss, which has also forced people to work together at each other's farmlands.""It seems we have returned to the traditional way of cultivation that our forefathers followed when society was egalitarian. Farm workers are not available due to the strike. So, people nowadays work together in rotation at one person's farm in the village. The next day, they will all work at someone else's land. After work, all the farm workers eat at the residence of the person on whose land they worked. Nobody is small or big in this work. This has brought us closer,"" said Ramesh Rai of Samalbong village in Kalimpong district.Besides this commune-type work, villagers are also sharing their meat. ""Just today, a big chicken was slaughtered at my house. While we kept 1 kilogram, we gave the rest to our neighbours. They would do the same when they slaughter their chickens,"" said Suren Tamang of Seokbhir Khani village of Kalimpong district.However, one crop that has taken a beating due to the strike is ginger. ""While 40 kg of ginger costed Rs 6,000 last year, it has reduced to only Rs 800 per 40 kg due to the strike,"" said Mangal Tamang of Takling village, equidistant from both Darjeeling and Kalimpong towns."

The tests confirmed the presence of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), which activists claim is due to oil extraction and refining.Dismissing the ONGCs claim that oil leaks and spills were dealt with appropriately, two soil samples that were collected from a farm in Thirupunjai in Thiruvarur district, which was contaminated during an oil spill more than a decade ago, showed the presence of 1760 mg/kg and 2983 mg/kg of TPH, respectively.Given that uncontaminated soils should have no trace of TPH, the levels found in the Thirupunjai field are exceedingly high and highlight the failure of the ONGC to deploy remedial measures to restore the paddy lands, said Nityanand Jayaraman of Chennai Solidarity Group, addressing a press conference on Wednesday.In an emotional outburst, delta farmers, Kasturi and Annadurai, alleged that an entire generation was getting affected due to hydrocarbon operations by the ONGC and the CPCL.Our children are literally drinking poison and several have been afflicted with life-threatening ailments over the years. We have spared our land for laying pipelines trusting them and now we are fighting for our lives. Police are treating us like Naxalites, if we protest. The government and the district administration are taking sides with the polluter, they alleged.Chandra Mohan of Arapoor Iyakkam said that even 38 days after the June 30 spill in Kathiramangalam, the ONGC hasnt taken remediation measures and as a result pollutants are contaminating public water resources and Velloor irrigation canal.Two sets of water and soil samples taken from Sriram Ramamoorthys certified organic farm, which was the epicentre of the June 30 spill, contained TPH ranging from 33.9 mg/L in water to 1,118 mg/kg in the soil.Piyush Manush of SpeakOut Salem said that the activists groups would mobilise farmers and file a private complaint in the local district magistrate court shortly."

Each participant was unique in her approach as IPSHITA PAUL finds out chatting with seven such homepreneurs...Unnati TrivediPeople going to a strangers house to have food cooked by the women of the house is a unique idea. Also the love and care with which my family members serve the food creates a homely atmosphere for themTo give a platform to the extraordinary cooking skills of their mother and aunts, Unnati and her sister Prachi came up with the idea of Pop Up Kitchen  a home-based restaurant. The idea was to create a unit of mom chefs. At first, our family members were reluctant to open their house to strangers, we were able to convince them, says 22-year- old Unnati.They first organised the restaurant in their dining hall four months ago. The youngster feels blessed as their first pop up lunch was a success. For the first event, around 60 people came and since then the number has increasedpeople not only liked our food but they also became overwhelmed by the arrangements we made for them.So far, they have organised three pop up lunches. We remove furniture from the dining hall and place around five tables. At one sitting, we can serve around 20-25 people.Specialising in authentic vegetarian Gujarati dishes, the kitchen has four chefs  her mother Chetna and her three aunts  Manisha, Smegha and Nimita, who are members of the club. They have also tied up with other women who are specialized in cooking various dishes. We also want to provide a platform to other moms who are passionate about cooking and bring their talent to the fore. As of now, we have three mom partners, she smiles.To create the perfect ambience, the entire group decorated the hall with traditional Gujarati handicrafts in their last outing. Gradually they also plan to offer other cuisines like Marwari, Malayali and Marathi in their Pop Up Kitchen. Ask her how the unit functions and she says, My sister and I take care of the organising and marketing work while the others take care of the kitchen.The sisters believe that though they are co-founders, the business belongs solely to the women of the house. We have divided the profits made so far among them only...we dont take any share as this is their platform, she says.At present, they inform people and promote lunch dates through Facebook and word of mouth. Luckily for us, people respond with great enthusiasm and also help us to spread the word further, she adds. Apart from organising the events, the kitchen also puts up stalls at various events and takes order for corporate and social parties. The kitchen charges `400 per head for the pop up lunch and for catering they charge `350 per head.Pop Up Kitchen will be organising their next lunch event on August 20.

Since then she had always wanted to do something for senior citizens who stay alone  away from their children and loved ones. And in November 2016, she gave shape to her dreams by opening Naamcare in partnership with two other people  a doctor and a marketing expert  to offer services to the elderly of the city.Before starting her association, Anitha conducted an online market survey to understand the current scenario and the kind of problems senior citizens face. Based on the results, we decided to address not only medical issues but also other non-medical and need-based issues, she shares.At present, Naamcare has 22 registered clients for whom the association offers a variety of services based on the customised subscription package they selected. We provide companionship service  where we take them to their preferred place and then back to their place, home need services, at home recreation, geriatric food, doctor, nurses, physiotherapist and attendant on call and counselling services depending on the package the client has selected.

The option of jobs includes cleaning maid, cook, nurses and caretaker for babies and patients. After giving them training, I also offer them food and lodging until they get a job.Earlier I had arranged their lodging in a different location, but owing to their security I have shifted the arrangement to my own house, she shares. Motcha, along with her team, usually visit various small and economically backward villages to empower women and provide them a stable life. We go to a village once in three to four months to conduct meetings and distribute pamphlets of our agency. Later, the leader of the village after verifying my background contacts me and refers the girls, she says explaining her process of work. Till date, she has covered more than seven villages which include Uthiramerur, Thiruvannamali, Maruthur, Salem among others.The agency has 160 girls working all over India and abroad and nearly 256 clients. Depending on the situation, she also treats her client free of cost. The elderly people who are poor and need attention  I dont charge money from them, otherwise, I charge 50% of the salary paid to the girls from the client, she says.Quoting the salary that the women get from the job, she says, The salary varies between `9,000 between `18,000 in the city. Also the salary includes two days leave a month and free food and accommodation when required, she declares.For details, call: 7550109718saanvi AishwaryaI am the sole breadwinner of my family. I want to expand my business so that we are able to live comfortably in the futureAfter completing her BTech in electronics and communication, S Aishwarya realised that she wanted to be her own boss, rather than being employed under somebody. And on December 16, she first manufactured LED lights as a part of her brand  Saanvi Lights. After my degree course, I used to work in an office as an embedded engineer.Thats where I got this idea, recalls the 19-year-old. At present, the teenager produces tube lights, bulbs, street lamps, panel lights, moving displays as well as false ceiling lights. I have converted a part of my house into a small factory and the lights are manufactured there.Aishwarya feels that her products stands out in the market as she includes sensors in them. If a person wants the lights of the room to be dim or bright, I can include that feature in the lights by using the codes, she shares.She provides these sensors in all the lights she makes. I primarily use two types of sensors  motion sensor and remote sensor. If the customer wants to control the power of the light from a mobile, I can provide an application for that too, smiles Aishwarya adding all her lights have a guarantee period.However, Aishwarya doesnt get the liberty to completely focus on her business. Due to financial constraints, she has to work somewhere else too.I need a stable job to keep up with expenses I took this one as the timings are good and it allows me to work on the lights at least till 2 am, she says.Though an entrepreneur, she believes that she is yet to enter the market. I cant take orders in bulk. Whenever I take orders, I charge at least 60% of the amount in advance so that I can buy the raw materials. I dont think everybody will agree with my policy. Hence I am struggling, she says.Within these eight months of business, she has sold around 12 display lights, 250 tube lights, 50 bulbs, 15 moving display and 50 panel lights among others.For details, call: 8939694305Megha DoshiAfter participating in the workshop, the students who are weak in science will get to understand the concept in a completely new light and they will also take a liking to the subject...slowly but surelyAfter working for 11 years in the banking sector, Megha Doshi was eager to do something in the educational sector. I was new to it, so when I was searching for something concrete to pursue, I got introduced to this concept of Science Adda, recalls Megha, who now runs the franchise in Chennai. Science Adda sets up portable science laboratories in schools to give the students hands-on experience and a practical demonstration of what they read in their text books.Depending on the requirement of the school, the franchisee assembles such labs for class 4 to 10. Till date, I have assembled labs on home appliances, electric current, water, science expo, sound, light, etc as well as teacher training programs to introduce the school faculty members to the concept, in around five schools.Science Adda is based in Bengaluru and Megha had to take special training to successfully conduct the brands activities in Chennai. There was a screening process to test my marketing skills. After that I was given extensive product training followed by a visit to a few schools in Bengaluru where the workshops were getting conducted in order to get a clear picture, she shares.It was a six-month process after which she started operations in the city. Once we fix the terms with the school, we station our lab in the school for the fixed number of days.Megha however only takes care of the marketing and organisational part, and has people from science backgrounds to explain the ideas while conducting the workshop. At present I am working with a team of four people. They are also given training on how to deal with queries of students belonging to different classes, adds Megha.She feels that one of her biggest challenges is to convince schools to include the workshops in their curriculum. I dont want even one child to miss a good opportunity, and therefore as per our policy, the schools have to make it mandatory and not optional.Ask her why she zeroed in on this business idea, and she says, I conducted research and found that none of the schools have concept-based labs. As a result, the weak students find it difficult to understand. Our one-and-a-half hour sessions provide them with a comprehensive overview of the topics they study in class, she opines.Having started work in 2015, she had to partially stop during the floods and cyclone in 2015 and 2016. Talking about her journey, she shares, I think I have been able to provide the students with something more than just the virtual experience, smiles Megha.For details, call: 9884510862K Raghavi SenthilkumarBeing a disabled woman, I face a lot of challenges, and without the support of my husband and parents I could have never achieved so much in lifeShe was always interested in empowering the marginalised section of the society, especially persons with disability and women. Thats why K Raghavi Senthilkumar formed an NGO  The Headway Foundation  in December 2016.Raghavi feels that many disabled people are ignored because of social stigma. To bring them in the limelight, we need to break stereotypes. And it can be surely done with training and awareness. Training transforms them by imbibing the right values and knowledge, while awareness increases the chances of their acceptance, says the BTech cum MBA graduate.Years ago, she organised a kick-start programme along with her husband where they invited HR managers and other professionals from the industry to showcase the talent of the disabled. We personally wanted to break the barrier, she opines. During our first event in 2016, we successfully placed 71 hearing impaired students in different companies across the banking and non-voice sectors. This year, 843 disabled people got shortlisted by 100 companies across various sectors.The NGO celebrated womens day with the workers of a village employed under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Our vision was to empower women and make them aware of their rights, she smiles. The environmental month was celebrated with the students of a government matriculation school while the recent campwas open to all. Through the camp, we tried spreading awareness about stem cell donation along with organ and blood donation.Sharing her future plans, she says, We want to create a barrier-free society for the disabled people. We want to empower them by giving equal opportunities, diversity and inclusivity. However, Raghavi maintains that she couldnt have proceeded without the support of her family.For details, call: 9940633177RajalakshmiMy daughter told me to apply for old age pension but I rejected that idea. I am competent enough to look after myself, unlike many who are weakand are in dire need of the pensionR ajalakshmi Venkataraman believes entrepreneurship is not just about earning money but its about adding meaning to life. Thus, at 64, she decided to start a business to earn a livelihood instead of financially depending on her daughter and son-in-law. Though my daughter and her husband have always been supportive, after my husbands death and my daughters marriage, I really didnt want to depend on anyone for money, shares Rajalakshmi (65).Though several ideas crossed her mind, she decided to go with her mothers recipe of millet-based healthy porridge powder. My mother used to make this powder at home and I have been drinking this beverage since childhood. I also make this powder for my children. So, I thought why not convert this idea into a business, she says.Rajalakshmi has been making around 10-15 kg of powder and walking around four hours every day to sell them. Since I am unaware of the recent digital promotional techniques, I go to the nearby park and approach people, explain my product and try to sell the packets. I have developed my business purely on the basis of word of mouth.However, the journey has not been an easy one for the senior citizen. People find it hard to trust my words and thats the biggest challenge I face every day. If I approach around 10-15 people, only three to four people will buy it. But once they buy, they always come back for a second order, she says.To expand her business, she also carries powder packets and readymade beverages to weddings and other events she attends. This has been very effective, as after drinking the porridge, people buy the instant mix powder from me.The porridge powder is available in two varieties buttermilk and milk. The milk-based powder can be given to babies and diabetic patients, she adds. The packets, available in 1 kg and 500 gm, costs ` 600 and `300 respectively. Explaining the high cost, she says, My products have around 20-25 basic ingredient apart from traditional rice varieties, and therefore it is priced high. Now, she is eager to create her own brand and name it after her mother Meenakshi Millet Mix.At present, she has around 50 regular clients and has sold nearly 1,000 packets till date. Her dream is to put up stalls at various exhibitions but as of now due to financial challenges, she is not able to proceed with it. My monthly income is around `3,000, therefore, I cant bear the cost of `2,000-3,000 for setting up the stall, she avers.For details, call: 9444567575/ 9444054320"

Hungry, he was looking around to grab a meal when he noticed the Indira canteen posters which mentioned meals for Rs.10.I came looking for the canteen. To my surprise, food was served free. I had the tasty vangibhath, rice-sambar and curd rice, an excited Rajesh said.Rajesh could not believe that meals will be served for just `10 in a city like Bengaluru. I wish we have similar neat canteens in my place. This will help people like us, he said.Vanajakshi and her sister Geetha, both flower vendors from Byrasandra, were also there. We string flowers and sell them. Since we leave for K R Market early in the day to buy flowers, we get no time to prepare food. We usually carry rice prepared the previous night. We cannot afford food in darshinis. But this price seems to be so good, Vanajakshi said.Suvarna from Rama Mandir Road in Basavanagudi said, I went to some of the small eateries, but they were closed today. So I walked a little distance to reach this Indira Canteen. The vangibhath is very good, I did not expect this, she said.Vinay Shetty (27) of Cheftalk Food and Hospitality Services, who was among the seven staffers serving people at the canteen, said they had prepared food for 6,000 people on Wednesday.BBMP commissioner N Manjunath Prasad said food inspectors will inspect the canteens frequently to monitor the food quality.A senior BBMP official said a total of 27 master kitchens will be set up across the city to cater to all the 198 canteens. Of these, 14 are ready and six are already operational.Shortage of platesThe canteen staff were seen struggling to cater to the rush due to a shortage of plastic plates. Since they had only about 500 plates, many were served food in areca leaf plates. Policemen posted on duty were even seen rinsing the plastic plates used by others. What else we can do? We are here since morning. If we wait till someone clean the plates, we will remain hungry, a policeman said."

And, according to officials, a lot of care has been taken to make the kitchens hygienic and efficient.Presently, there are six kitchens and, in the coming days, 27 kitchens will supply food to all the 198 canteens in the city. Each kitchen has been designed keeping in mind the menu and the number of people it is expected to serve. All the food is steam-cooked and food for about 6,000 people can be prepared in two hours.BBMP Special Commissioner for Indira Canteens, Manoj Rajan, said, If you look at the menu, we need to make both white rice and flavoured rice every day, so we have separate vessels for cooking rice.Each kitchen has three idli steamers, which can prepare a whopping 4,500 idlis in an hour. The prepared food is transported to the canteens in hot boxes so that it remains hot. A cold storage room is used to store vegetables and curd rice. The overall capacity of each kitchen is to feed about 6,000 people, and this can also be increased.No one to care for these workersWorkers who have come from Shivamogga to help with the preparation of food at the kitchen at Konena Agrahara havent been given accomodation yet.

For the working class like us, time also matters. That is why we prefer food from pushcart vendors than at the Indira Canteen, says 37-year-old Rajesh, an auto driver.Rajesh, a resident of Kurabarahalli, leaves home by 9 am and returns around 7 pm. I have my breakfast and dinner at home, but I have to have lunch outside. Indira Canteen food seems to be good, but for a person like me on the move, we also look for time. I cannot afford to stand for half an hour to buy food just because it is available for `10.Also, these canteens do not have provision to park our autos. I understand these are not highend restaurants where car parking is allowed. But I cannot park my auto somewhere else, walk to the canteen and spend time to have lunch there, he noted.There are many like Rajesh who prefer roadside food over the Indira Canteens. We do not eat rice every day. We consume rice only on some occasions. If there is no ragi mudde for lunch, its an incomplete meal for us. I come here to eat mudde-upsaaru (ragi balls with typical old Mysuru region curry) which costs `15. If I have mudde, I will not feel hungry for at least six hours, says Mahadev, a cab driver who hails from Kannenahalli in Mandya district.Jayalakshmi and Umesh, who run a pushcart eatery near Ramakrishna Ashrama, say they cater to 80 to 100 people a day. We provide mudde-upsaaru for `15, rice-sambar for `25 and with Vada for `30. There is no restriction on rice and sambar, Umesh said.The couple, who are into this business for the last seven years, say Indira Canteens will not affect their business. After all, we have our customers who still prefer us no matter where they are, Umesh said, pointing to a regular customer Mahadev."

If you thought you had seen it all with bhindi fry, masala, tadka or even a South Indian vengaya theeyal, then you Sir, need to order yourself some Bendakaya Pulusu at Nook, in Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park.The cafe style restaurant offers south Indian, north Indian, pan Asian and continental food. The ambience is set in green and white palette with box lights hanging from the ceiling. You are most likely to be surrounded by techies and a family crowd at this restaurant that also has a pool table and couch set in the lobby.The Lamb Seek Kabab is minced well and is topped with fresh coriander, the Prawns Tempura falls on the crunchier side and the Chicken Tikka was well marianted with flavours of the charred grill in the soft meat pieces. In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"

In the last few years, I have taken the brand to a national level, overseeing the opening of restaurants in cities such as Pune, Bengaluru, Chennai and Kolkata.Its been a tremendous learning with conceptualising, planning menus, training manpower and keeping the consistency throughout. I won the Global Grill in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and for Sigree in 2010, 2011. And was named among top 60 chefs in 60 years from IHM Mumbai. I passed out in 2003 from the college IHM Dadar catering and joined The Park group of hotels as a Kitchen management trainee and thats where I honed the skills of making kebab and curry.My hobbies have only been related to food. I enjoy cooking and I usually spend my spare time testing recipes and archives to understand the history of the food industry.I found two unique ingredients in Japanese cuisine  Japanese horseradish and Mirin. Japanese horseradish, also known as wasabi, is an Asian root that is ground or grated to produce a pungent, strongly flavoured condiment. Although, it is different from a horseradish plant, its often used in raw fish such as sushi or sashimi and to serve with various varieties of cooked fish, noodles and salads. It is also used to make dips and marinades. Its very rare to find wasabi plant outside Japan.Mirin, on the other hand, is a Japanese rice wine, but with a low alcohol content and high sugar content. Its used in desserts, dips and poaching of various meats.- Harman Singh Sawhney, Head chef, Hoppipola"

The fish was cooked well, but some of the skewers were too salty, which wasnt the best way to start the meal. This was followed by Crispy Szechaun Squid Rings - while the flavours were good, the squid was overcooked, making the rings quite chewy. We had the Wok Tossed Seafood next  a mixture of prawn, fish and squid in your typical Chinese-y flavours  and the squid was again overcooked and the dish didnt really stand out.After the rather disappointing starters, we were hoping that the main course would make up for the rest. In came clay pots of steaming Broccoli Red Snapper and Prawn Curry. The Broccoli Red Snapper was quite good, but nothing you wouldnt find at your local Chinese take-out place. The Prawn Curry, which was a Thai yellow curry with aubergines and pineapple, was the winner of the meal for us, as the pineapple went very well with the lemongrass and coconut flavours. We were served egg fried rice and chicken noodles with these two gravies, which werent too impressive. In fact, the egg flavour was was a little too strong in the rice, and we found ourselves reaching for the plain, steamed rice instead.While the chef informed us that there wouldnt be special pan Asian desserts to end the meal as they didnt want to shift focus from the seafood, we were served something of a dessert platter, which had fresh fruit, vanilla ice cream and a tiny piece of chocolate cake. Again, nothing stood out and the chocolate cake, if thats what it was, was overly sweet and dry.All in all, a disappointing meal. While the seafood was fresh, the Chindian-ness of the entire meal was what left us unimpressed. The festival is on till August 13.Cost for two: `2,400"

On the roof, solar panels provide him with electricity.Just under a decade ago, he says he could rent a country house for just 400 euros ($470) a month. Now for that price, he would be reduced to sharing a room.The number of tourists visiting Ibiza, a small island of just 142,000 inhabitants, has almost doubled from 1.7 million in 2010 to three million in 2016, according to the regional statistics institute.High demand for accommodation prompted the appearance of scores of tourist rentals, most of them without a permit, provoking a rise in real-estate prices and making it hard to find a room for less than 600 euros.The citizen's Platform of those Affected by Rental Prices in Ibiza has detailed the existence of countless abusive offers -- 500 euros a month to live on a balcony, 300 euros for a mattress not including the bathroom, or 2,100 euros for a small caravan.Trouble attracting workersWith a salary of just 1,400 euros as a truck driver and vendor, Andrade chose to buy his van for 3,000 euros.Four caravans are parked next to his van in a wasteland, its occupants opting for a nomadic lifestyle due to high rental prices.The situation gets even worse in high season, when the number of people on the island triples and temporary workers are needed in the tourism industry and other sectors, such as health services.Such is the difficulty to find affordable housing that the Can Misses Hospital in Ibiza, the main one on the island, has rehabilitated an unused floor to provide accommodation for temporary workers.Javier Segura, a 30-year-old microbiologist, arrived in June for a three-month contract and was forced to stay there after an unsuccessful search for a flat.""Some of the offers were rip-offs and others were really pricey... over 2,000 to 3,000 euros,"" he says.""And the offers with accessible prices, between 1,000 and 2,000, were all taken.""In an ironic twist, the tourism sector itself is finding it hard to find much-needed temporary workers if it doesn't offer accommodation with the contract.Years ago ""in May, I would receive 10 to 12 CVs every day to come work in the summer, now just one or two come,"" says Joan Riera, owner of the Can Alfredo rice restaurant in Ibiza Town, who has since opted to hire local personnel only.Reducing tourism""We have perverted the system,"" deplores Lucas Prats, president of an organisation that promotes tourism.Before there were ""buildings dedicated to residential homes and those in tourism zones. Now everything is for tourism.""As such, the regional parliament of the Balearic Islands has passed a law banning the use of apartments for tourists without a permit.It also limits to just over 623,000 the number of visitors who can stay in hotels or legal rental accommodation in one go, and plans to reduce that figure to around 500,000.""If we continue growing in this direction there will come a moment when we will not be a competitive destination. And neither will it be an area where one can live well,"" says Vicent Torres, director of tourism for the local government in Ibiza.""That's why we feel the need to reduce it all a little.""The aim is to stop locals from turning against tourism, an important activity for an island that was once poor and relied solely on fishing and agriculture before turning into an attraction for visitors in the 1960s.""In Ibiza there are no exceptions, we all live off tourism,"" says Prats."

In some dishes, it was difficult to guess the ingredients even after tasting it. Anokhi Kheer, an old Hyderabadi dessert is one delight. Traditionally kheer has rice or some other similar ingredient in it. The word anokhi means unique, and the uniqueness of this particular kheer lies in the fact that it uses onions instead of the usual rice as the main ingredient with milk. However, the dessert does not even have even a little bit of sharpness of taste which we normally associate with onions.The story of Anokhi Kheer dates back a few centuries. Unlike some other Nizami dishes, this used to be a dessert of the masses. Onion was an economical ingredient, and it is said that middle class and poor citizens who could not afford good quality rice substituted it with onions in their dessert. Anokhi Kheer was a typical summer food, it was served chilled to keep the body cool.Anokhi Kheer is prepared the same way as you prepare any other kheer, but the main trick is to prevent the pungency of onion from overwhelming the taste. Large white onions are used here, and sliced onions are boiled in water multiple times till the same get blanched, bringing out the sweetness. Like other kheer recipes, it is then added to reduced milk, sugar and khoya. Powdered cardamom seeds almonds, cashews and pistachios are used to add further taste to the dish.Unfortunately, this unique dish is not commonly available now. Jewel of Nizam is perhaps the only restaurant which serves Anokhi Kheer as one of their signature dishes. However, a few wedding caterers and home chefs like home chef Ahaana Khan have kept this dish alive. According to Ahaana, Choice of the right onions and patience in removing the pungency are key to the taste of this delicate dish.She laments that now very few people know about this dish, and one of the reasons of this dish going off popularity charts might be that the prices of onions have gone up many times compared to rice in the last few decades. She also mentions about another similar dish in Hyderabadi cuisine known as Lehsooni Kheer, where large garlic pods replace onions in the preparation. She fervently hopes that these delectable dishes regain their popularity in the times to come."

Interestingly, besides multi-level marketing schemes and online frauds, rice pulling seems to have become the best way for tricksters to relieve unsuspecting individuals of their material wealth. Days after the Kalady police arrested a native of Andhra Pradesh on charges of swindling several lakhs by deploying the trick, Ernakulam Rural Police unearthed yet another instance of rice puller fraud from North Paravur on Wednesday. In the latest case, the police arrested three persons, who allegedly duped a vegetable vendor from Angamaly off Rs 20 lakh by selling him the magic metal. The arrested have been identified as Vishnu Reddy, Nagaraj and Syed, all hailing from Udumalaipettai in Tirupur district, Tamil Nadu."

This year, the festival is being held between August 25 and September 5. While it is one of the most important festivals in Maharashtra, there are celebrations held across the country as well as in states like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.During Ganeshotsav, devotees throng pandals across Mumbai and other cities, and feast on sweets such as modak, which is considered Ganeshas favourite. To mark the end of the festival, the idols are immersed in water (visarjan) to the chants of Ganpati Bappa Moraya, Pudhchya Varshi Lavkar Ya (come back soon next year).Here are some facts about the festival:The Mumbaicha Raja Ganpati idol at Ganesh Galli; one of the oldest mandals, they have been around for 90 years. (HT file photo )Lord Ganeshas significance in Hindu mythologyGanesh Chaturthi is believed to mark the birth anniversary of the deity and is celebrated on the fourth day (chaturthi) of the Hindu calendar month of Bhadrapada. Ganesha or Ganpati is the younger son of Lord Shiva and Parvati. He is believed to remove obstacles (hence Vighnaharta, one of his 108 names) and is invoked for blessings at the start of any endeavour as the lord of good beginnings.There are various stories about his birth. One legend narrates that Ganesha was created by goddess Parvati out of dirt and set to guard her privacy while she had her bath. When Ganesha stopped Lord Shiva from entering their abode, he got angry and severed Ganeshas head. Parvati was heart-broken and to appease her, Lord Shiva fixed an elephants head on the child and thus, the elephant-headed Ganesha came into being. Another legend has it that Ganesha was created on request of the demigods to remove the rakshasas (demons) who were hindering them .The history of the festivalIts origins are related to the freedom movement. Back in 1893, freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak wanted to bring people together to create a feeling of patriotism. At a time when the British government frowned on Indians gathering together, Tilak urged people to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi publicly.Mawa modaks are available in a variety of flavours; modaks are believed to be the elephant-headed Ganeshas favourite sweet. (Shutterstock)What are the idols made of?The initial idols were made of mud but over time, Plaster of Paris (POP) became quite common. However, the latter pollutes the rivers and clogs water sources and contains harmful levels of mercury and cadmium. With growing awareness, a lot of people are now opting for eco-friendly idols made of easily dissolvable soil, coconut husk, fish friendly foods, and plant seeds.Which are the most famous pandals?Ganeshotsav is celebrated with a great deal of pomp and fervour in Mumbai. The must-visit pandals include Lalbaugcha Raja which is believed to fulfil wishes and attracts millions of visitors; Goud Saraswat Brahmin (GSB) Seva Mandal at Kings Circle, which is considered to be one of the richest mandals and known for their gold idols in the past (this year they wont feature an expensive idol); and the Keshavji Naik Chawl pandal in Girgaum, one of the oldest pandals (125-years-old) and the pandal where none other than Tilak had come as a visitor.Which are the best places to buy modaks?If you are looking for Ukadiche Modak or steamed modak made of rice flour and stuffed with coconut, jaggery, and cardamom, head to Modakam near Prabhadevi or Aaswad in Dadar. For mawa modaks, visit Panshikar Sweets in Girgaon and Dadar.Why dont people look at the moon during Ganesh Chaturthi?A story goes that the moon once laughed at Lord Ganesha and the deity cursed the moon. Hence, anyone who looks at the deity on Ganesh Chaturthi has to face the brunt of false accusations. According to a legend, Lord Krishna looked at the moon during Ganesh Chaturthi and was cursed leading him to be falsely accused of stealing the precious jewel Syamantaka.Follow @htlifeandstyle for more"

After the pitiable plight of the orphans was highlighted in the media, the administration has provided them with a ration card under Annapurna Antyodaya scheme under which they would get 35 kg subsidised rice every month. It has also been decided to cover the family under Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana.Until a couple of days back, these orphans led an obscure life. Deprived of the benefits under various welfare schemes of the Government, Ajay Behera (20), his brother Manoj (18) and two minor sisters Santoshi and Barsha were seeking solace from the district administration.A polythene-roofed makeshift shack at Gadavaguda, situated in the heart of the district headquarters town of Nabarangpur, is home to the orphans. Life took a harsh turn for these orphans after their father Balya Behera passed away in 2009. With the sole bread earner of the family no more, the family was left struggling to make ends meet. Adding to the suffering of the siblings, their mother abandoned them a year later. The entire responsibility of the family fell on Ajay, the eldest of the four, who was in Class VII then.At a very young age, Ajay started working as a daily labourer to feed the family. However, he found it difficult to sustain his siblings with his paltry income. He then admitted his two sisters in Deendayal Orphanage and Manoj in Utkal Balashram at Sindhiguda.Manoj, after completing his Plus-Two education, was not eligible to reside in Balashram any more and was forced to return home. On the other hand, Santoshi and Barsha were brought back from the orphanage two years back. Ajay claimed that his sisters could not continue their stay as the in-charge of the orphanage was misbehaving with them.Ajay now works in a hotel earning a meagre `150 per day. Manoj also works in a shop to help his brother sustain the family. We have no identity of our own. Though I had applied for an Aadhaar card, the officials asked me to produce identity proof. As I have none, they refused to entertain my request, said Ajay. Ajay had even been to municipal office for a ration card a number of times but to no avail. Moreover, as the makeshift shed is not able to accommodate all the four siblings, Ajay and Manoj have to spend nights on the verandah of a nearby house.Contacted, Collector Rashmita Panda said Santoshi and Barsha will be given `2,000 each every month under Integrated Child Protection Scheme. She further informed that Barsha, who is studying in Class VII, will be put in Kasturba Gandhi Vidyalaya. The administration will also provide vocational training to Manoj."

But still India No 2. That is the story of Pandu Rangaiah, a Nellore-born cueist. The 26-year-old lost his father, a labourer, early. With his mother being a housewife, he was forced to do odd jobs to put food on the table. From being a newspaper delivery boy to working in rice mills, Pandu did everything.Everything changed in 2003, when he was a 11-year-old. His friends took him to a local pool parlour and he immediately got hooked. He even worked at the parlour where he used to practise himself.I used to earn very meagre amounts previously. It used to be hard life. But as soon as I played once, I immediately got attracted. Initially I used to play small local events and earn money through that, he told Express.He started his professional career only in 2008, when a few friends took him to Hyderabad to play in a state-level competition. Since then, he has enjoyed a lot of success in such events, winning five of them while finishing as runners-up 14 times.Spotting my talent, a few of my friends sponsored to take me to play in the nationals for the first time in 2015. After reaching the semifinal in 2016, I got an offer from South Central Railway and got a job as an electrician, he added.Monetary constraints kept hounding him but the Cue Slam: Indian Cue Masters League will change all that. He represented Chennai Strikers where he was in the company of esteemed cueists like Pankaj Advani, who he lost to in the 2017 national final, and Vidya Pillai. Its been a chance to earn as well as learn for Pandu.I had tears when I got the chance to play here. The money on offer is quite a lot and also coach G Kishore Khurana has helped a lot. He has been teaching me the finer points of the game and also giving tactical training, which I did not get before. The format is quite fast with only 20 seconds between points. So it is quite challenging. Playing with legends will definitely help me in the long run.After Chennais loss in the semifinal stage, Pandu is already looking at the future. With the money he has earned from the league, he plans to play in his first international event and also send something to his mother. I want to represent the country in an international event and hopefully win a medal. Also, helping my mother is a priority, he signed off.ayantan@newindianexpress.com"

Embarrassed, she smiles and obliges. The World Championship silver medallist trains for six hours every day, 8.30am to 12 noon (on court) and 4pm to 6.30pm (endurance and weight training). Nine years ago, she had joined the academy run by the former All England champion. Before that, she had trained in two other places.Possessing a natural athletic build other than talent, PV Sindhu had to sacrifice a lot to be where she is now, things that are tempting for other teenagers, like hanging out with friends and having fast food. Like her classmates in Auxilium High School, she too had a craving for junk food. She also liked and still likes watching movies. In a chat with Express, Sindhu shed light on the years when she transformed from a girl next door into an international athlete.Until 9th standard, my diet was not strict. I ate whatever I wanted. I was lucky to have a body that did not gain much weight. When I got into 10th, things changed as I started travelling a lot. I had to maintain fitness and cut down things I loved, like chocolates and ice-cream. There were times when I felt like going to a movie with friends, but it could not happen as there was no time. We practised twice a day even then. All of it had to be synchronised with school as well.Sindhu and her parents, both volleyball players, lived in Secunderabad, about 25 kms from the academy in Gachibowli. I used to take care of her travel in the city ever since she started training under Gopichand in Gachibowli, her father PV Ramana, an Arjuna awardee and member of the bronze winning 1986 Asian Games team, said. Sindhus association with Gopichand goes back to around 2005, when he was yet to start the academy. We shifted to an area near the academy in 2012 to avoid the long commute, added Ramana, who accompanies her daughter to every training session.As Sindhu started spending more time at the academy, it became obvious that she would make more friends there. I loved school and remember that I used to run around a lot and get tired. I had a good friend named Chatur. We are still in touch, but rarely do we get the opportunity to talk. As I started spending more time at the academy, I made friends here.N Sikki Reddy, 24, part of Indias top mixed doubles team, is one of Sindhus closest friends. They have known each other for more than a decade and she also trains at the academy. Sikki had beaten Sindhu in the junior national final in 2009, before an injury forced her to become a doubles specialist. Sindhu and I played as a doubles team at quite a few tournaments when we were kids, Reddy revealed. Around six years ago, when we were staying at the academy, we had picked up this habit of watching horror films on a laptop. We used to get so scared that we joined beds to sleep. We maintained a balance between having fun and training.Times have changed since. Even though she is so close to me, we rarely get a chance to hang out these days, said Sindhu. When we travel to tournaments together, our schedules are different. So its just hi and bye sometimes. Their daily schedules intersect once a week when Sindhu visits the academy on Saturdays for a doubles session, which she says improves her defence. Otherwise, she trains at the newly constructed SAI-Gopichand Academy. Wednesdays and Saturdays are half days, while Sunday is a day off. But Sindhu made an exception this Saturday after missing a few sessions after the Glasgow silver.There were only two medal winners from India at last years Rio Olympics. Sindhu cliched silver, while wrestler Sakshi Malik grabbed bronze. The shuttler has continued her sublime form, whereas Malik has struggled. She has also become one of Indias biggest sporting icons resulting in multiple advertisement deals. So, does she ever get worked up with the packed schedule? I never compromise with my training and I never get bored of it.Though I enjoy doing ad shoots, I never let that affect the training, she says, minutes after completing her 30-minute stretching routine, obliging selfie-seekers and young fans.Working with coach Mulyo Handoyo has also reaped dividends. Asked about areas in her game and personal life she wishes to improve, she retorted, Game wise, there is always scope for improvement. You can never remain the same, that will make you predictable. On the personal front, I would like to control anger. I get really emotional at times.2012Sindhus family has done everything to ensure that she can focus on her training without hassles. In 2012, her family shifted close to the academy as she had to travel 25km one-way from their old house.Indulge after eventsSindhu likes junk food, but sticks to mostly rice with chicken or mutton. Breakfast includes milk and eggs. Chocolates and ice-creams are on only after tournaments. She had friends in school, but as training became the most important part of her life, friends have mostly been from the academy."

The Chief Secretary said the policy covers the modalities for installation of mobile towers, cell on wheel, micro cell, inbuilding solutions, optical fibre laying and setting up of end equipment.Special provisions have been made in this policy for KBK and LWE affected areas, Padhi said and added that the policy will help in establishment of modern telecommunication infrastructure to provide high speed internet in rural areas. Besides, it will improve terrestrial broadband connectivity in both urban and rural areas.The Chief Secretary said, there is a provision of dealing with public grievances relating to installation of towers and issues related to telecom infrastructure in the policy through district and state-level telecom committees.The Cabinet also approved food and procurement policy for 2017-18 Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) and fixed a tentative procurement target of 36 lakh tonne rice which comes to around 53 lakh tonne in terms of paddy. The Chief Secretary said the target is for entire Kharif and Rabi procurement. While kharif paddy will be procured from November, 2017 to April, 2018, Rabi paddy will be procured in May and June, 2018. In KMS 2015-16 and 2016-17, 50.87 lakh tonne and 54.27 lakh tonne paddy was procured respectively.The Chief Secretary said, paddy will be procured from farmers who are registered in the online portal of the Food Supply and Consumer Welfare department. Paddy will be procured as per the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Centre at ` 1550 per quintal for common variety and `1590 per quintal for Grade-A variety.Besides, the Cabinet decided to waive interest of `3.57 crore for delayed payment levied against Kerala Dinesh Beedi workers' Central Co-op Society, Kerala on purchase of kendu leaf. The case was pending since 1974."

For passersby, these stacks bring to the mind a warm feeling of hot steaming rice. However, for those who live near the mills the stacks are just unburnt husk and ash.In an effort to bring to an end the air pollution caused by the use of husk and firewood, the Indian Oil Corporation is now working with rice mill owners in the delta region to use LPG. Two mills in Sirkali area have already converted to the clean fuel and at least 50 more have evinced interest.Sources in IOCL said that the two mills converted to LPG-fired drying units after about six months of trial. We had to get the pressure and flow rate correct. The system resembles a reticulated gas system with 24 cylinders each weighing 47.5 kg and a regulator. If too much pressure is used the paddy will be burnt. Now with optimum heat being supplied, the rice does not break, explained an official.Benefits aplentyThere are a host of benefits in this conversion. We can sell the husk at Rs. 3 per kg instead of burning it. Also, LPG costs less than husk. Water used in the drying process can be saved too as every hour, some 500 litres is used to run the radiator. The electricity needed to run the dryer and manpower used to shovel in the husk are all saved, explained M. Aravind, whose family runs the Dhanalakshmi Modern Rice Mill in Thirukarukavur in Sirkali.M. Chitra of Thayagam Indane Gas Agency, Kuttalam in Mayiladuthurai, said that in both the mills, the owners were very receptive. However, they continue to use husk-based boilers which causes more expenses. The boiler has to be replaced. Also, in the 20-22 hours of daily operations, boiling is done only for three hours, she explained."

The arrested are Vishnu Reddy, Nagaraj, and Syed, all hailing from Udumalaipettai in Tirupur district of Tamil Nadu.According to the police, the accused got acquainted with the victim, Tomy, through one Saravanan, a vegetable dealer from Tamil Nadu. They lured Tomy into buying the rice puller, an alloy of copper and iridium, which is claimed to be used by foreign agencies including NASA in space satellites for generating energy.They managed to convince Tomy that the metal, also prized as a cure-all, would bring prosperity to his business and family and sold it to him at the Paravur market at Rs. 20 lakh, officials said. The accused have been booked under IPC Section 420 for cheating and were sent to judicial custody. The police are also investigating whether more people have been cheated."

Thilothaman said the prices of most items had settled down after a spurt in recent months.The government had taken steps to prevent prices from spiking during the Onam season. The Civil Supplies Corporation would organise 1,470 fair price Onam fairs across the State.This effort would be supplemented by a network of 3,500 markets to be set up by Consumerfed and more than 2,000 vegetable stalls to be opened by the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam and Horticorp.Price monitoring cellThe Minister said a price monitoring cell had been established to keep a close tab on the situation.The government machinery was fully equipped to ensure that consumers would not have to contend with skyrocketing prices this Onam.Earlier, moving notice for an adjournment motion on the issue, T.V. Ibrahim accused the State government of turning a blind eye to the spurt in the price of rice and other essential commodities and allowing hoarders and black marketeers to fleece consumers. He alleged that government fair price outlets were selling goods at prices higher than in the open market.Mr. Thilothaman said the price of rice now stood at Rs. 35 to Rs. 40 a kg. The government move to purchase the Jaya variety of rice directly from Andhra Pradesh (AP) without the involvement of middlemen had driven down prices in the open market.The AP factorThe Minister, however, said the pact with the AP government was yet to be finalised. There was some confusion following the revelation that farmers in AP had stopped growing Jaya rice long back, and replaced it with the Bondalu variety.The AP Civil Supplies Corporation asked for samples to compare with the rice grown there, The Minister said officials from AP were coming to Kerala to finalise the agreement for sale of rice.GST effectLeader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that prices of rice, oils, spices, pulses, and vegetables had gone through the roof in the absence of effective market intervention. The introduction of GST only worsened the situation, he said.The Opposition staged a walkout after Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan refused to permit the issue to be taken up for discussion."

S Stella, a teacher at the Anganwadi in Rathinapuri, gives us a glimpse into her world. An Anganwadi centre has a 10-20 children. Some have up to 40. The meal budget for a centre with 20 children would be Rs 22.60 on dhal days and Rs 27 on non-dhal days.How could we possibly buy vegetables or condiments to make the meal with? Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation is tasked with providing dhal, rice and oil for these centres. However, they were dependent on the fund allocated for buying vegetables, eggs and other condiments. The government allocates only Rs 400 for the purchase of LPG cylinders against the actual price of Rs 800, citing the subsidy provided by the Centre. The subsidy reaching the intended destination is quite debatable. Stella confirms that the Anganwadi bank accounts do not get any subsidy and it is they who have to shell out the money every time they book a cylinder.Yet, these centres function, thanks to its staff. On most days, it is the generosity of the workers that feeds its children. Their generosity too comes from empty pockets. R Saraswathy, who has been employed at a centre since 1984, draws a salary of just Rs 10,000. These workers have been fighting tooth and nail to get the budget to catch up with the current market.We are proud that the Anganwadi acts as the foundation for many children. Many who grew up under are care have gone on to do well for themselves, with some even securing government jobs. However, the government has been exploiting this system by its low allocation, exclaims Saraswathy When asked, ICDS Coimbatore district programme officer M Vasantha Devi promised to look into the matter to verify its authenticity."

Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday announced the sanction of a womens degree college at Araku, an eco-tourism project, at an estimated cost of Rs. 110 crore, at Araku with private participation and a double road with central lighting on the main road, among other things.Mr. Naidu participated in the International Day of the Worlds Indigenous People (Adivasi Day) celebrations along with Governor ESL Narasimhan at the NTR Grounds here.Describing Adivasis as gems of the soil, Mr. Naidu said they had proved that they were second to none. Tribal children from AP had scaled Mt. Everest, some of them put up a good show in international archery competitions and now many of the tribal youth were proving their talent in studies by joining the civil services. He said English medium was being introduced in Girijan schools.On the improvement of livelihood of the tribal people, he said coffee plantations along with the inter crops like pepper and silver oak could give high returns to the farmers. My objective is to ensure that five lakh acres in the Visakhapatnam Agency is brought under coffee cultivation. Already 1.5 lakh acres is under coffee cultivation.Mr. Naidu said the tribal areas were blessed with rich natural resources and clean environment and called upon the Adivasis to utilise locally available resources to multiply their income. Organic foods were in great demand and tribal farmers could use manure to grow vegetables, rice and other crops. The export potential of the popular Araku coffee should be tapped, he said.On the bauxite issue, the CM pointed out that recognising the sentiments of the Girijans, mining had been put on hold.Crafts bazaarMr. Narasimhan, during his address, suggested setting up of a permanent crafts bazaar at Araku to showcase the traditions and culture like clothing and jewellery to tourists. Similar bazaars should be opened in all major cities and towns of the country.Earlier, Araku MLA K.

5a0f2ee29855b76bf13d6ee9,Notes of a native son: Hansda S Shekhar,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/notes-of-a-native-son-hansda-s-shekhar/articleshow/60027329.cms,2017-08-12,"One of India's best young writers, and good friend of Goa, is fighting a cultural battle with significant implications for the rest of the country. On August 4, an irate crowd targeted the brilliant author Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar in his home city of Pakur, in Jharkhand. Accusing him of being ""the shaitan of Santhal society"", they burned an effigy of the doctor (he works at a government health centre) and winner of the prestigious Sahitya Akademi Yuva Puraskar Award. The purported offence is ""pornographic writing"" which ""showed serious lack of sensitivity towards the tribal people of India."" But what is really at stake is the question of who has the right to speak for or represent a culture.Shekhar is a startling and unique talent. There is literally no one else like him. Just 34 years old, he writes in an engaging style from and about a cultural universe otherwise entirely absent from Indian letters  the tribal firmament in rapidly changing, contemporary India. It's never fair to burden limitlessly talented young writers with comparisons, but here it is impossible to ignore deeply resonant similitude with the African-American pioneer James Baldwin. Notably, that correlation was first highlighted in Goa, when Shekhar launched his book of short stories, 'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' at the Goa Arts and Literature Festival 2015, at the hands of eminent Konkani writer, Damodar Mauzo.One of the best stories in that collection is being used to manufacture outrage against its author. 'November is the Month of Migrations' is stark and unforgettable, just three pages describing the season when ""Santhal men, women and children walk down from their villages in the hills"" to board trains to West Bengal, where ""they will plant rice and other crops in farms owned by the zamindars"".Trailing along is Talamai Kisku, 20, who is beckoned by a railway police jawan. ""Talamai debates if she should follow, and decides to. He is offering food, after all, and she is hungry."" When he asks, ""Will you do some work for me?"" Talamai knows what work he is talking about. He uses her, saying ""Saali, you Santhal women are made for this only."" But ""She just lies  passive, unthinking, unblinking  as cold as the paved ground...as still as an inert earthen bowl into which a dark cloud empties itself."" Finally, the jawan ""gives Talamai two pieces of cold bread pakora and a fifty-rupee note and walks away. She re-ties her saya and lungi, stuffs the note into her blouse, eats both the bread pakoras, and walks back to her group"".It is a masterly feat to condense and communicate such intense pathos and horror in a few unadorned lines. The scale of Shekhar's achievement is directly akin to all-time great Sadaat Hasan Manto, whose shorter-than-short stories remain the most searing evocations of Partition in 1947. 'November is the Month of Migrations' acutely recalls 'Khol Do (Open It)', where Manto writes about Sirajuddin, desperately searching for his abducted daughter, after a nightmare escape to Lahore. ""A succession of images raced through his mind. Attack... fire... escape... railway station...night...Sakina."" He finds her nigh-unconscious in a hospital. ""The doctor looked at the prostrate body and felt for the pulse. Then he said to the old man, ""Open It"" [meaning the nearby window]. The young woman on the stretcher moved slightly. Her hands groped for the cord which kept her salwar tied around her waist. With painful slowness, she unfastened it, pulled the garment down and opened her thighs.""Shekhar's critics aren't bothered about the obvious literary merit of his work. They are incensed about other things. The author told me via e-mail, ""This is tribal cultural politics. This is the politics of region, script, identity... a very layered and complicated issue. All I can say is those who hate my books without even reading them, will hate them no matter what."" But this turf battle is markedly like what plays out in other parts of India, including Goa. Some Santhals support the tribal-created Ol-Chiki script, and maintain Sarna (their animist faith). But converts to Christianity back the Roman script. Shekhar thoroughly confounds those stereotypes.But why shouldn't that be the case? Why should a few individuals determine what is suitably or insufficiently Santhal, or Goan, or Indian? In this regard, the recently departed poet and scholar Eunice de Souza complained, ""My blood boils when I hear an Indian talking about ""Indian culture"". This is a primitive impulse, finding something coherent and limited and saying, ""This is Indian culture"", and everybody else is excluded."" It should be noted she was a sincere admirer of 'The Adivasi will not Dance', calling it ""a fine book of stories."" This most discerning of critics wrote, ""I'm not interested in the ethnicity of writers, just whether they have something to say that deepens one's understanding of the world. Shekhar does just that...'The Adivasi Will Not Dance' is a remarkable achievement.""The writer is a photographer and a widely published columnist. Views are personal"

Or should the question be, can you? What would you even get for that money? Maybe one idly at Amma Canteen. Is that enough to feed a child for one day?Believe it or not, the per child feeding expense under the Noon Meal Programme (NMP) and Anganwadi centres as allocated by the Integrated Child Development Services Department is a measly Rs 1.13. In fact, the amount was much lower till as recent as 2014.Tamil Nadu was once the pioneer in the realm of welfare schemes for the States children. This was the State that introduced the revolutionary noon meal programme to encourage children to take up education and compensate the lack of resources caused by abject poverty at the same time.However, reforms and welfare became a thing of the distant past with the bureaucratic set up failing to build on the solid foundation presented to them. Soon, schemes and services  without adequate attention by means of money and manpower  were left to rot within the confines of government buildings. The once-revolutionary NMP and Anganwadi centres, which fall under the ambit of the Integrated Child Development Services Department, suffer a similar fate.Both programmes are plagued by several issues  inadequate staff, lack of funds, zero benefits for employees and more. However, over the years, they have failed to accomplish the very purpose they were designed to address. A meal budget of Rs 1.13 (the limit for dal days; non-dal days had a budget of Rs 1.35) is the reflection of that failure. This price raise  yes, you read right  came only in 2014 with the vareity meals scheme brought in by the late J Jayalalithaa. Until then (since its introduction by the late CM MGR in 1982), the budget had been limited to 56 paise.Why the low budgetTamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation is tasked with providing dal, rice and oil for anganwadis. The government allocates only C400 for the purchase of LPG cylinders against the actual price of C800, citing the subsidy provided by the Central government"
