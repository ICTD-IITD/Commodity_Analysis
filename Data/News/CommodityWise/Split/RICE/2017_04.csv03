Rajangam told reporters here on Thursday that the ruling BJP at the Centre and the Congress government in the union territory were competing to implement the anti-people policies. With the introduction of Goods and Services Tax, everyone had been affected. They are bringing in policies to destroy the public distribution system by cutting down subsidies. The Centre has cut down subsidies for cooking gas but has not taken any action to redress the grievances of farmers, he said.Mr. Rajangam alleged that in Puducherry, the government had forgotten its poll promises. They promised to provide free rice in ration shops but people are suffering without getting adequate essential food products. The water tax has increased and property tax has gone come up. Besides, several youths are without employment, he said.He alleged that the government had been favouring the private schools and colleges. To create awareness among people on these issues, we are organising a door-to-door campaign in 100 places in Puducherry and Karaikal, he said.CPI(M) Tamil Nadu State committee member V.

SAMRAJM_SAMRAJThe Civil Supplies Department is all set to issue green ration cards to eliminate higher income groups from the list of beneficiaries for free rice scheme.The department is awaiting a notification to kick-start the process to weed out Group A and B employees, income tax payers and certain category of traders who are in the GST regime.We have put up the file and are awaiting a notification to be issued, a source in the department told The Hindu .Data being collectedThe department has been collecting data from the Income Tax and Commercial Tax departments. Statistics related to a number of Group A and B employees are available with the government, a source in the government said.Preliminary assessment revealed that there would be around 70,000 income tax payers who are in possession of yellow ration cards and who are entitled to get free rice as per the existing policy.According to the new plan, the government will allow cardholders to voluntarily opt out of the free rice scheme.Simultaneously, the department will weed out higher income groups from the purview of getting free rice.Of the 3.35 lakh ration cardholders, 1.86 lakh are red ration cardholders. The government on an average per month incurred an expenditure for around Rs. 20 crore for free rice. The clamour for restricting freebies to poor families had been growing with even the ruling Congress, the AIADMK and the BJP openly expressing their support to the move.Except for the All India N.R. Congress, the principal Opposition party, there had been a near political unanimity on the need to restrict freebies to the poor families alone.Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi had expressed her reservations about distribution of free rice to all irrespective of their financial background.She had highlighted the need to limit freebies to poor so as to bring financial prudence.Sources in the government said the expenditure towards procuring rice under the scheme would come down by half once the new policy on free rice gets administrative approval."

Chandrababu Naidu an integral part of his speech for the third successive day on Saturday, Leader of the Opposition Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said during electioneering in the Nandyal constituency that he would not fear action.Addressing a gathering at Yalluru in Gospadu mandal on the fourth day of his show, Mr. Jagan called upon the people to question political leaders by holding them by their collar on their promises.Alleging that Mr. Naidu snatched away the mike from a farmer Mohan when he said loan waiver had not been implemented in toto, the YSR Congress president said no farmer had dared to raise chilli, Bengal gram or other crops as they lacked remunerative prices. The promise to set up a price stabilisation fund with Rs. 5,000 crore was ignored. If any farmer, DWCRA beneficiary or student questions Mr. Naidu, he will dub them Jagans followers and the police pick them up.Accusing the Chief Minister of duping students, Mr. Jagan said he promised a job in every family and to pay unemployment allowance. Mr. Naidu owed Rs. 76,000 to each unemployed, as 36 months had elapsed since he regained power. The fair price shops supplied nine commodities but were merely giving rice to ration card holders now. He accused the Telugu Desam Party of trying to lure voters by giving them Rs. 5,000 and make them pledge with a Gods portrait.Mr. Jagan said he was questioning Mr. Chandrababu Naidu on the mismatch in his words and deeds after his three-and-half-year rule. All the promises made by Mr. Naidu in his Independence Day address in Kurnool in 2014 remained unfulfilled, he said. Justice would prevail in the end, he said."

Additionally, they have also greatly lowered costs.Sex pheromone excreted by a female, attracts the male pests. We synthesise these pheromones in the lab and place them in traps in fields, said B.V. Subba Reddy, a scientist who is leading the effort at IICT.According to Dr. Reddy, the synthesised pheromones are loaded in small silicone capsules, about a centimetre long.Adult male insects, in their reproductive phase of their life cycle, detect the pheromone and enter the trap, expecting to find female mates.The insects are eventually killed after being trapped.Killing the adult male prevents proliferation of the pests. The eggs that surviving female pests lay in the absence of males are infertile. Eventually, the pest population dies, he added.Users of the technology say that pheromone traps help lower usage of chemical pesticides and reduce farming cost by more than 50%.The cost of conventional chemical pesticide for a crop like brinjal or chilly is Rs. 8,000 per acre per month. It costs less than Rs. 1000 to use pheromone traps, said Vinod Tandra, secretary of the Eklavaya Foundation, which is working with IICT to get farmers to adapt the technology.Besides the cost benefit, pheromone traps help lower load of hazardous chemicals on the crop, the ground water and eventually in the food cycle.IICT is helping farmers in Telangana and other States keep away the notorious Pink bollworm from cotton, the Yellow stem borer from rice and other borers that destroy vegetable crop. This year, the State Government wants the research institute to help cotton farmers in Adilabad, greatly troubled by the Pink bollworm.Further research is under way to make bio-degradable or environment-friendly material to load the synthesised pheromone, instead of silicone. Research efforts are also being made to develop pheromones that attract females, said B. Nagendra Babu, another IICT scientist.Farmers also express the need for pheromones to control female pests, as they lay several eggs.Their control can exponentially reduce pest population."

Sunil Kumar proposed the introduction of the scheme based on the A ctio Apportum (Avakasa Labham) concept that was first mooted in the State agricultural policy unveiled in 2015. The Minister told The Hindu that the scheme to be introduced this year envisaged the creation of a fund by levying an A ctio Opportum cess on farm produce at the point of sale.How it worksIt is estimated that over 40 lakh tonnes of rice is being sold in Kerala every year. If the government collects a cess of one rupee on each kg, it will generate an amount of Rs. 400 crore that can be routed to farmers as Avakasha Labham, their legal right of the profit share, says Chittur MLA K.Krishnankutty, who was the chairman of the committee that drafted the policy.A farmer giving three tonnes of rice to the State will be eligible for a payment of Rs. 15,000 as Avakasha Labham from the Department of Agriculture for one crop. The policy document notes that Palakkad matta rice is sold in upcountry metro markets at Rs. 65 to Rs. 70 per kg while the farmer producer in Kerala sells it at less than Rs. 23 per kg, with rapacious traders pocketing the profit. The marketing margin for milk and milk products ranges from 25 to 82% while that for vegetables varies from 14 to 82%.The Actio Apportum concept thus assures the producer farmer of the legal right to a share of the huge profit generated by traders, explains Mr. Krishnankutty. The assured income will encourage farmers to invest more in crop production. The policy had recommended the Actio Apportum system only for small and marginal farmers depending only on agriculture for their livelihood. The Minister said the modalities of the scheme would be decided after detailed discussions."

For, the area is known for its melt-as-you-bite-into it traditional sweet. The city's other areas that are thronging with Ganeshotsav festivity, also see a steady stream of customers for this steamed delight. But it's no longer found in just mawa and barfi variations. This time, how about tucking into healthy modaks with unique flavours, like some city-based sweetmakers are trying out...You might think the idea for a granola modak might take time to catch on. No, says Tanvi Kewal Chheda, who decided to make the novel recipe this year. ""This is a modak, but with a homemade granola addition, comprising rice bran, wheat bran, wheat or corn flakes and rolled oats, and raisins or cranberries for flavour,"" she says. And the modaks won't crumble away if that's what you're thinking  dates are the binding agent here. ""This is a good replacement for the usual mithai versions,"" she adds.Seeds have several health benefits and they've also popped into modaks this year. Bandra-based foodie Yajur Khanna makes about seven variations with pumpkin and chia seeds. ""I've also tried date-oat-coconut, lemon and saffron and kesar-pista  so they're interesting flavours with a healthy twist. She explains, ""No ghee, khoya or sugar is used in the preparation. For sweetness, we use dates, raisins and cranberry paste.""And are you a peanut butter fan? Your breakfast staple has also gone a la modak. In this, the sweet is made with a little low-fat homemade peanut butter and saffron milk as the binding agent. ""We started these different healthier versions this year as there is so much awareness about health issues and with so many Mumbaikars shifting to different diets there is a demand for these. Yes, the healthier modaks may cost a little more than the regular ones as dryfruits and other ingredients are used as the base here, but I have heard people say, 'It doesn't matter; health comes first. It's good to know people are willing to make a healthier switch,"" she adds.Folks seem to want to push the proverbial envelope and go ahead of the regular fare, which is what is prompting foodies to make zany flavours such as red velvet and strawberry. Chef Rakhee Vasawani tried a refreshing chocolate and paan modak and Kemps Corner-based confectionist Shradha Mehra Virani, has fused innovation into the sweet with flavours like sea salt-caramel and cupcake modaks, with themed toppings. Other quirky flavours include orange, blueberry, coffee and a 'kairi modak', too! ""A few years ago who would have thought of green mango modaks, but today people are more willing to accept other tastes when it comes to festive sweets. This one is more tangy, for instance,"" says Khushboo Soni from Andheri who started making these flavours from this year. If you want to spice things up, take your taste buds on a ride with a 'chilly modak'. Adds Khushboo, ""When you bite into this modak, it's sweet and then comes the piquant flavour.""Kings Circle resident Neetu Nandrajog has gone a step further to make cake modaks. She explains, ""These are cakes carved into modak shapes. You can do so many flavours apart from the normal chococlate cake, like rasmalai-cake modak. To make it, the cake is moisturised with milk used for rasmalai and has pieces of the cottage cheese in between the layers. You can also do a blackforest-rasgulla cake modak in the same way.""Fusion has found its way here as well. Foodie Richa Lulla is doing a fusion modak, with 'til gul-praline'. ""These are two popular flavours so I thought why not merge them and it's been a hit,"" she says.If you're having family and friends over at this auspicious time, serve them these dessert-style 'waffle modaks'. Here, mini-sized modaks are made and placed in the pockets of the waffle. Shaved coconut is added on top and it's drizzled with maple syrup or honey."

When he was returning to Bopal, three persons on a bike forced his car to stop near Gokul Rice Mill.""The accused took his car keys out took away a bag containing cash before fleeing. Thakor had filed a complaint for the robbery with Bavla police.

The group led them to the hidden cash and the motorcycle used in the crime.Investigators said Nikul works with a cosmetics agency and had seen Thakor deal in large amounts of cash. He prepared his friends for the robbery and they even reconnoitred the route, choosing the spot to strike as it was relatively desolate."

While Bengaluru has the highest count of millet consumers, as per industry estimates, Hyderabad is fast catching up, say observers. This, courtesy more dieticians and chefs promoting the nutritionally-superior millets.Also fuelling its demand is the Indian Institute of Millets Research 's (IIMR) partnership with a company to market millet-based products such as jowar idli, jowar pops, ragi dosa, foxtail flakes etc. Turns out there's another 35-40 companies that have come forward to forge similar tie-ups. ""Although we had conducted a lot of research on millets and developed a technology to add nutritional value to millets, we had to work on the demand too. We noticed that it was the inconvenience of using millets that was keeping modern women from using it in their daily cooking. We worked on processing technologies and with the help of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) we came up with a range of ready to eat products that have cut down the drudgery. For example for making a bajra roti, it's no longer required to mix it with hot water kneed endlessly,"" said B Dayakar Rao , principal scientist, IIMR. He suggested millets be introduced in mid-day meals as well.Dieticians and nutritionists too confirm the benefits of millets and say that clinical trials conducted on diabetics, hypertension and obesity patients have shown impressive results. ""Available in many varieties, millets help in controlling blood sugar levels considerably. Being glutton free millets are easily adopted by the body. Millets are also easy to digest and are good for people with gastritis and other digestive disorders,"" said Sneha Ghosh , nutritionist, Apollo Life Studio.While experts suggest replacing one meal (150-200 gram of cooked millets) with rice or wheat, it can also be included in meals progressively, they add.C J Jadav, director Innerbeing Wellness Pvt Ltd that has partnered with IIMR points to a paradigm shift in the choice of peoples' food. ""Since we launched millet based products in 2015, we have seen a 40-50 per cent growth in sales each year,"" said Jadav."

Bamboo, which is common in the Western Ghats, was in the news last year when it blossomed.Farmers in the area had last year predicted that bamboo would blossom in the drought and when rainfall was low. This came true, with rainfall in the past two years down by 50% of the average rain in the season. ""We've seen this phenomenon after almost 50 years. Our elders used to say that bamboo is the best indicator of climate change: If bamboo flowers tur n to fruit, locally called `bamboo rice', it will be a year of scarce water and low rainfall,"" said Ganapu Buddu, a tribal of Joida area.Tribals in the area said the bamboo flowering had worried them as it leads to variation in climatic temperature, less rainfall and a fall in agricultural produce. Mass flowering also attracts predators, mainly rodents. The sudden availability of fruit in huge quantities in the forest brings in millions of hungry rats who feed, grow and multiply at an alarming rate. After they devour the bamboo fruit, the rats start consuming crops -both stored as well as on fields. A bamboo flowering event is almost always followed by famine and disease in nearby villages, said Raju Gowda , an agriculturist.But this year, the bamboo plants turned yellow in April-May and slowly dried up. Most of the people acquainted with the forest say there is little revival of bamboo plants that have turned yellow. ""Bamboo is an important food for elephants in the Western Ghats and farmers are apprehensive of elephants intruding agricultural fields in search of food, if bamboo is not available,"" said Nagesh Kamat , an agriculturist. ""We are worried because during the monsoon, the cane is drying up while the rest of the forest has turned green. The forest department should study this phenomenon.""But deputy conservator of forests, Karwar, K Ganapati said it was a natural phenomenon. Bamboos have the life cycle of 65-80 years. They start blossoming and flowers produce fruit (bamboo rice) for 60-70 years. Following this, the bamboo forest dies out. Since a bamboo forest usually grows from a single bamboo, the death of bamboo occurs in a large area. The rice which falls on the earth results in growth of new bamboo trees, he added."

Segregation happens constantly through the day. The leftover food dumped in a bucket is collected by the piggery every morning. Barrels have been installed in the kitchen into which the workers dump leftover food. There are separate buckets for tea and coffee waste.Solid waste such as plastic bottles and cardboard items are given away to rag pickers,"" Prabhu says.Explaining his mantra of three R -reduce, reuse and recycle -Prabhu says keeping a logbook of the quantities of rice and vegetables going to waste every day helped him in optimum procurement of raw materials for the eatery.""We used to order a fixed quantity of goods every day regardless of how much was used. We reduced that after we realized how much was going to waste. Leftovers from our kitchen, that doesn't qualify as waste, are given to the poor and the needy,"" he says.The restaurant, which sees a footfall of about 1,000 people every day, avails no service from the municipal corporation to get rid of the huge amount of waste it generates. Prabhu says that arbitrary revisions in the rate, delay in collecting garbage and unreliability of their services motivated him to take charge of his own waste."

The kharif and rabi harvest has thus resulted in a total of 1,13,227 tonne of rice produced, this year. This is as opposed to 1,15,068 tonne of rice in 2015-16 and 1,20,505 tonne in 2014-15.""The major factor for the decline is seed replacement. Any seed variety has to be replaced every ten years or so. Proper management practice is also required. This includes a recommended quantity of seeds, appropriate spacing and application of an optimum dose of fertilizers and insect repellants,"" said K K Manohara, a scientist specialized in plant breeding at ICAR-CCARI.Manohara said that the existing varieties of rice in Goa  Jaya and Jyoti  are not high yielding. There are varieties like Goa Dhan 1 and Goa Dhan 2 which have been recognized by the ICAR as better yielding.Besides, the area of plantation is also decreasing every year, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said.""Farmers are using their land to grow cashews and vegetables as they are a more lucrative crop compared to rice. Additionally, agricultural land is being converted to developmental land to widen roads, thus reducing production area,"" Kakode said.The area for rice cultivation has reduced from 41,970 hectares in 2014-15 to 41,344 hectares in 2015-16. The area further reduced to a total of 40,823 hectares in 2016-17.In addition to these reasons, experts also pointed out that the crop is ""labour intensive"". The operation of transplanting, plucking, etc, is spread over several days. This is followed by weeding out unwanted growth and other nitty-gritties. The process of harvesting and winnowing also requires a significant amount of manual labour, which is usually a problem in Goa. Erratic weather conditions and stray animals feeding on crop are also a major factor to the decrease in production."

And while it is true that his festival, Ganesh Chaturthi, evolved as a metaphor for the abundance reaped from the land during the monsoon, today it is also a joyous occasion for families to bond over food and sweets.In talking about the culinary spread associated with the Chaturthi , two sweets - the modak and nevri - merit special mention. For one, they are traditionally not prepared during any other Hindu festival, and two, they have their unique mythological links. Of course, to say that nevreo are not prepared on other occasions is no longer completely true, for with improved economics people, nowadays, mark other festivals with nevreo, too.Modaks and nevreo are principally stuffed sweets and share common fillings, covers and methods of cooking, differing only in their shapes.The modak can be defined as a round dumpling with a tapered top, or, as writer and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik writes in his book '99 Thoughts on Ganesha', ""It looks like a bag of money, similar to one carried by Kuber, treasurer of the gods."" Pattanaik adds that the sweet filling is to remind man that wealth has to bring happiness.Noted Goan folk researcher Jayanti Naik , points to the similarity in shape between the modak and a tufted coconut, which is a ritualistic male symbol.The reason why the modak is prepared only during Chaturthi is well-known. It is a great favourite of the elephant-headed god and it is compulsory to offer him as many as 21.While the nevri has a simple, half-moon shape, why it is synonymous with the festival is open to discussion.Naik alludes to the semi-circular shape of the sweet as being representative of the 'garbh' or womb, a subtle reference to the undertones of fertility rituals associated with the festival. ""Therefore, no matter how many nevreo you make at Chaturthi, you have to make at least one modak,"" she adds.Folklore researcher Pandurang Phaldesai says, ""Sweet preparations symbolise all that is good and prosperous, and what better way to celebrate than by fashioning sweets out of the indigenous ecological produce of the land?"" Which in this case comprises rice, wheat, coconut, jaggery, and a variety of grains.But, whether it is the nevri or the modak, the fillings reflect an amazing variety. To begin with, the ingredients used to make the shell will determine if the sweet will be steamed or fried. Rice makes for the former variety, while wheat is used for the latter. In an interesting twist, sometimes the covering is made from sweet potato.Coming to the ingredients, Prabha Pradeep Rege of Ponda , who prepares nevreos and modaks on pre-order basis for festivals, says, ""There is the principle base, sweetener and fillers that enhance taste. The favourite sweetener is jaggery, though sugar may also be used. The choice for the base can range from coconut (fresh and dry) to flour of various grams, and from evaporated milk solids (khava) to wheat flour. There is even a spicy variety, but it is not offered to god.""So if someone offers you a 'chunnache' nevri or modak you should know the stuffing comprises coconut and jaggery. 'Punnache' indicates a filling of the flour of chana dal or moong, while 'tikhatache' refers to a spicy stuffing.Which variety a family will offer to Ganesha will differ according to economic status and personal choices. The number of nevreo offered, too, is subjective. The only constant is 21 modaks."

This is the famed Onasadya , he told his friends. Except, all this happened in February, a good seven months before the festival and the venue, a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram that serves sadya all the year around at an affordable price.With more such establishments popping up and the plantain leaf sadya now becoming the norm, is the Onasadya becoming another trope to keep the tradition alive?Culinary expert Pazhiyadom Mohanan Namboothiri concurs, saying, ""Onasadya has surely lost its appeal, with people now considering any meal that has payasam as a wholesome sadya."" The 61-year-old master chef recalls how Onam used to be a big celebration as it followed the quiet month of Karkidakam. ""So, Onam witnessed a surge of energy and it kept people on their toes. Everyone in the family used to be involved in the making of the sadya as it used to be a one-off, grand affair,"" he says, adding that with Onasadya available through caterers and hotels, Thiruvonam has now become a day of relaxation for many.Historian Malayinkeezhu Gopalakrishnan says that in the past, the preparations for Onasadya used to start at least 10 days in advance. ""Back then, we had pradhaman only during Onam and that made it so much special and delicious, of course,"" he says. To make the ada or rice batter for the ada pradhaman, they had to pound the rice, paste it onto a leaf and then roast it before cutting it to pieces. ""The whole process was sacred in a way as we raised sheets to cover the dried ada so that no impurities fell into it. We even sourced the jaggery from farmers and plucked and dried cashew nuts at home. And then we used to anxiously wait for two days, sometimes even without sleep for the Onasadya,"" he recalls.It's a stark contrast to the current scenario, the 68-year-old says. ""In my younger days, we could see these many dishes spread on a banana leaf only during Onam or weddings. Now, every other hotel serves at least 10 dishes on a normal day. Even for payasam, ready mix ada is available, which doesn't offer the same relishing taste as those prepared in a traditional way at our homes in the past,"" he opines. ""Now, you have sadya every day.""While Onasadya may be losing its appeal in Kerala, it still caters to the nostalgia for Malayalis abroad. Advaith's father Sabu Chandran, who has been working in Abu Dhabi for the past 30 years, says, ""In the 90s, expatriates used to yearn to return to Kerala during Onam  just so we could have the joy of eating Onasadya together with our families. But since the turn of the millennium, those of us in the Gulf celebrate it with all its vigour. We now want to stay back or return from Kerala soon so we could be part of the celebrations in the Gulf.""Sabu also says that the Onasadya has helped mend the eating habits among NRI children. ""A lot of kids like Advaith, who grew up in the Gulf, don't have a particular liking for anything vegetarian. But serve them the Onasadya on the banana leaf and they would wipe it clean. That's the respect for the Onam tradition that we have created among the children because of the parents' nostalgia,"" he says."

""Waiting for the part-time cook to arrive and then supervise the cooking is something I don't have time for in the mornings. So, getting a tiffin delivered to us is a more convenient option,"" she says.""Preparing meals also involves shopping for groceries and vegetables, again, for which I have no time,"" she says. The couple catches a bite at the hospital during lunch time and settles for a meal delivered by a tiffin service for dinner.They are not the only ones opting for such meal choices in the medico fraternity. Many busy doctors prefer the sheer convenience of a tiffin service over running a kitchen at home. ""My wife and I are both gynaecologists at Indira IVF and keep extremely busy hours. So, we get our lunch delivered by a tiffin service and cook dinner ourselves,"" says Dr Amol Naik. ""We never know at what time we will have our lunch, so it is convenient if the tiffin arrives on time and is kept there so that we can eat whenever we are free,"" he adds.Tight schedules, time constraints and lack of domestic support are all reasons for which many professionals are now opting for tiffin services. ""Among the 90 customers that we have, a bulk are medicos and bankers,"" says Yogendra Singh Sanger, who runs Tiffin Break, a meal delivery facility at Trimurti Nagar. ""A rising number of working couples like bankers and medicos, those who have to be at their workplace by 9am, are the ones who opt for the service,"" Sanger says.For a monthly charge that varies from Rs1,200 to Rs2,200, the tiffin comes packed with four chapatis, dal, a seasonal vegetable, rice and salad in a quantity sufficient for one person. ""The meals are simple and cooked with less oil and spices as per tastes,"" says Suwarna Jugade, who runs Akshay Tiffins in Abhyankar Nagar.Jugade's clientele comprises mostly senior citizens. ""These days there are many elderly couples who do not cook at all. Most of them order tiffin for lunch as they eat a very light meal in the evening,"" says Jugade, who charges Rs1800 for a tiffin delivered once a day. ""This price is fixed even if rates of vegetables and dal soar.

At times, we also give our preferences for certain vegetables,"" adds his wife Kuntal, who enjoys being free from working in the kitchen.Tiffin services abound in the western part of the city with a bulk of them being around Dharampeth right up to Hingna. ""That's because the students prefer to live here as colleges are close by and this is a very vibrant area,"" says Sachin Pande, an engineer who has started Addu Tiffin service on West High Court Road.""My finding is that students and professionals from upper middle class backgrounds are now coming into the city for studies or jobs. They have discerning tastes and most are foodies. They even give me suggestions on what my menu formation should be and how I can innovate with the recipe,"" says Pande, who enjoys this interaction with his young customers.For those living alone in the city, the tiffin and its provider become a major focal point. ""When living away from home, what we eat is a big concern for our families too,"" says LIC employee Sukhwant Singh and adds, ""So, if one is lucky enough to find a good tiffin service, then living alone becomes easier."" Singh says he collects his tiffin as it gives him an opportunity to chat with people.Supplying tiffin is a business easy to start and sustain for those who wish to earn their bread through it. It's a one-man army at Rohit Mess Service in Jaripatka where Rajani Waghmare, a former nurse, runs this business for 16 fixed customers. ""I also supply meals for patients and their relatives at Rs60 for a single meal of four chapatis, rice, dal and vegetable,"" says Waghmare who quit her job 17 years back from Janata Hospital as prolonged duty hours were keeping her away from home and her small kids.""I finish preparing the lunch by 9am and then go and deliver it to my customers most of whom are senior citizens,"" says Waghmare. The dinner time tiffin is delivered by 7.30pm again by Waghmare herself who has learnt to drive a two-wheeler to deliver her service. The vehicle has been her only other investment in the business besides her culinary skills.Besides supplying meals there is also a service of simply delivering a dabba which has gained ground in the city as it expands and people move to peripheral areas. ""This concept of dabbawallah in Nagpur has emerged from the Jaripatka area where maximum Sindhis, who are essentially traders, reside. Most have their shops in wholesale market around Golibar chowk,"" says Ramesh Hemnani, who delivers tiffins in the Gandhibagh area.There are more than 200 such delivery men who are carrying tiffins to various parts of the city. They reside in Mecosabagh, Chhapru Nagar, Pardi, Shanti Nagar and Telephone Exchange, areas which have a higher concentration of Sindhi population. The delivery timings stretch up to 3.30pm. ""We deliver to businessmen who begin their day late and lunch times are stretched beyond 2.30pm,"" says Raja Panjwani who delivers tiffins in Itwari."

Kannan, who penned Annas biography Anna: the Life and Times , said here on Friday.As part of the Madras Week Lectures organised by Roja Muthiah Research Library, he spoke on the topic Leader Anna.Mr. Kannan spoke of how simple and humane Annadurai was.Here was a man who was able to move from a humble background, study with the help of a backward class scholarship in Pachaiyappas College and go on to become the Chief Minister, he said.Mr. Kannan compared him with other world leaders such as Abraham Lincoln, Vladimir Lenin and Jawaharlal Nehru; he was a combination of them in many respects.Phenomenal speakerHe was a phenomenal speaker and writer, Mr. Kannan said.When he started his journal Dravida Naadu , it sold 6,000-8,000 copies, at a time when there was no social media or connectivity.He shared a great bond with Periyar for nearly 14 years; he felt Periyars speech was quite raw and would go back after meetings and reflect on what he had spoken.Later, in his journal, he would sugarcoat [and write] what Periyar said, he added.He was a man who thought DMK came to power too soonR.

Ambathkumar and M. Packiaraj.Despite the variety faced the danger of attracting the dreaded disease, most of the farmers in Thiruvadanai, RS Mangalam and part of Nainarkoil cultivated the variety as it commanded good demand in the market and fetched higher price.The department stopped distributing BPT 5204 seeds and cut the subsidy but farmers get them from private dealers, they said.The farmers, instead, could go for CO 51, a short duration drought resistant variety developed at the paddy breeding centre in Coimbatore last year and introduced in the district as breeder seeds to benefit the farmers, the officials said.Farmers could also go for TKM 13, Anna (R) 4 and NLR 34449 varieties.The department has adequate stock of CO 51 and NLR 34449 varieties and they were distributed to the farmers at subsidised rates, they said.Farmers raised paddy in about 1.70 lakh hectares in the district, mostly through direct sowing, ahead of the north east monsoon.The district had suffered 100% crop loss last year following monsoon failure."

In celebrating Him, the Hindus of the state touch base with an ancient fecundity ritual, one that sees them venerate Lord Ganesha with the very produce of nature that He blessed them with. Food, thus, is one of the hallmarks of Ganesh Chaturthi, and is replete with associated fertility symbolisms.In the prelude to the festival, Lord Ganesha's parentsLord Shiva and Goddess Parvatiare worshipped a day before. Folklore paints a picture of Parvati pregnant with Lord Ganesha, yet another allusion to fertility. ""In Goa, the day is referred to as tay and involves womenfolk observing a fast. In Hindu priest and other such households, the hartalika puja is perfomed,"" noted Goan folklorist Jayanti Naik, says.Intriguing food symbolisms are seen right from this day. To begin with, the fasting diet includes only fruits and milk. Naik says the women eat nothing that is cultivated with a plough. ""This is the tradition pan-India,"" she adds, while explaining that the plough is perceived to be a symbol of masculinity.Lord Ganesha is born on the following day, called chavat, marking the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi. ""The birth of the benevolent god marks the most important day of the celebrations,"" says artist and culture enthusiast Naguesh Sardesai. And, understandably, food is cooked in plenty.Goddess Parvati or Gauri, who symbolises the Mother Goddess, is given a special nourishing diet to satisfy her 'duvalle' or cravings. It comprises varan, a preparation from at least five leafy vegetables, and moni patolleo. While patolleo are elongated rice dumplings of sorts with a sweet filling, those offered to Gauri have no filling and are therefore called moni.""The food offered to Parvati is bland,"" says Naguesh, adding that salt is added only to the food offered to Lord Mahadev and Lord Ganesha.The rest of the cuisine covers a plethora of Ganesha's favourites, including moongache gathi, khatkhate, ambadayache uddad methi, etc. ""Sweet dishes comprise stuffed patolleo, modakswhich may be fashioned from stuffings of chunna (coconut and jaggery) or punna (chana dal and jaggery)and neureos,"" says publisher and food writer Sapna Sardesai. A payasam is also prepared. ""To the payasam, five grains of tender rice grains taken from new sheaves, are added,"" Sardesai explains.""The tender grains are significant of the new harvest,"" says Naik, adding that this offering of the first sheaves is a thanksgiving for God's bounty. Explaining the fertility symbolism behind the neureos, Naik says, ""Neureos form the female symbol, which is why no matter how many are prepared, it is compulsory to prepare at least one modakthe male symbol.""The following day, pancham, which concludes one-and-a-half days of festivities and sees a majority of Goan Hindu households immersing their respective idols, has a greater variety of preparations in addition to those prepared on the main day. Only the leafy vegetable preparation is excluded.""In addition to gravy prepations like moongache gathi (prepared from sprouted moong) and ros, dry vegetarian dishes are also cooked on this day. For instance, bhendyachi bhaji is made from the local, seven-ridged ladyfingers and ghosalyachi bhaji is made from ridge gourd. A green chilli or bitter gourd raita is also prepared. Deep-fried potato kaapa and ambadayache uddad methi, a tangy gravy made from hogplums, more or less completes the spread,"" says Sardesai.Both Naik and Sardesai make special mention of heet a local version of idlis made in a casing of jackfruit leaves. ""While it is common belief that idlis are a south Indian preparation, Goa has always had its version of it,"" Naik says. Traditionally, heet is dipped in coconut milk sweetened with jaggery before it is consumed.In the evening, after the concluding puja, or uttar puja, is held, two large laddoos of lhayo (puffed rice) are made with jaggery, roasted chana dal, cashew nuts and coconut. One laddoo is offered to Lord Ganesha as a send-off food, and the other to the person who takes the idol for immersion. The puffed rice is, once again, a symbol of prosperity.Thus, the entire celebration, right from the decoration to the food, pays glowing tribute to Nature's abundance and diversity."

By the time R Goundar , a mason, arrives on Tuesday morning, the canteen has run out of idlis. It's less than an hour since the canteen opened. Goundar and many others like him are missing out on the benefits of affordable food promised by chief minister Siddaramaiah . A week after they opened in 101 wards, Indira Canteens continue to be dogged by a number of logistical glitches -late delivery , changed menu, and shortage of food compounded by the well-to-do dropping in for the ""food experience"".Goundar finally has his breakfast at an expensive roadside stall. ""My son told me the quality of food at the Indira Canteen was good and it was cheap too. I'm struggling to make ends meet and need to eat in these canteens,"" he said.While some of the canteens have come up at places which are not really teeming with the poor, there is also a delay in food reaching the eateries, and running out in no time. A long wait in a queue to pick up tokens and another endless wait for the food to arrive makes it difficult for labourers to spare that much time. A quick survey of Indira Canteens by TOI found that there are many who are left disappointed as the canteens invariably run out of food.The Indira Canteen at Maruti Seva Nagar is out of stockOff Berlie Street in Shantinagar, autorickshaw driver Afzal Khan was turned away when he reached the canteen at 2.15pm. ""I eat when I stop between trips. It may not always be possible to reach a canteen when they start serving meals. The food is good but those who come late miss out,"" he told TOI.Lunch ran out within an hour of service, leaving many disappointed, though they had come during the mandated lunch hours.Then, there is a different clientele. Ajay N, a finance employee with a company, who stopped by for a meal at the Hebbal outlet said, ""I carry lunch from home every day, I wanted to see how the canteen system works. I don't mind eating here occasionally.""Ranjini M, who came with her mother-in-law to the Kodigehalli canteen on Monday for dinner, parked her car by the roadside. After collecting the coupons, the duo headed to a fast food stall nearby to have masala puri. ""I've tasted the food at a couple of other canteens. The taste and quantity are great. This is just an experience,"" she said.Lunchtime at the Indira Canteen in Hoysala Nagar, east Bengaluru, starts only by about 1pm, while BBMP has mandated that lunch be served from 12:30pm.Locals say it's been opening late for every meal since August 16. When TOI visited the canteen at 12.45pm, the doors were shut and a few workers were napping inside.For Papamma, 54, a vegetable vendor, the canteen is a boon but only if she arrives on time.""Normally , I spend Rs 3040 per meal, but now I spend only Rs 10. But the queues get long. I have to keep track of time and reach before the canteen shuts,"" she says.There are only six centralized canteens and 17 more are under construction. This is primarily the reason for shortage of food in the 101 canteens, say BBMP officials.Though the BBMP has fixed the menu, catering companies seem to be dishing up what they wish.In Shantinagar, for example, instead of rice and sambar for lunch, citizens were served pulao. ""I came here expecting some hot rice and sambar. Not that the pulao is bad, but we were expecting something different. We heard the menu was fixed,"" said Bharat N, a Swiggy employee.The canteen supervisor said they were not focused on the dishes, as they were more preoccupied with providing food on time. In Byatarayanapura too, pulao, curd rice and chutney were served instead of rice and sambar.Here, you can evade the coupon system. The staff was ready to serve meals without giving coupons, and said money can be paid at the place where food is delivered. ""This is clearly a violation, as the coupon system keeps a tab on the number of meals served in each canteen and accordingly, measures can be taken to supply additional stock or reduce it if required,"" said a BBMP official who promised to initiate action.Mayor G Padmavathi admits that on an average, 250 people per meal are served in each canteen.""There is a shortage of food supply primarily because only three centralized kitchens are working.Another 13 will be completed in about a fortnight. By September 1, we will be able to feed 500 people per meal in each of the 101 canteens,"" she told TOI.She put the demand in each canteen at 800 per meal, but the logistics of sending the required amount of food to each canteen is still not worked out.Padmavathi has been inspecting an average of 1015 Indira Canteens a day to see whether the management, quality of food and hygiene is being maintained. On Monday, she suspended Nagesh, a health inspector who shut down the Subramanyapura ward canteen even when there was enough food left.""I am inspecting 10-15 canteens a day and updating the chief minister. He is very happy with the way the scheme is working. By October, we will be able to set up all 27 kitchens, one in each assembly constituency.Then we can feed a minimum of 3lakh citizens,"" she said."

Beautiful flower arrangements, traditional dances, delicious lunch spreads and captivating boat races mark the festival in Kerala, where it is observed over a period of 10 days.Malayalis in Pune, who have not been able to visit Kerala for Onam this year, will be coming together as a community to celebrate the most auspicious day of the festival, Thiruvonam, on Monday.Though the festival has its roots in Hindu mythology, it is celebrated by Malayalis of all religions and communities. More than a religious festival, it is observed as a syncretic, cultural and social practice.P Velayudhan, the editor of Vakdevatha, a magazine for Malayalis in Maharashtra, sheds more light on the practices and festivities.""On the day of Onam, we wake up early in the morning. After taking a bath, we put on new clothes, like the kasavu and mundu, which are the traditional dresses of people from Kerala. Then family members make the pookalam (floral arrangement on the floor). Finally, we head to the temple, or any place of worship, and pray that the year goes well for us,"" explained Velayudhan.Special attention is given to the scrumptious Onam sadhya (feast), family gatherings and onakkodi (buying and wearing new clothes on Thiruvonam).""The day is primarily about the pookalam, family, and sadhya. Some people also visit the local Malayali Samaj gatherings for lunch. Shopping for new clothes is also an integral part of Onam celebrations,"" said Vibha Nair, a Pune-based member of the Malayali community.The sadhya is almost always an elaborate affair, with as many as 26 vegetarian dishes traditionally served as part of it... all on banana leaves. The spread includes avial, kootu curry, payasam, along with other rice and vegetable dishes. Wrapping up the feast are sweets. Family members usually start preparing the sadhya after a visit to the temple. Cultural events are planned towards the evening.Velayudhan's magazine Vakdevatha had conducted a cultural and charity event on Saturday evening at a Nigdi temple complex. At the event, orphaned children, belonging to a Dapodi-based charity, received onakkodi. The event also felicitated students who did well in the Board examinations this year. Traditional Kerala dance forms, music and a mono-act competition were also part of the evening.""Moreover, we had invited Shihabuddin Poythumkadavu, a Sahitya Akademi-winning poet and public speaker, for a lecture. The lecture was to help the younger members of the community understand the significance of Onam, and how it is celebrated. The second and third generation of Malayalis in Pune should also know about their culture,"" Velayudhan said."
5a0f85dc9855b76bf13d8ef6,Safeguarding the interests of farmers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/safeguarding-the-interests-of-farmers/article19531243.ece,2017-08-21,"The PDS in Tamil Nadu is intact and continues to retain the feature of universal coverage even after implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013.A PDS outlet in Coimbatore.M. PeriasamyTransformational changes are taking place in India currently, improving the way we live. These changes are impacting all our lives in small or significant ways. It is gratifying to know that the citizens at large are happy with these changes. However, for some who have fed themselves on the fodder that such changes are not for the near future, there is consternation. Even worse, these people find it difficult to comprehend that technology and policy are working together to remove discretion and opaqueness.The ongoing discourse, particularly in Tamil Nadu, on the Public Distribution System (PDS), the procurement of grains/pulses from farmers, public storage in Food Corporation of India godowns, commitments made in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Direct Benefit Transfer, etc. is interesting. However, there are strands in this discourse which are impressionistic and not based on data. They create a populist narrative and distract from the core issues. It is necessary, therefore, to infuse facts into the discourse.Facts in Tamil NaduThe PDS in Tamil Nadu is intact and continues to retain the feature of universal coverage even after implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013 (NFSA). Although the guidelines under the NFSA prescribe identification of priority households, there is no denial of any benefit under the PDS. There is no reduction even in the total coverage from the earlier Targeted Public Distribution System, which was effective till Tamil Nadu joined the NFSA in November 2016. The average annual offtake or the annual allocation has remained 36.78 lakh tonnes. The major part of the subsidy for the distribution of foodgrains (90.81% for rice and 91.70% for wheat) is borne by the Government of India.The implication of this subsidy allocation to Tamil Nadu alone on the Government of India is approximately Rs. 843 crore per month and approximately Rs. 10,120 crore per year. Since the central issue price under the NFSA is much lower compared to the erstwhile Targeted Public Distribution System, the burden on the State government has come down. On implementing the NFSA, the savings for the State exchequer on account of this subsidy, thanks to the lower central issue price, is approximately Rs. 436.44 crore per year.Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan on August 1 stated in a series of tweets the data for Tamil Nadu and also highlighted the fact that Tamil Nadu gets the highest allocation in the country as tide over allocation of 12.52 lakh metric tonnes of foodgrains. The narrative in Tamil Nadu cannot be devoid of these facts.Ensuring trade transparencyAnother disturbing strand in this narrative in Tamil Nadu is that the Indian government has callously sold away the interests of our farmers at the WTO by agreeing to the Trade Facilitation Agreement. Nothing can be further from the truth than this!The Trade Facilitation Agreement was agreed on in 2013 in Bali and came into force from February 2017 after two-thirds of the WTOs 164 members ratified it. Several trade-related issues such as transparency, predictability and efficiency at the ports, faster clearance procedures, and improved appeal rights for traders are to be addressed by countries. They shall notify various provisions to bring in the facilitation, over three years or more. Only the basic set of provisions will be implemented within one year. The Trade Facilitation Agreement allows for consultations before any new trade rules are notified. A WTO study indicated that when the Trade Facilitation Agreement is fully implemented, trade costs for member countries will decrease by an average of 14.3%. It is also estimated that the time taken to export and import will come down drastically. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has made budgetary allocations for bringing in single-window clearance and improving customs clearance at the ports. A high-level committee chaired by the Cabinet Secretary will monitor logistics and efficiency at ports and related issues.Thus, it can be seen that the Trade Facilitation Agreement is not about market access but inter alia about facilitating and bringing trade transparency. By ratifying the Trade Facilitation Agreement, India has not forgotten the developmental agenda lying unfulfilled at the WTO.Protecting the farmerThe Public Stock Holding issue remains unresolved at the WTO. Although agreed on in Bali in 2013 and reiterated in Nairobi in 2015, that a permanent solution for Public Stock Holding be found by 2017, it is still a work-in-progress. The existing WTO rules would have allowed a legal challenge to our Public Stock Holding and minimum support price-based procurement programme in case we breached the limit on procurement. The limit is defined as 10% of the value of production of the particular grain being procured.WTO rules classify procurement and holding of public stocks for food security purposes as Green Box or non trade-distorting. However, if foodgrains for the public stocks are procured through an administered price/minimum support price and if this minimum support price is higher than the archaic fixed reference price (calculated on base period 1986-88), then it is considered as trade-distorting agriculture support. Such trade-distorting support should be within the limit, which is 10% of the value of production of the particular grain being procured.One of the first things that this government did in 2014 was to intensely engage with the WTO to obtain a peace clause so that even if we did breach the limit, no one shall challenge our programme till such a time a permanent solution is found, agreed on, and adopted by the WTO membership. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on this matter, personally engaged with global leaders, and by November 2014 we obtained an open-ended peace clause from the General Council of the WTO, which was later reaffirmed at the Nairobi Ministerial. So Prime Minister Modi has safeguarded the interests of the farmer and ensured that Indias sovereign right to protect them is not diluted.Providing food to the poor or targeted groups at subsidised prices is fully WTO-compatible. This does not figure at all in the WTO calculations. We have not undertaken any commitment in the WTO for any kind of limit on the food supplied under the NFSA .An informed discourse based on facts is welcome and I believe such a discourse shall strengthen public policy.Nirmala Sitharaman is Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Commerce and Industry, Government of India"

""Though there have been improvisations but many don't know how to serve it properly.

""You start eating with ghee and parippu.Sambar is not exactly a Kerala curry , so people serve pullissery in some places. After eating all curries, comes the rasam. For completing the sadya, you have to take a small helping of rice and eat with buttermilk to finish the course. It will lighten the stomach and ease the diges tion,"" Namboothiri said.Dr Sharmadkhan, general secretary , Kerala state government ayurveda doctors association. said a healthy way of eating sadya would be to eat less rice. ""But people eat lot of rice along with all the curries.Pickles are a no-no. Ideally, they should be eaten sparsely ,"" he said.

Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

The Project was successfully experimented in four districts between 2008 and 2015Annamalai University director (research and development) R M Kathiresan will supervise the implementation of the project in association with Commercial Agriculture A, a non-government organization in Nepal, from 2017 to 2019. Annamalai University registrar K Arumugam formally launched the project in a simple function on Friday.Kathiresan said the project involves rearing fish (Katla, Common corp, Mrigal and Rahu) in a 1m trench surrounding the farm measuring not more than an acre and 20 poultry cages (with 20 broiler hens in each cage) erected four feet above the paddy crops.""The fish feeds on the insects and worms in water that affect crops, while poultry droppings are rich manure for the crops. We have experimented the project involving more than 1,200 farmers in Cuddalore, Villupuram, Nagapattinam and Tiruvannamalai districts and found that the income of farmers went up three-fold by adopting integrated farming and rearing techniques,"" said Kathiresan.He said farmers, who used to earn between Rs20,000 and Rs25,000 by cultivating paddy in one acre in a season have reaped a profit of more than Rs60,000 per acre by integrating cultivation of paddy with rearing fish and poultry.Kathiresan said the university undertook the research with the help of assistance from World Bank (Rs9 crore) and biotechnology research assistance council  Birac (Rs70 lakh) and other funding agencies and partners including The Bill and Melinda Gates' Foundation, Dhan Foundations and Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs).""We worked on different and diversified farming and rearing techniques. We experimented integrating farming and rearing of fish, broiler chicken, Japanese quail, duck and rabbits and finally found that rice-fish-broiler chicken yielded the maximum profits,"" said Kathiresan. ""Poultry droppings are rich in nitrogen content (1.25%) when compared to cattle droppings (0.5%). The manure is so rich in minerals that chemical fertilizers will not be required (barring initial stages of the project),"" he said.There are more than 100 countries in the world cultivating rice and more than 200 million families involved in cultivation of rice. ""More than 70% of rice growing families own land less than one acre. Small land holders land are the predominant growers of rice. This integrated farming and rearing technique is most suited at farms less than an acre,"" said Kathiresan.A delegation of scientists from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) nations will soon visit India to study the project implemented by the Annamalai University and replicate it in their respective nations."

Yet, for the last three years it experienced huge water scarcity with many rivers becoming parched during summer.Major rivers like Bharatapuzha, Periyar, Pamba, Chalakkudi and Achankovil have been exploited for sand and its tributaries are clogged with residential and industrial waste.The state government is yet to envision a comprehensive river revival plan to address the situation that may create another drought like situation this summer.Take Pamba River for instance. The river is the primary water source for districts of Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha and irrigates Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala. The river is clogged with waste generated during the Sabarimala season and by municipalities along the banks.The decade-old action plan to shore up the polluted river is stagnating as many of the major projects that were conceptualized under Pamba Action Plan (PAP) are yet to see the light of the day. Though a sewage treatment plant was inaugurated at the Sannidhanam to reduce the problem of solid waste being dumped into the river, none of the civic bodies along Pamba have solid waste treatment plants.Sand mining is one major issue that has destroyed rivers of Kerala.""A comprehensive river and sand audit should be conducted to assess the extensive damage caused to the rivers.The local bodies should identify this inter-linkages and initiate measures to protect these green zones,'' said Harish V of One earth, One life."

And during the five days of Puja, eating at home is a big no-no for most Kolkatans. No wonder, most city restaurants come up with Puja special menus, while others experiment with their regular offerings to woo customers during the festival. For some foodies, happiness is gorging on the traditional Bengali cuisine, while for others, Puja is the time to explore tastes. So, while you chalk out your pandal-hopping itinerary, it's time you also make plans of dropping into restaurants offering your favourite dishes with a quirky twist. Not only do the dishes have a hint of Bangaliana in them, but will also leave you with an ethereal aftertaste, making the festivities a yummy experience. Like the idea?A true-blue Bengali surely knows his fish. From pabda to parshe, from hilsa to katla, there's hardly anyone who can beat the Bangali babu when it comes to choosing the freshest of fish at a Sunday morning market. But while the maachh has remained constant, the jhol has seen transformation of tastes over the years. The plain simple fish curry, made mostly with paanch foron, now sees the inclusion of exotic items like lotus stems and elephant apple, among other things. The latest experiment with the Bengali fish curry is the addition of kamala or oranges, apart from other Indian spices, thereby giving an all new twist to the dish. Here's presenting you the kamala katla jhol. The dish draws inspiration from Pratim D Gupta's film, Maacher Jhol, and is available at 6 Ballygunge Place. Paoli, the leading lady of the film, joined us at the restaurant to experience the delicacy, which is surely going to be the must-have item for every Bengali this Puja.Maachher jhol and Bengalis are inseparable. A fish loving Bengali cannot even imagine a day without his bowl of maachher jhol and bhaat. And giving a quirky twist to the staple Bengali fish curry is the kamala katla jhol. Inspired by the recently released film Maacher Jhol, the dish, as the name suggests, has orange juice as one of the main ingredients. It not only lends a sweet and tangy taste to the dish, but also gives a strong aroma of orange. The chefs of 6 Ballygunge Place indulged in extensive brainstorming and research before coming up with the correct concoction of spices. Garnished with curry leaves and pieces of fresh oranges, the gravy of the dish will leave your tastebuds asking for more. A plate of steaming-hot basmati rice goes perfectly with this item.Biryani has been winning the hearts of Bengalis for ages now. And no celebration is complete without a steaming hot plateful. The aromatic spiced rice  a staple from the kitchen of the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah  came to the City of Joy in 1856. Over the years, the delectable Mughlai dish has been savoured in different forms  with aloo or without, sprinkled, at times, with golden fried onions, or shredded meat instead of a large chunk. A hot favourite for the Kolkatans this Puja would be Oudh 1590's raan biryani, in which hand-pulled tender shredded meat is generously sprinkled over flavoured rice and the combination is cooked in dum pukht style. The biryani comes without the round golden brown aloo, but the ample amount of meat makes up for its absence. And to give a hint of Bangaliana, the dish is topped with a generous dollop of khanti ghee!Murgir jhol or Bengali-style chicken curry has always been a delicacy, be it during the festive season or on a mundane weekday. The Chatgaiya murgir jhol is inspired by the culinary traditions of Chittagong in Bangladesh and is a typical home-style chicken curry. This dish will be enjoyed by lovers of spicy food, especially since it's simply made using coriander paste and green chilli paste. A plateful of hot ghee bhat is the best accompaniment with this dish.If you gather a bunch of argumentative Kolkatans and ask them about which place serves the best fish fry in town, you can expect the followingmonologue: ""I love Mitra Cafe, but Apanjan's fish fry is fluffy and has a thick slab of bekti fillet...."" But this common Bengali snack has experienced an innovative twist over the years and is available in different shapes, sizes and fillings, apart from the bekti fillet. The Tikki of Joy (name inspired from the City of Joy) is the Kolkata style fish fry, but here the fish is lightly poached as opposed to boiling it, and the coating is made with Japanese Panko style breadcrumbs and then deep fried. It is served with kasundi that's absolutely fresh and zingy.What saves you when you're dead hungry after hours of pandal hopping and want something filling to satiate your tummy? A pizza. And when this Italian staple dish comes with a quirky Bengali twist, your pet pujo is taken care of during the festive season. And when the Bengali's favourite daab chingri comes as a pizza topping, then happiness really knows no bounds. Slow cooked prawns with tender coconut, ground mustard, chilli and fennel are sprinkled generously on the pizza. If you're curious about the mention of Iti aunty, then the chef of Monkey Bar, told us that he once had a delectable daab chingri delicacy prepared by a woman named Iti. He loved the dish so much that he decided to make a pizza inspired by it, using it as a topping, and thus coined this special name.The Bong 's favourite hansher dim diye gorom bhaat gets a modern twist through this dish. The duck eggs are cleverly incorporated by adding diced runny half-boiled duck eggs and the yolk to a mixture of cream, butter and macaroni pasta before it is gratinated with sharp cheddar cheese.Bongs drool over crabs. Fondly called 'Dasarath' in Bengali households, the crabs are mixed with zesty seasonings in this dish, making it a must try this Puja. The well-cooked crab meat are topped with buttered breadcrumbs and served with boiled veggies. Sounds yummy, doesn't it? Trust us, it really is!Khubani is apricots in Hindi. Unlike the regular malai koftas, which are round, these are in the shape of kodma  a type of sweet used in several Pujas in the city. Apart from apricots, the stuffing of the kofta consists of mashed potato, cashew nuts, paneer, chopped garlic and green chillies. The koftas, after being fried separately, is dipped in sweet and spicy makhani gravy. The dish also has a dash of kasoori methi, which gives it a nice aroma.It's not often that we find chirey or flattened rice, a common food item in Bengali households, being used in an exotic dish. In this delicacy, the flattened rice is used in an innovative way along with paneer, green peas, palak, potato, kishmish, khoya and cashew nut. The chirey is used as the crumb in preparing the kebabs and since it also has a cheese filling, as you take each bite, the liquid cheese melts in your mouth! The dish is served with mint chutney. With acrispy outer coating and a soft stuffing inside, the kebabs make for the best accompaniment with beverages.Molecular gastronomy takes over the Bengali rannaghar as the age-old tradition of rubbing fish with spices and mustard oil before deep frying is retained here while preparing this delicacy. The bekti fillets are dry rubbed in a marinade of cream cheese and tangy sweet homemade aam kasundi and then, instead of deep frying, they are vacuum-sealed and poached in a sous vide machine at a controlled temperature, retaining the natural juiciness and flavours of the fish and extracting all the notes and textures of aam kasundi, which would otherwise be lost in deep frying. Sous vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours) at an accurately regulated temperature. The dish is served with a creme. Chantilly of whipped cream and Malibu rum.Happiness knows no bound when the kosha mangsho aka spicy Bengali mutton curry  a Sunday staple in the Bong household  finds a place on a pizza topping. Especially during Duga Puja, when you crave to have a traditional Bengali dish, yet look for a quirky twist, Hoppipola's kosha mangsho pizza should be the top choice. Chunks of spicy mutton pieces are placed on a layer of cheese in this thin crust pizza. It's crispy, cheesy, zesty and definitely oh so yummy."

Those who follow the Cauvery in Tamil Nadu , how ever, will be disappointed, as the lifeline of agriculture on some 88,000 sqkm across Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh Tamil Nadu and Puducherry , is dry hundreds of kilometres before it meets the Bay of Bengal. And the sea, as if in search of the river, is making incursions inland--with disastrous results.Seawater incursion-up to 20km upstream in parts of the Cauvery delta which includes Thanjavur, the rice bowl of TN -is ruining soil fertility in Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts of the state. S Janakarajan of Madras Institute of Development Studies says groundwater in Nagapattinam, at the tail-end of the Cauvery, is 100% saline and up to 60% in Tiruvarur.""The incursion has been rapid in the past few years. It has also affected the soil in Nagapattinam.If water doesn't flow in In partnership with our rivers, our food security will be threatened,"" he says.This salinity has rendered 2.32 lakh hectares of farmland in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Thanjavur districts unsuitable for cultivation, says S Dhanapalan, president of the Cauvery Delta Farmers' Association. "" About 57% of this is completely affected by salinity and cultivation in the rest is dependent on rain,"" he added.In such a situation, many growers have re verted to traditional va rieties of paddy that can be cultivated in saline water, says `Nel' R Jayar aman (Nel means paddy).""About 37,000 farmers across the state grow these varieties. Of them, about 5,000 are from coastal villages in Cuddalore, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur,"" he said.While farmers get about 2,100 kg of paddy worth Rs 24,000 per acre by cultivating hybrid seeds, traditional varieties yield 33% less, but fetch up to Rs 30,000 per acre in the market. With robust traditional varieties, farmers can afford to spend less on fertilizers, pesticides and weeding.Besides, seawater incursion into Kollidam river, a branch of Cauvery, has also contaminated groundwater. As many as 150 villages, including Chidambaram and Bhuvanagiri, along the coastal belt are struggling for drinking water, says P Vinayagamoorthi, president of Kollidam, Keelanai Farmers' Association . The situation improves a bit occasionally, when Kollidam is in spate, he added. Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had in August 2014 announced construction of a barrage across Kollidam to stop seawater incursion. Unless the project is implemented, people will continue to suffer, Vinayagamoorthi said adding that the government should also put an end to excessive extraction of groundwater wherever it is potable.Besides sea incursion, excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers in the catchment areas is also affecting the tail-end regions of the river. ""Much of the fertilizers and pesticides used in the coffee estates of Kodagu Hills and Hassan district in Karnataka end up as deposits in the tail-end of the Cauvery and its branches,"" says S Dhanapalan.Unless a series of measures are taken like building check dams and barrages and renovating drainage channels, farmers will have to permanently give up agriculture, he added.Spiritual leader Sadhguru has said revival of rivers should be the government's priority as a long-term policy. Speaking at a public event in Trichy during his pan-India Rally for Rivers, he recalled how he used to swim in the Cauvery in Karnataka as a teenager. ""But now there is only shallow water,"" he said. On Friday, Sadhguru addressed an event in Mysuru, from where his rally left for Bengaluru."

Since the supply of each item in the breakfast, lunch or dinner menu is limited, canteen operators are in a quandary whether to hand out a second serving.A 10-rupee meal comes with 300gm rice, 150gm sambar and 100gm curd rice, taking the total food weight to 550gm. Ope rators are not ready to increase the quantity of sambar as it bleeds them. Now, the BBMP is contemplating a 50gm cutback on rice. Visitors are happy about the quantity of rice served at the canteen, but they say sambar is just not enough. When they come back for an extra serving of sambar, canteen staff say `no' because they have been instructed not to breach the quantity set for each item on the plate. This has often triggered off clashes between customers and canteen operators,"" a source in the BBMP said.BBMP chief engineer (road infrastructure) BS Prahallad, who is the main coordinator for canteens, told TOI: ""Canteen operators are not ready to increase the sambar quantity per plate as it costs them more."" So the BBMP's solution is: Reduce rice quantity to 250gm per plate and increase sambar to 150gm. With this formula, the BBMP need not pay caterers more, he added.Each canteen is expected to cater to 300 customers a session. The CM had recently asked the BBMP to increase it to 500 a session."

We are doing everything we can to retain customers. We have been offering only South Indian food, but now plan to serve noodles, fried rice and other Chinese items, she said.Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association president Chandrashekhar Hebbar said it is natural for darshinis to tweak their business model for their survival, as they are already incurring losses after the introduction of GST as more people are opting for street food.He, however, has not come across reports of businesses in darshinis dipping after the launch of Indira canteens."

As a result, the vast cultivation area of the premium Sona Masuri rice brand here has remained unsown.The water crisis, affecting around 20 lakh farmers and labourers in the command area, is likely to trigger a migration. There are also fears it could lead to a serious shortage of this high-quality rice in the market.Consumers in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of the country, as well as those in Singapore, Dubai and Sri Lanka, are likely to be hit as the rice variety grown in the Tungabhadra belt is of high quality and is sought after.At present, the reservoir has 57 tmcft of water, against its capacity of 133 tmcft. This includes 32 tmcft of slit accumulated over the past 50 years. Considering the evaporation losses, drinking water requirements, and the share of undivided Andhra Pradesh, hardly 35 tmcft of water will be left in the reservoir for the States irrigation. Given the poor inflow, the reservoir cannot meet the demand of 80 tmcft for taking up paddy cultivation on around 6 lakh acres spread over three districts  Ballari, Koppal and Raichur.Water releaseAccording to sources in the Department of Water Resources, water will be released into the canals in the first week of September for farmers to cultivate rabi crops such as chickpea, green gram, sunflower and sorghum, which require relatively less water. The Tungabhadra Irrigation Consultative Committee (TICC) is scheduled to meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday to finalise the schedule and amount of water to be released from the reservoir.In 2016-17, which witnessed the lowest inflow, water was provided with difficulty for kharif crops. Paddy growers then managed to scrape through before the closure of canals, but cotton and chilli growers suffered Going by that experience and the reduced inflow to the dam in August, farmers are not taking any risks. Meanwhile, the TICC has been very cautious in releasing water into the canals as top priority is being given to overcoming the looming drinking water crisis.Furthermore, farmers who have grown paddy plants for the purpose of selling them to other farmers for transplantation are feeling the heat as their saplings are growing old in nursery beds with no buyers."
5a10b4ab9855b76bf13d9c5f,Search for democracy,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/search-for-democracy/article19572519.ece,2017-08-28,"A lasting return to democratic order remains a long-standing concern in Thailand, but seems some distance away in this founder member state of ASEAN. The latest twist to the ongoing political turmoil is the failure on Friday of the former Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, deposed in 2014 by a constitutional court, to appear for the final verdict in a case relating to a rice subsidy scheme. Her absence has fuelled speculation that she may have fled the country, much like her sibling and erstwhile head of government Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in 2006 in a military coup and has been living in exile since. The Shinawatras largely symbolise the simmering opposition to the entrenched influence of the military and urban elites in a nation where the contemporary record is a continuous cycle of coups and military-inspired Constitutions. The late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died last year, was an ardent champion of rural development, but not enamoured of democratic freedoms. His successor, Maha Vajiralongkorn, earlier this year endorsed the latest charter, the 20th in over 80 years, but only after wresting powers from the junta.The Constitution has little to commend itself in terms of either enshrining democratic principles or popular legitimacy. It provides for a nominated upper house, a non-elected Prime Minister, and greater powers for the Generals. A 2016 referendum drew a mere 61% approval even from the small 55% voter turnout. More ominously, the plebiscite exposed long-festering ethnic divisions between the Malay Muslim-concentrated provinces in the south who rejected the Constitution and the remaining majority Buddhist regions. Given the systematic suppression of dissent and the introduction of draconian legislation, human rights activists have all too often fallen foul of the Generals. Any hopes for a stable democratic government in Thailand will hinge on the conduct of free and fair general elections promised for 2018.Whereas a conviction would have made a political martyr of Ms. Shinawatra in the run-up to the polls, her sudden flight from the country has taken the winds out of the oppositions sails. But embarrassingly, the government of Prime Minister General Prayuth Chan-ocha was obliged to offer farmers loans owing to record-low global prices for rice. The move was not much unlike the subsidy scheme that Ms. Shinawatra was sought to be proceeded against.Meanwhile, the Generals have their own reputation at stake concerning the award of building contracts to their close associates. There is perhaps merit in the assessment that the once-thriving Thai economy could be losing out to competition from ASEAN neighbours who have emerged from conflict and dictatorship of the recent past. Finally, the countrys leaders should also be concerned that deficits in democratic governance may not always go unnoticed, notwithstanding the ASEAN principle of mutual non-interference in the internal affairs of member nations. There was a welcome deviation from this norm when Myanmar had to forgo the ASEAN annual chair. The precedent would be instructive across the region."

Citing the rulings of the SC over the plea for releasing all convicts serving life imprisonment after death sentence was commuted, Thirunavukkarasar said the State should not have released Perarivalan as the matter was still pending before the court.He noted that the scar inflicted on the people following the brutal assassination of the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had not healed even now. Releasing convicts on ordinary leave will set a wrong precedent, he said.Referring to the issue over the Speaker slapping notices to 19 dissenting MLAs of AIADMK, Thirunavukkarasar, who had served as Deputy Speaker felt that whip would be applicable only to the proceedings within the House and not outside.Action could not be initiated against DMK members for bringing banned tobacco products to show that such products were allowed to be sold after receiving bribe, he said, recalling how K A Mathialagan, one of the founding leaders of the DMK, had brought idlis to register protest against price rice in the past.

Whenever I need directions, I stop by a rickshaw. And I get perfect directions to my destination from one of the thousands of hard working men who have left their villages to make Delhi their home.That is why, when I was on my way to Lajpat Nagar in search of a chholey bhaturey wallah that I had not visited ever, I didnt worry. I took the Metro from Rajendra Prasad Road to Lajpat Nagar, and once I walked out of the station at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station, I jumped on to a waiting rickshaw.I am looking for some special chholey bhaturey, I said to him. Oh, Anandji, he replied, and took me right there.Its nice to know that there are still some chholey bhaturey in Delhi that I have not tried out.Seeing is believingI had been hearing about Anandji for a while, but, as it happens sometimes, I had never gone there. Last week, I thought I couldnt call myself a chhole bhatura expert if there was a much talked of place that I had not been to. So, as I said, I took the Metro.This is a 22-year-old shop in Lajpat Nagar 1. The address is Shop No 3, Krishna Market (Tel nos 011-29817406 and 41326226; owner Bittus number: 9811301302). I was quite impressed by the place  it was spic and span, and had high tables for those who wanted to stand there and have a quick meal. I was there pretty early in the day, so it was not crowded either. There were a few people there, and I was happy to see that they were all eating chholey bhaturey.I asked for four plates  each for Rs 70. The bhatureys were not enormous, as some bhatureys are. This I thought was the right size  neither too large, nor too small. The chholey was superb  and what I really enjoyed was that it wasnt dripping oil, or overwhelmed with spices. It was almost like the good chholey that you get at home, with the perfect balance of spices. There was a nice juicy piece of potato in the chholey, which came with chutney, some pickle and onion rings.The service is smooth, too. I went in, placed my order, paid up, went to the counter where I presented my receipt, and within fifteen minutes, I was out of the place, where my friendly neighbour GPS-wallah was waiting.There are quite a few other items on the menu, too  chholey poori, rajma rice, kadi rice and dal makhni rice, all for Rs. 70 a plate. There is a thali (Rs. 100) and a special thali (Rs. 130). From 4 pm to 8 pm you get aloo samosa, paneer pakora, jalebi and break pakora. They also sell a dal samosa, which I must try out one day.Anandji is also known for its lassi  sweet and salted (Rs. 60/Rs. 40). I had heard about their creamy lassi, too, but I had to hurry back with my lunch. And the food packet in my hand smelled so good that I was dying to dig my teeth into it.I wouldnt like to do a listicle on chholey bhaturey shops  those hard-to-escape lists of the ten or five top chholey bhaturey outlets in town that you see on the Net. My favourites, of course, are those places that have made us happy for years with their fare  Nagpal on the other side of the road, Chacha in Kamla Nagar, Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar and Nand in Sadar Bazaar, to name a few. And I must say Bhatia in IP Extension isnt bad either.But Anandji is somewhere right there, too. I had his chholey bhaturey for lunch and thought this was a place I could go back to. Not just for the dal samosa and the lassi, but for an encore."

As Cambodias roads improved, locals started moving away from using the bamboo carts  known in Khmer as norries  to transport goods.Tourists filled the demand gap, with savvy operators in Battambang charging backpackers to hitch a ride on a unique piece of Cambodian railway culture. On a recent Sunday the dusty site was billowing with foreign and local tourists, eager to pile on for the windy trip through rice fields and over small creeks.Eye on tracksBut Chan Samleng, director of the Railroad Department, said the Bamboo Train operators will soon need to clear the area so that builders can start restoring the line for a train service.They have no right to run on the railroad anymore, he said of the drivers. They can look for other jobs. While Cambodia remains one of Asias poorest nations, it is also one of the continents fastest growing. In recent years the government has turned its attention to its railways.In April 2016, the line from Phnom Penh to Sihanoukville was reopened to passenger trains, displacing dozens of bamboo trolley operators. Previous deadlines to close down Battambangs Bamboo Train operators have passed without consequence in a country where projects are routinely hampered by delays. But Soy Savuth and the other drivers are worried that the latest threat is real."

Chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi met on Saturday authorities of the energy and irrigation departments and directed them to ensure optimum power supply and to arrange for the necessary level of water to flow into paddy fields.The chief minister was informed that Agra, Hathras, Amethi, Ghaziabad and Bulandshar districts received highly deficient rains, less than 15% , while in the entire Bundelkhand region comprising Jhansi, Lalitpur and 16 other districts, rains were below 40%. 20 other districts of the region have also received deficient rains. In 48 districts comprising more than 50% of the state's geographical area, rain was deficient this year and if the dry and humid spell continues for the remaining days of September, there may be a crisis for farmers, as majority of them are depending on rains for their paddy crop.During the review meeting, the chief minister was presented a report by the irrigation department on its efforts to bolster flow of water into the agriculture fields, particularly for paddy and other crops of the Kharif season. State energy minister Shrikant Sharma said rise in demand for electricity all over the state was primarily because of deficient rains.Principal secretary irrigation Suresh Chandra told TOI he had issued necessary directions for optimum supply of water to canals for irrigation and he added that he had asked electricity department officials to ensure regular and adequate power supply to run tube wells. Agriculture director Soraj Singh said amid deficient rains in Bundelkhand, seeds and other aids to farmers are being supplied for the Rabi season.Paddy is sown in 59 lakh hectares agriculture land. Last year, rice production was 143 lakh metric tonnes as rains were normal but this time, with below average rain, not only paddy, most Rabi crops, mainly wheat will suffer because of lack of the requisite moisture level."

I rushed out. When I turned around, the building came crashing down. My two brothers and three other colleagues died, Mohammed Sartaj said. Numb with grief, he continued standing near the massive pile of rubble, hoping to recover his monthly salary of Rs. 14,000 from the ruins.Locals rush to helpPakmodia Street residents poured out on the streets within seconds of the tragedy, rushing to help anyone who could be rescued. Eateries came together and cooked dal and rice in large quantities, and a makeshift kitchen was set up across the lane from the site of the collapse by afternoon. Residents moved from person to person, be it firemen, policemen, NDRF personnel or locals helping with the rescue operation, informing them that hot food was available. Local social and political workers were roped in, and carton after carton of bottled water was rushed to the site. Bheed mat karo, jinka kaam hai unko kaam karne do (Dont gather, let the people work), local resident Mohammed Ilias, 60, called out with a handheld public address system, while others helped him disperse crowds of onlookers who were getting too close to the site. Young boys kept fetching water for the elderly volunteer, who refused to take a break till evening.Around 3 p.m., Aftab Ali, another local resident, arrived at the site looking for blood donors for the victims admitted to JJ Hospital. Mr. Ilias immediately began calling for volunteers on the PA system, and Mr. Ali directed donors to the hospital. As the azaan for the third namaaz sounded, Mr. Ilias asked people to head to the local mosque and pray for the souls of the departed and speedy recovery of the injured."

The South Indians gathered patiently inside, all hankering for a taste of home, took a deep appreciative breath. Practically every table ordered the same item off the menu: biryani chunky with tender mutton and stocky seeraga samba rice.Judging by social media reviews of the 400 people who ate on the first day, most were delighted about the launch of this American outpost offering typical Southern Tamil Nadu biryani. Or namma ooru biryani as one commentator put it on the restaurants Facebook page.From a tiny eight-seater restaurant in Dindigul in 1957 to a high-powered chain of 42 restaurants serving about 2.5 lakh customers across the world everyday, Dindigul Thalappakatti has come a long way. Back in Chennai, owner D Nagasamy settles down to chat about his rapidly expanding empire at his Anna Salai restaurant (one of 24 he has in Chennai) over a bowl of fragrant biryani teamed with cups of sweet, milky chai.We are still using my grandmothers recipe, nothing has been changed... Well, except the method of cooking. Because we now make 1,500 kilos of biryani a day in the central kitchen in Chennai alone. And 2,000 kilos on weekends. However, we still use the same spices: cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, all hand-ground on stones with a little water to maximise flavour.Rice and spiceThe biryani is now made in a largely automated central kitchen. For every kilogram of rice, we use 10 grams of the spice blend. The spices are put along with onions, garlic and water into a machine to be made into a masala. It takes three hours for each cycle. At full capacity, the machine can yield 450 litres of the biryani masala. Mutton and rice are added after this.Nagasamy pauses for a few seconds to do the math. That much masala makes 7,000 biryanis. Which means they still have plenty of bandwidth for expansion in Chennai.Determined to standardise flavour despite the burgeoning number of restaurants, the team is particular about ingredients and technique. The meat comes from Kannivadi, from tender grass-fed goats. (Kannivadi is a small town in Dindigul district.) The rice is a type of short grain seeraga samba , called parakkum sittu , from Tiruchi and Thuraiyur. Cinnamon comes from Theni. Combined, they create a unique style of biryani, popular in Southern Tamil Nadu. Which is why, for the past 10 years, most of their expansion has been in the State. If you serve basmati biryani in Tiruchi, people wont accept it. They want seeraga samba , Nagasamy says.Turban talesBusiness was given an unexpected fillip by a rash of pretenders who used the chains trademark name, and now-iconic logo of a turban, to advertise. When my grandfather opened his restaurant in 1957 serving my grandmothers biryani, his customers began to call it thalapaketti because he wore a turban, so that became our logo, says Nagasamy, discussing how he advertised his first restaurant in Chennai (Anna Nagar) in 2008.A number of other establishments then sprung up, following the same theme. At one point, there were 70 restaurants using some version of thalapaketti in their name.Nagasamy finally went to court against Chennai-based Rawther Thalappakattu Biryani. Both sides defended their right to use the name and turban in a long-drawn legal battle from 2008 to 2013. Finally, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board ruled in favour of Dindiguls Thalappakatti, stating that Rawthers version  Thalappakattu  did not have a significant phonetic difference. Nagasamy says the episode turned out to be an advantage. By 2013, everyone had heard about us.Leading the way into the kitchen, past sacks of charcoal, bubbling kadais and vats of payasam topped with puddles of golden ghee, Nagasamy carefully lifts a cloth-covered lid on a large pot of biryani, which has just arrived from the central kitchen.Chamber of flavoursThe room is enveloped in a steamy fog of cardamon, cinnamon and ghee. He uses an oversized spoon to gently stir the meaty rice. This rice is easily digestible. It absorbs flavours so its very tasty. And we traditionally make the biryani with boneless mutton as its easy to cook and eat.Last year, he opened restaurants in Dubai, Malaysia and Paris. A lot of our customers in France come from Puducherry and Dindigul. We use the local meat in our international restaurants, but follow our traditional recipe.He adds, We still have expansion plans in Tamil Nadu. Salem and Erode are next on the list. By the end of the year, we plan to open 10 more restaurants. Including one in Abu Dhabi, which should be ready to launch in three months.Although he works with partners for the international launches (We invest 51% in each one), he keeps the Indian business small and fairly intimate. We have 2,000 employees, and many of them have worked for us for decades. Till now, I have taken no franchises. Its fully owned by me. So its my baby, he says, adding with a grin, So if anything goes wrong, Im the one who feels the pain.Whats so special about Dindigul biryani?According to legend, the water from Kamarajar Lake in Athoor enhances the flavours of the biryani made in Dindigul.Traditionally, it is prepared with a superiorseeraga sambarice, known asparakkum sittu.The meat comes from top-class breeds of cattle found in the famous cattle-markets of Kannivadi and Paramathi.By another nameTahari is a vegetarian version of biryani, prepared by adding potatoes to rice. In Kashmir, it is sold as street food and the dish became popular during World War II, when meat was a rarity."

The district, located between Warangal and Khammam districts, is predominantly agriculture-based with a few quarries. The district has 30 rice mills and four cold storages and has 15 active granite quarries. The Kesamudram market is known for Turmeric while the one at Danthalapalli is known for mango and lime. Speaking to The Hindu , district Joint Collector K. Damodar Reddy said the district administration was planning to set up an industrial zone where they would promote setting up of granite polishing units in big way. Similarly, they propose to encourage more agri-based industries.Horticulture nurseryThe administration has decided to set up 50 acre horticulture nursery to supply quality plants to promote horticulture in a big way in the district. The district, formed 10 months ago as part of reorganization of districts, has a population of nearly eight lakh of which 90% is in rural area. Except for the district headquarters town, all the mandal headquarters are still evolving into towns. The district headquarters has rail and road connectivity but still lacks in basic amenities. The district had many tile kilns which now disappeared with changing pattern of housing even in rural areas. Now there are brick kilns which do not employ big numbers or generate turnout worth mentioning. They cater to the housing needs of the town and surrounding mandals.Other optionsThere is not much scope for industries here. Hence we are looking at other options, Mr. Damodar Reddy explained. However, the district headquarters is likely to witness growth by way of shops, and hotels."

It has also been reported that some crops intended for the Onam market took more time to mature. Cowpea in some areas were yet to be harvested though they were meant for Onam sales, the sources added.The major sales outlets opened by Palliakkal Cooperative Bank were at Rajendra Maidan. The sources said that around 40 acres had been brought under vegetable cultivation before Onam and around 100 farmers in Kottuvally and Ezhikkara panchayats were involved in vegetable cultivation. Bank president M.O. Vijayan had said that around 2,500 self-help groups of farmers had been formed through the intervention of the bank in the area.The sources said that the bank, which encouraged and provided facilities for vegetable cultivation, received only Rs. 5 per kg of vegetables sold. The rest of the price at which the vegetables were sold went to the farmers. The rise in the price of some vegetables ahead of Onam helped the farmers earn good remuneration this season.The increase in local production of vegetables also helped keep the prices in check during the Onam season, said sources, though they pointed out that a shortage in production due to climatic conditions had seen prices of some of the vegetables going up considerably two days before Onam. The price of cowpea went up to Rs. 130 a kg while that of the nendran banana and bitter gourd went up to Rs. 75 a kg in the retail market.Meanwhile, the Cooperative Bank is preparing to engage in large-scale rice cultivation in pokkali fields within the banks operating area. The sources said that around 200 acres under pokkali rice was near ready for harvest by the month of October."

With the highest acreage in Kerala, coconut assumes significance as the base crop for integrated farming, says Jacob John, Professor and Head, Integrated Farming Systems Research Station (IFSRS), KAU. The other components in the coconut-based system are inter-cropping of spices such as ginger and turmeric, tubers such as cassava, fruit crops such as papaya and bread fruit, vegetables such as cowpea, ash gourd and amaranthus, and fodder crops, besides dairy farming and azolla units.The genetically improved (not modified) Tilapia was found to be suitable for the model because of its fast growth and weight up to 700 gm. Fetching Rs. 300 a kg, it is more remunerative for farmers, says Mr. John.Compared to other freshwater species such as Rohu, Catla and Pearl Spot, it has more amount of flesh.The fingerlings at the working model at the research station were procured from the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture, Vijayawada. The channels between the bunds in the coconut grove were protected by nets to thwart birds and reptiles. Two ponds within the 50 cent property were utilised to grow azolla, a water fern to feed the fish.After the fish is harvested, the nutrient rich silt from the channels is used as manure for coconut palms, along with leaf toppings and cow dung generated in the model. This reduces the reliance on chemical fertilizers, says Mr. John. The coconut-based model has been profitably maintained on the Nedumcad campus of the IFSRS here for the last three years. We could realise an average yield of 50 kg fish from one cent area. This works out to an income of Rs. 75,000 from just five cents, Mr.John says.The IFSRS has developed three other models of integrated farming systems, two with rice and banana as the base crop and the third for homestead farming.The Department of Agriculture has earmarked Rs. 700 crore to popularise integrated farming systems this year."

Each of them spend Rs. 30 to buy a kg of jasmine in the morning and sprinkle water over it to keep it fresh. The scent occasionally wards off the stench from the nearby Kiruthumal river but there is no job satisfaction.For one kg of flower strings, I get Rs. 60. This is only enough to buy some rice for the house, says M. Jyothi, weaving a colourful basket to break the monotony. The women in all seven blocks yearn to contribute monetarily to the household but are unable to find lucrative options in the area.Formerly known as Thideer Nagar, Ward 78 received its unique title after a large number of people, who were displaced from their homes in todays Periyar Bus Stand, settled here.Now, there are about 3,000 houses in the area. My house was near the newly constructed flyover adjacent to Periyar. I moved here 60 years ago and this has been my home ever since, says K. Papamma, a resident.Her husband died 58 years ago and Papamma had to go for construction work. There was no other means to make money. It was either this or cleaning plates in hotels nearby, she says. The situation remains the same.Most men drive autorickshaws or tricycles. Their earnings are volatile as it is customer-dependant. A large amount is shelled out for petrol, say the women. They also complain that almost all the men drink every day.Queues are formed at 12 noon. I havent seen such organised lines even in temples, exclaims Jyothi. Due to this, the household income is reduced to a pittance.Adding to their woes, the Corporation toilet in disuse between blocks 2 and 3 has become a hazard for those who live nearby. The space is a haven for anti-socials. Broken bottles, remnant pills and cigarette buds are found in abundance inside. The toilet is not in use as there is no water supply. Repair work is pending too. Police personnel who come on rounds turn a blind eye to this, say residents.It will be useful if this toilet is demolished and a new building constructed to house a business centre or anganwadi. If we invite investors, there could be a sweet, papad or chikki factory in the neighbourhood. All the women can work efficiently, suggests I. Rasathiamma, a local flower seller. Several others agree.A senior official of the engineering department of the Madurai Corporation says that if women of the area complain, the toilet can be brought down. With the health departments concurrence, we can surely ensure an alternative structure for them, he says.The roads are narrow but evenly laid with paver blocks. Residents of block 5 say that the garbage collection van does not come to their street. Other areas are, however, satisfied with standards of cleanliness as garbage is collected every day. Street lights are functional but safety of women is still a point of contention due to the presence of a liquor shop and the unused toilet."

Children are unable to study as the pests occupy every corner. Despite spraying disinfectants , it has not helped to get rid of them , he added. Residents said the problem worsened between July and September as it was the breeding season for the pests. They complained that fumigation measures were not carried properly for pest control.T. Sadagopan, president of Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre, said that nearly 15 localities in Pattabiram faced the problem every year for over a decade now. A public interest litigation was already pending in the Madras High Court on the the issue for several years now. We have already made representations on the issue to the FCI authorities. We plan to file a petition to expedite the hearing, he said.Spread over 86 acres, the FCI storage depot in Pattabiram stored nearly 1.40 lakh tonnes of rice procured from other States like Punjab and Andhra Pradesh.Officials of the FCI said that nearly 100 workers were engaged in fumigation and spraying drive to control infestation of rice weevil.

The government has selected 50 villages in the coastal districts of Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg under the scheme.A Mangrove Co-Management Committee will run the project, under which businesses such as crab farming, bee-keeping, rice farming, fish farming and tourism will be set up.The businesses can be run through a committee or by an individual. In case of businesses run by a committee, the government will invest 90% and beneficiaries will have to invest 10%. In the case of individual businesses, 75% will be invested by the government and 25% by the individual, said an official.While 50 villages have been selected for 2017-18, the scheme will cover 75 villages in 2018-19 and 2019-20. The idea is to make peoples livelihood dependent on and linked to the mangrove cover. It will mean people will voluntarily come forward to save the mangrove cover. The government believes that peoples participation is important in conservation of mangroves, said the official.The official said the project aims to ensure group benefits in villages by setting up the organisational structure. The committee will also prepare a micro plan for mangrove maintenance and work on conservation, protection, setting up protective fences and improving the quality of mangroves.The project will be financed through the district development fund and mangrove foundation set up by the government. A State-level committee headed by the Principal Chief Forest Conservator (Wildlife), including district collectors of coastal regions, will be formed to coordinate the project. The Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Mangrove Cell) will supervise the entire project.Stalin D. of Vanshakti, an organisation working in the field of mangrove conservation, said, It is a welcome move.

But ever since he reached the country, Mr. Salimullah has been spending days and nights on the Kutupalang Dhal road in Ukhia, a sub-district in Coxs Bazar.We have no option but to be on the roadside. The camps are full. We have no food except some biscuits and bread given by local aid workers, Mr. Salimulla told The Hindu on Sunday afternoon.Overcrowded campsLike Salimullah, tens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine have entered Bangladesh over the past two weeks. The refugee camps in Kutupalang and Nayapara in Coxs Bazar are already overcrowded, forcing new refugees to stay on the roadside.On the Ukhia-Teknaf road, which leads up to Leda on the Myanmar border, The Hindu met hundreds of people, including women, children and elderly. Some of them have set up makeshift tents using old clothes and polythene. Please help me, forget about us, my kid will die if I dont get milk or food, Khaleda Begum, a young mother, told this reporter, carrying her new-born baby.Ms. Begum and her husband fled Mongodu in Rakhine as Myanmar security forces launched an anti-insurgency operation. They burnt our village and we had to flee, she said with tears rolling down her cheeks. In Bangladesh, like many others, they had to take roadside shelter.Government sources said around 100 babies were born in the no-mans land near border during past two weeks, without any medical attention and in unsafe and unhygienic conditions. Unless they (children) are picked up from roads and taken to hospitals, they are sure to die, a local official said.Bangladesh was already hosting 5,00,000 Rohingya refugees who fled violence in Rakhine over the past several years before the latest crisis broke out.The new wave of refugee influx started after Myanmar security forces started an operation in Rakhine following an insurgent attack on police camps on August 24. Some 3,00,000 Rohingya have entered Bangladesh since late August, according to government officials and aid agencies. The people stranded on the border do not have enough food or medicines, according to aid agencies. Many of them are still trying to cross the mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach Bangladesh. Several of them get shot while trying to cross the border or get wounded in landmine explosions.86 admitted to hospitalA total of 86 Rohingya people have been admitted to Chittagong Medical College Hospital over the past few weeks, mostly wounded by gunfire or landmine explosions. Two of them have died. Besides, at least 89 people have drowned while trying to reach Bangladesh via water.The UN Resident Coordinator in Bangladesh on Saturday appealed for aid, saying the aid agencies working in Ukhia and Teknaf urgently needed $77 million to cope with the situation.Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who said the county was giving humanitarian assistance to the hapless people, has also urged Myanmar to take back the refugees the soonest. She will visit the Kutupalang refugee camp in Ukhia on Tuesday.Bangladesh has proposed creating safe zones run by UN agencies for the Rohingya in Rakhine to stop the refugee flow.

Earlier, the State had to take permission from the Centre to procure essential commodities whose prices had risen beyond the reach of the common man.At present, when prices fluctuate, the State Food and Civil Supplies Department demands a subsidised price list from the Centre and puts up a proposal for procurement with the State government. But this process takes a long time, and until then the crisis usually has already hit a peak. With a decentralised policy for procurement, we will save a lot of time, said an official.Last year, the government had decided to directly procure paddy and rice from farmers and sell it to State fair-price shops, leaving out millers and the Food Corporation of India from the procurement chain. But the move was made possible by switching to the Centres scheme of decentralised procurement of food grain, first introduced in 1997-98, for efficiency in procurement and the Public Distribution System (PDS).The government has already started buying sugar, meant for distribution through PDS every month, through a live centralised e-auction conducted through the National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX), an online commodity exchange.The auction had received great response and cut out the role of middlemen; it showed us that independent procurement can be done in a fair and transparent way, said a former secretary of the Food and Civil Supplies Department.West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala have adopted decentralised policies. Data shows that due to the decentralised process, there has been an increase in procurement of grains in these States."

It is a flower that finds many uses in South East Asian cooking  as a food colouring in Malay cuisine, served in drinks in Thailand, and dipped in batter and fried in Burma.At Nara Thai India (NTI), which opened on Monday, the flower also serves many purposes. A dehydrated version sits atop the heady and purple Butterfly Pea Sour (Rs. 600); in the SukhoThai Fizz (Rs. 400), it is found in syrup form blending with gin; and the fresh flowers add a pop of colour to the juicy pomelo salad, Yum Som O (Rs. 390).The flowers themselves may be missing from the restaurants interiors, but purple orchids step in for that floral touch. The dcor at NTI is a blaze of purple, from the ceramic tableware to the plush sofa seating. The place may be casual but it has just the hint of a fine dine with embellished lamps, traditional Thai fans on the ceiling, bevelled mirrors hugging the walls, silk cushions and decorative ceramic pots. The al fresco courtyard leads into the dining area, and an enclosed private section. The place is spacious and yet cosy.Nara -- which comes from the Sanskrit word meaning Thai woman -- was established in 2004 by Narawadee (Yuki) Srikarnchana and Sirisopa Chulasewok. The duo wanted a place to serve fuss-free local food in a contemporary setting. They soon branched out to Singapore, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Hong Kong. Nara has been brought to India by KA Hospitality, the group who earlier gave us Hakkasan and Yauatcha.The restaurant features a lot of staples and new vegetarian dishes (and an exclusive vegetarian menu). Theres the Yum Phak Boong (Rs. 240) which has leaves of morning glory fried in a light, thin batter till crisp, served with a sweet and tangy dip. Som Tum (Rs. 390) is a refreshing salad with raw papaya and peanuts adding different textural notes. The medu wada-like Tord Man Goong (Rs. 540) is a spongy shrimp cake with a distinct flavour thanks to some briny sweet shrimp. Big juicy fat prawns also feature in the hot and sour Tom Yum (Rs. 290) with a thin broth redolent with flavours of lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and lime juice.The ubiquitous green Thai curry, Kang Kiew Wan (Rs. 390) is unlike any other version weve had in the city  its thick and creamy, with just a hint of sweetness. Packed with chunky bits of pea aubergines, eggplant and basil, we lap it up with sticky rice, Khao Niew (Rs. 150). The star of the meal is the Butterfly Pea Rice or Khao Phad Samunprai (Rs. 250)  a mound of blue rice infused with the tint of the flower, which has the warm, nuttiness of sesame. It comes with cashews, tofu and Thai herbs. That comforting Thai favourite, the omelette with crabmeat or Kai Jiew Nua Phu is fluffy and has crispy edges, but lacks the flavour we would expect from the crab.Dessert comes in two forms, a beautifully plated Thai Tea Crepe Cake and the very simple Nara Coconut Ice cream with Condiments (both Rs. 290). The former features layers of thin savoury crepes sandwiched between light-as-air cream and served with a drizzle of thick milk tea crme. The latter comes with six condiments to mix and match  sticky rice, spandan, sweet corn, peanuts, coconut jelly, and water chestnuts. They each bring in a pop of colour and texture to the smooth coconut ice cream.NTI imports all its vegetables and herbs to maintain consistency and offer a more authentic taste. Their aim is to get diners to enjoy simple, flavourful Thai food and return for more. We certainly will.Nara Thai India, Bandra-Kurla Complex. 61378080."

Clandestine Clara, rebellious and delectable. Roaring Radcliffe, her illegitimate son, a rake with a weakness for tobacco, rum and provocation. British perfume house, Penhaligons, knows a thing or two about using fictional stories of British aristocrats to pique your interest. It did mine, which is why, on a recent trip to San Francisco, I squeezed through a crowded itinerary to slip into the fairly recent Penhaligons store at Westfield mall for adekko. At the perfume bar, over 30 bottles topped with brass animal heads await  sitting pretty in the Portraits collection, the aforesaid Clara, with rhum vanilla head notes, cinnamon musk heart and amber patchouli base, makes her presence felt. She is about to be upstaged by Agarbathi and Paithani, two scents I least expect from a brand founded in 1870 by a Cornish barber who went on to become perfumer to Queen Victoria. The latest in the brands Trade Routes collection, they are inspired by Californian master perfumer Alex Lees visit to India. Notes of bergamot, pink pepper, jasmine and sandalwood define Agarbathi, the perfume houses homage to Indian temples. Paithani, meanwhile, with cardamom, nutmeg, rose and cedar, references our monsoon beverage, the masalachai. What do both fragrances have in common? A heart of milk accord. It is, let me assure you, no coincidence. For as master perfumer Lee confirms, milk in perfumes is trending. In an interview earlier this year, he bravely called it the future.We are closest to our palate than we were in a long time, begins perfumer Jahnvi Dameron Nandan, speaking to me from Paris, where she is working on a new fragrance with an opera house that uses pyrazines and a warm rice note. There is a strong connect between aroma and memory, and the general perception is that we associate the familiar smell of milk with warmth and comfort. Weve never consumed so many sweets as we do today, as I see on streets in Tokyo, Paris and India. It could be a sign of our (troubled) times, observes Nandan, trying to explain the revival of milk in fragrances today. When (Thierry Muglers) Angel came in the early 90s, it planted the idea of gourmand scents or wearing what you eat. The milky note, sticky, sweet and unisex, follows that idea. And when you have the blues, you eat more. Manan Gandhi, the founder of progressive Indian fragrance house, Bombay Perfumery, adds that the milk trend represents how far perfumery has come in terms of sourcing ingredients. Milk-like ingredients molecules are broken down and recreated to achieve a distinct scent that reminds one of comfort and ease, he says, referring to his Chai Musk, the perfect monsoon fragrance for its fiery note of ginger balanced by the milky notes of sandalwood. At Penhaligons, Lee, who hails perfume as a medicine for the spirit, says you can thank milk for imparting creaminess, volume, and a new type of addiction to a perfume.Penhaligons Agarbathi and Paithani at approximately Rs. 14,000 for 100 ml and the Portraits collection for Rs. 15,000 for 75 ml. Bombay Perfumerys Chai Musk at Rs. 4,100.Milk notes are the easiest way to give a creamy facet to a fragrance, bringing some comfort and extending an oriental dimension. A typical milky rich note is good for glamourous evenings, but think about a fresh aloe vera milk or fig milk blend for spring or summer.Pierre Kurzenne, senior perfumer, SymriseWhen sulfurol and pyrazine meet, you get a condensed milk note, cloying and intellectually stimulating. We are in gourmand territory now. It brings back the good moments, like digging into cake or sweets, or walking through a forest.Jahnvi Dameron Nandan, perfumer"

The purchasing centres will start by October 20.Harish Rao also decided to conduct a video conference with the district collectors on the cotton purchase on September 18. Harish Rao wanted the CCI officials to start opening purchasing centres from October 3 itself. The farmers resorted to cotton cultivation this year due to shortage of water and also expecting good revenues. Harish Rao wanted the officials to adopt the model used for purchasing the paddy for the cotton this year. The Union Textiles secretary too will come to the state on September 15 and examine arrangements for the purchase of cotton. Rao wanted CCI and state government officials to ensure that farmers do not suffer for want of price in selling the cotton. If any trader resorted to malpractices, the trader would be jailed, Harish Rao warned.The ginning mills would be notified and the farmer could take his produce to the nearest mill. During the procurement of paddy too, the farmers were attached to the nearest rice mill so that they need not transport the goods to far off places. The amount would be credited to the accounts of farmers within 48 hours after they sell cotton. The state government will also keep a tab on the private traders who purchase cotton.It too would take measures to ensure that no other person sells cotton to the CCI or at market yards in the guise of farmers."

But status quo will be maintained on small petrol diesel cars, so even if it has got cheaper let consumers enjoy the benefit,"" Jaitley said.Tax on mid segment cars had gone down from 48 per cent to 43 per cent and the council today decided to increase cess by 2 per cent to 45 per cent, he said.Large cars got an advantage of 8 per cent, but the council hiked cess today by 5 per cent, he said adding SUVs got benefit of 11 per cent post GST, but cess is being hiked by only 7 per cent.""Cess on cars with seating capacity above 10 but up to 13 as well as hybrid cars will remain unchanged,"" he said.The council, he said, decided that in large vehicles where affordability of consumers is high, the pre-GST rate has not been restored.""Even though we had a headspace of hiking cess by 10 per cent, it has been hiked by 7 per cent,"" the finance minister said.Jaitley said GST on about 30 items have been lowered after anomalies in the fixation of rates were pointed out.To deal with businesses which are deregistering brands post GST to avoid taxes, the panel decided May 15, 2017 as the cut-off date for considering as a registered brand for the purpose of GST levy, irrespective of whether or not the brand is subsequently deregistered.Unbranded food items are exempted from the GST, whereas branded and packaged food items attract 5 per cent rate. Hence, many businesses are deregistering their brands to avoid the levy.The tax has been lowered on dried tamarind, custard power, oil cakes, dhoop batti, dhoop and other similar items, plastic raincoast, rubber bands, rice rubber rolls for paddy de-husking, computer monitors and kitchen gas lighters and brooms and brushes.Also, the deadline for filing of sales return or GSTR-1 for the month of July, the first month of implementation of the new tax regime, has been extended by a month to October 10.Deadlines for other three returns to be filed under the GST regime have also been extended. Jaitley said overall GST collections have been robust with over 70 per cent of eligible taxpayers filing returns of about Rs 95,000 crore.The meeting, the second since the implementation of GST, reviewed the functioning of GST Network -- the IT backbone and portal for registration and tax returns under the GST regime.GSTN on ""two-three occasions got overloaded. These are transient challenges and glitches in technology. The council has decided to appoint a committee to interact with GSTN for smooth transition"", the finance minister said.Since the work is huge, the period of filing of returns has been extended, he said.Jaitley further said that food stuff sold in open was categorised at zero per cent tax rate while the branded ones attracted 5 per cent.Some businesses were deregistering their brands and selling under corporate brand name, creating inequality of trade, ""so we amended the rule"", he said.""If you fall in either of two categories, you will pay 5 per cent tax -- one, if on May 15, 2017, you had a registered trade mark you have to pay 5 per cent GST. Two, if you have a mark or a name on which you are entitled to maintain actionable claim or exclusivity, then you have to pay 5 per cent,"" Jaitley added.Khadi fabric sold through KVIC stores would be exempted, he said adding inter-state sales where turnover is less than Rs 20 lakh as also for artisans will not need registration.Similar dispensation for certain categories of job work, excluding gold, has also been approved.At its last meeting on August 5, the panel had approved hike in cess on mid, large size cars, SUVs, hybrid and luxury ones to up to 25 per cent, from 15 per cent. Subsequently, an Ordinance promulgated and the council today looked into the quantum of hike.Car prices had dropped by up to Rs 3 lakh as the tax rates fixed under the GST that came into effect from July 1, was lower than the combined central and state taxes in the pre-GST days.To fix this anomaly, the council raised the cess.Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said the council has decided that GSTR-3B will be filed for four more months till December.""For GSTR-1, 2, 3, we are giving a long rope and we are staggering the return filing date for July,"" he said.""(For) companies with turnover of over Rs 100 crore, the last date for filing GSTR-1 will be October 3. For the rest, it will be October 10,"" he said.GSTR-2 for July will have to be filed by October 31 and GSTR-3 by November 10.Date of GSTR 1, 2, 3 return filing for month of August will be informed later.Jaitley said businesses can opt for Composition Scheme till September 30 and the council has also allowed businesses to make rectification in transition form TRAN-1 once.Under the GST, which replaced over a dozen central and state levies in the biggest tax reform since independence, cars attract the top tax rate of 28 per cent.On top of this, a cess of 1 to 15 per cent has been levied for the creation of a corpus to compensate states for any loss of revenue from implementation of GST."

According to the road transport and highways minister, a Cabinet note on electric vehicles is ready that will take care of charging stations.""We should move towards alternative fuel... I am going to do this, whether you like it or not. And I am not going to ask you. I will bulldoze it. For pollution, for imports, my ideas are crystal clear... The government has a crystal-clear policy to reduce imports and curb pollution,"" Gadkari said at SIAM's annual convention here.He held out a veiled warning, saying those supporting the government will have an advantage and those busy ""minting money"" will be in trouble, asking them not to approach the government later on the ground that they have a huge stock of vehicles that do not run on alternative fuel. ""Already, we are in the process of a Cabinet note where we are going to plan charging stations... It is in the last stage and will be done as early as possible,"" he disclosed, adding that the government will soon bring in a policy on electric vehicles. Cautioning against any dilly-dallying tactics, he said the future is not of petrol and diesel, but of alternative fuel. ""I urge you (carmakers) politely to do research. First, when I urged you for electric vehicles, you said the battery is costly. I coaxed you to start at least. Now, the batteries cost 40 per cent less. And if you start now, the cost will be reduced further in mass production. Teething trouble is everywhere,"" he explained.The minister is clear that electric cars, buses, taxis and bikes are the future and India should move forward in this direction. He sought to put the entire issue in perspective, saying imports and pollution are the twin problems as India's import bill stood at a huge Rs 7 lakh crore per annum, a big drag on the economy.""Now, the government has decided to start 15 industries for second generation ethanol. Ethanol can easily be produced from agro-based cotton straw, wheat straw, rice straw, bagasse and bamboo. Alternative fuel imports substitute, cost effective and pollution free,"" Gadkari added.He promised that the proposed vehicle scrapping policy stuck due to GST issues will be sorted out soon. ""Now, the GST Council is formed. We are preparing the note. I am going to the finance minister and after that, we will move this Cabinet note. In the GST Council, we will present the note and take opinion of stakeholders.There are some concessions we are expecting from state governments,"" the minister said. The government is planning 2,000 driving schools on two acres each and called on the industry to join hands to make the skill development dream of Prime Minister Narendra Modi a big success. Outgoing SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) President Vinod Dasari hailed the government's move towards reducing imports and pollution, saying the industry fully backs it.""Already, we are leapfrogging to BS VI from BS IV within three years, which is the shortest time anywhere in the world. However, what we are asking is consistency in policy, which once formed must not be changed as the auto industry has long gestation period to introduce new technology,"" he said. Asked why the BS IV norms were not implemented for 10 years across the country when the industry was ready with the technology, he cited non-availability of fuel.""The government must ensure that when we move to BS VI, fuel is available,"" he added. He called on the government to defend a policy once framed when external agencies like courts come into the picture, giving an example as to how last year BS IV compliant big cars and SUVs were banned in NCR despite being fully in conformity with laws. ""If the government wants to reduce pollution, then old polluting vehicles must be banned instead of targeting those new ones which comply with the latest emission norms of the country,"" Dasari suggested.""All that we need is a clarity in terms of implementation timeline, setting up of infrastructure to support it. If electric vehicles become cheaper than conventional ones, consumers on their own will go for them,"" he pointed out."
5a111b589855b76bf13dcb09,He can smell The problem!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/sep/13/he-can-smell-the-problem-1656800.html,2017-09-13,"CHENNAI: I am called the Madchef for two reasons. One, because I am from Chennai which was formerly known as Madras. Second is because back from 1994-97 I was known to make a no-wait infusion cuisine at a time when everybody was expected to follow tradition. I was always fond of making new dishes and was the first to introduce paneer tikka pizza, which was made fun of at that point only to become popular later on.If someone enters my kitchen to learn I expect them to give nothing less than 100%. When we create new dishes, it may be too early for the time but we select dishes based on a balance of feasibility and the scope for marketing. My first dish was a cheese fondue when I was five, inspired from an Asterix comic with some help from my grandmother. It came out pretty well. I have come a long way and have created my own inventions like the orange peel what the corner and white chocolate pasta.My inspiration comes from all around. I refer to the flavour wheel and keep innovating to make new dishes. Food is my calling and I have the ability to visualise what a dish will look like, even before it is made. I can smell flavors and tell if a dish is salted, just by smelling it. I consider this my superpower.I remember a funny incident from college. There was a friend who rarely attended classes. During one of the tests when we had to make pasta and kheer, he ended up putting olives in the kheer and grapes in the pasta because he couldnt make out the difference between the two and it was hilarious.My comfort food comprises of anything made at home. For example, a good meal would be curd rice with pickle. I love to cook for my family and friends and I love the food that my family cooks for me; food is all about memories. My daughter is my biggest critic. If she likes something I have made, then its definitely the best.Molecular gastronomy is neither good nor bad but its definitely fun. Food wastage is a big issue in the food industry. I am the kind of guy that finishes whats on the plate, no matter how bad or good it is. It is sad to see people load up their plates even if they cannot finish it just because they feel they have paid for it. I am connected with a couple NGOs that collect excess food and give them to the needy.To anyone who is new to cooking I would say, just go ahead and try without worrying about perfection. It will come eventually. Ensure you are able to recreate whatever you do. My latest culinary experiment includes hope beef burger with an onion marmalade and slow cooked pork ribs."

My mother used to cook for a joint family and she was my first trainer. I still remember some of her tricks and tips...even now, every day, she asks me if Ive eaten properly (smiles).I started my career in 1990 at Taj Manjarun, Mangalore where I replaced my elder brother and worked there till 1998. This is where I first ventured into seafood specialities. From 1999 to 2008, I worked in Karavalli, a coastal restaurant in Bengaluru. Karavalli specialised in Goan, Kerala, Mangalore, Karwar and basically coastal cuisines and I took it as an opportunity to polish my skills with seafood. I have participated in food festivals across the country like Taj Bengal, Calcutta in 2003, Taj Banjara, Hyderabad in 2005 and other esteemed establishments like Blue Diamond, Pune and Taj Residency, Delhi. In 2009, I joined Raintree, Anna Salai and I am the sous chef there.My speciality is coastal cuisines and seafood from Kerala, Goa and Mangalore. My favourite dishes that I make best arecrab porichathu and Syrian Chicken curry. But I vote steamed neer dosai with coconut milk as my comfort food. Neer dosai is a popular breakfast in the rural areas of Mangalore. I love to cook for my family, especially my children. I am happy when my customers compliment my dishes andask me to teach them the recipes. I do everything in my capacity to ensure that the guests feel at home and they get what they request.I feel that the use of molecular gastronomy is not a bad thing at all. It has got some negative publicity due to isolated incidents that happened due to incomplete knowledge and inadequate assistance. It creates an entirely new and fun experience for the customers so if there is enough information, why not? Although I would suggest to avoid letting very young kids try it.I am very particular about wasting food and ensure that I discuss with my customers before cooking and always cook according to portions to avoid wastage. To people who are new to cooking, I would a saystart slow and gradually move on to more advanced techniques. Anybody who is interested in cooking can learn with time and remember to put your heart and soul into every dish.CRAB PORICHATHUIngredientsIngridientsOnion ,finely chopped 1Tomato,finely chopped 3Ginger Garlic Paste 1 tspTurmeric Powder  tspChilly Powder 1 tspCoriander Powder  tspCurry Leaves 10 gmCoriander Leaves 10 gmSalt To tasteOil 15 mlMETHODBring water to boil in a deep vessel.When it comes to a rolling boil, add enough salt and turmeric powder to it.Add the crab to this and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Lee, the billionaire de facto head of South Korean conglomerate Samsung, could be a crowded prison set in wooded hills just to the north of Seoul, where disgraced politicians and business leaders have previously served time.Lee, who has been tried on charges ranging from bribery to perjury in a scandal that triggered the dismissal from office of the country's ex-president Park Geun-hye, will hear the verdict of a lower court on Friday. Prosecutors are seeking a 12-year jail term.The 49-year-old Samsung scion denies wrongdoing, and would almost certainly appeal any conviction, with his case likely to be fast-tracked to the Supreme Court for a final ruling, probably next year.In the event, then, of an upheld conviction, Lee would likely follow a route to Uijeongbu Prison taken previously by a former prime minister and the heads of the SK and Daesang conglomerates, among others.If sent to Uijeongbu, Lee would likely be held in a single cell, equipped with a TV, shelving, coat rack and electric fan.Prisoners are expected to work - tending the flower garden is seen as a popular choice, said a prison official, who didn't want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media - and he would be allowed to exercise outdoors for an hour a day.They can also take up study courses in English or Japanese, and attend religious services. Chey Tae-won, the convicted SK chairman, dedicated a book he published while at the prison ""to the Lord"".Lawyers said white-collar crime inmates often reduce their manual work time by having ""special meetings"" with visitors, which can be granted at the discretion of the prison warden.Directing operations at Samsung Electronics, the world's leading smartphone and memory chip maker, from prison, though, would be a challenge as most visits are restricted. Previous conglomerate, or chaebol, heads relied on leadership committees to mind the shop while they served their sentences.For now, pending this week's lower court verdict, Lee remains in the Seoul Detention Centre where, since February, home has been a 6.56 square meter (71 square foot) cell, with a partitioned toilet. Meals are simple, normally rice and side-dishes, and cheap, costing 1,443 won ($1.26).The centre, in a Seoul suburb near apartments built by Samsung C&T and stores advertising Samsung Electronics' smartphones, is the country's third-most crowded correctional facility.A justice ministry official told Reuters that Lee could ask to be transferred - possibly to the newer 12-floor Seoul Eastern Detention Centre, which local media say has basketball courts, elevators and wall-mounted flat-screen TVs. A former top aide to ex-president Park, on trial for corruption, recently moved to the new Seoul facility.While preparing the lengthy appeal process, previous high-profile inmates have hired so-called 'butler lawyers', who stay with detained clients for hours a day to get them out of their cells and into the more comfortable visitors' rooms.Justice ministry data show SK chairman Chey had more than 1,600 meetings with his lawyers during his 17-month detention in 2013-14 - more than three meetings every day."
5a111c9b9855b76bf13dcc27,A bowl or two of burma,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/aug/21/a-bowl-or-two-of-burma-1646372.html,2017-08-21,"Lipsmacking dishes that use healthy ingredients, available at reasonable prices. No, this is not a Utopian fantasy.Tucked away in the bylanes of Burma Bazaar are 10-12 stalls that have been serving piping hot Burmese cuisine.CHENNAI: As you walk down the busy streets of Burma Bazaar around dusk, one thing that is sure to catch your attention is a line-up of food stalls selling dishes with funny names. Atho, Bejo, Mohinga, etc. are all some popular Burmese food items that have become quite a rage among the city's foodies. I am a huge foodie and I am always exploring different cuisines and varieties of food. It was during my college days that a friend told me about Burmese food at Burma bazaar. That was when I first tried atho  Burmese noodles, recalls Alex K Jose, a software engineer.The narrow streets have about 10 to 12 stalls and they're almost always overflowing with customers digging into their plates of atho. Most of the owners of these stalls have been in the city for over 40 years; they were set up by Tamil refugees who fled Myanmar and settled down in the city. We started doing business almost 30 years ago. It was my grandfather who started this stall right here and we are still doing a fair business. We get more customers around weekends and that usually goes up to 20 or 30 customers a day at times,explains Hussain Basha, one of the stall owners.Most of the stalls sell a similar menu which includes dishes such as atho, bejo, mohinga, khowsuey and some egg dishes. Atho, the most popular among the Burmese cuisine is noodles that is cooked with a lot of shredded cabbage, fried onion, tamarind, chilli powder, lemon juice and is tossed in garlic oil. Mohinga, a dish specially made for the noodle soup lovers, is made of plantain stem soup and is mixed with deep fried noodles (Bejo). Bejo is prepared out of rice powder and Bengal gram and is mixed with sauces and vegetables. Khowsuey, yet another favourite, is also referred to as coconut milk noodles and is another kind of noodle soup, made out of coconut milk, lemon and noodles.Shahul Ahmed, who owns a food stall and has been in the field from childhood says that he has trained many people in this cuisine. In earlier days, you would find Burmese food only in Burma Bazar, but nowadays you get it even in malls. I have had a couple of people who wanted to train under me for a few months, learn how to cook the basic dishes and now they run their own little hotels and restaurants, smiles Shahul.Though there are restaurants that serve Burmese food, there seem to be more customers at these little stalls than at bigger hotels. My family has been running this stall for over 20 years, and even today, we are serving the same set of dishes, at prices ranging from Rs 50-100. Our customers have only increased day by day. If we start a restaurant, that means, the prices will increase, rent will be more and so people will be sceptical about buying from there. That's why we are happy with these stalls. This is where it all began from, and so we want to stick to the basics, he smiles.Vaishnavi Raju, a solution design consultant, agrees with Shahul Ahmed. I have always eaten Burmese food from these little stalls and I feel that is where you get to taste the authentic flavours at such a reasonable price.With the number of stalls going up day by day, you would find stalls in many corners around the city. Though originally started by the Burmese, today, a majority of the stalls are owned by non-Burmese, who have learnt cooking from fellow Burmese. Radhakrishnan is one such person. I set up my stall 15 years ago and am running it successfully today. The best thing about Burmese food is that it is healthy and natural, he says.Since most dishes are made from fresh vegetables and ingredients like plantain stem, it also has a lot of health benefits like preventing diabetics, aiding digestion, etc. Everybody wants to eat healthy and people have become extremely conscious about their body and health. Burmese food is ideal in that aspect and also taste great at the same time. That's why a lot of people prefer this, he claims.How they came to TNThe Tamil Chola Empire had trade relations with Burma.During the colonial era, many people of Tamil ethnicity migrated to Myanmar to earn a living.It was after the Second World War that a majority of these Tamil people came back to India.Burma Bazaar was initially set up in the 1960s by the Myanmar Tamil Refugees.The government provided them a place to stay but many remained unemployed.Many then started their own business, with a lot starting food stalls selling Burmese food.Today, the stalls have flourished so much, and can be found in many parts of the city."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.

To tide over the crisis, the government plans to write to the Centre to provide each family with 200 days of work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), instead of the 100 days that is normally ensured.The decision was taken following the review of assessment reports submitted by district collectors. There are 150 tehsils in the state.The Chhattisgarh government has decided to immediately begin employment-oriented relief works and to supply uninterrupted power supply for irrigation pumps to make use of available water for agriculture.Apart from the request to the government to increase the number of days that families can get guaranteed work under NREGA, the Chhattisgarh government claims it is trying to ensure that every household has adequate stores of rice in every gram panchayat.The state also plans to get farmers covered under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana insurance scheme to help them make good their losses. It also plans to get them exempted from paying revenue taxes on farm land.The Chhattisgarh government will also send a proposal to the union government on resolving the water crisis, and seek diesel and seed subsidy for the affected regions in the state.The number of tehsils declared drought-hit are four in Raipur, three in Gariyaband, six in Balodabazar, five in Mahasamund, four in Dhamtari, three in Durg, four in Balod, five in Bemetra, nine in Rajnandgaon, four in Kawardha, four in Kondagaon, two in Narayanpur, seven in Kanker, five in Dantewada, four in Bijapur, eight in Bilaspur, three in Mungeli, six in Raigarh, four in Janjgir-Champa, one in Korba and five in Koriya district."

Sabari Ram has been running into them for a decade whenever he goes up to the grazing lands.For many shepherds like him in the pasture lands close to the MacMahon Line, being abused and threatened by Chinese boots is a regular affair. The PLA troopers destroy their temporary shelters, throw away their rations and utensils. Its the PLAs way of staking claim to this territory.On July 26 this year, Chinese troops transgressed a kilometre into India and came up against the usual lot of shepherds grazing their flock. This year, they were particularly aggressive.I was on my way to Barahoti when I got to know that Chinese soldiers had abused and shoved some shepherds around, said Sabari Ram. They threw away their rations (salt and rice) and destroyed their temporary shelters.Shepherd Hari Singh, who returned early from Lapthal, said the PLA soldiers not only pulled down the tents as usual, they set fire to them. They were so aggressive I thought they would kill us.''Shepherds have to take a permit from the sub-divisional magistrate at Joshimath before proceeding to Barahoti and Lapthal, some 400 km from Dehradun, to graze their sheep. The permits are three to four months. Grazing begins after the snows melt in April-May.New Indian Express caught up with some shepherds near Gamsali village where they had pitched camp for the night. All of them said they detected a change in the Chinese soldiers behaviour this year and thought that a war was likely.Sitap Singh, who returned from Barahoti, said he decided to remain well inside Indian territory after learning from other shepherds that the Chinese troopers appeared very edgy this time. I thought a war was imminent, he said.EPS PhotoWhenever the shepherds go to the higher reaches of Barahoti or Lapthal, they carry enough stocks of rice and salt to sustain themselves for four months. Belonging to the Bhotiya tribe, who are mostly shepherds and goat herders, they eat rice with meat, preferably goat or sheep. A ferocious Bhotiya dog accompanies each shepherd to protect the flock from leopards.According to ITBP and local police officials, Barahoti is a bowl-shaped area where Indian troops are entrenched in one corner and the Chinese in the other. In between the two sides is pasture land where the shepherds graze their sheep. Each time a group of shepherds move into the pasture land, the PLA troopers come stomping in and scare them away. This has been the case since the 1962 war.In recent years, the number of Chinese incursions in Uttarakhand has been on the rise. In 2013, the then chief minister Vijay Bahuguna informed New Delhi that there were 37 incursions between 2007 and 2012 in the Barahoti area alone. The fact remains that the Centre downplayed these incursions.Chinese incursions happen so regularly that even the Centre hardly takes cognizance of it, often referring it to as minor breaches, said a police officer in Chamoli district who says hundreds of such transgressions by Chinese have taken place since 1962.For the shepherds of Niti valley, Malari, Gamsali, Tapovan and Suraithota, access to the pasture land in the disputed zone is a necessity. The grass on the higher reaches is of the best quality and the climate fattnes up their animals and they get a good price in the market. The Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Army would rather have them graze their animals up there because they come back with first hand information on any Chinese incursion. ''If this area is uninhabited for long, it would give China free rein,'' an official said.The shepherds are up at Barahoti for six months between April and September, and withdraw when it gets cold. Only the shepherds are allowed to go up, says Yogendra Singh, the sub-divisional magistrate at Joshimath.Another advantage is that the shepherds understand a bit of Chinese as it is similar to their language of Rongba.Nomads on the borderThe shepherds of Barahoti belong to the nomadic Bhotiya tribe. Once the Bhotiyas used to live all along the border of India and Tibet and used to trade in wool and salt between the two places. Till 1962, a large number of Bhotiya caravans of mules and yaks used to travel into Tibet laden with Indian goods when the snow melted. They would barter these goods for Tibetan merchandise to be sold in India.The Indo-Tibetan border was closed in 1962 after which the Bhotia tribe moved across into India. Even now, besides grazing sheep in Barahoti, they still visit Parvati Kund, an area close to the LAC where a temple is located and all locals worship it. The Chinese troopers are often seen close to Parvati Kund where many people from Tibet too come to worship on their side."

""But even so, we will be on time for harvest. The elders in the village have predicted more rains, but this local variety of rice will be able to withstand it.""This local rice variety is bao, an indigenous, deep-water or floating river variety that fares better than hybrid varieties during intermittent submergence from flash floods. Bao is also more tolerant of drought-like situations -- another common feature in Assam thanks to climate change.Faced with sudden and ruthless weather pattern changes that threaten their livelihoods, farmers like Subhadra have turned to what their forefathers relied on for centuries -- traditional or indigenous technical knowledge.Today, indigenous technical knowledge in agriculture is being studied and evaluated the world over for scientific reasoning and better application. In Assam, returning to traditional varieties of rice has, for one, proved to be beneficial to farmers who face multiple floods, and who now must deal with drought-like conditions in equal severity.The present situation of three to five flash floods during the monsoon season -- each lasting seven to 15 days -- is likely to get worse in the future due to climate change.""The advantage of traditional rice varieties is that they can be planted a little later than usual if there are floods, and even then they can withstand a submerged field,"" says Dr Tomizuddin Ahmed, chief scientist at the Regional Agricultural Research Station in Jorhat, Assam.Tea growers have also made a return to traditional knowledge. Tea is the most important cash crop in Assam -- its cultivation occupies more than 200,000 hectares of land -- but climate change has led to a surge in new pests and an increase in the use of chemicals to manage them.Gobin Hazarika, who owns a two-acre tea garden in the Lakhimpur district, relies completely on nature to ward off pests. ""I have planted neem trees, a natural pest repellent, amid the tea bushes. Sometimes I also burn tobacco leaves,"" he says.Planting fruit and berry trees has also proved successful for Abrar Choudhury, senior manager at a Goodricke tea garden and chairman of the Assam branch of the Indian Tea Association.""The birds prey on the pests in the tea bushes,"" says Choudhury. ""We have also planted rows of bright flowers such as marigolds which attract the insects that are natural predators of the pests. Our pesticide use has come down considerably as a result.""Tea growers have also borrowed a part of indigenous technical knowledge for pest management from rice growers; digging in a T-shaped stick near the bushes which birds can rest on while they prey on the pests.""We mostly put bamboo sticks in the field when the paddy ripens and pests come to feed on it,"" says Hiren Gohain, a farmer in Tezpur village, Sonitpur district. Other traditional methods of repelling pests include spraying raw cow dung mixed with water or scattering slices of pumalo on to the paddy fields, or rearing ducks nearby, which are said to feed voraciously on the rice hispa pest.In the absence of a reliable early warning system for floods, traditional wisdom is helping farmers to be better prepared to face natural disasters. ""When ants move to higher places, it indicates heavy rain, and heavy rains during monsoons warn us of a flood,"" says Subhadra.Traditional knowledge is also being used to cope with disasters in Dhemaji, one of the districts worst affected by floods. While the monsoons bring floods, the ponds people rely on for drinking water dry up in winter. To cope with this, fishermen have built shallow ponds in low-lying areas with tall embankments. The cost of construction is low and the method ensures better water retention.In areas where leaks occur -- particularly those where a great deal of silt is deposited during the floods -- a mixture of raw cow dung and water is applied to the bottom of the pond to act as a sealant. Plantain and betel nut trees are also grown on the dikes to minimise erosion.""Our forefathers passed on this traditional wisdom by virtue of their close understanding of nature and her creations,"" says Pulin Borah, a 61-year-old farmer from Dibrugarh in upper Assam. ""Had these been irrelevant, do you think people would still continue to believe and practise them? Our best bet is to rely on nature to cope with her ways."""
