Recently convicted in a rape case, Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the leader of Dera Sacha Sauda (DSS), has managed to create an empire of wealth using his influence across Punjab and Haryana.Making a song and dance of brand Ram RahimGurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was struggling to make it to the big league as recently as in 2012. He had expressed support to the Congress in the Punjab state elections but the party lost and the influence of the Dera Sacha Sauda which he headed fell. But the 'guru' hit upon an idea to cash in on his popularity. He got ""devotional pop music"". The venture turned out to be a roaring success for the 'Maharaj' and boosted his popularity. The song ""Highway Love Charger"", produced in 2014, was viewed a whopping 3,20,000 times on Youtube and record-label Universal sold around 30 lakh copies of the album.(video: Youtube/ DeraSachaSaudaVEVO)Movies and masala maketh the 'Maharaj'Ram Rahim is best known for the series of his mind-blowing movies. In 2015, he released ""MSG: The Messenger of God"" which, true to godman style, had a social message addressing issues such as drug abuse and alcoholism. Ram Rahim not only acted and directed the movie, but was the singer, composer, lyricist, scriptwriter, cinematographer and editor. No wonder he claims to be god (omnipotent)! The film was released worldwide in Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, and the film grossed approximately Rs 16.65 crore according to box office estimates.Four other films followed as sequels to the first one. A fifth is said to be currently underway.150 products, 200 stores: The superman and his supermaketIn February 2016, Ram Rahim launched his brand called MSG. During the inauguration, he claimed that he started the brand when he noticed the amount of pesticide used in farms, and claimed that his intention was merely to offer products that were safe for consumption and not to compete with other brands. MSG All-Trading International Private Limited, which was set up in 2015, received dealership proposals from many countries.Some of the products that the brand popularly sells include:41 listed grocery productsVarieties of rice and pulsesSugar, salt, and spicesA whole range of cosmeticsAyurvedic productsThe products are internationally available through an online portal called msgmyandurchoice.com.A screengrab from the online shopping portal msgmyandurchoice.comMany pies, all with the goodness of 'Sacha Sauda'No empire is complete without real estate, and Dera Sacha Sauda is no exception.

A fun fact about him is that he is a snake rescuer and till date, the 21-year-old has rescued over 500 snakes in the city.He has been a member of People For Animals (PFA), an organisation that caters to animals welfare throughout the country. Abhishek, an ardent Rajnikanth fan was fascinated with one of Rajnikanths movie scene, where a snake is rescued. So when his sisters house had a snake visitor at Banneghatta, he did not hesitate to rescue the snake even though he was just in seventh standard.Abhishek with a rescued cobraThat was a very foolish thing to do. Chances of snake biting me was high, says Abhishek. I was an impulsive teenager. If I had to tell my younger-self anything then it would be not to rescue snakes without identifying them, adds Abhishek.But ever since then, he rescued snakes without letting his family know about his deeds. A year later his parents found out when he had to rescue a snake from his own house. He says his mother panicked and gave a definite No saying that the job is too risky. His father encouraged him to follow his passion and get professionally trained.After the episode, he met professional snake rescuers and trained under them, including Jayaraj S, who is the current BBMP official of wildlife rescue department.Do you know that a plate of rice we eat is possible because of snakes? questions Abhishek. Snakes play a major role to ensure good crop and harvest. If snakes were not present then 25 per cent of the crop produce would be lost to rats and insects, he answers.But he also believes that rescuing any animal is a good deed. I see no difference in rescuing a crow or a snake, says Abhishek. Snake has captured his fascination since he was a child and shares that rescuing snakes make him happy.Rescuing processThe snakes found in homes and construction sites are mostly released half a kilometre away from where they are found to ensure snakes habitat. The snakes usually come from forest and woods that are quite nearby the location they are found at, says Abhishek. For almost all his ventures that has been the case and majority of the snakes have been rat-snakes. He has rescued russel viper once, which he says was so close to bite him on his chest.During his initial days as a snake rescuer residing in Bannerghatta Road, he used to get calls every second day. For his class 11 and 12, he moved to Tamil Nadu and changed his number. It has been three years since he has been back in the city and now the only people to approach him to rescue are through personal connections and BBMP.The last snake he rescued was a week back in HSR Layout. Because of rapid urbanisation, the snakes are either lost or have moved further away from the city so I get lesser rescue calls than before, says Abhishek but changing his number cannot be ruled out as one of the reasons.Abhishek does not charge for his rescue service but adds that he is open to donation for PFA."

Accordingly, food will be supplied | JITHENDRA MBENGALURU: Visitors to Indira Canteens have largely given a thumbs up to the initiative, with their only issue being the quantity of food served in each plate. Quantity per plate will be increased once the system is completely streamlined, say BBMP officials. At the canteen in Langford Town in the Shanti Nagar ward, some visitors contemplated buying another plate after they finished one and were still left hungry.Raghu, the supervisor of the canteen, admitted the quantity was less, and said for this price, the quantity couldnt be increased any further. At the canteen in Banashankari Temple ward too, some customers were dissatisfied with the amount of food in a plate but didnt buy another plate as that would mean standing in the queue again.The problem is more pronounced at canteens which get a high footfall. For instance, the canteen in Shanthala Nagar ward on Commissariat Road has seen a high stream of visitors since the first day.A BBMP official said they had asked for extra food from other canteens to be sent there to meet the demand. The official has also requested the kitchen to send more food. He said, Due to the canteens central location, many people come here, including a lot of auto drivers. The quantity will be increased. Even now, we tell people they can take another helping if they werent satisfied with the quantity.BBMP Special Commissioner for the Indira Canteen project Manoj Rajan said each plate was meant to have 300g of rice and 100g of curd rice. Due to too many visitors at some canteens, the Joint Commissioners there, in their wisdom, suggested reducing the quantity so that more people could eat, he said. He added that after two weeks, standard bowls to measure 300g and 100g would be provided at all canteens and food would be served only from them.To ensure the supply of food meets the demand, the palike has implemented a dynamic pooling information system, wherein officials from every canteen will collect the actual number of visitors every day.This will enable us to assess the actual demand in the canteen and help us make better decisions on increasing or decreasing the meals-per-canteen count, Rajan said."

Moreover, it has come to light that subsidy from these canteens would cost the State exchequer close to Rs 89 lakh a day. As many as 500 Indira Canteens would be set up in the state by the end of December including those in Bruhata Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits.CM Siddaramiah in his budget announced that his government would set up 198 subsidised food canteens for urban poor in BBMP limits, within a few months. He added that 101 Indira Canteens were already functional and the remaining 97 would be opened by October 2. At these establishments, breakfast is served for Rs 5, while lunch and dinner served for Rs 10, he said.BBMP Commissioner Manjunath Prasad said: As of today, 1.4 lakh people are getting food everday. It is expected to increase to three lakh when all 198 canteens will be functional. With this the total subsidy given by State government has reached Rs 32 lakh per day. Moreover, the State government has spent Rs 100 crore on the construction of Indira canteens, kitchens and equipment on Indira Canteens in the city.BBMP sources said: The bidder has quoted Rs 57 per day for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The customer would be paying Rs 25 for the same (Rs 5 + Rs 10 + Rs 10) and the remaining Rs 32 will be paid by the State government. Initially it was estimated that Rs 3 lakh per day would be spent on all 198 canteens, but the number is likely to rise to Rs 57 lakh.After getting a good response, the State government is planning to set up Indira Canteens outside BBMP limits. We have identified 300 places for Indira Canteens. Each district headquarters will have five to 15 canteens, depending on the population. The eateries are expected to start by the end of December or January first week, sources in the Urban Development Department said.Rs 225 crore for 300 canteens outside BBMPSources said that it might cost the state Rs 225 crore for the construction of the 300 canteens to be set up outside set outside BBMP limits besides equipment for the same.It will be similar to Indira Canteen structures in BBMP limits. However, in some places, we shall use the existing buildings, sources said. Apart from the cost of the structure, the State government would be spending Rs 34 lakh on food subsidy everday for the canteens outside city limits.Eshwar Khandre, Minister of State for Municipalities and Local Bodies, said that officials were still in the process of calculating the subsidy amount.What you can look forwardJolad rotti oota (with curry) for Rs10 (three jowar rotis) in North KarnatakaRaagi Mudde (with sambar) for Rs10 (One big mudde) in Old Mysuru regionNeer Dosa for Rs 5 (two pieces) in Coastal KarnatakaFish curry (tentative) in Coastal KarnatakaRice items like Anna Sambar/Rasam, rice baths for Rs 5 to Rs10"

Their festival - NH44 - was all about food and drinks that one would find at dhabas along highways in south India.The items on the menu were limited, but had some popular names on it. We started the meal with the Magic Mushrooms and Social Chicken Sukka. Both dishes were low on spice and high on flavour, making them the perfect accompaniments with your drink. We paired it with the Tanker LLIIT, which comes in a long, cylindrical glass, and one of these can keep you going for some time, as it is quite strong. We tried the Luru Prawns and Red Hot Chilli Babycorn. Both the dishes were spicy, especially the prawns that had an overwhelming flavour of chilli powder - definitely reccomemded for those who have a high spice tolerance. One cocktail that we particularly enjoyed was the Bhayanak Thandi Beer - a shandy of sorts which helped wash down the spicy starters.We really wanted to give the Banarasi Patiala a try - a sugarcane juice based cocktail - which was unfortunately not available that day. The Tenderloin Roast - which is basically like a Kerala beef fry - was good and had plenty of coconut bits to make it feel authentic. The Mackerel Masala Fry was also on point in the flavour department. They also had some Social classics on the drinks menu, such as Dawa Daru and Pauvas.For the main course, the festival had three thali options - fish, chicken and vegetarian. We tried the special on the main course list - Ramesh Annas Chicken Chettinadu Biryani. The biryani was actually very good. The mildly-flavoured rice was comforting, and had a very home-cooked feel to it, making it our favourite dish on the menu. All in all, the concept of the festival was refreshing and gave us that feeling of driving down a highway and stopping for a meal at a local dhaba. However, this festival had limited options for the vegetarians, but gave meat lovers enough to want to come back for more.The festival ended yesterday, and the prices of the dishes starts at as low ` 100."

He adds, It used to be cooked only on special ocassions at home, but not anymore.Raj has been researching on the delicacy for a while now and initiated a meetup for biriyani lovers in the city. There about 100 members in the group he has made.He says, I wanted to try different varieties of biryani in the city. He found an alternative to Hyderabadi Biriyani called Donne Biryani in the city. This one is a local rice dish served on a banana leaf. The ingredients, flavours and aroma are completely different. You need to hunt down the restaurants for its authentic taste, he says. The Shivaji Military Hotel and Govindrao biryani are good places for it, he adds.Raj held the first meetup on August 20 for seven members. We tried Bamboo biryani. Its the second most popular biryani after the Hyderabadi biryani, he says. The dish is available only at few places. After research, we saw good ratings for this biryani at Broadway - The Gourmet Theatre, he says.One of the members Irene Metilda, an entrepreneur, says this group helped her socialise over biryani. The foodie says, I love biryani and can never get bored of it. Also, it helped me connect with people who share similar interests. She adds that her mothers a good cook and nothing can beat the biryani that she cooks.Raj says he plans to hold a meetup once every month. The next one will be most likely on a third Sunday of September where the group will explore Parsi and Nawabi biryani.

We might consider orange juice a healthier option but 100 ml of it contains 9 gms of natural sugar. He explains, 100 ml of an aerated drink contains 10 gms of sugar. So, it is more healthy to have the fruit. You feel full after having one. For a glass of juice, they add about four oranges, increasing its sugar content.It is important to know the amount of nutrients you are consuming. Veer says Indians tend to have an unhealthy diet. Indian foods are heavy on carbohydrates and fat as there are rotis, rice and curries are made with lot of oil and butter. And, once you try them, you get addicted and it is difficult to get out of them. He says 35 per cent of his subscribers are from India. People from Mumbai and Delhi are more fitness conscious than Bengaluru, he adds.Todays youngsters want to look good and Bollywood impresses an image of that perfect body. They go to a gym but dont realise that gymming is just 20 per cent of the equation. The rest 80 per cent is food, he says adding people think it is important to consume proteins for developing muscles. It is true. They eat chicken but the meat contains fat too. Hence, it is important to eat in right amount, he adds.Veer founded The Food Analysts four months ago and has more than 60,000 subscribers from USA, UK, Middle East and India, India being the biggest market.He says, I used to spend a lot for a trainer and gym. But, I wasnt satisfied with the results. He downloaded a fitness app that tracks intake of food. I had to break down the food into its different nutrients and upload pictures and data on the app. I thought why not have someone else to do it for me, he adds. People usually click food pictures to post on Instagram, Facebook. With TFA, they can post the pictures on a WhatsApp group and get a report on the nutrients in their diet.I didnt want to inconvenience users, with downloading an app and then uploading pictures. Instead, I decided to have it on WhatsApp so they can chat like friends, he says.How the platform worksSign up on the platform, giving basic details such as weight, height, food habits and exercise routine. You can choose a monthly package or a yearly one. A registration fee of `400 per month for a year is charged. Once you register, you can start chatting with the nutritionists on WhatsApp. You can send the pictures of your food and get a report on the nutrients you have consumed. The nutritionists can also suggest a change in diet, if required and suggest the foods you should consume.How accurate is this platform?Veer Ramlugon, founder of The Food Analysts claims that they have a database of five million food items that have been tested in labs for its nutrients. The platform is 85 per cent accurate as the staff has received maximum training to detect the portion one consumes checking the size of the plate and food in the picture. Over a period of time, 15 per cent inaccuracy can be eliminated with the guidance from the nutritionists, he says adding, 10 calories can be burned easily by walking for five minutes."

Ravishankar says, I take only bulk orders. Families come with pulses, chillies and grains to grind them for sambar or bisibele bath powders. They then sell them in small quantities in packets. The customers also grind rice and sell instant dosa batter. He claims that he gets about 30 customers every day and proudly believes that is is because of the hygiene he maintains.

I just had the most delicious vegetarian version of Nasi goreng that there is, born out of chef Sachin Talwar's intelligent choice of ingredients and his love for food making that reflects in his creations.The spiced pre-cooked fried rice has mushroom and cottage cheese bites and is topped with a cottage cheese layer, which served as the vegetarian equivalent of an egg topping. The spice mix in the rice is a brilliant blend to say the least. The dish completes itself with peanut butter sauce, fried papad and vegetable satay on the side.The dish is part of ""World Street Food Festival"" at My Fortune, Bengaluru. The festival includes Cheese Baked Nachos, Double Decker, Veggie Burger, Eggplant and cheese Fritters, Falafel, Mexican Re-fried Beans Gorditas, Paneer Khurchan Kathi Roll, Tofu Satay with Peanut Putter Sauce, Veggie Nasi goreng, Veggie Wraps, American Chicken Supreme Burger, Arrosticini Abruzzesi, Chicken Satay with Peanut Butter Sauce, Garlic Chicken Wings, Hot Dog, Mexican Lamb Gorditas, Murgh Khurchan Kathi Roll and Nasi Goreng.The Cheese Baked Nachos are crisp, layered with corn, tomatoes, onions and zuchini. The sour cream and salsa dip, both score high on taste and technique.The Chicken Satay with Peanut Butter Sauce is an unusual combination for an Indian palate, but once you dig in, you wouldn't stop with just one bite. The chicken is grilled right with Indonesian spices and the peanut butter sauce adds a tinge of sweetness to the dish.The Eggplant and cheese Fritters are extremely crunchy on the outside and has smooth cheesey texture on the inside with well-cooked aubergine slice layered in. It is served with cumin and olive oil induced pimento sauce. The jalapeno stuffed in the patties lifts the flavour of the ensemble. The Garlic Chicken Wings served as an Italian twist to a Chinese preparation. The meat has chilli flakes on top, is roasted well and has a strong flavour and aroma of olive oil. It isn't too spicy and will suit the taste buds well.The Paneer Khurchan Kathi Roll is a maida roll stuffed with onion, tomatoes and paneer chunks. The fish and chips served on the table was another winner of the evening. The batter fried fish melts in your mouth. The Basa fish is light and the corn flour batter adds crunch to the dish. It is served with French fries and tato suace on the side. The ""World Street Food Festival"" is being hosted at My Fortune, Bengaluru until September 17. Cost: `2,000 for two people (approx.)"

The Appaji Canteen, named after former PM H D Deve Gowda, is located in Srinagar.When Express visited both the canteens in Hanumanthanagar ward, most of the people opined that food provided at Appaji Canteen was tastier and healthier. Small queues and more quantity of food served in each plate also attract many to Appaji Canteen. Ragi mudde and thatte idli are the favourites here. For officegoers and school students, who are not so fussy about taste and want to eat at a lower cost, visiting Indira Canteen is the best bet.People queue up at the Appaji Canteen in Hanumanthanagar | nagaraja gadekalStaff at this canteen also do not mind giving food parcels, if the customers are students in hurry. Many times, students come here to have their breakfast and ask us to parcel food for lunch. We do it for them. But we dont give more than one parcel, said Nagesh, an employee at Hanumanthanagar Indira canteen. On the other hand, Appaji Canteen staff are now strict with no- parcel rule. The staff say that earlier, people would come and get as many as 10-15 thatte idlis and 10 plates of rice bath parcelled. Because of this, the food was getting over in just 20 minutes and many had to return hungry. So we stopped parcel services, said Venkatesh, Appaji Canteen chef.Business at nearby hotels hitWith thousands flocking the Appaji and Indira Canteens, hotels nearby are feeling the heat. Mani, who works at a fast food hotel near the Appaji Canteen, says business is down by 30-40 per cent. Business has also been hit at 4-5 other hotels in the vicinity. However, those who do not want to stand in queues visit our hotel, he added. Ramesh, a worker at a hotel located near Indira Canteen, said their business has been hit, but not to a great extent. We might have suffered a loss of maximum 10 % in business, he added.Appaji vs Indira canteensFor the past one month since the lauch of Indira Canteen, the politics over the canteen project is a hot topic of discussion among those who come to have food at Appaji Canteen. From politics over canteens to comparison of menus and the price list  everything is discussed over a meal. But the customers are in unison about one thing  as long as they get cheap food, who gets political mileage from such projects does not bother them.Good quality foodAs early as 7 am every morning, 30 minutes before the Appaji Canteen opens, a long line of people can be seen on 50 feet road in Srinagar. The customers mainly include sales executives, auto drivers and daily wage workers. Traffic is partially affected as there is no space for parking on the road and the footpath is teeming with people having food. The canteen is open between 7.30 am and 9.30 am for breakfast and again between 1pm and 3pm for lunch. Rajesh, an auto driver said, The quality of food is very good, but only that we have to stand in queue and wait for our turn. Prices are really affordable and I do not have any problem waiting for the food.Manjunath, a sales executive, too echoed similar views. The food is really cheap and of good quality, he says. The Indira Canteen in Hanumanthanagar is popular among school going children and senior citizens. The canteen serves food three times a day and gets more customers than Appaji Canteen. The coupons get sold within 30 minutes after the business hour starts. The space constraint causes inconvenience and the premises can hardly accommodate 300 people at a time. Vedesh, an employee at a private firm, said, The quantity of food might be less here, but the quality is good. Indira Canteen must start cooking thatte idlis and some more dishes."

It did not mean all 36,000 new refugees counted had entered in the last 24 hours.Still, ""the numbers are very worrying,"" Tan said. ""They are going up very quickly.""Thousands are streaming daily across the swampy border, having walked for days through forests and rice paddies to reach safety in Bangladesh. Others were attempting to cross the river that separates the two countries, and at least several dozen have drowned in the attempt.Older, established refugee camps that have been housing Rohingya since the 1990s have already reached capacity. Tens of thousands of new arrivals had nowhere to go, and were sheltering in makeshift camps, in village alleys, on open roads or in fields.The latest influx of Rohingya began Aug 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked Myanmar police posts, prompting security forces to launch ""clearance operations"" in response.Both Myanmar security officials and Rohingya insurgents accuse each other of committing atrocities in the last week.Refugees are arriving in Bangladesh with stories of their homes set aflame and Myanmar soldiers firing indiscriminately around their villages.The Rohingya have long faced discrimination in Myanmar, but bloody rioting in 2012 forced more than 100,000 into displacement camps in Bangladesh, where many still live today."

LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex) groups strongly oppose the plebiscite and so do we,"" she said.""Telling one group of people that their rights have to be decided by a public vote sends a terrible message.""It is one of two legal challenges being heard by the court, both essentially seeking the same thing.The other, launched last month and being heard alongside Tuesday's challenge, is led by Independent MP Andrew Wilkie, PFLAG (Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and Gays), and Melbourne mother Felicity Marlowe.Opponents claim the survey falls outside the powers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which has been hired to conduct the poll.They also say Canberra exceeded its executive authority by earmarking Aus$122 million (US$96 million) to carry it out without parliamentary approval.The government argues it can authorise using the cash under laws that allow it to green-light ""urgent"" and ""unforeseen"" spending.Vile hate and abuse""Our case is very tight,"" Wilkie told reporters. ""It's very much about the power of the executive and whether or not a government has the right to conduct this sort of activity without the approval of the parliament.""The government is expected to make its case on Wednesday, with legal experts saying a result is possible later this week.""Nothing in the submissions put by the Commonwealth to the High Court alters my view that the survey will more likely than not be struck down,"" constitutional law expert George Williams wrote in a column for the Sydney Morning Herald.Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull supports marriage equality, but he is battling with right-wing members of his own Liberal Party, who are against legalising such unions.He has pleaded for respectful debate amid homophobic slurs expressed by opponents.In signs the debate could turn toxic, a poster emblazoned ""stop the fags"" was put up in central Melbourne last month and flyers describing homosexuality as ""a curse of death"" were distributed in suburban Sydney.Marlow, a lesbian mother-of-three, said since the postal survey was announced, she has suffered ""vile hate and abuse"".""Our ability to nurture and love and care for our children has been questioned already on social media, on posters, on flyers, on advertisements in the newspapers,"" she said."

Swiss offer insect burgers of mealworm larvae,http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/sep/11/yuck-or-yum-swiss-offer-insect-burgers-of-mealworm-larvae-1655390.html,2017-09-11,"GENEVA: Swallow deeply, pinch the nose and repeat the mantra: ""Tastes like beef, tastes likes beef."" Then bite into the burger of rice, chopped vegetables, spices and mealworm larvae.The Swiss supermarket chain Coop, to a bit of domestic hoopla, has begun selling burgers and balls made from insects. It's being billed as a legal first in Europe, a continent more accustomed to steak, sausage, poultry and fish as a source of protein.The goal is to convince leery consumers to try a nutritious, if unusual food that ""preserves the planet's resources,"" Coop says.About one-third of the burger is mealworm larvae. A burger weighing 100 grams (3.5 ounces) has about 10 grams of protein in it  about the same amount found in a child's-size beef burger.For now, only seven of Coop's nearly 2,500 stores in Switzerland are serving up the critters concocted by the Zurich-based food startup Essento. The chain says the insect products have been flying off shelves during their limited rollout in the Alpine nation and a broader launch is planned by year's end.Insect promoters say Switzerland isn't the first European country to allow retail sales, just the first to have those sales so clearly authorized. A change in Swiss law in May allows the sale of three types of insects: mealworm larvae, house crickets and migratory locusts.""It's the first time that a state has authorized human consumption of insects in such a firm, explicit way in Europe,"" said Christophe Derrien, chief of the International Platform of Insects for Food and Feed.Insects can be found on the shelves in Belgium, Britain, Denmark and the Netherlands, but that's due to a ""legal void"" in European Union rules, he said.New legislation taking effect in January will smooth the way for bug burgers to turn up on picnic plates across the EU, however.The chain says it has a policy of not releasing sales numbers, but spokeswoman Andrea Bergmann said the insect burgers and balls ""have been very successful from day one and have been sold out quickly everywhere.""The burger itself has little white specks of rice inside with traces of carrot, paprika, chili powder and pepper. After a hesitant bite, the main flavors that come out are the spices. The texture is curious, a bit like a meaty falafel with a crunch. An aftertaste lingered  but maybe that was just my subconscious playing tricks.The insect burgers, like the meat variety, can be accompanied by buns, tomatoes and lettuce. The insect balls  a mixture of mealworms with cilantro, onions and chickpeas  seem to fit best in pita bread, perhaps with a spoonful of yogurt.The U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization has promoted insects as a source of human food, saying they are healthy and high in protein and minerals. The agency says many types of insects produce less greenhouse gases and ammonia than most livestock  such as methane-spewing cattle  and require less land and money to cultivate.Still, there's no telling how long a true conversion in consumer tastes from beef to bug burgers might take  if it happens at all."

But it's impossible to stop the flow, these people are everywhere,"" he added.The UN said most of the new arrivals were in the squalid camps already housing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees around the coastal town of Cox's Bazar.But many lacked shelter from the heavy monsoon rains and an AFP reporter on the ground said hundreds of new makeshift shelters had sprung up on the outskirts of the sprawling camps in recent days.""It has been raining frequently since last week. We have to keep our children safe from being sick,"" said Amena Begum, a newly arrived mother of five.Mounting criticismRefugees in Cox's Bazar have alleged their families were massacred and villages torched by security forces and Buddhist mobs.The latest clashes broke out when Rohingya militants attacked security installationsMyanmar accuses the militants -- which it describes as ""Bengali terrorists"" -- of setting fire to Rohingya houses and those of other communities.De facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner of Myanmar's junta, has come under increasing fire over her perceived unwillingness to speak out against the treatment of the Rohingya or chastise the military.She has made no public comment since the latest fighting broke out.""Over the last several years I have repeatedly condemned this tragic and shameful treatment,"" Pakistani activist and fellow Nobel peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai said in a statement about the Rohingya crisis on Twitter.""I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same.""The crisis threatens Myanmar's diplomatic relations, particularly with Muslim-majority countries in Southeast Asia where there is profound public anger over the treatment of the Rohingya.Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi met Myanmar's army chief General Min Aung Hlaing in Naypyidaw on Monday to try to pressure the government to do more to alleviate the crisis.Rakhine has been a crucible of religious violence since 2012, when riots erupted. Scores of Rohingya were killed and tens of thousands of people -- the majority from the Muslim minority -- were forced into displacement camps.But the current round of fighting is the worst yet.Myanmar's army has said nearly 400 people have died in the past 10 days, including 370 Rohingya militants.Ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and other tribal groups are also among the dead and displaced after allegedly being targeted by Rohingya militants.Scores of people have drowned while attempting to flee the violence by crossing the Naf border river into Bangladesh.Bangladeshi coastguards have said many migrants are travelling on rickety fishing boats unsuitable for the rough waters.On Monday police in Bangladesh said the body of a Rohingya woman had washed ashore, bringing the total number of drowned to 54.Most of those entering Bangladesh are women, children or elderly men, and the refugees say that many young men have stayed behind to fight.Bangladesh was already home to an estimated 400,000 Rohingya before the latest influx and has made clear it doesn not want more coming in.It has pushed a number of them back, in what rights groups say is a contravention of its international obligations."

It is a duty from a Muslim brother to another to help in distress.""Bangladesh already hosted at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before this latest influx, offering sanctuary for more than three decades to civilians fleeing violence and persecution in neighbouring Rakhine State.But this fresh wave is unprecedented in its magnitude, pushing conditions at the camps to the absolute limit.Charities are warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis as Bangladesh pushes for a diplomatic solution to close the floodgates.Prices soaringAt the congested market near Kutupalong refugee camp, where children bang on the windows of passing cars pleading for food, Bangladeshis are helping out with whatever meagre resources they have.Some of these freelance relief efforts are shambolic, with tremendous crushes and children knocked down as donated supplies are tossed from moving trucks.As the crisis enters its third week, patience is also running thin among some Bangladeshis living near the border, where many earn little.Prices for food and other staples have soared in local markets, which have become choked with chronic traffic and large numbers of beggars.Kuilla Mia, a tea seller working a street corner amid a chaotic swirl of refugees, said he had nothing to spare.""I would like to give them a discount, but I cannot because the price of sugar is high,"" he told AFP.Bangladesh -- which initially ordered border guards to turn back newcomers before the effort became futile -- has been praised for taking on the burden despite its own pressing challenges as one of the region's poorest countries.The plight of the Rohingya, who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar, has particularly roused emotion across the Islamic world.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina toured Kutupalong, one of the biggest camps, where she was seen consoling a young Rohingya boy.""I can't hold back the tears in eyes as I look at this scene... Why should people suffer such pain?"" she said, according to private news portal bdnews24.com.Bangladeshi authorities have said they will register all new arrivals, setting up booths in the camps to collect fingerprints and family information.Hasina wants the Rohingya returned to what she has labelled their ""ancestral homeland"" in Myanmar.""Myanmar has created the problem and it will have to resolve it,"" she told parliament on Monday.Dhaka has pointed to a deal with Yangon in 1992 that saw more than 236,000 Rohingya repatriated as ""members of Myanmar society"".Mohammad Hussain, a lentil vendor, said he was giving away what he could, but Bangladeshis alone could not be expected to care for all the refugees.""If aid doesn't arrive from abroad, then these people will be in serious danger,"" he told AFP.But for young Hassan, the experience has been moving""I feel great helping them, and I want to do more,"" he said."

Would another girl, who looks even younger, get justice after an alleged statutory rape at the hands of an older man?In their impoverished communities in Uganda, the answers hinged on the fact that one girl had a birth certificate and the other didn't. Police foiled the planned marriage after locating paperwork that proved the first girl was not 18 as her parents claimed. The other girl could not prove she was under the age of consent; her aunt, who's also her guardian, has struggled to press charges against the builder who seduced and impregnated her.""The police were asking me many questions about proof of the girl's birth date,"" said the aunt, Percy Namirembe, sitting in her tin-roofed shantytown home in Masaka near the shores of Lake Victoria in south-central Uganda. ""I don't have evidence showing the victim is not yet 18.""As Namirembe spoke, her niece sat beside her, her belly swollen and a vacant stare on her face.In the developed world, birth certificates are often a bureaucratic certainty. However, across vast swaths of Africa and South Asia, tens of millions of children never get them, with potentially dire consequences in regard to education, health care, job prospects and legal rights. Young people without IDs are vulnerable to being coerced into early marriage, military service or the labour market before the legal age. As adults, they may struggle to assert their right to vote or inherit property.""They could end up invisible,"" said Joanne Dunn, a child protection specialist with UNICEF.With support from UNICEF and various non-governmental organizations, many of the worst-affected countries have worked to improve their birth registration rates. In Uganda, volunteers go house to house in targeted villages, looking for unregistered children. Many babies are born at home, missing out on registration procedures that are being modernized at hospitals and health centers.By UNICEF's latest count, in 2013, the births of about 230 million children under age 5  35 percent of the world's total  had never been recorded. Later this year, UNICEF plans to release a new report showing that the figure has dropped to below 30 percent.India is the biggest success story. It accounted for 71 million of the unregistered children in UNICEF's 2013 report  more than half of all the Indian children in that age range. Thanks to concerted nationwide efforts, UNICEF says the number of unregistered children has dropped to 23 million  about 20 percent of all children under age 5.Uganda is a potential success story as well. UNICEF child protection officer Augustine Wassago estimates that Uganda's registration rate for children under 5 is now about 60 percent, up from 30 percent in 2011.While obtaining a birth certificate is routine for most parents in the West, it may not be a priority for African parents who worry about keeping a newborn alive and fed.Lack of registration hampers Uganda's efforts to enforce laws setting 18 as the minimum age for marriage. Child marriage remains widespread, due largely to parents hoping to get a dowry from their daughters' suitors. Even when the police are alerted, investigators face an uphill task pressing charges if they cannot prove, with a birth certificate or other official document, that the girl is a minor.But in the recent case in the Rakai administrative district, police detective Deborah Atwebembeire was able to prevail in a surprise raid on a wedding party because the bride-to-be's birth certificate proved she was 15.""When we reached there, I heard one man say, 'Ah, but the police have come. Let me hope the girl is not young,'"" Atwebembeire recalled.The girls' parents claimed she was born in March 1999, which would have made her old enough to consent. Yet only months before, the parents told birth registration officials she was born in October 2001.The wedding was called off; the parents spent a night in jail.The girl, Asimart Nakabanda, had dropped out of school before the planned marriage. ""The man is out of my mind now,"" she said. ""I want to go back to school.""The progress in India results from a decades-long initiative. Health workers, midwives, teachers and village councilors in remote areas have all been empowered to report births.Chhitaranjan Khaitan, a census official, said 15 of India's 29 states now report a 100 percent birth registration rate.An added motivation is India's effort to stem its skewed gender ratio, due largely to families' preference for sons. By requiring health workers and village officials to register all births, authorities hope fewer newborn girls will be killed by their families.Pradeep Verma, a car mechanic in the central state of Chhattisgarh, was thrilled to obtain his daughter's birth certificate earlier this year.""It was the first thing I did after my daughter was born,"" said Verma, 28. ""My parents did not register my birth. It was not considered important or necessary in those days.""Verma, who dropped out of school in 10th grade, has had repeated problems with proving his identity, particularly in getting a government ration card entitling him to cheap rice and sugar.""My daughter will not have to face such hassles,"" he said.Children in an orphanage-school in Uganda (AP)Chhattisgarh was recording just 55 percent of births in 2011. In 2013, with help from UNICEF, the state government launched a registration campaign and today it registers virtually every birth.Yet huge challenges remain for UNICEF and its partners to attain their goal of near-universal registration by 2030. In war-wracked Somalia the most recent registration rate documented by UNICEF, based on 2006 data, was 3 percent  the lowest of any nation.There's also the massive problem of children without birth certificates or other identification who comprise a significant portion of the millions of displaced people worldwide, fleeing war, famine, persecution and poverty. Birth registration can be crucial to enabling refugee children to return home or to reunite after being separated from their parents.Claudia Cappa, author of the upcoming UNICEF report, says such separations can be heartbreaking for a parent.""How can you claim your child if you don't have proof he or she really existed?"" she said."

High Commissioner for Refugees had previously estimated as arrived since Aug. 25.""This is an alarming number,"" Tan said. ""The existing camps are full to the capacity. There is a lot of pressure on relief agencies to accommodate the rising numbers.""She said the new number was still a ""rough estimate,"" and based on an assessment that involved a host of aid agencies operating in the area. Some aid groups also had identified ""new pockets of people that we did not know about before, mainly in villages"" where Bangladeshi communities had taken them in, but also some new settlements and clusters in difficult-to-access areas.Makeshift camps were quickly appearing and expanding along roadsides, Tan said.She said it was possible some people who received help from multiple agencies could have been counted twice.The exodus from Myanmar's northern Rakhine state began Aug. 25 after Rohingya insurgents attacked police posts. The military responded with what it called ""clearance operations"" to root out any fighters it said might be hiding in villages of Rakhine state.The Myanmar government says nearly 400 people have been killed in fighting it blames on insurgents, though Rohingya say they Myanmar troops and Buddhist mobs attacked them and destroyed their villages.It's not known how many Rohingya remain in Rakhine state. Previously the population had been thought to be roughly 1 million.Journalists in northern Rakhine state saw active fires in areas Rohingya had abandoned, adding to doubts over government claims that Rohingya themselves were responsible for setting them.Associated Press reporters who have been in Rohingya camps all week saw a surge in the number of people entering Bangladesh on Thursday and Friday.An increasing number of Rohingya were also arriving by boat, with 300 boats reaching the Bangladesh town of Cox's Bazar from Myanmar on Wednesday alone, according to the International Organization for Migration.""Sea routes are particularly dangerous this time of year, when boats are known to frequently capsize in rough seas,"" the IOM said in a statement.Dozens of Rohingya have died in capsizings since the exodus began, and there are other dangers as well. On Monday, the AP saw an elderly woman whose leg had been blown off when she set off a land mine.Land mines were planted years ago along parts of the border. Bangladeshi officials say Myanmar soldiers have planted new explosives since the latest wave of violence began, though the Myanmar military denies it.""It may not be land mines, but I know there have been isolated cases of Myanmar soldiers planting explosives three to four days ago,"" Lt. Col. S.M. Ariful Islam, commanding officer of the Bangladesh border guard in Teknaf, said Friday. He added that he was aware of at least three Rohingya injured in explosions.There are now massive crowds of Rohingya in the streets of towns including Cox's Bazar and Teknaf, with relatively few soldiers or police and even fewer signs of aid agencies.At a small makeshift mosque made of bamboo sticks and plastic sheets, a small group of new arrivals offered prayers Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam.Later, members of a local organization were seen distributing aid, throwing packets of puffed rice and old clothes into huge crowds of Rohingya. There are no clearly organised points of distribution.Tan, of the refugee agency, said it was distributing aid through a local organization that preferred to keep a low profile.U.N. agencies have released $8 million in emergency aid in the area, but were pleading for millions more."

A senior party source told AFP ""she is definitely no longer here, she is likely in Singapore now.""Yingluck joins her billionaire brother Thaksin in self-exile -- a knock-out blow to the family and their political ambitions.Thailand is deeply divided between the Shinawatras and their political base, which is mainly drawn from the rural poor; and a royalist army-aligned elite, who loathe the clan and refuse to cede power to democratic governments.Yingluck's government was removed by a military coup in 2014.In a day of high drama, Yingluck ducked her court hearing for negligence over a flagship rice subsidy policy, which carried up to 10 years in prison and a life ban from politics.""Her lawyer said she is sick and asked to delay the ruling... the court does not believe she is sick... and has decided to issue an arrest warrant,"" fearing she may flee the country, lead judge Cheep Chulamon told the court, rescheduling the verdict to September 27.A minister in her government was jailed hours later for 42 years in a separate trial for corruption linked to the policy.Thai junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha denied knowledge of her whereabouts but ordered border checkpoints ""to be stepped up,"" while his number-two Prawit Wongsuwon said it was ""possible"" Yingluck had fled through neighbouring Cambodia.Requesting anonymity, the senior source in the Shinawatras' Pheu Thai party told AFP that she left Thailand on Wednesday, adding ""it's impossible she left without the military green light.""Family traditionYingluck's brother Thaksin Shinawatra, who is also a former premier, fled Thailand in 2008 before he was convicted of graft and handed a two-year jail term.The telecoms tycoon, who once owned Manchester City football club, has not returned since and his Thai passport has been revoked.He is believed to use a Montenegrin passport to travel between homes in Dubai, London, Hong Kong and Singapore.The clan had clung on in Thailand's treacherous political game for more than a decade despite two coups, deadly protests, a cascade of legal cases and huge asset seizures.Thaksin remains a galvanising force for his party and a canny political operator.But analysts say if both siblings are now in exile their time in Thailand's spin dryer political arena is over.""It is the end of the Shinawatras and the Pheu Thai party in politics,"" Puangthong Pawakpan, a Thai politics expert at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.""With two family members as fugitives, the family loses political legitimacy,"" she said, adding that Yingluck's departure would be welcomed by a Thai junta weary of the prospect of her political martyrdom in jail.Billionaires and generalsTo many supporters Yingluck had finally emerged from her elder brother's shadow, drawing on a star quality throughout her 18-month trial that is absent among the gloomy cast of ageing generals who rule Thailand.Her flagship rice subsidy poured cash on her family's rural political heartland, paying up to twice the market rate for the grain.But it was beset by graft and led to billions of dollars of losses.She pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying she is the victim of a ""subtle political game.""Rumours of her flight were met with understanding from supporters who lingered outside the court.""The Thai prime minister has done her best, she has sacrificed a lot,"" said 64-year-old Seksan Chalitaporn.""Now the people have to fight for themselves.""In a Facebook post on Thursday Yingluck asked her followers to stay home to avoid any incidents stoked by people with ""ill-intention against the country and us"".The Shinawatra family emerged as a political force in 2001 when billionaire patriarch Thaksin swept to power.He jump-started the economy and provided the most extensive pro-poor welfare schemes in Thai history.But critics accused him of using political power to further his business interests.He remains loathed by the Bangkok royalist elite but cherished by the rural poor.A coup toppled him in 2006 and he fled overseas.Historically the Shinawatras have been able to mobilise huge crowds of supporters -- known as the ""Red Shirts"" -- to take to the streets when the family's political fortunes have waned.But three years of repressive junta rule has successfully quashed any widespread opposition to the military for now.The country's democratic future also looks bleak, with a junta-scripted constitution severely cramping the power of any future elected governments.The junta has trailed elections for next year, but the timetable has repeatedly slipped."

But unverifiable testimony has trickled out, telling of tit-for-tat mass killings and villages being torched by the army and the militants.As violence spins out of control, food and medical relief have been stopped to many already languishing in basic camps, according to Pierre Peron, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.""Humanitarian aid normally goes to these vulnerable people for a very good reason, because they depend on it,"" he said in a statement, adding disruption to the relief chain ""has a very real human impact.""UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Friday warned the spiral of violence could lead to a ""humanitarian catastrophe"" and urged Myanmar's government to provide security for aid agencies to reach those in need.Shortly before his comments, aid groups were again spotlighted by army chief Min Aung Hlaing, whose office said WFP-labelled food and medicines had been found with dead militants.The militants are fighting under the banner of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), who say they are defending their minority group from persecution by Myanmar.The ARSA emerged as a force in October last year when their attacks killed Myanmar border police, prompting a crackdown by security forces which the UN says may have amounted to ethnic cleansing."

(PTI) New Delhi, Aug. 5: The GST Council today fixed a uniform tax rate of 5 per cent for all job works in the $108-billion textile sector, instead of varying rates in the range of 5-18 per cent. Upset over the different tax slabs, the textile sector had been holding strikes and protests across the country, including the Prime Minister's home state of Gujarat. Rate rejig All job works in textiles, from embroidery to weaving, will be taxed at 5 per cent instead of 18 per cent decided earlier. This 5 per cent rate will be applicable to apparels, shawls and carpets as well. To make farm equipment cheaper, tractor parts will attract a GST rate of 18 per cent instead of 28 per cent previously. The GST rate on government work contracts has been set at 12 per cent. Anti-profiteering rule The council gave an in-principle approval to anti- profiteering measures and decided to set up a screening committee in 15 days to see if the tax reductions after the implementation of the GST have been passed on to consumers. Finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters after the GST Council meeting that several industries had not passed on the benefits of the new tax system to the consumers. ""We appeal to them to pass on the benefits and expect the market mechanism to compel them to pass on the gains to consumers,"" he said. ""We hope we won't be pushed to a position to constitute an authority immediately,"" he added. Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia said states would set up their respective screening committees within 15 days and the Centre would also set up the standing committee in the same timeframe. These committees will be the first point for receiving profiteering complaints. e-way bill measures Jaitley said all goods worth over Rs 50,000 will have to be registered online before they are moved for sale beyond 10km. GST-exempt goods have been kept out of the purview of e-way bills - a minor relaxation from the draft rules which required all goods to be pre-registered. The e-way bill mechanism is likely to come into force by October 1. The permits thus issued will be valid for one day for movement of goods for 100km and in the same proportion for the following days. According to the draft provision, GSTN would generate e-way bills that will be valid for 1-20 days, depending on the distance to be travelled - one day for 100km, 3 days (100km to less than 300km), 5 days (300-less than 500 km) and 10 days (500-less than 1,000 km). Jaitley said the council had given an in-principle approval to pan India e-way bill. ""There will be no checkposts. The process will be technology-driven and human intervention will be minimised,"" he said. Bengal chief minister Amit Mitra said the council had decided that the ""checks would be randomised"" and purely technology-driven. This will pre-empt harassment to manufacturers. Jaitley said more than 71 lakh central and state taxpayers have migrated to the GST system and have completed registration. Another 15.67 lakh new applications for registration have been received. The council today also decided to exempt goods and services related to the Junior Fifa World Cup which will be hosted by India. Besides, aggregators who are offering small housekeeping services such as plumbing and others will have to pay the GST under the reverse charge mechanism. Cab service providers will have to pay 12 per cent GST if they claim input credit, and without input credit it would be 5 per cent. Next on agenda The council will meet next on September 9 in Hyderabad during which it will take up the issue of many rice millers deregistering their brands to escape taxation under the GST. Under the GST, unbranded food items are exempted, where as branded and packed food items attract a 5 per cent rate."

Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University who lives in Seattle. ""It could very well be calculated toward reinforcing the point that Qatar will not bow to this regional pressure placed upon it.""Qatar's Foreign Ministry announced early Thursday that the country's ambassador would return to Tehran. Qatar pulled its ambassador in early 2016 after Saudi Arabia's execution of a prominent Shiite cleric sparked attacks on two Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran, a move to show solidarity with the kingdom.""The state of Qatar expressed its aspiration to strengthen bilateral relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran in all fields,"" a short Foreign Ministry statement said.Iranian state media acknowledged the development, without elaborating.Despite recalling its ambassador in 2016, Iran and Qatar maintained their valuable commercial ties. Qatar and Iran share a massive offshore natural gas field, called the South Pars Field by Tehran and the North Field by Doha.That gas field's vast reserves made Qataris have the highest per capita income in the world, as well as funded the nation's Al-Jazeera satellite news network and secured hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup.Since the diplomatic dispute with Arab nations began in June, Iran has sent food shipments to Qatar. Shiite power Iran also has incorporated the crisis into its regular criticism of the Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia, part of the two Mideast powers' long-running proxy war.There was no immediate reaction from the Arab nations boycotting Qatar. On Wednesday, the Central African nation of Chad announced it would close its embassy in Doha, accusing Qatar of trying to destabilize it from neighboring Libya.The diplomatic crisis began June 5, when Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates cut ties to Qatar over allegations including it funding extremists and being too close to Iran. Qatar long has denied funding extremists.The boycotting countries later issued a list of 13 demands to Qatar, including that Doha shut its diplomatic posts in Iran. Qatar ignored the demands and let a deadline to comply pass, creating an apparent stalemate in the crisis. Attempts by Kuwait, the U.S. and others have failed to make headway.In recent days, however, Saudi Arabia announced it would allow Qataris to make the annual hajj pilgrimage, which is required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life. Saudi state media said that came in part due to an intercession by Qatari royal family member Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and later a vacationing King Salman in Morocco.But Sheikh Abdullah has no role in Qatar's government and his last position was as head of the equestrian and camel racing federation decades ago. Sheikh Abdullah's grandfather, father and brother were rulers of Qatar until a palace coup ousted his branch of the royal family in 1972 and a prominent Saudi columnist has suggested the sheikh could be the start of a Qatari government-in-exile.Ulrichsen cautioned that so far, the Saudi moves appeared to be more needling than anything else.""Given that a formal escalation in terms of sanctions is probably off the table for now, we're seeing this informal pressure on Qatar ... to try and perhaps stir the pot,"" the professor said. ""I think the informal pressure is increasing because of the lack of formal alternative measures they can realistically hope to place on Qatar."""
5a1135a89855b76bf13de106,First sighting of box turtle in Barak,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170806/jsp/northeast/story_165774.jsp,2017-08-06,"Cuora ambofinensfis Guwahati, Aug. 5: A study on the sighting of a turtle species, Cuora ambofinensfis, for the first time in Barak Valley proves that the area is still rich in turtle and tortoise species. The sighting was reported in the current issue of the Journal of Threatened Taxa, by scientists Kulendra Chandra Das of Mizoram University and Abhik Gupta of Assam University. The study was conducted from February 2002 to June 2007. Cuora ambofinensfis, which known by different names such as Malayan box turtle, Southeast Asian box turtle and Ambofina box turtle, is widely found in a variety of habitats in the floodplains of the Brahmaputra. In Barak Valley, the live specimens were recorded near Jirighat in Cachar district and the carapaces (a scientific term for protective shell) of the species were also recorded at Baliapunjee, a village adjoining the Longai river and Longai reserve forest in Karimganj district. The species is semi-aquatic, inhabiting rivers, lakes, marshes, mangrove swamps and rice fields in and around lowland forests. These turtles bask on banks or on logs and breed during early monsoon. They lay one to six eggs which hatch 45-90 days later. The authors say no intensive survey of semi-aquatic turtle fauna of Barak Valley has been conducted, apart from a couple of publications documenting onsite records of soft-shell turtles and tortoise species. The study was conducted with the objective of reporting the distributional status of Cuora ambofinensfis in the valley. ""The present records are from an area between these localities and fill the gap in the distribution of this species in the Northeast and Bangladesh. It is highly likely that this species is rarely seen in Barak Valley. However, the carapace records should be treated as possible sites where these turtles may be found and not as perfect site records. The villagers in this region hang turtle and tortoise carapace in their cowsheds and homes as they ascribe some magic and religious properties to them,"" the report says. The study says the Barak Valley has an affluent pool of turtle and tortoise species. Both aquatic as well as forest-dwelling species are well represented but semi-aquatic species are least represented in this region and are encountered in a diversity of fragmented habitats. The study points out the urgent need for ex situ conservation of this species because of severe threats like fragmentation of habitats, shifting cultivation, illegal hunting or trade. Therefore, it says, rare species like Cuora amboinensis, should be listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. So far, this species is included under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora since 2000 (CITES 2017). This argument is justified by the inclusion of this species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in the threatened ""vulnerable"" category. The authors say the addition of this species in Schedule I of the wildlife act would aid in its conservation."

Nabakishwar Singh has moved the Manipur anti-corruption cell for tracing missing rice, which was meant for distribution to the public under the National Food Security Act. Singh reported to the anti-corruption cell on Thursday that six months' rice quota for distribution to the beneficiaries in Lilong Assembly constituency was missing. The rice was not distributed to the public. The deputy commissioner wrote to the cell, which is directly monitored by chief minister N. Biren Singh, seeking a directive to the consumer affairs, food and public distribution department to trace the missing rice and also hold a departmental inquiry against Thoubal district supply officer P. Virdhwaja and civil supply inspector K. Dhananjoy Singh in connection with the missing rice. Irregularities in implementation of the food security act had rocked the recently concluded Assembly session with Lilong MLA Md Abdul Nasir raising the issue and demanding action against those responsible for the disappearance of the rice. An inquiry conducted by a five-member committee constituted by the deputy commissioner found that the rice quota from October 2016 to March 2017 was missing, the report to the cell said. The inquiry also found that several signatures of fair price agents of the constituency were forged. There were several complaints from various districts of irregularities in distribution of the rice under the act. While some complained about not receiving rice others complained that the fair price shop agents charged more than the Rs 3 per kg of rice, which is fixed by the government. Chief minister N. Biren Singh had mooted during Assembly election this year that an inquiry would be conducted into the alleged irregularities in the implementation of the food security act. ""There were many irregularities during the previous government. After the present BJP-led government came to power there were only a few complaints. We have issued rice for the current month for distribution to the beneficiaries,"" consumer affairs food and public distribution minister Karam Shyam told The Telegraph. He said the government was taking the siphoning of rice meant for the poor very seriously. ""I presided over a meeting of officers of my department on Thursday and discussed ways to streamline procuring, distribution and sale by fair price agents and also discussed fixing responsibility for leakage of rice,"" the minister said. ""We will work out a plan or mechanism to plug the holes and ensure that the rice reaches the real beneficiaries,"" Shyam said."

A resident of Denai village in Daspur-II block, Prasun Bera, said: ""Relief material is being distributed only in areas close to the panchayat offices. But food and other relief are not reaching those in remote areas and in places under eight to 10 feet of water for the past two weeks.

Tapan Dutta, the zilla parishad functionary in charge of food supplies, said: ""In many cases, it has been found that flood victims living close to relief camps are turning up again and again to collect relief to build up on stocks. In the process, those living in remote areas are suffering because they can't turn up at the camps frequently.""

Delhi Public School Bangalore North had on August 3 sent out circulars to guardians of Class I students informing them about Chinese New Year celebrations on August 11. The guardians had been asked to send decorative materials and Chinese food with their children, who were to be dressed in Chinese attire for the symbolic commemoration of the Chinese New Year that falls in January or February every year. However, several guardians objected to the idea, citing the border stand-off between India and China over the disputed Doklam plateau at the two countries' tri-junction with Bhutan. They brought the school's plans to the notice of the district education department. Caught in the unusual situation of having to intervene in a school programme, Bangalore North education officer Narayan Das contacted the DPS principal and requested her to scrap the event in view of the prevailing ""anti-China sentiments"". ""Under the circumstances, we thought it best to cancel the event. The school was cooperative and immediately called it off,"" Das told The Telegraph today. According to the school circular, the guardians were supposed to send glitter tubes, decorative stickers, A4 size red sheets of paper and glue sticks for their children to prepare decorative items. As part of the ""food festival"" on the day, the guardians had been asked to send Chinese food items such as noodles, momos and fried rice in the children's lunchboxes. The children were also required to attend school in traditional Chinese attire or at least red-coloured clothes. ""The school conducts similar programmes to mark the new years of other countries such as France and Germany as part of its activities for students. But we suggested that the Chinese event be scrapped,"" Das said. School principal Manju Balasubramaniam could not be contacted as she was busy in meetings. A school official confirmed that the event had been cancelled and the children informed. ""It was part of extra-curricular activities where children are introduced to the culture, dresses, food and other aspects of other countries. We had planned to celebrate the Chinese New Year months before the Doklam stand-off began,"" said the official, who cannot be named as she is not authorised to speak to the media."

Ambur Biryani from the erstwhile princely state of Arcot is one of them. The biryani is especially in demand in the northern part of Tamil Nadu as well as parts of Karnataka around Bangalore city.Ambur, a small town in Tamil Nadu known for its leather industry, is located on the way to Bengaluru from Chennai close to Karnataka border. It is said that about a century ago, Hasin Baig, a bawarchi from the kitchens of the Nawab of Arcot relocated to his hometown Ambur and started preparing biryani there with a similar recipe as the Arcot biryani.While the biryani at Nawabs court was prepared in basmati rice, Baig started making his Ambur version for the masses using cheaper seeraga samba rice. The biryani (spelt briyani in Ambur) which was initially sold on bicycles, became so popular that a small shop was set up and people from even outside the town started to flock to this shop. Over the years, this recipe, now known as Ambur Biryani, has spread to parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where it is hugely in demand. Bangalore and Chennai, for example, has many eateries offering this version of biryani.Apart from the variety of rice (seeraga samba rice is known as chitti mutyalu in Telangana), there are other differences Ambur Biryani has with its Hyderabadi counterpart. The meat here is cooked before putting the biryani on dum, and tomatoes are used frequently in the recipe. Also, in the biryani more of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and green chillies are used yet it is not as spicy as the Hyderabadi variety. Moderate use of tomatoes, coriander and mint leaves gives a uniform colour to the dish.While preparing Ambur biryani, the meat is first pre-cooked with onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, curd and whole spices. Separately cooked rice and this meat are then layered in a degh and topped with ghee before putting on dum. In some places the rice and meat are mixed together instead of layering. The biryani is preferably eaten with an eggplant gravy known as kathirikal pachidi.In Hyderabad, a small place in the bylanes of Madhura Nagar near Ameerpet is perhaps the only place serving Ambur Biryani. Pondy Parottas is a 12-seater eatery run by Raja Subbiah and Judith May, a couple from Pondicherry. Known for its Tamilian and Sri Lankan parottas, the outlet introduced Ambur Biryani about a year back and since then there has been no looking back. According to Raja, Ambur Biryani has become the fastest selling dish drawing a steady flow of local customers. He offers variants of this biryani in chicken, mutton kheema, and prawns. Enthused by the response he is planning to start his second outlet in Hi-Tec City soon. Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

Talking to reporters, PCC president Ripun Bora said floods had affected the state more this year as the state government did not have a contingency plan. ""The state government could not alert the people because it did not have any idea how much water will be released from the dams in Arunachal Pradesh and Bhutan. This wreaked havoc in the districts. As the state government did not keep food stock, the district administrations had to buy food from local vendors, causing a delay in sending flood relief,"" Bora said. ""In such circumstances, the state government should have stock of food for two to three months. But a cabinet minister has said the state has food for 10 days only. What will happen after that?"" he asked. Ripun Bora addresses a news conference in Guwahati on Sunday. Reuters and UB Photos pictures Bora said during the Congress rule, the district administration officials would purchase relief materials for floods following a verbal order of the chief secretary. The amount spent was reimbursed later. ""But now the officials are afraid of doing that. They wait for the government's written orders, which was also another cause for the delay,"" he said. According to Bora, baby food, tarpaulin, fodder and kerosene are also parts of relief items. ""But during our visits to the flood-affected people, we found that these materials were not distributed,"" he said. Bora added that 7,000 schools in Assam had been damaged in floods and 1,700 have been turned into relief camps. He demanded the state government announce a special package for those schools. The PCC also demanded a waiver of the agricultural loans taken by the flood-hit farmers. ""The farmers were the worst hit in the floods. Their crops were destroyed. So, we demand the state government waive their loans,"" Bora said. He also criticised the state government for its ""failure"" to repair the embankments. ""Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal had earlier ordered that all the embankments should be repaired by April 30. But it did not release funds and many contractors got work order only in May,"" he said. Bora said post-flood diseases were another concern and the state government should now prepare itself to deal with the diseases. The PCC chief said people are also facing a steep price rise of food items and the state government had failed to take any measures. Bora said the PCC had formed four groups to assist flood-affected people."

Talking to the media here, Bora said his department had estimated that the production of rice this year would be nearly 62 lakh metric tonnes. But the second wave of floods has affected a large area of paddy fields, damaging saplings. After the first wave of floods on July 31, Bora had said the production of rice in the state would not be affected if there was no second wave of floods. On July 31, Bora had said that 2,89,032 hectares were affected by the first wave of floods. Today, however, he said the affected area in the first wave was 2.08 lakh hectares and in the second wave it was one lakh hectares. He had said 6,293 hectares of agricultural land in the state have been damaged by siltation in six districts in the first wave of floods. However, an assessment report of the department stated that as on August 1, about 6,615 hectares in eight districts of the state have been affected by siltation. As on August 1, siltation has affected 295 hectares of land in Barpeta district, 614 hectares in Biswanath, 32 hectares in Majuli, 3,565 hectares in Lakhimpur, 79 hectares in Golaghat, three hectares in Darang, 2,000 hectares in Dhemaji and 27 hectares in Jorhat. The amount of siltation is more than 70 centimetres in all the affected land in Lakhimpur and Dhemaji districts. The minister said the agriculture department is planning to reclaim the siltation-affected land through Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. He said 6.29 lakh farmer families have been hit in both waves of floods in the state. Bora said the agriculture department thinks that after the second wave of floods the farmers will not benefit from kharif crops. ""We have to give emphasis on rabi crops and Bodo paddy cultivation,"" he said, adding that the agriculture department is preparing a list of the affected families and their estimated loss in floods. He said the families would be given compensation through direct benefit transfer from the disaster management funds of the state government. Bora said till July 31 altogether 45,000 farmers took the benefit of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana covering 29,400 hectares of agricultural land. ""But we are not sure how many of the flood-affected families have the insurance,"" he said. Bora said the agriculture department has received 17,757 applications under the Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana through which it has set a target to distribute tractors at 70 per cent subsidy to self-help groups."
5a113cdf9855b76bf13de6d1,Soil map push for better yield,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170821/jsp/bihar/story_168223.jsp,2017-08-21,"Patna, Aug. 20: A soil fertility map depicting the deficiencies in soils found in different arable lands of the state will soon be available. The map, expected to be ready for use before March 2018, aims at checking the unnecessary use of fertilisers and enhancing the productivity of land in a sustainable manner. The information gathered can also give the state a fair idea about its fertiliser needs in advance based on which the government can place demands before the Centre. According to the latest productivity data (from 2015-16), Bihar has a productivity of 21.04 quintals of rice per hectare against the national average of 24.04. Similarly, wheat productivity is 22.44 quintals per hectare against the national average of 30.93. Bihar's productivity in maize, pulses and oilseeds is better than the national average. Bihar's 56.38 lakh hectares of arable land has been divided into 14,11,875 grids from where soil samples had to be collected for necessary tests in labs to find out the kind of soil deficiency of a given grid. To ensure the authenticity of the samples, the staff had been given GPS equipment to provide the coordinates of the grids and also some brief details about the farmers who had their holdings in a given grid. Based on the information collected from the field, a mobile app ""Mitti Bihar"" has been developed. It has details of the information gathered from the ground. After the soil test is conducted, information regarding various kinds of deficiencies in a given grid is also mentioned. ""As the variability of soil property was more in irrigated land as compared to those not irrigated, it was decided that the grid size would be 2.5 hectares for irrigated fields and 10 hectare for the rest,"" a senior agriculture official, closely associated with the preparation of the fertility map, told The Telegraph. At present, 30.64 lakh hectares of total arable land has irrigation facility while the remaining area (25.74 lakh hectare) has none. The official pointed out that first it was thought to collect samples according to holdings of the land. But later, based on field experiences about the changing nature of soil in terms of various deficiencies, the grid size for irrigated and un-irrigated land was fixed. ""Sample collection from different grids is done and 11,65,222 samples have reached various labs and testing of 1,16,300 samples have been done. Based on these tests, 52,59,356 soil health cards have been made,"" said the official. At a recent review, agriculture minister Prem Kumar directed the officials to complete the soil testing work as soon as possible and issue the soil health cards to the remaining farmers. He has directed experts to revisit farmlands where soil health cards had been issued, based on which suggestions would be given to farmers about use of fertilisers. The department will re-visit at least 6,54,000 grids for assessment this fiscal. #""The department will continue to pursue farmers to use fertilisers according to the unique need of their field and we hope that over a period of time the message will percolate,"" said another senior official. Chandradev Yadav of Banjariya in East Champaran district said: ""The government needs to train its field staff who are supposed to advise us. They don't make themselves available easily, forcing farmers to continue with the kind of fertiliser use as has been going on for years."""

However, one of the most popular dishes from interiors of Telangana, which is a utility dish for many occasions is sarvapindi. The snack which is said to have originated from Bollepally village in Warangal and has travelled from the rural areas of the state to the towns. It is now becoming popular even in Hyderabad. A few outlets prepare and sell this dish.The name sarvapindi comes from the words sarva which means a round shaped deep vessel usually used for milk and pindi which stands for a snack. It is a rice flour based round pancake which is cooked inside a bowl.The snack is also called Ginne Appa, Tapala Chekka or Ganju Pindi in different districts of the state. A favourite in Telangana for breakfast or evening snacks, Sarvapindi is also carried for long journeys like pilgrimages as the staple food. It is eaten with pickles or curd.To make sarvapindi, ground rice flour is mixed with ingredients like soaked chana dal, coarsely ground peanuts, sesame seeds, spring onions, curry leaves, salt and green chillies and an appropriate amount of water to make a dough and this is spread as a round layer inside the bowl like a pancake. Holes are made with fingers at a few places on this to allow air to escape and drops of oil or ghee poured on top to permeate into the snack. This is then slow cooked in steam till it becomes crispy on top. The snack is best consumed hot, though it has a long shelf-life. The chana dal and peanuts provide some crunchiness.There are little variations in the recipe based on the seasons and regions. Millets, coriander leaves, garlic, ajwain and fennel seeds are some of the ingredients which are sometimes used. Though sarvapindi has become comparatively more popular in Hyderabad since the new state was born, there are not too many places where it is sold. According to the food lovers from Telangana, the taste of the dish depends entirely on if the steps of preparation are followed diligently. At some places, to avoid the slow cooking time, people fry the sarvapindi, and as a result, the pancake becomes oily and the taste is lost.Sridevi Swagruha Foods atHimayatnagar is one of the places which is known for good quality sarvapindi. Jagan Mohan, owner of the outlet says that there is quite a bit of demand for this snack, and he gets orders for bulk quantities too. Each piece of this snack costs `30. He adds that if no onions are added to the snack, it stays good for consumption even after a fortnight.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."

Baraigram, which falls under South Karimganj constituency in Assam's Karimganj district, is around 24km from Karimganj and 80km from here. Jayjul Hussain, Abdul Wahid, Liton Malakar and other members of the KYC alleged there has been largescale anomalies in the distribution of rice and kerosene under the food security act. They alleged that the dealers and workers of the Baraigram Samabay Samiti has been depriving the beneficiaries by giving them lesser amount of rice and kerosene than what is supposed to be given. According to government guidelines, every beneficiary should get 5kg of rice and 2.9 litres of kerosene each month, but the dealers are providing 4.5 kg of rice and around 2.5 litres of kerosene. Many get even less than that. They said according to food security act, the price of 1kg of rice is Rs 3, but the dealers are charging Rs 4 per kg from the beneficiaries and alleged that the dealers of the Samiti, through such unethical practices, are pocketing a lot of money. They said one of the beneficiaries, Abdus Sahid, a resident of Sherpur, a village in Karimganj district, had not received rice, kerosene till date. ""Not just Abdus, but many are there who are having cards, but are not getting anything. As such, the dealers/workers of the society are misappropriating the items and a probe would expose the ongoing anomalies,"" they said. They alleged that actual beneficiaries were deprived and food security cards were instead provided to rich people (businessmen, government employees). They also alleged that a large number of hawkers are linked with the syndicate. The members threatened to launch severe protests if the matter is not probed soon. The Samiti covers three gaon panchayats - Baraigram, Bandarkona and Elaspur - and two wards in Moina gaon panchayat. According to September, 2016, data, a total of 7,900 Primary House Hold (PHH) cards and 749 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) cards are listed with the society. Abdur Rab, in-charge of the Baraigram Samabay Samiti, told The Telegraph that all the allegations are ""baseless"" and questioned why none of the beneficiaries had complained about any such anomaly. He, however, alleged Jayjul had demanded money (gunda tax) from the society and as he could not get what he wanted, he is spreading rumours about the society and its workers. South Karimganj MLA Aziz Ahmed Khan today said necessary steps would be taken so that the issues could be solved as soon as possible. Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar said the matter would be investigated and necessary steps would be taken regarding the matter."

(AFP)Guwahati, Aug. 27: The flood situation in Assam improved substantially today though over 1.6 lakh people are still suffering across six districts, the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) said in its daily flood report. Over 2.03 lakh people were affected by the latest wave of floods in Dhemaji, Barpeta, Chirang, Morigaon, Nagaon and Karbi Anglong districts till yesterday. According to the report, Morigaon is the worst affected with more than 92,000 people affected, followed by Nagaon, where 54,500 have been hit by the deluge. Currently, 343 villages are under water and nearly 25,000 hectares of cropland inundated, the report said. The authorities are running 91 relief camps and distribution centres in four districts, where 24,557 people have taken shelter. The third wave of floods has so far claimed the lives of 73 people. The total number of persons killed in flood-related incidents in the state is 157 this year, including eight in Guwahati. The Dhansiri at Numaligarh in Golaghat district, the Katakhal at Matizuri in Hailakandi district and the Kushiara in Karimganj town are flowing above the danger level.

Track repair The Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) officials yesterday said it would take at least another six days to resume normal train movement between parts of north Bengal, the Northeast and rest of the country. ""Restoration work of the track is going on in two sections between Sudhani and Telta stations and between Kumedpur and Khurial stations. Considering the progress of work, it seems that only one track will be ready in both these stretches. It would take some more days to restore the second track,"" an official said. Sudhani, Telta and Khurial are located in Bihar while Kumedpur is in Bengal's Malda district. All these stations come under the principal route that connects major parts of north Bengal and the Northeast, with Calcutta and rest of the country. Between Sudhani and Telta, the Mahananda had swept away soil from under the tracks near a rail bridge and left a stretch of 60 metres of both tracks hanging on August 11. On the other hand, a bridge between Khurial and Kumedpur was also washed away by the Mahananda. In both sites, railways have taken up repair and restoration. In the damaged site between Sudhani and Telta, the army is also helping the railways. ""If at least one track is restored, we will only run goods trains, that too, in limited numbers, on Tuesday from 4pm onwards. If the track is found fit to resume train operations, there is a plan to start running passenger trains from September 1 morning,"" an NFR source said. Earlier, the railways had cancelled trains, which run from parts of north Bengal and the Northeast to different destinations of the country, till Monday. On Friday, a fresh notice was issued which mentions that as many as 70 long-distance trains have been cancelled till September 31. Once the track is ready NFR authorities are planning to resume services of some trains immediately, including the Rajdhani Express, Awadh Assam Express, North East Express, Kamrup Express and Uttarbanga Express. Ever since train connectivity was suspended, people travelling to north Bengal districts like Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar and the Northeast, or vice-versa, have to arrive in Malda or Raiganj in Bengal, till which trains are running. From there, they need to take buses to reach Dalkhola, from where special trains are running to Guwahati and Dibrugarh. Otherwise, they need to travel to Siliguri by road and then take buses to move in onward direction."

Yingluck, 50, whose family has dominated Thai politics for more than 15 years, failed to show up at court for judgment in a case centred on the multi-billion dollar losses incurred by a rice subsidy scheme for farmers. Overthrown in 2014, Yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. Her former commerce minister was jailed in a related case for 42 years today. ""She has definitely left Thailand,"" said one source, who is also a member of her Puea Thai Party. The sources did not say where she had gone. Yingluck's brother, Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile to escape a corruption conviction that he said was aimed at demolishing the populist movement he founded. The struggle between that movement and a Bangkok-centred royalist and pro-military elite has been at the heart of years of turmoil in Thailand. The verdict against Yingluck could have reignited tension, though the army has largely snuffed out open opposition. After Yingluck failed to show up, the Supreme Court issued an arrest warrant against her and rescheduled the verdict to September 27. It said it did not believe her excuse that she could not attend the court hearing because of an ear problem. ""It is possible that she has fled already,"" deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan said. He later said police were probing reports that she had left via Koh Chang, an island close to the Cambodia border."

The new modus operandi of the alleged extortionists came to the fore when the Bihta police in Patna rural seized a handwritten pamphlet demanding Rs 10 lakh as extortion money from two businessmen brothers, who owned a rice mill on Amhara-Bikram road. The station house officer (SHO) of Bihta police station, Raghav Dayal, said today that the leaflet allegedly issued by Yuva Sangathan had been seized and an FIR lodged against unknown persons. The leaflet was pasted on the boundary wall of the rice mill of Raju Singh and Aatish Singh, both residents of Amhara village in Patna district. The two brothers - Raju and Aatish - were taken aback over the threat issued to them in the extortion letter. ""If you want to do business in Bihta, then you have to pay Rs 10 lakh as extortion money to us. If the demand is not met, be ready to face the consequences,"" the threat letter seized by the police, said. SHO Dayal said the police have taken the threat to the lives of the two brothers, who also owned a brick kiln near the rice mill, seriously and launched raids to nab the culprits. ""We are on the job and the accused will be put behind bars soon,"" he told The Telegraph over phone today. The SHO admitted that such an extortion demand had been made for the first time in rural parts of the district. ""This is the modus operandi of the Maoists and not the extortionists. We are investigating the case from different angles,"" he added. Raju reportedly told the police that he had not received any threat to his life or demand for extortion money earlier. When contacted, Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj said the Bihta SHO had been asked to look into the matter and take proper action against the accused. ""Prima facie it appears that somebody has committed a mischief by pasting a leaflet on the boundary wall of the rice mill. But the police will investigate the matter,"" he said. The SSP, however, denied the involvement of any Naxalite outfit in the incident. ""The Maoists don't hesitate in disclosing their identity as far demand of levy (read extortion) is concerned. But this is not the case with Bihta rice mill owners,"" Maharaaj said."
5a11435c9855b76bf13debd3,RJD supporter base profile has changed,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170828/jsp/bihar/story_169431.jsp,2017-08-28,"The size at today's RJD rally might be debatable, but one thing that has undeniably changed is the profile of the participants. RJD chief Lalu Prasad has been organising the largest rallies ever at Gandhi Maidan right from the early 1990s. Back then, the participants consisted of the poor and downtrodden sections of society, who came wearing tattered clothes and were even barefoot. But on Sunday, a sizeable section of participants came in jeans and were seen clicking selfies. The youth had come to hear Tejashwi Prasad and Tej Pratap Yadav, who, they feel, have the potential to challenge the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The paradigm shift in those who participated in Sunday's RJD rally points to the social and economic churn that has taken place since 1990 when Lalu first came to power. The forces of social justice have retained power since then. One cannot take away from Lalu the credit of giving voice to the voiceless, downtrodden, poor and backward classes in the state. Sunday's rally saw major participation by youngsters, mostly students and unemployed youth. Abul Farah Shazli, a Simri-Bakhtiarpur (Saharsa) boy pursuing post-graduation from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), had come all the way from Aligarh along with 50 friends from Aligarh and Delhi. He even lost his wallet in the rally but not his enthusiasm. ""We all have roots in Bihar and came to support Lalu ji and his call to protect the country's secular fabric,"" Shazli said. He conceded the RJD is technologically poorer in reaching out to its support base. Masoom Nabi, a Jamia Millia Islamia graduate and son of a farmer in Motihari, was enthusiastic about the rally. ""The youth are feeling cheated, as unemployment is high,"" Masoom said. ""Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised 2 crore jobs every year, but the situation in the country is such that people are, instead, losing jobs."" Guddu Siddiqui, an MBBS student from Patna Medical College and Hospital, came to hear Tejashwi and Tej Pratap. Siddiqui said: ""The RJD was considered a party of the poor and downtrodden, mainly in rural areas, but with Tejashwi and Tej Pratap at the helm now, the party's support base is changing. Many youth students and working professionals are joining the party."" Anil Yadav, who is preparing for competitive exams at Bazar Samiti, claimed Lalu and his family members are not corrupt and the CBI raids were a pressure tactic by the Narendra Modi government. ""We fail to understand how only a few politicians (like Lalu and family) have amassed wealth,"" Anil said. ""Why isn't the CBI raiding properties of BJP leaders?"" While on the one hand there was active and huge participation by youths, there were many coming to attend the rally with just puffed rice and gram. Davendra Prasad Kushwaha, who had come from Kaimur, was spotted having puffed rice and gram with his friends as no food arrangement had been made for them. Kushwaha said: ""We have brought puffed rice and gram from our homes. The RJD is a party of the poor, who have limited resources."" In 2010, when the RJD began losing its grip over its caste combination, there were apprehentions in the RJD that Lalu's appeal had weakened - particularly among the younger generation. During the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, a number of youths belonging to Lalu's core voter base, the Yadavs, preferred to back the BJP. But Tejashwi's entry into politics appears to have rejuvenated the party's youth base, apart from the more educated and more prosperous sections of his voters."

Picture by UB Photos Shillong, Aug. 24: A march by the Hyniewtrep Youths' Council (HYC) activists to make ""the powers that be"" heard and consider their series of demands, culminated here today after walking 93km from Nongstoi, the district headquarters of the West Khasi Hills. Around 70 HYC activists took out a march on Tuesday from Nongstoi to the state capital Shillong, highlighting various issues pertaining to Nongstoi town and West Khasi Hills district, especially lack of development in the district. The HYC activists took about 27 hours to complete the 93km march all along the national highway (Shillong-Nongstoi-Tura Road) and halted on the way for two nights at Mairang and Mawngap. From Mawngap, they resumed the march this morning which culminated at a parking lot near additional secretariat here at 12.30pm. However, a member Oliver Twist Marngar fell ill on the way and was admitted to the civil hospital here. Raising slogans against the Meghalaya government for neglecting the West Khasi Hills district, the activists also asked the government to implement strong laws that can safeguard indigenous Hyniewtrep people and implement laws like the inner-line permit (ILP) to check influx as they walked on the national highway. The organisation expressed concern over the failure to resolve the inter-state boundary dispute with Assam. Created on October 28, 1976, West Khasi Hills district, which will soon complete 41 years, is still one of the backward districts in the state. The HYC Nongstoi circle president, Lumlang Kharsyiemlieh, said Nongstoi and West Khasi Hills district, despite 41 years of existence, there were no proper roads that would connect the district with other districts except a two-lane highway connecting the Garo hills region. Reading out from a memorandum submitted to the chief minister's office here, Kharsyiemlieh said the district has been neglected despite having a number of tourist spots that would boost tourism. Stating that the district has no other colleges that can cater to students' needs except Nongstoi College, the HYC demanded a government college to be named after longest-serving legislator and parliamentarian, late Hoping Stone Lyngdoh, to keep his legacy alive for generations to come. The other demands include creating sport infrastructure, multi-water-harvesting schemes for farmers cultivating rice and other crops, cold storage facility, training for farmers, creating healthcare facilities and a blood bank unit. The HYC said on the 41st year of district-hood, the government departments in the West Khasi Hills are stilling functioning from rented houses, which showed the state government's casual attitude. The district did not have a proper hall or auditorium for hosting events. Commenting on the mining issue, Kharsyiemlieh opposed the state government's move to allow Meghalaya Mineral Development Corporation Ltd to take over coal mining in the state."

The firm, Lauhitya Livelihood Pvt Limited, which sells organically grown vegetables, fruits and other food items at two stalls here under the brand name Organic Majuli, provided training to farmers in Dimoria, Bahtola and Amguri villages, following which the farmers started selling their products here. ""We have six farms on a 30-bigha land, including ponds and dairy farms. The farmers have been provided training on how to prepare organic manure using cow dung and without the use of any pesticides. Since their products have got a good response at two of our stalls at Six Mile and Amigaon here, we have decided to offer them an online platform to reach out to more customers. We have got more than 30 orders online from the time we launched the online sales facility on Thursday,"" Lauhitya Livelihood managing director Manash Chaliha told The Telegraph today. Chaliha, a BTech, worked with the World Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers for six years before starting the firm in 2014. The firm aspires to empower farmers in rural Assam with nutritional needs and income security, besides creating an eco-system to promote social entrepreneurship. The core team members of the firm include young boys and girls who have done their MBA and MCA and worked in various companies before launching the start-up. The firm has also provided training to more than 1,000 farmers in different parts of Assam and Meghalaya on organic farming practices. ""Our initiative is on the line of Centre's plan to make the Northeast the organic hub of the country,"" Chaliha said. Spices like black pepper, ginger, turmeric and dry chilli, dairy products like fresh milk and paneer, black rice, joha (scented) rice, bao (brown) rice and fruits and vegetables are being sold online and delivered home in the city. The start-up is also offering customers an opportunity to visit their firms in Khetri to see the organic products and buy from the field. ""People can see with their own eyes how vegetables are grown organically and thus remove their suspicion about whether the food items they are buying from us are fully organic or not. They can catch fish in the ponds, visit the dairy farms and the vegetable fields. Children will come to know how our farmers grow their produce while a family can have an outing. They can also have food prepared by women of the Tiwa community who live there,"" Chaliha said."

The race to produce more has killed age-old agricultural practices and traditions. In a bid to reacquaint the present generation with their cultural roots, a London-based Malayali restaurateur Das Sreedharan recently organised a two-day harvest festival at his 25-acre retreat, Rasa Gurukal, on the banks of Chalakudy river.A large group comprising foreigners and guests from various parts of the country, including State Agriculture Minister V S Sunilkumar, and other dignitaries took part. Several of them sang songs as they harvested a rare variety of rakthashali rice in the traditional way. Eventually, a traditional Kerala feast was prepared using organically grown ingredients.During the festival, the participants sang thuyilunarthu pattu and played various games associated with the harvest. The aim was to take the younger generation to the kitchen where we can see our mothers in their full glory.Das said the most vibrant place in a house is the kitchen. However, the vegetables that we get from the market today are polluted with chemicals and they have made our kitchen impure. This, in turn, has affected our quality of life, Das said. According to Das, a person can love nature only if he or she loves and respects his or her mother.Das also has been conducting a free course for chefs on traditional Kerala cuisine for the underprivileged. He even gives a stipend and jobs in his eateries if the students so wish. We can never get back to the old way of life since science has propelled man to regions beyond our imagination. But we can certainly continue with some traditions, like responsible food production, which will provide a new aesthetic and philosophy to life. The festival will be an annual event, said Das."

With the National Centre For Earth Science Studies (NCESS) holding an assessment of the ecologically sensitive area, a report related to the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) will soon be submitted to the state government.S Sarma MLA, who is coordinating the project in his constituency, said the state government will convene a meeting of various stakeholders in the second week of September to review the status of the project.The meeting will discuss steps to take the project forward based on the recommendations of the expert committee report, he said.NCESS scientist K K Ramachandran, who supervised the CRZ mapping, said the mapping of 10 select locations in the area is over and the process of preparing the maps is in progress.We have sought two weeks additional time to submit the report which will have measures to conserve ecologically fragile zones and to ensure the environment is protected when development works are carried out, he said.According to Sarma, the project conceived in three phases will change the face of the area. Infrastructure development works will be given thrust as it is very important in connecting the sparsely scattered regions. Construction of retaining walls, reinforcement of existing bunds, construction of sheds to mount engines and motors, sluice construction, dredging and removal of sediments accumulated in and around 10 rivers are the main works in the first phase.In the second phase, drying units for paddy cultivation, rice seedling procurement warehouses and rice mills will be set up, apart from increasing farm subsidies and ensuring high-quality disease resistant fingerlings for fish cultivation. The third phase will see the branding and marketing of produce from Organic Vypeen in the country and abroad.The project will also increase the Pokkali acreage under cultivation in Vypeen and nearby areas considerably, if implemented.The project has received a sum of Rs 63.55 crore, including Rs 6.96 crore from the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana scheme, Sarma said.According to the Agriculture Department, there have been some issues related to removing sediments accumulated in the water bodies in Vypeen, which even led to a court litigation. Following this, the Kerala Land Development Board held a meeting with the Ernakulam District Collector with regard to the lifting of a High Court stay order in connection with the issue. But the stay order can be lifted only with the approval of the CRZ or based on the expert report of NCESS. And the state government has provided a sum of Rs 12 lakh to NCESS to carry out a status report related to the project site. Once the status report is available, the department will take steps to hold an environment impact study and secure clearance from the Pollution Control Board.Pokkali Samrakshana Samithi general convener Francis Kalathungal said, though the project is expected to give a facelift to organic cultivation in the area, the project will be more beneficial to tourism and fish cultivation. If implemented in letter and spirit, it will be beneficial for farming in the region, he said.Infrastructure developmentInfrastructure development works will be given thrust as it is very important in connecting the sparsely scattered regions in the island.

And there is no Onam which is complete without it. So says Santhosh Thirumeni, of Thirumenis caterers, who has introduced his own line of Kappa (tapioca) payasams at the Ernakulathappan ground in Kochi this season.It is important that one selects the right tapioca if the payasam has to be a good one. Especially, avoid those tapiocas which have absorbed large quantities of water, said Santhosh.This time, he is also selling the apple payasam variety, made from fresh apples. We buy apples in bulk and grind them in the mixie. The essence is then added to jaggery, with helpful spoons of sugar, he said.Paalada payasamHowever, despite the city folks affinity to variety, the paalada still remains No. 1 in Kochi. People like sugar-sweetened delicacies better than jaggery dishes. It is something they have been accustomed and what caterers have been providing for a long time, said R Viswanath, of Kailasam caterers in Irumpanam, Kochi.And unlike what most families are accustomed to, the Paalada is cooked for five-and-a-half hours at a stretch. Many families cook paalada at their homes, but they are all made from instant cook mixes which can be prepared in half an hour. However, we prepare the ada from rice and wheat which is washed and then cut into small pieces. It is then dried in banana leaves, which is later put into the milk and cooked for five and a half hours, said Santhosh.However, none of the payasam sellers has stuck to the paalada despite its demand. There is a niche group of people who always come asking for the Amballapuzha paalpayasam, which is why we are selling it this time. I still remember how there was a time when this payasam was made from the fresh milk of cows in temples, immediately after it was milked. The speciality of the paalpayasam is that it is cooked in milk alone, said Viswanath.Towards central and southern Kerala, the peoples preference for items with Kadala parippu and cashew nut varieties are stronger. This is why people in Thiruvananthapuram would prefer an adapradhaman, which has a rich helping of cashew nuts and resins. Also, semiya paalpayasam has many takers, said Vishwanath.In many places in Kerala, jackfruit payasam is a variety many are experimenting with. Caterer H M Rafeeque says he is introducing the jaggery and sugar-coconut milk mixes for his jackfruit payasam. The payasam is made using both koozha and varikka jackfruits, he said.Pazzham payasamsKrishna Iyer of Akshaya caterers, Tripunithura said they stick to selling parippu, paalada, pazham and gothambu payasams alone for Onam. I think people equate the paalada with icecream, says Krishna, with a laugh. For the pazham payasam, Nethran bananas are used. We buy at least 1 and a half tonnes of 15-20 day ripe bananas, if the payasams have to taste sweet, he said.Nimy Sunil Kumar, a culinary expert, said that despite the many varieties that have been introduced over the decades, the latest being dates, pumpkins and carrots, nothing can beat the traditional savour of the payasams made exclusively from rice. The payasams (made with jaggery and only rice) were offerings made to the gods in the past. Today, it is the only sweet Malayalees are famous for, she said."

There is no harm in having a non-vegetarian meal. But, ideally, portion control must be exercised; have salads and soup before the main course. It will be better to avoid red meat; chicken or fish are healthier options.""Of course, get more exercise. ""Those who exercise for 40 minutes can add another 10 during this time, she said. And it is all a matter of balance.Even those with diabetes can have sweet dishes if they cut down on other meals. If a cup of payasam is irresistible, have it. But dont forget to skip rice in the next meal to compensate for this, said Usha.A major concern in most households is about the quality of the ingredients, and according to those in the catering business, it is almost impossible to get vegetables which are free of pesticides.""We cannot source the large quantity of vegetables for our sadya from within the state, so we depend on Tamil Nadu where, because of the large-scale production, they use chemical fertilisers and pesticides,"" said Yadu Pazhayidam, managing partner of Pazhayidam catering and exporters.""We wash vegetables with salt and blanch them in boiling water for a couple of minutes to remove the chemicals."""

Bengal gram is not part of kootu curry, but a rather uncustomary uzhunnu vada is. Coconut in sambar? You ought to be kidding. No, parippu is not a side dish as we start our sadya with that, a generous dash of ghee over the canary-yellow curry. And when it comes to payasam, its the thick-dark ada pradhaman, not the overly-sweet palada.Served on a long plantain leaf, the traditional Onam spread is a delectable assortment of tastes and flavours. However, this festive fare is not the same across the state and in Thiruvananthapuram it comes with a distinctive Travancore twist.In Kochi, however, you see slight variations of the Travancore Onasadhya. For example, if the parippu curry is poured over the rice in the capital, in Ernakulam, it is served as a thick gravy with additional butter. Every district has a variation in their food and this is the same for the Onasadhya. While in Ernakulam, mangoes are used to make avial more sour, in Kottayam and other districts, yogurt is used, said Saji Alex, chef de cuisine, Cassava restaurant, Mariott Hotel.There are varieties also in the way payasams are served. For example, in Thiruvananthapuram, the payasam is served with a bolly and extra sugar, while in Ernakulam, payasam is able to stand on its own.Tamil Nadu influenceThiruvananthapuram has a strong Tamil population and you will see a slight influence of their cuisine in our sadya, says Hari S, a culinary enthusiast. He adds, Its just like the slang, subtle and unique. Though we all speak Malayalam, the local parlance of a place will be different. So our erissery or olan will not be the same you get in Kochi or Kannur, he explains.Vada kootu curry is one exclusive dish you find in the local spread, a signature item in the multi-dish sadya. You will not find vada kootu curry in any other place including the nearest locations like Kollam. Outsiders often think that its made of regular uzhunnu vadas. Actually we prepare small globs using the same batter and add them to this potato-onion masala. The small vadas will suck up all gravy giving you a scrumptious, almost-dry curry, says Swapna Rakesh, culinary expert and blogger.In her blog swadcuisine.com she explains how to prepare all traditional sadya items in the authentic style. She says parippu, one important part of southern sadya, goes missing in many parts of Kerala.For us one pradhaman, ada or pazham, is mandatory and if there is pal payasam it is always served with boli, she adds. Another dish you may across in the local spread is chakka kootu curry, the jackfruit delicacy seen as part of sadya in some areas of Thiruvananthapuram. Its made of half-ripe jackfruit. Its not a typical sadya item, but a dish thats usually made as part of the meals just like aviyal and thoran, says Radhamma, homemaker.Small limes are not used for pickle as this time its naranga curry made of big, wild lemons. We use this variety called vadukanpuli naranga for sadya. Its less tangy and more sour compared to your regular lime pickle. And then, the ingredients we use for avial are also different giving it a special tint and taste, says Jayalakshmi, a caterer.In the capital you cant imagine a sadya that comes with any non-veg accompaniment. In Malabar it may be customary to celebrate Onam with a non-veg sadya. But here its always a pure vegetarian spread and I believe that Onasadya is to be relished that way only, says Geetha, a retired school teacher."

While a few of the traditions and rituals connected to the festival are known to many, others are more rare and obscure, practised only in a particular region. Among such Onam folk arts is the Onatharu- a form of theyyam performed in North Malabar. A folk art form passed through generations in the Vannar community surrounding the area, the theyyam, regarded as a deity or form of Onathappan/Mahabali, is performed by members, moving from house to house, especially on the days of Uthradam and Thiruvonam. Young boys appear as the theyyam dancers, wearing bangles adorned with bells on their hands, says A K Nambiar, secretary, Kerala Folklore Academi. A tradition practised by members of the scheduled cast community, a performance lasts for 10-15 minutes.Pramod Payyannur, member secretary, Bharat Bhavan, who had earlier done a short film on the art form of Theyyam says, There are different kinds of Theyyam, and Onatharu is a rare one which is performed by members of only a particular community.For the performers, the ritual is a tradition that has been passed down through generations. Kunjurama Peruvannar is one such person who is still part of the tradition, having started performing right from the age of four. One person, mostly a young boy, comes dressed up as the Theyyam while there will be two people playing the chenda. There will be another person, usually a lady, who will collect the rice grains or other collectibles received after the performance, he said. According to him, the Onatharu is first performed at a temple shrine or kavu before moving to houses. The ritual is performed at Kannur and Kasaragod. It is also seen at certain parts of Kozhikode, though there it becomes modified into Onapottan.While the form is not known to many outside North Malabar, the performer does not feel the art has become any less important. Connected with the folk art for long, Kunjiraman believes that inspite of being practised only in a few regions, people are becoming aware of such rare rituals, thanks to the media. Yet, he is content with the form being confined to the particular region. This ancient folk art is part of the Vannar communitys heritage, he concludes"

""We should move towards alternative fuel... I am going to do this, whether you like it or not. And I am not going to ask you. I will bulldoze it. For pollution, for imports, my ideas are crystal clear... The government has a crystal-clear policy to reduce imports and curb pollution,"" Gadkari said at SIAM's annual convention here. He held out a veiled warning, saying those supporting the government will have an advantage and those busy ""minting money"" will be in trouble, asking them not to approach the government later on the ground that they have huge stock of vehicles that do not run on alternative fuel. ""Already, we are in the process of a cabinet note where we are going to plan charging stations... It is in the last stage and will be done as early as possible,"" he said, adding that the government will soon bring in a policy on electric vehicles. Cautioning against any dilly-dallying tactics, he said the future was not of petrol and diesel, but of alternative fuel. ""I urge you (car makers) politely to do research. First, when I urged you for electric vehicles, you said battery is costly. I coaxed you to start at least. Now, the batteries cost 40 per cent less. And if you start now, cost will be reduced further on mass production. Teething trouble is everywhere,"" he said. The minister is clear that electric cars, buses, taxis and bikes are the future and India should move forward in this direction. He said imports and pollution were twin problems India faced, with the crude import bill of Rs 7 lakh crore per annum a big drag on the economy. ""Now, the government has decided to start 15 industries for second generation ethanol. Ethanol can easily be produced from agro-based cotton straw, wheat straw, rice straw, and bamboo. Alternative fuel is import substitute, cost effective and pollution free,"" Gadkari said. He promised that the proposed vehicle scrapping policy, stuck because of GST issues, would be sorted out soon. ""Now, the GST Council is formed. We are preparing the note. I am going to the finance minister and after that, we will move this cabinet note. In the GST Council, we will present the note and take the opinion of stakeholders. There are some concessions we are expecting from state governments,"" the minister said. Outgoing SIAM president Vinod Dasari hailed the government's move towards reducing imports and pollution, saying the industry fully supported it. ""Already, we are leapfrogging to BS VI from BS IV within three years, which is the shortest time anywhere in the world. ""However, what we are asking for is consistency in policy, which once formed must not be changed as the auto industry has a long gestation period to introduce new technology,"" he said. ""If the government wants to reduce pollution, then old polluting vehicles must be banned instead of targeting new ones which comply with the latest emission norms of the country,"" Dasari said."

(AFP) Rezu Amtali, Bangladesh, Sept. 3: They stumble down muddy ravines and flooded creeks through miles of hills and jungle in Bangladesh, and thousands more come each day, in a line stretching to the monsoon-darkened horizon. Some are gaunt and spent, already starving and carrying listless and dehydrated babies, with many miles to go before they reach any refugee camp. They are tens of thousands of Rohingya, who arrive bearing accounts of massacre at the hands of the Myanmar security forces and allied mobs that started on August 25, after Rohingya militants staged attacks against government forces. ""There are no more villages left, none at all,"" said Rashed Ahmed, a 46-year-old farmer from a hamlet at Maungdaw Township in Myanmar. ""There are no more people left, either,"" he said. ""It is all gone."" The dying is not yet done. Some of the Rohingya militants have persuaded or coerced men and boys to stay behind and keep up the fight. Tens of thousands of Rohingya are waiting for the Bangladeshi border force to allow them to enter. Still more are moving north from the Rohingya-dominated districts of Rakhine State. Here, in the forests of Rezu Amtali near the border with Myanmar, dozens of Rohingya told stories that were horrifying. Person after person along the trail into Bangladesh told of how the security forces cordoned off Rohingya villages as the fire rained down from helicopters, and then shot and stabbed civilians. Children were not exempt. Mizanur Rahman recalled how on August 25 he had been working in his village in Buthidaung Township in Myanmar, when helicopters roared into the sky above him. ""I had fear in my heart,"" he said. His wife came running out of their house with their son, less than a month old. They escaped to a nearby forest and watched as the choppers' weapons engulfed the village in flames. Rahman's extended family fled the next day. ""Now we are supposed to be safe in Bangladesh, but I do not feel safe,"" Rahman said, as he wandered through a market in the Kutupalong refugee camp. His wife's postpartum bleeding has increased so much that she can no longer walk or produce milk for their infant son. The baby looked skeletal, parched skin pinched at his joints. Other refugees took turns gently touching the baby's feet to check if he was still alive. The refugees flowing into Bangladesh have been predominantly women and kids. What the survivors are fleeing into is no haven. Bangladesh is itself poor, overcrowded and waterlogged, and has been reluctant to take on more displaced Rohingya. Around 4 lakh already lived here before the exodus. A humanitarian disaster is brewing here in a country hard-pressed to feed itself, much less a new influx of refugees that one Bangladeshi official estimated could soon surpass 1 lakh. Volunteers for the World Food Programme in Bangladesh worried that they had not been able to offer rice to the new arrivals at the camps. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

The Food and Civil Supplies Minister says Onam-Bakrid fairs,which functioned for three months during the UDF rule, will be operated only for 10 days.

5a114d669855b76bf13df340,A desi take-off,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/aug/29/a-desi-take-off-1649369.html,2017-08-29,"KOCHI: It has been established countless times that the road to a persons heart is through his or her stomach. And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."

She was running her fingers through the cluster of my hairs.She looked at my face, particularly on my eyes as if she was searching for a source of inspiration.Then she gazed at a distance. I could, even in my childhood innocence, notice the reminiscences of love in her wrinkled face.She gave a long sigh.Onam during my childhood was totally different. In all aspect it was lively; throbbing with serene naturality..She stopped for a while as if to recollect her experience.We girls and boys wandered around the pastures, uplands and causeways in search of flora and fauna.Aneeta ThomasThere was no deforestation. Various varieties of flowers were available. We filled them in our flower bags..I started imagining; standing on her shoes. My memories too flew away like butterflies from flower to flower.The front courtyard of ancient house; leveled- up with cow dung paste. There was a small tent-like podium festooned with flowers and split tender coconut leaves. Three cone shaped idols of Mahabali from Atham (a star in the astral order- ten days prior to Onam) flower dises were displayed with the plucked flower in different colours and patterns, Poovada, a cake prepared with rice powder, jaggery, cardamom and few petals of flowers was offered to Mahabali as part of traditons.Arpoooo. Irrooooo. The boys and girls would chant aloud to greet Maveli.When Mahabali ruled the world people were all alike. They were all bound with a union of fraternity. No stealing, no perfidy, no false-hood. Having bathed in torrential rains for the past few months the nature smiled with bounteous harvest, flowers and vegetables.Came Chingam, the month of Leo. Mahabali, the erstwhile emperor pays him yearly royal visit to Kerala. The three world were ruled by the Devas Dynasty (Suras) and the Dynasty rotationally. Both these communities were in tug-of -war for power.Mahabali, though belong to the latter, his rule was unblemished. No poverty. No famine. No untimely death. No law-and -order situation.If things continue like this thought the Devas there is no hope of our ruling the world. We have to sit permanently on the opposite bench.They put their heads together and devised a plan.Lord Mahavishnu, the chief architect of fancy dress should camouflage into a dwarf and approach Mahabali seeking three feet measurement of land for meditation.Take it, Mahabali, the chivalrous emperor agreed. With one foot Mahavishnu measured the Earth and the underneath world. With the second he conquered the heaven.Where is the place for third step? Mahavishnu asked Mahabali , who humbly show down his centre-head.Before being pushed down to the underneath world Mahabali implored:Lord, kindly permit to revisit my beloved subjects once a year.His request was granted! Thus Onam is the homecoming celebration of King Mahabali.Sports and entertainment of various artifacts are included during Onam. Very sumptuous feast including pudding (payasam) and one or more pairs of new clothing to everyone.Onam lasts for ten days where the old and young participate with equal enthusiasm. The major attraction of Onam celebration are pookalam, vallamkali, onasadhya,onakalikal, pulikali, onapottan, etc.Onam has changed over the years. But the spirit of the season and colour of celebration remains the same. More than a celebration by individual household, it has become a celebration of society as a whole. Once Chingam begins, the festive mood begins and it is a time for Onam contests, onasadhya and pookalam. Even though keralites have changed and modes of Onam celebration have changed, still Onam is a festival that rejuvenates the inborn feelings of keralites."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Sept. 11: Assam water resources minister Keshab Mahanta today told the Assembly that IIT Guwahati will be asked to study the causes behind yesterday's flash floods in Sonitpur district in central Assam. Raising the issue during zero hour, BJP MLA Padma Hazarika said the water level of the Jarasar river rose suddenly within half an hour late on Saturday and inundated Rangapara, Balipara and Chariduar areas and also swept away a youth, identified as Diganta Das, at Balipara. His body was retrieved today. Hazarika said the government should constitute an expert committee to study whether the flash floods was caused by heavy rainfall in adjoining hills of Arunachal Pradesh or because of possible damage or breach in any sluice gate or agricultural bund in Arunachal Pradesh. The water resources minister agreed that people were caught unawares by sudden surge of the Jarasar, which originates in Arunachal Pradesh. Mahanta, who visited the affected areas yesterday, said IIT Guwahati will study what caused the flash floods in Sonitpur district, which affected 41,500 people in more than 35 villages. Floodwaters also submerged a stretch of National Highway 15 at Balipara town. He said the district administration, state disaster response force and national disaster response force are engaged in rescue operations and relief distribution. NDRF personnel evacuated 753 marooned people to safer places at Chariduar revenue circle in Sonitpur district yesterday. ""An electrical sub-station was damaged and steps are being taken to repair it,"" he said. Floodwaters started receding from the Chariduar revenue circle today but more than 17 villages are still under water. Earlier during question hour today, minister of state for revenue and disaster management Pallab Lochan Das said according to the Assam Disaster Management Authority report, 158 people died and 220 domestic animals and 228 poultry have been killed in the three waves of floods this year till September 5. Replying to a question by Bodoland Peoples Front legislator Thaneswar Basumatary, Das said 956 relief camps were opened where 4.52 lakh flood-hit people took shelter. The minister said rice, dal, potato, salt, mustard oil, puffed rice ( muri), rice flakes (chira) and baby food were distributed among the flood-affected people. As of today, apart from Sonitpur, areas in six other districts - Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Udalguri, Nagaon, Morigaon and Jorhat - are reeling under floods. Raising the issue of flood and erosion causing massive loss of life and livelihood every year, AGP legislator Phani Bhushan Choudhury called for sending an all-party delegation to New Delhi to impress upon the Centre to declare it a national calamity. ""While floods kill people and destroy cropland, nearly 8,000 hectares of land are eroded every year. The size of Majuli, the river island and seat of Vaishnavite culture, has been reduced by half since 1951. Most of the 4,474-km embankments which were constructed years ago to reduce the impact of floods have outlived their lifespan. Assam bears the impact of floods because of rain in neighbouring states but the efforts to involve other states to mitigate floods have not materialised yet."" Another senior AGP legislator Brindaban Goswami said the government should launch a drive to register and maintain records of erosion-affected people. Responding to them, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal assured that the government with the help of the Centre had taken steps to mitigate the flood and erosion problem. He said a national-level conference to find solutions to these issues would be held here soon. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY PRANAB KUMAR DAS"

Picture by Biplab BasakJalpaiguri, Sept. 13: State food minister Jyotipriyo Mallick today said the food department had decided to sell 30,000 metric tons of rice to the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The minister also informed that the state food and supplies department would soon resume the public distribution system (PDS) - sale of food grain through ration shops among beneficiaries - in the hills. At a meeting here, Mallick said: ""Because of the violence in the hills, there had been a halt in the supply of food grain and around 51,000 metric tons of rice are lying unsold at the godown of the department at Dabgram, located on the outskirts of Siliguri. We have decided to sell around 30,000 metric tons of rice to the FCI."" ""An official from the FCI will arrive from Calcutta tomorrow to monitor the entire process,"" Mallick added. Yesterday, at the second rounds of bipartite talks held in Uttarkanya on the current impasse in hills, the hill parties had urged the chief minister to resume the PDS. ""We want the public distribution system to function during the shutdown but those who have called the strike did not allow the ration shops to open. Also, truck drivers who ferry the goods denied ascending to the hills after violence and ransacking of vehicles were reported. They were apprehensive of similar attacks,"" a senior official of the state food and supplies department said. Mallick, while speaking to newspersons, said: ""Every month, around 9,500 metric tons of rice and around 4,000 metric tons of flour are required to distribute through ration shops among the beneficiaries of Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts. But ration shops in hills are close since the indefinite strike began in June. But after yesterday's meeting, situation is getting normal in the hills."" In the hills, around 8.75 lakh people are provided with food grain from ration shops, Mallick said. ""Each of those who have ration cards will get six kilos of rice and five kilos of flour a month,"" he added. When asked by when the department would be able to send food grains to the hills, the minister said: ""Once the situation turns normal, it would take only two days for us (the department) to send the required quantities of food grains to the hills."" Tomorrow, the food minister will hold a meeting at Uttarkanya, in the presence of state tourism minister Gautam Deb and officials of the district administration, police and his department where discussions would be held on introducing the public distribution system in the hills. At today's meeting, held at the district magistrate's office here, administrative officials of Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar districts were present."

(AFP) Sept. 10 (Reuters): Myanmar today rebuffed a ceasefire declared by Muslim Rohingya insurgents to enable the delivery of aid to thousands of displaced people in the violence-racked state of Rakhine, declaring simply that it did not negotiate with terrorists. Attacks by militants on police posts and an army base on August 25 prompted a military counter-offensive that triggered an exodus of Rohingya to Bangladesh, adding to the hundreds of thousands already there from previous spasms of conflict. According to the latest estimate by UN workers in the Cox's Bazar region of southern Bangladesh, about 294,000, many of them sick or wounded, have arrived in just 15 days, putting huge strain on humanitarian agencies' operations. Thousands of Rohingya remaining in the north-western state of Rakhine have been left without shelter or food, and many are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice fields to reach Bangladesh. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) insurgent group declared a month-long unilateral ceasefire, starting today, so that aid could reach these people. The impact of ARSA's move is unclear, but it does not appear to have been able to put up significant resistance against the military force unleashed in Rakhine state, where thousands of homes have been burned down and dozens of villages destroyed. ARSA's declaration drew no formal response from the military or the government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. However, a spokesperson for Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, said on Twitter: ""We have no policy to negotiate with terrorists."" Myanmar says its security forces are carrying out clearance operations to defend against ARSA, which the government has declared a terrorist organisation. Human rights monitors and fleeing Rohingya say the army and Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes have mounted a campaign of arson aimed at driving out the Rohingya, whose population is estimated at around 1.1 million. About a dozen Muslim villages were burned down on Friday and Saturday in the ethnically mixed Rathedaung region of Rakhine, two sources monitoring the situation said. ""Slowly, one after another, villages are being burnt down - I believe that Rohingyas are already wiped out completely from Rathedaung,"" said one of the sources, Chris Lewa of the Arakan Project, a Rohingya monitoring group. It was unclear who torched the villages, and independent journalists are not allowed into the area. In Cox's Bazar, Reuters journalists saw waves of Rohingya arriving today, and crowds of desperate people - mostly women and children - queuing for handouts of food and clothes. More than 300 people arrived on small boats and fishing trawlers on Shah Porir Dwip island, a short distance from the mouth of the Naf river that separates the two countries and flows out into the Bay of Bengal. Many collapsed on the beach from motion sickness and dehydration. Bangla seeks support Bangladesh today sought India's support in handling the Rohingya issue by mounting pressure on Myanmar to take back the refugees who have taken shelter in the country. Ruling Awami League general secretary and senior Bangladesh minister Obaidul Quader said: ""The entire world is today worried with the Rohingya issue and India also expressed its concern... their (India's) concern and stance beside us is very crucial at this moment."" Quader said: ""We hope India will favour Bangladesh in this humanitarian crisis as well."""
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

Picture by Ngangbam Indrakanta Singh Imphal, Sept. 8: Manipur Speaker Khemchand today inaugurated a five-day pottery workshop-cum-exhibition at Nupilal Memorial Complex here, organised by Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation Limited. Altogether 16 stalls were set up by artisans from popular pottery craft villages in Ukhrul, Imphal East and Kakching districts. Varieties of clay and stone pottery ran-ging from toys, idols, tea sets, water pots to traditional cookers and others kitchen utensils were exhibited and sold. Yiemayo Luiram, an artisan from Ukhrul, said, ""This kind of exhibition provides us with a big opportunity to sell our products. There is no specific market place for us to sell even if our items are in great demand."" She brought pottery priced from Rs 150 to Rs 850. The lowest-priced items were the cups and prices of traditional rice cookers were the highest. Traditionally called nungpi chaphu, pottery of Ukhrul is liked by everyone in the state with its famous rice cooker also used for cooking non-vegetarian food. The pottery of Ukhrul is known technically as black pottery, produced using clay and stone. The artisans from Andro, a cultural heritage village of Manipur in Imphal East, and potters from Thongjao in Ukhrul displayed their unique clay products, including toys and idols. Khemchand said, ""I have found new designs that I have not seen before. Everyone in the state need to encourage our artisans. I am proud of being a Manipuri."" Manipur handicrafts inspector Wangkheimayum Jadumani said many who were supposed to participate in the exhibition failed to turn up as the panchayat election is approaching.

(Reuters) Kutupalong Refugee Camp (Bangladesh), Sept. 8 (AP): In a corner of a room in a sprawling expanse of squalid shanties and tents, Zahida Begum holds in her arms the tiny boy she gave birth to just hours ago. Her eyes are blank. The 25-year-old ethnic Rohingya Muslim crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar on September 1 with her two young sons, husband and mother, fleeing shootings and arson attacks by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist monks, her family says. Having spent all their money on smugglers who helped them cross the Naf river to safety, she now sits afraid and unsure of what will come next. The massive Kutupalong refugee camp of tiny mud houses covered with plastic sheets, with its overpowering stench of rotting food and feces, is now her home. She gave birth alone, in the toilet outside the room, says her mother, Dildar Begum. The baby has not been fed since his birth 10 hours ago. She's feverish and shivers so much that her mother lit a small, smokey fire to warm her up. She is still bleeding from the birth. No doctor is in sight in the camp, set up in the early 1990s to accommodate earlier waves of Muslim Rohingya refugees escaping from convulsions of violence and persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar. There are no clinics or pharmacies or even basic first aid centres. New arrivals like Begum and her family survive on the kindness of older refugees and on food handouts from local volunteers and aid groups: rice and curry once a day if they are lucky. ""She's been crying from hunger,"" her mother said of her weak and ailing daughter. Begum simply stares. Myanmar's government refuses to recognise Rohingya as a minority group and denies them citizenship, even though about 1 million were living there until two weeks ago and many families had been there for generations."

(PTI) New Delhi, Sept. 9: The GST Council today lowered the tax rates for 30 items of daily use, ranging from idli/dosa batter to kitchen gas lighter, and extended the last date for filing of sales returns by a month to October 10. ""The GST on about 30 items have been lowered after anomalies in the fixation of rates were pointed out,"" finance minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting. To deal with businesses which are deregistering brands after the GST to avoid taxes, the panel set May 15, 2017, as the cut-off date for considering registered brands for the purpose of GST levy, irrespective of whether or not a brand is subsequently deregistered. Unbranded food items are exempt from the GST, whereas branded and packaged food items attract a 5 per cent levy. Hence, many businesses are deregistering their brands to avoid the tax. The GST has been lowered on dried tamarind, custard power, oil cakes, dhoop and other similar items, plastic raincoat, rubber bands, rice rubber rolls for paddy de-husking, computer monitors, kitchen gas lighters and brooms and brushes. Jaitley further said that food items sold in the open were under the zero per cent tax rate, while the branded ones attracted 5 per cent tax. Some businesses were deregistering their brands and selling under corporate brand name, creating inequality of trade, ""so we amended the rule"", he said. ""If you fall in either of the two categories, you will pay 5 per cent tax. One, if on May 15, 2017, you had a registered trademark, you have to pay 5 per cent GST. Two, if you have a mark or a name on which you are entitled to maintain actionable claim or exclusivity, you have to pay 5 per cent,"" Jaitley added. ""The reduction of rates shows the government can be flexible to review the rates if GST collection continues to be healthy. The decision on branded food products should ensure that all such products have the same treatment as long as the brand owner wants to legally protect it,"" Pratik Jain, partner and leader (indirect tax) of PwC, said. Khadi fabric sold through the stores under the Khadi and Village Industries Commission will be exempted, Jaitley said, adding inter-state sales where the turnover is less than Rs 20 lakh as also artisans will not need registration. Returns filing extended The deadline for filing of sales return, or GSTR-1, for July, the first month of implementation of the new tax regime, has been extended by a month to October 10. Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia today said that the council has decided that GSTR-3B (returns for July and August) can be filed for four more months till December. ""For GSTR-1, 2, 3, we are giving a long rope and we are staggering the return filing date for July,"" he said. For companies with a turnover of over Rs 100 crore, the last date for filing GSTR-1 is October 3. For the rest, it is October 10. GSTR-2 for July will have to be filed by October 31 and GSTR-3 by November 10. The dates for filing returns for August will be given later. On the glitches in the GST Network, Jaitlet said, ""These are transient challenges. The council has decided to appoint a committee to interact with GSTN for a smooth transition."""

(AFP) Toronto, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Oscar-winning actress Angelina Jolie says she never intended to step behind the camera, but travelling around the world for the UN opened her eyes to the conflicts that have inspired many of her most recent films. ""I never thought I could make a movie or direct,"" Jolie told an audience at the Toronto Film Festival on Sunday, which is screening her Cambodian genocide film First They Killed My Father and Afghan film The Breadwinner. Jolie said her first major film as a director, the 2011 Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey, was prompted by her humanitarian work as a special envoy for the UN refugee agency. ""I wanted to learn more about the war of Yugoslavia. I had been in the region and traveling in the UN. It was a war I really couldn't get my head around. ... It was not a goal to become a director,"" she said. The Breadwinner, an animated film that she produced, is about a young Afghan girl who cuts her hair and poses as a boy in order to feed her family. It ""tells the sad reality of many girls having to work and not go to school"", said Jolie, who has made several trips to Afghanistan. ""The people I have met over the years are truly my heroes. The nice thing about being a director is to champion other people,""? Jolie added. Jolie said First They Killed My Father, was inspired by wanting to learn more about the history of Cambodia, the birthplace of her son Maddox, one of her six children. She said she wanted ""Maddox to learn about himself as a Cambodian in a different light"". The film, which was screened in Cambodia earlier this year, tells the story of a young girl during the country's 1970s genocide who is forced into the countryside to toil in rice paddies and then take up arms as a child soldier. Jolie, 42, who won a supporting actress Oscar for Girl, Interrupted in 2000, shrugged off her status as a role model for women. ""I have a lot to learn and need role models myself,"" she said."
5a1154299855b76bf13df7e4,Hurricane 'is chasing us',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170912/jsp/foreign/story_172520.jsp,2017-09-12,"A man walks through a flooded street in the Brickell area of downtown Miami. (AFP) Orlando (Florida), Sept. 11: Bracing for hurricanes is almost a summer tradition here: the steady, clanking sound of wood banged to windows, the endless lines for bottled water and fuel, the pilgrimages to fortified shelters. But Irma, which struck Florida's coastline twice and then tore through the state with a fury, is anything but a run-of-the-mill hurricane. It was wider than the peninsula itself. There was hardly anywhere in the state to escape its blustery wrath. Certainly not in the tiny islands of the Keys, which found themselves nearly under water yesterday after Irma zeroed in on Cudjoe Key, Florida, just after 9am (local time). Not in the shimmering high-rises of Miami, where hurricane winds partially knocked down two construction cranes. Not in and around the tourist havens of Orlando and Tampa, where theme parks were shuttered. Even the most northern pockets in Tallahassee, the capital, and the small towns along the Florida-Georgia line, were cowering with the rest of the state for a thorough pummelling from tropical-force winds. To try to escape Irma, Floridians scattered across the state on clogged interstates. They slept on cots inside high schools, on narrow beds in roadside motels, on friends' couches and wherever they could reach on a tank of gas. The question for everyone was whether to go, and then where to go, to best outlast the winds. Irma's ruinous march was, for a while, aimed directly at South Florida, prompting much of the population, with memories of Hurricane Andrew and fresh scenes from Hurricane Harvey, to flee to the north and west. But by Saturday morning, the storm had shifted west. And suddenly, Naples, Fort Myers and Tampa, a collection of Gulf Coast cities particularly vulnerable to storm surge, found themselves in harm's way. For days, that part of the state had been considered for some a safe haven; all of a sudden it was the bull's eye. ""I feel like the storm is chasing us,"" said Antonella Giannantonio, 51, who wasted no time last week packing her family, including her octogenarian parents, into two cars, then driving from North Miami Beach to Naples, then Tampa. Wearing a Navy cap, Florida's governor, Rick Scott, stood before a bank of microphones as the storm crept closer, sounding the alarm in brutally direct sound bites: Evacuate. Leave now. Get out. His plain-spoken words and Irma's promise of devastation forced one of the largest evacuations this country has seen. Yesterday, as Irma's winds left millions of Floridians in the dark, Scott's message was even more sobering, as if there might be little else to say: ""Pray."" In Key West, a place so vulnerable that the authorities had said to remain was the most foolhardy of moves, Richard Peter Matson stayed anyway, and slept little as Irma neared. Even with a Category 4 storm bearing down on his home, he defended his decision to stay put, despite what he described as a challenging night. ""I kept tossing, turning,"" said Matson, an 81-year-old artist. ""Things kept smashing and banging."" When the winds moved on, the Key West holdout stepped outside to briefly inspect his street, now strewn with debris and branches, broken shutters and windows. He saw a downed cable and remembered the voices of friends who had warned him he'd be electrocuted if he stayed behind. If there is an opposite of a storm-chaser, it would be Brian Plate, a Key West boat captain who spent the past few days on the run. Plate, 36, took a cat and a friend and hit the road at about 2.30am (local time) on Thursday, headed for St Petersburg, a seemingly safe 644km away. Two hours into the seven-hour ride, he was so tired that he pulled over to take a nap. He awoke the next morning to grim news: Irma, then a Category 5 storm, was now headed for St Petersburg. He hit the road again, and about eight hours later, pulled into a friend's farm in Sale City, Georgia, carrying 100 pounds of rice and beans, plenty of tortillas, a generator and a portable stove. He learned there that the storm is headed for Georgia, too - but he is done running. ""My nerves are completely shot,"" he said, expressing worry for his friends who stayed ""down there"". After ramming Key West, Irma marched north yesterday, eventually coming ashore again at Marco Island, Florida, near Naples, around 3.30pm (local time). In Miami, which escaped a direct hit, the storm nonetheless intensified enough to make a solid five-storey hotel vibrate. Rain fell hard, the wind howled, and the daytime sky grew dark. In many places, water made the pavement go away, flooding areas across South Florida, from Fort Lauderdale to Miami and Miami Beach. Behind the Element hotel by the Miami International Airport, a lake overflowed, sending water into the parking lot and up to the sandbags protecting the lobby. NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE"

An organiser said the 475 candidates shortlisted by the 12 recruiters present at the fair have been asked to visit the offices of these companies for the next round of interview. ""We received positive feedback from the recruiters. They were all very happy with the quality of candidates who visited the fair,"" said one organiser. The registration fee was increased to Rs 100 this year to attract only quality candidates, the organiser said. The companies that took part in the fair included Britannia, Coca-Cola (DBPL), Wockhardt, LICI, ICFAI group and Dominos. Most of the jobs were in sales and marketing but there were a few openings in other sectors such as communications and engineering as well. A couple of engineering students who dropped in at the St. Xavier's College auditorium, where the fair was held, rued the lack of engineering jobs in the city. ""There are only a handful of engineering jobs in Calcutta. A couple of companies at the fair said they have openings for engineering students and I dropped my CV with them,"" said Imran Faiz, a graduate in electrical engineering. Other than recruiters, academic institutions and training institutes preparing for competitive exams were also part of this year's fair. ""Our objective was to learn from the companies what they look for in a fresher. This will help us prepare our students. We told the aspirants who came about the opportunities for higher studies at our institution,"" said Arup Dutta, director, Industry Collaboration and Business Analysis, Adamas University. Some students from the university who had come to the fair got a chance to interact with an official from Britannia and learn from her what a recruiter looks for. Britannia was one of the top draws for the aspirants at the fair. Some aspirants also had a word of advice for the organisers. ""It will be better if the recruiters display the nature of jobs they are offering. It will help both the candidate and the recruiters because only the interested candidates will approach them, saving time,"" said a visitor to the fair. An organiser said the feedback of all aspirants was valued and would be kept in mind while organising the next edition. ""Some visitors also complained about the absence of IT and aviation sector companies,"" he said. The next edition of the job fair will be held around the same time next year."

In 2001, some poor and marginalised women of the village produced mudhi and marketed it though a self-help group (SHG) Mayurbhanj Mudhi Association (MMA).Around 130 women from the locality joined the association and have made puffed rice business lucrative. Their success story has inspired several others in the nearby villages. Now, around 80 to 90 quintals of mudhi are being produced every month.Some farmers even cultivate rice to meet the demand for mudhi. Price of mudhi per bag has been increased from `140 to `150, said Anup Kumar Behera, who has been volunteering to monitor the SHGs operation. He said the rural market is consuming approximately 60 per cent of the produce while the rest are exported to other towns and States.MMA secretary Kabita Behera said the cooperative has been following several strategies for strengthening its market linkage. Apart from selling it in the weekly market, the bloated rice is being exported to West Bengal, Jharkhand, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Mumbai, she added.With the support of the district administration and NGOs, they displayed the famous Baripada mudhi during State and National level exhibitions and trade festivals. Though the SHG is running with a small workshop at Sangrami Mahila Mandal, it is has no adequate space to cater to the needs of their business. Earlier, they had urged a former collector to provide a government building for smooth functioning of the association. But so far, no action has been taken in this regard."

He also promised revival of sick rice milling units to be taken up on priority by the state government.Reiterating his governments commitment to early redress of problems faced by the industry, Amarinder said that a one-time settlement (OTS) scheme was recently announced to provide an opportunity to all defaulter rice millers to clear their past dues. Around 1,500 of the total 3,500 defaulting and sick milling units would benefit by the scheme, he said, adding that this was one of the several measures initiated to bring the industry back on the path of progress.Responding to a demand from the rice millers, Amarinder said he would take up the issue of bardana (gunny bags) use and transportation charges with the central government next week at his meeting with Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. On the issue of millers in surplus paddy districts being given more paddy at a rate of 140% of their original entitlement, he assured that no miller would be forced to mill paddy beyond his capacity and only those willing to mill extra paddy would be considered.Punjab Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh blamed the previous SAD-BJP government for the mess in the industry, saying the Akalis and BJP had plundered the state, leaving it under a massive debt burden of 2.08 lakh crore. He promised to act as a bridge between the milling community and the government to resolve any issues of concern."

There is opposition to the move from state farmers, and the mandi board is at the centre of it, because it manages procurement of grains and other produce through a network of 1,700 mandis.The corresponding levy is lower in states such as Rajasthan (1.6%) , Uttar Pradesh (2.4%), and Madhya Pradesh (0.2%).One of the options on the mandi boards mind is to hike the fee only for the dominant crops, wheat and paddy. We will implement the governments decision, but we will see that farmers interests are not harmed, said the boards chairman, former Congress minister Lal Singh. In the board meeting of October 11, we will decide whether to implement the hike on all crops or just wheat and paddy.Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union, said the enhancement is unjustified because, though the fees are levied on the purchaser of the farmers produce, the burden actually falls on the farmers. He added, This will lead to increase in the costs and dissuades traders from buying from the state, he said.The funds collected as fees go to the Punjab Rural Development Board for infrastructure, including link roads, which, the government argues, is for the benefit of the farmers.However, with the cotton crop ready, farmers in south-west Punjab prefer to take it to mandis of Sri Ganganagar (Rajasthan) and Dabwali (Haryana), where the levies are lower. Next, basmati growers are worried and already demanding a rollback as the crop is set to arrive in mandis by the end of October.The Punjab Basmati Rice Millers Association has said that said big mills set up under the mega project category have been exempted from the market fee, so the business will shift to those. In 2013, the government had abolished both the fees on purchase of basmati, but it was levied again in 2015.Wheat and paddy produce are bought mostly by state agencies and the Food Corporation of India (FCI) on behalf of the Centre, while other crops are primarily procured by traders."

In the 1960s, the armed forces used to grow wheat and rice in vacant areas and even the bungalows as part of the grow more food campaign, but the ministry must clarify whether the army will do it physically or it will get funds for it.But he was quick to add that if the rumour that it was part of the central governments efforts to get the pilgrim places cleaned was true, he would be very offended.Lt Gen Harwant Singh (retd) feels the order is downright humiliating. Soldiering is all about pride, such an order will lower the self-esteem of a soldier. It is unfortunate that our chiefs dont stand up to such diktats, he said, adding that there was a difference between helping out in an emergency and wielding the broom to make up for somebody elses inefficiency.There were others who said the order stemmed from the misplaced notion that the armed forces had nothing to do during peace time. Calling it an idiotic decision in view of the threat the country faces from two sides, Col Anil Raina (retd) said the army is busy every month of the year. From January to March, we are doing in-house training and preparing for the next nine months. Then there is field firing, followed by inspections where a unit is told whether it is war ready or not.Agreeing with him, the former army commander said a soldier has to account for every hour in his day. From training and refresher courses to administrative work, he is kept physically and mentally busy. It is peace time that prepares you for war.Col Raina said a soldier is so busy even during peace that if you were to ask him how many nights he gets to sleep, he will reply 2- 3 nights a week.Brig Baljit Singh (retd) of War Decorated India, however, chose to interpret the order more cautiously. I think the PMO implies that the army will get the work done, not that it will do it physically. The officer went on to explain that the chief executive officer of the cantonment board, who is an employee of the defence ministry, has both staff and funds at his disposal. He can use both to clean up areas in high altitude with scanty civil population.But most veterans found the order hard to swallow. Slamming it as very stupid Brig Harwant Singh (retd) of the Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement, bristled, The army does not need any swacchta abhiyan. They are asking us to clean up. It amounts to gross ill-treatment of the soldier. Dont reduce him to a safai worker.Seconding him, Brig Onkar Singh Goraya (retd) said the PMO can boost the cleanliness campaign by sending his people to cantonments for a tutorial in cleanliness. Visit any military station and you wont find a brick out of place. We do the job with minimum effort. Learn from us, dont hand us the broom."

The decline, though marginal, raises fears of increase in food prices because it comes at a time when the economy is under strain.Experts said the decline in production would lead to greater farmer distress which had led to a string of farm loan waivers by individual states.Till last week, the ministry had maintained production would be closer to last years production for the season and had set a target of 137 MT.The estimates show a decline of nearly 10% in kharif oilseeds and roughly 4% in coarse cereals. At the same time, production of sugar cane is pegged at 337.69 MT significantly higher than last years output of 306.72 million tones.The production of most of the crops is estimated to be higher as compared to their average production of the last five years, a ministry official said.Official sources also said rice production for the season is estimated at 94.48 MT, nearly 2 MT below last years figures while the total production of coarse cereals is expected to go down from 32.71 MT during the 2016-17 kharif cycle to 31.49 MT. Ministry sources said the decline will not lead to food security concerns due to the available buffer stocks.This is not unexpected. We had drought in many rain-fed areas, Siraj Hussain, former secretary agriculture told HT. The riddle, however, is that even the expectation of lower production has not led to increase in prices.That, he added, signals lower domestic demand and a shortage of cash in rural areas."

Now, he prefers to sell it without a brand name, thanks to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) that levies 5% tax on branded produce.While the pros and cons of the new tax regime are still being debated, traders of two major crops in north Karnataka  toor dal and Sona Masuri rice  are struggling to cope. The sale of the crops under registered trademarks attract 5% tax, making them costlier compared to unregistered brands, which are not taxed.In order to avoid GST, toor dal traders in Kalaburagi, and Sona Masuri rice traders in Raichur, Sindhanur, Gangavathi, Karatagi, and other towns and cities along the Tungabhadra paddy belt are now either giving up their trademarks or stopping sale under registered trademarks.For instance, in Kalaburagi, one of the major red-gram growing districts in the country, there are over 250 dal mills of which only six had registered their unique brands under the Trade Marks Act. Now, all six have deregistered their brands to avoid GST.Even 5% tax makes a huge difference in the highly competitive market. Dal mills with unregistered trademarks can sell the product at much lower prices as their brands do not attract GST, Mr. Nadar told The Hindu .Pointing out that there are additional costs incurred in maintaining quality of product for selling them under registered trademark, Yogarajan Nadar, trader, said the actual difference would be more than 15%.When we carry out business under registered trademark, the product is subject to quality check by government officials. We spend about 10% additional cost on processing to maintain quality, he said. Mr. Nadar looks after a 70-year-old toor dal business that was started by his grandfather, who hailed from Tamil Nadu and settled in Kalaburagi. He recently deregistered his Peacock brand to avoid GST.There are over 400 rice mills in the towns and cities along the Tungabhadra Left Bank Canal that irrigates nearly 6 lakh acres of paddy fields in Raichur and Koppal districts. Most of the mills sell rice both under registered and unregistered brands. With 5% GST, these mills have stopped selling the product under registered trademarks.At present, I have stopped selling Sona Masuri rice under my registered brand Parivar. But, I continue selling the product tax-free under different unregistered brands, said Maram Tippanna, a rice trader from Raichur. He, like many other rice traders, is hoping for relief at the GST Council meeting which is expected to be held in the first week of August.Mr. Tippanna pointed out that there was a huge demand in Bengaluru and other metros for Sona Masuri rice grown in the Tungabhadra irrigation belt and marketed under registered trademarks, but the traders were not able to supply them under the same brands and for the same price after GST."

Paddy transplanting, though, has been a bit sluggish in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, but it is likely to pick up in the coming days. Sowing of pulses is apace in the key growing states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka, which is an encouraging sign, Anand Sharma, regional co-ordinator of the IMDs agricultural meteorology told, The Hindu .Apart from western parts of Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana, the monsoon rains have covered most parts of the country, he added. The monsoon rain delivers about 70% of Indias annual rainfall and is critical for millions of farmers as nearly half the countrys farmland lacks irrigation and is dependent on rain."

Another student said that they often suffer from stomach ache, diarrhoea, fever and allergy because of poor quality of foodgrains, improper cooking and lack of cleanliness.The students said that the Government was running the hostel for those belonging to socially and economically weaker sections of society. It was spending Rs. 500 (boarding charges) on each resident of the hostel since last year. Earlier, the boarding charge was Rs. 450 a student.VictimisedThe students alleged that arrogant wardens were threatening them not to complain to the higher officials. Those who questioned them were victimised. There were also cases of the wardens taking false confessions in writing from the students to threaten them.The cooking vessels were not cleaned properly. The rice was of poor quality and chapattis were not properly baked, they said.

Janakarajan.Funded by the Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR), the study was conducted between 2014 and 2016 and covers a period spanning almost four decades, beginning from the 1970s. Through the comparison of the geographic information system (GIS) imagery for May 2014 with the 1971 toposheet obtained from the National Remote Sensing Centre at the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the researcher has tracked land use and changes to land cover to show that the delta region has shrunk by 20% due to anthropogenic factors such as diversion of land for non-agricultural purposes, as well as factors linked to climate change.For a once-prosperous agricultural belt, the drastic reduction in crop cover and a 13-fold increase in wastelands between 1971 and 2014 indicate a worrisome phenomenon. Much of this is because the land is kept fallow due to lack of water and other adverse climatic conditions, Mr. Janakarajan says.Risk of sinkingAnother phenomenon reported by the study is the increase in mangrove cover in the region as sea water ingress has grown in the coastal areas. The data shows that mangrove cover has gone up nearly 14 times since 1971.Increasing mangrove cover is nothing to be happy about, because what that means is that more and more cultivable agricultural land is coming under sea water and the soil is turning saline, Mr. Janakarajan says. With 72% of the low-lying land in the State falling under the delta region along the coast, the land in this region is at greater risk of submergence as a result of rising sea levels due to climate change. The author cites studies by Sujatha Byravan and others to show how a substantial portion of land in the delta region is at an elevation of merely a metre from the sea. He raises the issue of reduced sediment flow to the delta, which otherwise helps maintain the critical elevation level from the sea.There is an almost near-unanimity among researchers that the withholding of the river flow upstream through the construction of a series of dams is the fundamental reason for the reduced or no sediment flow downstream, and that delta subsidence [ Imminent threat to coastal populations] is in a large measure attributable to these kinds of human intervention in the rivers, Mr. Janakarajan says, pointing out that the Cauvery delta has witnessed a decline of 80% in sediment deposit over the last century.This is borne out by the loss of storage capacity in the Mettur dam as a result of siltation, for instance. The dam, constructed in 1934, used to have a storage capacity of 2708.8 million cubic metres (MCM). By 2004, this was reduced to 1994.2 MCM. Besides, data reveal that its capacity had reduced further to 1,889 MCM in 2015. Sediment flow to the Cauvery delta has been practically nil of late, as per a 2015 report by the Central Water Commission cited by the study.Cycle of drought and floodA noticeable consequence of climate change has been the cycle of drought and flood that coastal areas have been enduring. While there has been a decline in the overall rainfall between 1974 and 2004, the study reports an increase in rainfall, occurring in spurts, at the local level. The overall decline in rainfall has not been borne out across the Cauvery basin in the State. During several years, the delta districts received 1,200 mm of rainfall, which is high. However, this pattern has not spread out. Usually, the rain occurs within a span of a few days, resulting in heavy flooding. The fields get flooded and the crops are destroyed. On the other hand, there is the prevalence of droughts such as the one that the State is currently reeling under.All these factors have resulted in a drastic reduction in land under crop cover to the tune of 27%, as against 1971 levels. Due to sea water ingress, there has been a substantial rise in shrimp farming along the coast, which is detrimental to agricultural practice, the author points out.Periodic storm surges in the delta region have exerted additional stress on the 14 tail-end regulators in the canals at Nagapattinam district, which help keep sea water at bay. These regulators help divert the drainage water flowing from the Cauvery river system for irrigation purposes, which would otherwise end up in the sea. The total area irrigated by the water impounded by these regulators is 25,509 hectares. With a rise in sea levels, this arrangement could turn dysfunctional.Another major vulnerability is the soil type. The delta region has clay soil, of which 52% is cracking clay, which is very vulnerable if it doesnt receive continuous irrigation, Mr. Janakarajan says.The study also points to the decline of dairy as a secondary occupation in the delta districts, with the cattle population also registering a steep decline, as revealed by the livestock census data. This means that when agriculture fails to support farmers, back-up options such as livestock and poultry rearing may not be of much help either. Poultry farming cannot withstand rough weather conditions, which are not uncommon for the delta, the author observes.The decline of agricultural prospects in the Cauvery delta has been disastrous for the socio-economic well-being of the local population. Indebtedness is a major issue and alcohol addiction is high as job opportunities decline, the study shows. Economic vulnerability is very high, the author warns.What farmers sayVoices from the Cauvery delta region have shed some light on the ground reality, as well as the sort of State intervention which might help tide over the current crisis.Voicing his concerns over the implications that the decline in land under crop cover may have for food security, Mannargudi S. Rangathan, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, says, Food security is of utmost importance and the delta region plays a very important role in this regard. In the face of changing climatic conditions and sea-level rise, both the government and the farmers must devise strategies that will help address the situation rather than merely throwing up their hands in despair.The former Thiruvarur Collector, S. Natarajan, undertook a very good rainwater harvesting effort in the delta areas, which helped farmers to produce a bountiful harvest later on. This is just one instance of how, even during a water crisis, timely government intervention could help address some of the problems identified by the MIDS report, he says.However, not all farmers are happy with the way the State has intervened to address the crisis in the delta districts. P.R. Pandian, president of the Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, says that although several schemes have been announced by the State for the farmers welfare, it remains unclear as to who is benefitting from them.Recently, the treasurer of the association, S. Kannappan, sought details under the Right to Information Act regarding the implementation of the livestock fodder distribution scheme, under which farmers are eligible for 22 kg of livestock fodder per cow per week.No farmer that I know in my village has received any livestock fodder under the scheme, though in the RTI documents, the government has accounted for all the money on paper, Mr. Kannappan claims. He says depots were proposed under the programme for distributing the fodder, but he couldnt find any in his area. Farmers in the delta region have particularly been hit hard by the recent drought, and are struggling to feed their cattle, with many selling them under distress, he says.Building resilienceMr. Pandian further points out that with the objective of improving irrigation structures to benefit farmers, the government had envisaged the strengthening of irrigation canals and bunds to handle incidents such as floods. However the Public Works Department (PWD) has been moving at a snails pace on this project while contractors have been swindling money.One thing that the study makes clear is that there is no escaping the need to build resilience, in the light of climatic changes. The Tamil Nadu State Climate Action Plan, drafted in 2014, anticipates many of the challenges that the report has raised, and envisages a slew of measures to make agriculture sustainable, given the climate variability. Promotion of drought- and flood-tolerant varieties of paddy, micro-irrigation to promote efficient use of water and use of bio-fertilizers to improve soil health are among the proposals aimed at helping farmers improve their yield with available resources.However, there is no clarity on the extent to which these proposals have been incorporated in government interventions. H. Malleshappa, Director of Environment, claims that most of what the report advocates have already been implemented by the departments concerned such as the PWD and the Department of Agriculture, adding that ultimately, only the individual departments could account for the progress made, and he cant answer on their behalf.Agriculture Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi says the State would, in the future, adopt two varieties of paddy recently developed by the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, which are said to be flood- and drought-tolerant.Though the work on introducing climate resilient crop varieties is only beginning, the efforts of the State thus far have placed greater focus on promoting efficient use of water in agriculture through the expansion of the System of Rice Intensification (SRI).Now, almost 60% of paddy grown in Tamil Nadu is covered under SRI, Mr. Bedi says, adding, We have also placed emphasis on crop rotation and are asking farmers to grow pulses, millets or cotton after paddy cultivation. Further, we have also encouraged cultivation of black gram by the bunds of paddy fields to ensure nutritional value of soil.However, wasteland reclamation work is currently concentrated in the dry regions of Tamil Nadu around the Mettur dam, Pennaiyaar basin and parts of Krishnagiri, and not in the Cauvery delta regions.The State governments 2017-18 policy note on agriculture admits that agricultural production has been severely affected due to natural factors such as cyclones and drought. Though it outlines several schemes for the benefit of farmers and also uses the term climate-smart numerous times, it lacks clarity on the specific resources that would be dedicated to developing such climate-smart practices. One promising initiative is the collective farming scheme, which aims to promote farmer-producer groups with a corpus fund of Rs. 5 lakh per group. This will help reduce the vulnerability of small and marginal farmers to natural hazards as it allows them to pool their resources and scale up farm production. However, these schemes have only been proposed for the dry regions of the State, rather than delta regions. Agriculture Minister R. Doraikannu points out that the State government has announced a sustainable agriculture programme focused on rain-fed areas to promote dry land agriculture. But this does not cover the delta regions. He also notes that Rs. 1,250 crore has been released to insurance companies towards crop insurance payments for drought-affected farmers across the State.That said, the worsening economic vulnerability of the delta farmer is a clear indication that something is amiss despite the climate action plans drawn up by the State. With the Cauvery delta region accounting for 30% of the food grain production in the State, it is imperative that the crisis engulfing the region is resolved sooner rather than later.With 72% of the low-lying land in the State falling under the delta region along the coast, the land in this region is at greater risk of submergence as a result of rising sea levels due to climate changeS.

Palainswami to withdraw the National Food Security Act (NFSA) notification published in the gazette, DMK working president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday said the government should not reduce the number of ration cards.As he promised in the Assembly that the universal public distribution system would continue even if the NFSA was implemented, the Chief Minister should ensure that the number of ration cards is not reduced, Mr. Stalin said in a statement. He said if NFSA was implemented in Tamil Nadu, poor and middle-class families would not be able to purchase rice under the public distribution system.As the price of rice is increasing in the open market, the State governments notification had come as a major shock to the people. When enumeration is done under the NFSA, a substantial portion of the 1.95 lakh ration cards would be reduced, he said.Mr. Stalin said even though late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa vehemently opposed the NFSA, the AIADMK government agreed to implement it when she was in hospital. It agreed to identify Priority Households (PHH) and restrict them to 37.79% in urban areas and 62.55% in rural areas.Officials say the Central government has asked the State to limit the percentage of PHHs in rural areas to 62.50% and in urban areas to 37.88%.Mr. Stalin said since the NFSA guidelines had been published in the gazette, the government could not stay away from its implementation. But the claim of Food Minister Kamaraj that it would not be implemented goes to show that it is running a Thuglak durbar, he alleged.Under NFSA, poor and middle-class families would not be able to purchase rice through the Public Distribution System"

Satyagopal, Commissioner of Revenue Administration, and former Director General of National Institute of Plant Health Management.Addressing a brainstorming session on Ecosystem engineering for sustainable agriculture at Madurai Kamaraj University on Friday, Mr. Satyagopal stressed reduction in use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and move towards organic methods.Referring to the MKUs initiative to adopt 400 villages both directly and through its affiliated colleges, he said students could become agents of change by helping farmers adopt various emerging and proven techniques in organic farming.India had to adopt excessive use of chemicals in farming to ensure food security, he said, adding there had been a realisation now that these methods caused ecological damage in the long run, particularly affected soil health.There was a shift in many countries towards sustainable farming, and many of these techniques were cheap and easily available.For instance, the technique of bio-priming of seeds of rice and other crops involved inoculation of beneficial fungus that could act as fungicide on the seeds. The National Institute of Plant Health Management had come up with cost-effective and easily adoptable methods in bio-priming of seeds, which could considerably increase yield, and resist pests and crop diseases.Similarly, though soil testing is widely prevalent, farmers are not relying upon the results to assess the quantity of urea and other fertilizers needed. Instead, they use excessive quantities of fertilizers, he said. By doing this, farmers are spending money to lose money since use of more nitrogen-release fertilizers leads to excessive growth that will attract more pests. Consequently, farmers have to spend more on pesticides, he said.Mr. Satyagopal also elaborated on a number of techniques like use of vermicompost, mycorrhization and ecological engineering that need to be adopted by farmers.P.P. Chellathurai, Vice-Chancellor, in his inaugural speech, stressed that the university was not content with producing quality research work, but strived towards taking the benefits to the masses, particularly to those from rural and underprivileged background."

Ramakrishnan on Tuesday said the withdrawal of subsidy for cooking gas would severely hit the middle and lower income groups.Speaking to presspersons here, he criticised the notification of the State government on the implementation of the National Food Security Act (NFSA) as it excluded several categories of existing beneficiaries. This would hit the low income group and the unorganised sector workers, he said. Fixing the annual income ceiling at Rs. 1 lakh and monthly income at Rs. 8,000 for a beneficiary under the public distribution system (PDS) was a decision far removed from the ground reality.The action of the Centre and the State governments was aimed at jeopardising the functioning of the PDS, he said.The Centre was only snatching rice from a man without resources for one square meal and was providing subsidies on a platter to corporate houses.As per a report tabled by the Centre on the floor of Parliament, while corporate houses owed Rs. 7,11,000 crore to the banks, the benefits in the form of concessions and subsidy extended to them in the last three years of BJP rule ran to Rs. 4,20,000 crore.Mr. Ramakrishnan demanded that both the Centre and the State should reconsider their decisions on LPG subsidy and PDS revamp."

Saminathan, met the Director of Civil Supplies Department to express their willingness to discard government freebies, including free rice.Mr. Swaminathan told The Hindu that he along with party workers submitted the letter of intent to the Director. He said around 50 letters were submitted and more workers would follow the party direction in the coming days.The BJP leader said if the welfare measures were restricted to the needy, that is sections of people belonging to the financially poor background, the financial crises could be solved.While a large number of deserving beneficiaries were without the red card, income tax payees and affluent sections had obtained the card, he said.Blaming a section of legislators for the anomaly, he said the reason for the mess was due to favouritism shown by the MLAs.The AIADMK members even went to the extent of surrendering their ration cards to the Speaker.

I wanted to go beyond that, says chef Gayatri Desai, the innovation chef at Doolally who will present a pop-up this Sunday inspired by her recent trip.In June, Desai took off on a solo trip to Dimapur and Mokokchung in Nagaland, Imphal in Manipur, extending all the way to Yangon in Burma. I travelled for 20 days. No hotels, no restaurants. I was a chef with a backpack, says the 28-year-old who hails from Shivaji Nagar, Pune. After a degree in Culinary Arts from Northwest Culinary Academy Of Vancouver, Desai conducted her first pop-up three years ago in the Canadian city she studied in. Since then, I have popped-up 25 times in India, Burma, Vietnam, Mexico, Japan and the roof-top terrace in my parent's home in Pune.It was the cooking techniques that struck her the most during her travels. I learnt how to cure, smoke and ferment various ingredients, she says. While fermentation is common with alcohol, especially beer, it was the first time she discovered how the process affects food and its ability to add smokiness, depth and a lot of dark colour to curries and gravies.Desai also discovered black rice when she was stranded in a village in Manipur owing to a landslide. From the field to the villager's wood-fire kitchen to my plate, she reminisces. They were not surprised when I smuggled a gunny bag of this magical forbidden rice to take home with me. In addition, the chef brought back other ingredients including anishi (fermented yam leaves) from Nagaland, awa-phadigom (saw-toothed coriander) from Manipur, nei lieh (perilla seeds) from Meghalaya, Sichuan pepper corns, shitake mushrooms and rice beer tablets.The chefs collection of spices, herbs and cooking techniques from the Northeast will be put to use at the upcoming pop-up. But Desai will also source locally fresh vegetables, chicken and seafood. We have tweaked the dishes slightly for Mumbai because we dont want the vegetarians to miss out, concludes the chef. Patrons can then look forward to a five-course small plates meal with savoury dishes and one dessert.The Northeast India pop-up will take place on Sunday August 13 from 7.30 p.m. to 10 p.m at Doolally Taproom, Colaba.

This has prompted the students to demand strict action against officials responsible.The office of Chief Food Analyst in Mysuru had tested the samples of tur dal, rice, refined oil and tea powder obtained from the hostel kitchen. As per the lab tests, except the refined oil, all the three items were unfit for human consumption. The officers of Food Safety and Quality Authority in Hassan had collected the samples from the hostel on July 16, following a protest by students complaining that the food served there was of poor quality. The samples were sent to the office of Chief Food Analyst, where the divisional level lab is also located. According to the report, the tur dal sample contained living insects, while the rice sample had living insects, hair and other extraneous matter. Similarly, the tea powder sample was found unsafe as it showed the traces of added colour. The Chief Food Analyst, after conducting the tests, sent the report on July 29.V.

A short distance ahead are mother and daughter Jil Pyngrope, 75, and Stailin, 40, standing on an incline plucking tea leaves, tossing them into baskets on their backs. Their chuckles hide the gloom of a difficult past.For the inhabitants of Mawlyngot village in Meghalaya's East Khasi Hills , tea is not just another crop but a means for survival and reclaiming pride. Jil and Stailin were part of an alcohol brewing community, until they found a way to better their lot - by brewing delicate flavours of their own brand of tea, Urlong, which means 'dream come true' in Khasi. The tea is now looking to rival the country's popular infusions from Assam and Darjeeling.About 40km from Shillong , at an altitude of 4,800ft, the sleepy hamlet of Mawlyngot is about a century and a half old. Locals say people from the India-Bangladesh border migrated down the river Umsong and settled on the hills. Early inhabitants thrived on smallscale cultivation of yam, corn, millet, potato, chilli and banana but with lower yields and absence of policing, they turned to the easy-to-brew country liquor 'pyrsi' made from rice and millet.Mawlyngot's brewery soon became reason for the community's steady collapse  broken homes, chronic illnesses, drunken brawls and penury. ""As a landless villager with no education, brewing pyrsi was an easy way to earn money. You can't escape addiction when you're brewing alcohol all day. I would often get into fights on the streets,"" says Phroshon Songthiang, 39. Phroshan is now a changed man who manages the community-run tea processing unit.The turnaround began after village headman D L Nongspung stumbled upon camellia shrubs - a plant from the tea family - growing in the area. The soil enriched by the rare presence of blue worms made the place ideal for tea cultivation.For Nongspung, it was ""a command from God"" to wean away Mawlyngot from the spirit. ""What struck me after moving here in 1987 was the number of children dropping out of school. The rate was 60%, and the main reason was families being unable to afford books or fees as they earned less than Rs 1,000 a month from brewing illicit liquor,"" he recalls.With an initial funding of Rs 58 lakh from the tribal affairs ministry and a community contribution of Rs 5 lakh in 2003 and NGO World Vision 's intervention, 25 farmers in the village started learning the art of harvesting tea. It wasn't until 2007 that the first batch of tea leaves was plucked. ""The farmers were eager to switch to a new way of life but the start wasn't easy,"" says Nongspung.Land holding being small and fragmented, farmers would sell their produce locally for a small profit. So they got together to form the Urlong Tea Integrated Village Cooperative Society in 2011, a society that currently comprises 41 farmers who own individual gardens with an implied agreement of interdependence.""They sell the leaves plucked from their gardens to the society-owned tea processing plant for the collective benefit of all farmers,"" explains Nongspung.Besides a daily wage for plucking of Rs 300 for males and Rs 200 for females, land owners get up to 15% share in the annual profit.From an annual sale of Rs 2 lakh for 300kg a decade ago, the turnover has increased to Rs 15 lakh for 3,000kg of green, black and white tea in 2016. Ivashisha Pyngrope, secretary of the tea growers' society, has returned to Mawlyngot after finishing college in Shillong. ""I want to do my bit for my village too,"" says the 31-year-old. ""I've seen my house filled with jerry cans of liquor, my father drink uncontrollably and the family turn asocial,"" she says, but her eyes light up when she recalls the first coat of paint and an almirah her house got after her father switched to tea gardening.""He is sober now, spends quality time with us, eating meals at home, praying at church and discussing the farm,"" she says.Markers of civic progress  schools, electricity, footpaths, a guesthouse and motorable roads - have begun to appear in the village. Seven neighbouring villages are also replicating Mawlyngot's model. Currently a popular item on the racks in Meghalaya, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, the first flush of Oolong tea has also found takers in Australia. Mawlyngot's cultivation practices are organic and they received certification from the Control Union, which helps Urlong tap the international market.""Mawlyngot is now on the tourist map,"" says Nongspung. ""We're hoping for more people to come find us."""

More and more areas in the central parts of the country are being inundated.The main concern of the government is to get adequate relief for the victims, said officials. Food Minister Quamrul Islam said the government has sufficient stock to feed the people. However, media reports said in most areas, the relief distribution was not adequate.The disaster management department said that cash of around 60 million taka, about 16 tonnes of rice and 36,500 packets of dry food have been distributed among the flood-affected people.

With steamed rice, often of the red variety, served at the centre of their plate, locals serve yellow dal and curries made of vegetables, greens, fish and meat around it, virtually covering the entire colour palette within that small radius. Rice is cultivated locally, mostly from the islands North Western, North Central and Northern Provinces. This year, though, Sri Lanka is in a spot. From meeting the domestic requirement for rice almost entirely, Sri Lanka is now considering a substantial import of rice to ensure food security, following a drought, the worst the island has seen in 40 years. Clear warning signs emerged in 2016, after monsoons failed. Farmers worst fears came true when the drought extended well into 2017, affecting their two main harvest seasons, Maha and Yala. Speaking on what he called a really bad situation, Sri Lankas Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake told The Hindu : We hoped to cultivate 8,00,000 hectares of paddy this year, but about 50% of that has been damaged due to the drought.To cope with this, Sri Lanka is importing over 3,00,000 tonnes of rice, mostly from India. However, given the countrys monthly requirement of 2,00,000 tonnes of rice, imports are only set to increase. The Central Bank has said that if the drought persists through the year, Sri Lanka may have to import food and fuel worth an additional $800 million.According to Sri Lankas Disaster Management Centre, almost 1.3 million people have been hit by the drought. Several thousand farmers in 20 of the countrys 25 districts are suffering, their land and soil parched for over a year now. Data point to a severe impact in Kurunegala district, less than three hours drive from Colombo, and Puttalam  both in the North Western Province. While Anuradhapura in the North Central Province has also been badly hit, the Tamil-majority Northern Province is the most-affected region, where farmers in all its five districts of Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi, Vavuniya and Mannar are in a crisis. People here are also facing a serious drinking water problem.Broader patternsSpeaking of possible underlying causes, experts point to some broader patterns in climate in the island. Buddhi Marambe, professor of Crop Science at the Agriculture Faculty in University of Peradeniya, said over the last 50 years, Sri Lankas average temperature had risen by 0.01-0.03 degree Celsius annually. The impact of such climate change has been that the wet seasons have got wetter, and dry seasons have become drier over the years, he told The Hindu .The last time the island faced such a severe drought was in 1973-74, and preparing for such a disaster in 2016 was simply off the cards at the policy level. When two inter-monsoons and two monsoons [southwest and northeast] fail, that severely affects the yield. The government is in a precarious situation, with no other option but to import, said Prof. Marambe, who chairs the countrys National Experts Committee on Climate Change Adaptation. Following the drought, many younger farmers are switching to other jobs, Reuters reported. An estimated 1.8 million farm families are engaged in paddy cultivation in Sri Lanka, where agriculture remains a key driver of the rural economy.There is more to the drought story than climate change, argued Chinthaka Rajapakse, moderator of the Movement for Land and Agricultural Reform. To start with, the government lacks a long-term strategy to tackle climate change. Moreover, its policies systematically exclude the poor. Where do ordinary people like farmers figure in its grand development agenda? he asked.If the drought persists through the year, Sri Lanka may have to import food and fuel worth an additional $800 million, according to the countrys Central Bank"

Against this backdrop, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan made an observation in the Lok Sabha recently that prices of subsidised wheat and rice will not be reviewed till 2018, which indirectly hints that subsidy for these chief food grains will also get reviewed after 2018 or go in the near future.

Except one or two voices at both the places, those who participated in the public hearing welcomed it stating that the hearing would change the fate of their area for better. They said that the places would become rice - crop intensive, and the migration to towns could be contained, along with lowering the chances of suicide among farmers. Land oustee at both the public hearings did not express their voices, much to the govt.s respite. The low level of participation could be partly due to the location of the hearing.So far, leaders from only Congress and CPI (M) have demanded compensation under LA Act- 2013.In Siddipet, four reservoirs  Anantagiri (3.5 tmcft), Ranganaiksagar (3 tmcft), Mallannasagar (51 tmcft) and Kondapohamma (15 tmcft)  are coming up with a total capacity of 72.5 tmcft which would naturally submerge large chunks of land to the tune of thousands of acres. Irrigation Minister T. Harish Rao and Collector P. Venaktaram Reddy were able to convince farmers of several villagers to sell their land to the government under GO 123 in the initial stages for most of the projects except parts of Vemulaghat and Etigaddakishtapur under Mallannasagar and parts of Bailampur, Mamidyal and Thanedarpally under Kondapochamma.

5a12a4149855b76bf13e10ed,The disease that just won’t go away,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-disease-that-just-wont-go-away/article19520832.ece,2017-08-19,"At 17, Rohim Sarkar weighs as much as the average 11-year-old. When shirtless, each of the seven pairs of bones that make up his upper ribcage is visible from five feet away. An attending doctor at the Habibpur block hospital in Malda, West Bengal feels his spleen and the verdict is clear: VL, he declares, followed by two other colleagues jotting the verdict and leading the boy aside for a confirmatory dipstick test, a detailed set of photographs, a skin biopsy and a recommendation that he immediately begin treatment.Sarkar presented symptoms considered typical of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), or kala-azar, a disease that is endemic to a contiguous blob of districts spanning West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Caused by the Leishmania donovani parasite, harboured by an insect called the sandfly, the Habibpur block, barely 30 km from Bangladesh, is considered particularly vulnerable to kala-azar outbreaks.A parasitic diseaseKala-azar is a parasitic disease that is confined to humans, meaning that unlike, say, bird flu, there is no other animal that harbours the infection in Asia. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent in 119 districts in four countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal), India itself accounts for half the global burden of the disease. If untreated, kala-azar can kill within two years of the onset of the ailment, though the availability of a range of drugs for almost a century has meant that less than 1 in 1,000 now succumb to the disease. According to numbers from the Union Health Ministry, 2016 was the first year that no kala-azar death was reported in India. Experts, however, note that like malaria and several other vector-borne diseases in India, the government only considers lab-confirmed and officially registered deaths and therefore, frequently underestimates both caseload and mortality.Historically, a 20-day treatment schedule with sodium stibogluconate (SSb) injection and the spraying of the malarial insecticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethan (DDT) in houses and surroundings were the only weapons against the disease.When DDT was used as part of the malaria eradication programme, very few cases of kala-azar were reported. When the use of DDT was stopped a few years later, there was an increase in the number of kala-azar cases.Over a period of time, resistance to the only drug (SSb injection) led to frequent outbreaks and fatalities and the Union Health Ministry, which had committed to eliminating kala-azar by 2010, revised it to 2015. Bangladesh, India and Nepal committed to eliminate the disease from the region, where elimination (as opposed to eradication) is defined as no more than one case per 10,000 population at the upazila level in Bangladesh, sub-district (block PHC) level in India and district level in Bhutan and Nepal.Since 2003, Indias National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) is in charge of coordinating with endemic States to eliminate the disease. With funds from a World Bank-supported project (2008-2013), the NVBDCP now funds consultants at State and district level and Kala-azar Technical Supervisors (KTS) at the States blocks (or clusters of village panchayats) to conduct active surveillance. That means local village health workers (Accredited Social Health Activists or ASHAs) are entrusted with constantly visiting houses and looking for patients who may present symptoms of the disease and alert health authorities.Several new medical advances have aided the fight against kala-azar. A rapid diagnostic test, called rK39 can  with a pinprick of blood  indicate the presence of the parasite. With SSb injection on the decline, there are now two mainline drugs, miltefosine  originally conceived as an anti-cancer drug and taken orally  and liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), a drug that once needed to be injected at regular intervals over four weeks but now only requires a single shot. These, besides an array of genetic tests that have obviated the need for painful jabs to the spleen and liver to confirm the presence of parasites, and global and national political commitment in terms of funding research and drug dispensation, has meant that kala-azar may be on the verge of being stamped out. However the 2015 elimination target was missed and postponed to September 2017, again a deadline that wont be met. This, in spite of the number of kala-azar patients plummeting from 36,000 in 2005 to 2,969 in 2017, according to Central government figures.At the campSarkar is one of 57 residents whove made it to the Habibpur hospital as part of biannual medical camps organised as part of the active surveillance process. About 160 were expected but a bus strike has thwarted attendance. West Bengal, like the other endemic States, was to have eliminated kala-azar in 2015, but is set to miss the deadline this year too despite the number of patients in the State coming down from 2,700 in 2005 to less than 50 as of this July.Among the camp attendees, seated on the rows of wooden benches that made up the capacious common hall of the hospital, Sarkar was the only one who presented the typical symptoms  the emaciation, anaemia and signs of a puffed spleen  that have helped doctors quickly ferret out kala-azar cases for almost a century. More than Sarkar, however, what worried the visiting doctors were 20 outwardly healthy occupants of those benches. Most were once kala-azar patients and, as the doctors who screened them found, are stricken in various degrees by a mixture of blotches and ulcers on their hands, legs, backs and, sometimes, on their faces.Painless and never known to trigger the fevers and pains typical of parasitical diseases, the blemished skin is the only sign of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). It isnt the kind of disease that prompts villagers of Habibpur block, who besides kala-azar also live under the constant threat of malaria and tuberculosis, to skip farm work or forego a days earnings from manual labour, to line up outside hospitals. One of the patients with PKDL told me that the only reason he wanted treatment was because he was looking to get married, says Dr. Mitali Chatterjee, a medical doctor and researcher at the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research (IPGME&R), Seth Sukhlal Karnani Memorial Hospital, Kolkata, which is known informally as the PG hospital.PKDL results from the parasites left over from a kala-azar infection that couldnt be slain by the chemical cocktails used to treat kala-azar. Though harmless, the pigmented skin can provide harbour, says Chatterjee, to the parasites and they can make their way onto other sandflies. Like the anopheles mosquito, the sandfly needs human blood to nourish their larvae and in the process can pass on parasites to new people and trigger a kala-azar infection. Roughly a tenth of those with a history of kala-azar will go on to develop PKDL and, potentially, seed a fresh outbreak. The precise reason for this isnt known yet. In the 1970s or early 80s, VL [kala-azar] had almost disappeared and then there was suddenly an epidemic, says Srija Moulik, a research scholar at IPGME&R, it was later traced back to a single case of PKDL. Theres a paper on that.Case and cure filesThe earliest empirical evidence for a link between PKDL as a silent agent provocateur for kala-azar outbreaks and DDT sprays came in the 1990s from C.P. Thakur, a physician and now a BJP Rajya Sabha MP. He reported an unusual trend in kala-azar cases in Bihar. Between 1970 and 1989, 530 individuals were confirmed with PKDL at the Patna Medical College (PMC), with the number of cases rocketing from two in 1970 to 59 in 1989. This was in contrast to no cases of this disease being reported at the PMC from 1958-1970. In the period 1977-1990, there were 3,01,076 cases of kala-azar reported in Bihar alone, with a mortality rate of over 2% (compared with 31,074 cases and a mortality rate below 0.4% for the rest of India). It seems possible, that once DDT spraying stopped, the re-establishment of large sandfly populations and infection of these vectors, largely as a result of them feeding on cases of PKDL, provoked the resurgence of kala-azar, Thakur and co-author K. Kumar reported in the June 1992 edition of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology .Even though this link between kala-azar and PKDL was hinted at since 1922, it wasnt until 2005 that the World Health Organization (WHO) and health authorities in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan (who together account for 90% of kala-azar cases) began concerted efforts to eliminate PKDL, as part of kala-azar elimination strategies.In a round-up of the countrys progress in dealing with the disease, at a conference in Bengaluru earlier this year, Chatterjee showed a slide illustrating that in spite of the rapid dive in kala-azar cases across endemic States, PKDL cases in Bihar, which bears 70% of Indias kala-azar burden, had risen to 500 from nil in 2013; from 300 in 2013 to 900 in 2017 in Jharkhand and 50 to 250 in West Bengal, in the same period. To Chatterjee, however, the rise in cases indicates States increased efforts to find kala-azar patients and hidden PKDL cases becoming manifest.At the IPGME&R, one of the nodal research medical labs in Kolkata thats part of the kala-azar surveillance-detection-and-analysis network, scientists are finding out through DNA analysis that the leishmaniasis parasite is an extremely resilient entity and can be dormant in the body and seed infections even after as many as five years.The group of mostly-women scientists, who are trying to cleave apart the mysteries of the parasite, are located a five-minute walk away from a modest building that once hosted the laboratory of Sir Ronald Ross, the India-born British Nobel Laureate who established that mosquitoes were responsible for transmitting malaria. Ross was also the one who christened the kala-azar parasite as Leishmania donovani , after the scientist duo that discovered them.Over the days spent peering through blood samples and skin biopsies from medical camps such as at Malda, Moulik points to yet another possible chink in the governments artillery to weed out kala-azar. The single injection of LAmB, which is now used to treat kala-azar, dramatically reduces the number of parasites in the blood and can cure the infection. However, when PKDL patients were subjected to the same medicine (targeting the same parasite), it didnt completely clear the parasite load. On the other hand, prior to LAmB, the treatment of choice for kala-azar was miltefosin, which is an oral pill taken over 12 weeks. It usually brought about nausea and other discomfort because of which several patients would quit treatment midway. However Moulik points to data in the lab that shows miltefosin did a superior job in flushing out the parasites from PKDL patients. There is a catch though. The ultra-sensitive probes that Moulik employs can spot parasites only if there are at least 10 of them in a microgram of DNA. It is quite possible that a patient might be well and disease-free for a few years but have a miniscule amount of parasites that will multiply at an opportune time in, say, five years, and then radiate the vicious cycle of outbreaks and epidemics that has undermined anti-kala-azar programmes through the years. I believe that if parasite loads go down to 10, the bodys immune system should ideally stave off infection but this is indeed the million-dollar question: How long till we are sure that the parasite loads never increase enough to pose a threat? says Moulik.The ground realitiesThe Habibpur hospital, from where IPGME&R gets a significant number of patient samples, is as large as a single-screen movie hall with X-ray machines, photocopiers, beds and a handful of trained nurses. To get to it, one must cross a stream of stagnant water that, according to local residents, swells up during the monsoon. Within several areas of the hospital, debris is piled up. There is a mossy pool of garbage alongside a water cooler that is inaccessible to the most flexible of gymnasts.The block medical officer is a busy man who must, alongside coordinating a kala-azar camp, dragoon the same set of field workers to fan out into the villages looking for tuberculosis, malaria and leprosy patients. Since 2015, when the government authorities woke up to the urgency of eliminating PKDL, patients are being given financial incentives. All those who complete the course of treatment will get Rs. 2,500 (and the medicines made available through the WHO network) and the village field staff, consisting of ASHAs and KTSs, stand to get Rs. 500 for every such patient. If financial incentives are given, then we get patients, says a doctor who has been part of several field camps, but almost never has a district medical officer accompanied us. They are supposed to.English Mohanpur, an inexplicably-named village a few km away from the hospital, is a slushy hamlet between rice fields. Several tribal communities populate its interiors and Koel, an ASHA worker, says some of the tuberculosis and kala-azar patients also battle alcoholism. Few houses have concrete roofs and fewer still comply with the government directive to spray the houses with the insecticide synthetic pyrethroid, the replacement for DDT. These sprays are needed at regular intervals and need a thorough application in every room including the kitchen. The problem is that the spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell, says Chatterjee. There is also a cluster effect. Families stay very close together and one infected person can spread it to the others.Sripad Mandal, 42, a daily-wage labourer and village resident, was bedridden for three months because of kala-azar. He says he visited the block hospital and was given a course of medicine but that didnt work. He wasnt given a second round of medicine at the hospital and finally had to get himself admitted to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. He now claims to be well. His disease, however, manifested before the government announced financial incentives for completing the treatment. This is the disease of the poorest of the poor. Unless socio-economic conditions are improved and better sanitation is available, I dont see just medicines and drugs completely eradicating kala-azar, says Chatterjee.The problem is that the pyrethroid insecticide spray stinks and people say theyd rather risk kala-azar than bear with the smell.Dr. Mitali Chatterjee,Doctor and researcher, Kolkata"

Fret not, for a new restaurant near you serves this wonderful Japanese dessert that I must admit I was introduced to only a few years ago.It started with a post by a young restaurateur that I think very highly of. Varun Tuli, earlier known for Yum Yum Tree in Friends Colony, had put up these most attractive images of colourful little dollops on a social media site. Turned out they were mochi ice cream, traditionally prepared with sticky rice, with red bean paste or custard inside.I met mochi quite like an old friend at his new restaurant in Khan Market, called Yum Yum Cha, the other evening. The restaurant opened in Cyber Hub and Saket a little while ago, but I went to the just opened Khan Market outlet  and was, as youd expect, floored.The restaurant is beautifully done up, with colourful origami creations hanging from the ceiling. The menu has a collection of Japanese and pan-Asian dishes, and the chef, the manager and the young server all guided me ably through it.Being a pork lover, I thought I should start with the pork belly and jus bao. Next on the agenda was a plate of six rice noodle rolls with spicy prawns. I was tempted by the sushi rolls but moved on to the main course  Japanese curry with crispy prawn and sticky rice and braised pork belly with steamed rice. And then, of course, there was mochi.The bao was excellent, with succulent pieces of pork all dripping with juices. I enjoyed the soft rice noodle rolls, which had been doused with some light soya. The Japanese prawn curry was superb  you put some sticky rice in a bowl, top it with a light broth and then add crispy prawn balls to it. I found the pork pieces just a wee bit stringy, but the mildly sweet gravy was rather nice. And, all in all, the meal was delicious.The mochi ice cream comes in various flavours, and we opted for blueberry and mango. Though I am not greatly fond of ice cream, these scoops were actually as good to eat as they were to look at  like most of Japanese cuisine.By the way, the first ice cream in Japan was produced way back in 1869. Researchers say a scoop then cost an exorbitant amount of 25 yen, though the price plummeted to a yen or so in three decades.Yum Yum Cha is full of young people, all having a good time. There is good reason for that: the place is cheerful, the food is great, and the rates are low for a Khan Market restaurant. For instance, a plate of two baos comes or Rs. 285, six rice noodle rolls with prawns are for Rs. 385 and a platter of eight sushi rolls costs Rs. 685. The hotpots are for Rs. 585 and eight slices of a Japanese pizza for Rs. 485.Gourmet foodYet, the food is gourmet. The toppings on the pizzas, for instance, consist of tuna and truffle, of Peking duck and truffle pepper. Takoyaki, Japanese dumplings (Rs. 385 for six pieces), have fillings of classic octopus, chicken and cheese and peppers. There is even carpaccio  traditionally served raw, but I think it is roasted here  and sashimi rolls of all kinds of fish and other ingredients.The place beckons with all its lights winking alluring at you from one corner of Khan Market. The entrance is through the middle lane (closer from the Sham Di Hatti side). The address is Shop 69, First and Second Floor, Middle Lane, Khan Market (Tel nos: 011-41523030/011-41525050). I was invited, but the publicist tells me that a meal for two, without taxes, comes for Rs. 1800 or so. The place doesnt have a bar licence yet.Try it out. Young Tuli knows his onions  and his nori."

Hence, rice production in the district may be adversely affected this year.Somasundra, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu that paddy was grown in over 88,740 hectares during 2015-16 and there was a rice production of over 3,00,709 tonnes during the year. He said that over 35.67 quintal rice was produced per hectare last year and he said farmers had grown paddy in many taluks despite drought.The Agriculture Department, at the behest of the State government, is prevailing upon farmers not to cultivate paddy this year owing to failure of rain.The department, through Raitha Samparka Kendras (farmer contact centres), and through other various other platforms had insisted the farmers not to grow paddy this season and it also made it clear that government was not responsible if farmers grew paddy and the crop got damaged for want of water.Apart from instructing the farmers not to grow any water intensive crop such as paddy, and sugarcane, the department had also called upon the farmers to grow ragi, hybrid maize, jowar, pulses, cotton, and oil seeds, which require less water. Many farmers had cultivated the above crops in most parts of the district. Hence, most of the farmers did not take up paddy this season and only a small number of farmers in the rain-fed area and are dependent on their borewells have cultivated paddy this season, Mr. Somasundra said. He said that water being let into the canals would be used to fill the tanks for drinking purposes.In K.R. Nagar taluk, paddy cultivation is down to 2,384 hectares as against the target of 26,500 hectares, in Mysuru it is 160 hectares as against the target of 8,000 hectares, while in Nanjangud only 53 hectares has been brought under paddy cultivation this year as against the target of 17,000 hectares.

This year, festivities span 12 days, including two weekends. Pandal-hoppers will have more time to visit popular venues next week once the household idols are immersed.The fourth day of the bright half of Bhadrapad is observed as Ganesh Chaturthi. Mandals and households are expected to perform the 'pran pratishtha' ceremony during Friday's puja mahurat spanning 11.25am through 1.55pm. Priests advise devotees to avoid setting eyes on the moon this day.Households which host the lord for a day-and-half also craft laboriously creative tableaux. Preparations begin up to two months in advance. Families make offerings of red hibiscus flowers, durva grass, coconut and, of course, the lord's favourite modak sweet made either from rice or wheat flour, mawa, chocolate and dried fruit.This year, the historic edge is unmistakable in Pune as well as Mumbai. It was in 1892-93 that Lokmanya Tilak gave the call for community festivities as a way of mobilising support against British rule.

Khadilkar Lane, where the chawl is located, is lit with a canopy of lights. Inside, a replica of the Ganpatipule temple has been built for the 2.25-ft-tall idol. In an era when pandals spend Rs 50lakh to Rs 60 lakh on decoration, here for the first time Keshavji Naik chawl is spending Rs 18 lakh as compared to the regular Rs 3lakh to Rs 4 lakh.""State Bank of India chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya will inaugurate celebrations on Friday.

We have sought bringing branded rice also under 0% GST.Similarly, rice bran sold for solvent purposes attracts 5% GST while there is no tax on bran meant for cattle or poultry feed. More than half the volume goes to the feed industry. GST on bran should be removed, he said.K.S. Jagadeesan, former president of the Tamil Nadu Federation of Rice Mill Owners and Paddy, Rice Dealers Association, said southern States are major rice consumers.Awareness on rice brands had been high in Tamil Nadu and there are more than 100 brands in the State, he said. It is the Government that supported and encouraged millers in Kangeyam to modernise mills and develop brands. We did that and now branded rice attracts 5%. This increases the cost of rice, according to Mr. Jagadeesan."

Their joy knew no bounds with sprouts emerging from the clay idols worshipped by them on the Chaturthi day, shunning harmful plaster of Paris and chemical paints under the guidance of their teachers.The whole effort is to kindle the students interest in returning to the traditional way of celebrating the festival in a pollution-free environment, explains school correspondent G.

About 500 kg of rice has been arranged in a pattern to get the attractive image of Lord Ganesha, explains festival organising committee convenor Bezawada Poornachandra Rao.Devotees at Ranguthota here toiled for 10 days to make a gigantic Ganesh idol with 5,000 miniature clay images of Lord Lambodara by arranging them in a pattern. Instead of taking the Ganesh idol in a procession, we will dissolve it using water in our colony itself on September 3, the immersion day, says Mr. Kuppam Prasad, president of Ranthuthota Bala Bakta Samajam.With sediments collected from the revered River Ganga, the Society for Awareness and Vision on Environment (SAVE) churned out hundreds of grandiose environment-friendly Ganesh idols with, among other ingredients, bamboo sticks, paddy straw and husk, to satisfy the desire of devotees keen on putting mega idols in their apartments and street corners on the occasion.Jute bags and handloom cloth were given free of cost to the devotees as part of a conscious effort to prod devotees to shun plastic on the one hand and provide employment to artisans and handloom weavers on the other, said SAVE convenor M. Rachana."

(Top) Flood-hit residents of Muzaffarpur in Bihar go in search of dry land. (Below) Tents on National Highway-77 in Sitamarhi district provide temporary relief.Ranjeet KumarThe whirring sound of moving rotor blades of the helicopter in the sky alerts everyone in the colony on the Buddha Nagara Radha embankment in Mushahari block of Muzaffarpur district in Bihar. This is a colony only five days old. Marooned by floodwaters from all sides, breached at two places, the 10-feet-wide embankment has become a new colony of flood-hit victims  a ragtag cluster of hastily erected bamboo shanties and tarpaulin tents precariously perched even as the swirling waters of the Burhi Gandak greedily nibble away stretches of earth.With arms aloft and eyes looking up to the sky and ears adjusting to the sound of the helicopter blades, the new settlers hope for something to fall from above  sign of some helping hand from the State government. But the helicopter soon becomes a blip. Hope is quickly displaced with despair. Its our fate that this government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisis, Sudha Devi, sitting under a tatty awning, says.Life on an embankmentStretched over 10 km from Dumri to Buddha Nagara Radha to Rajwara, the embankment is the lifeline for the flood-hit villagers, mostly poor and daily-wage agricultural labourers. The devastating floods having snatched away almost everything, they took refuge here clutching their meagre belongings. Some managed to rescue their cows, buffaloes and goats, now tied to a bamboo keel by the side of their shanties. Blank wooden cots, torn plastic mats, a few utensils and earthen stoves make up the rest of their possessions. Land is scarce and the first one to reach gets the right to erect a tent. Latecomers frantically vie for vacant spots. We waited till we lost everything now life is on loan, says Dinesh Thakur, an agricultural labourer.More than 50,000 people have taken shelter on this embankment built in 1954. If this had not been here, imagine our fate, says Subodh Kumar Suman, a primary school teacher of Roshanpur Chakki. His village and school are under water but he has been helping fellow victims settle down on this embankment.Suman offers us a ride on his motorcycle from one breached place of the embankment to another. At both the breached places  Rajwara and Rohua  villagers are scrambling to get on the motor boats run by two different teams of the National Disaster Response Force to cross the river. It is a stampede-like situation but there is little one can do to bring order. An NDRF man helming a motor boat appears helpless as he ferries more people beyond the prescribed capacity of eight. Yes, its a risk of life but what are our options? he says.There is no sign of government or non-government relief reaching out to those taking shelter on Buddha Nagara Radha embankment. The electricity in the entire area has snapped and no official has bothered to visit. Their meagre food ration has run out. The survivors talk about how they eat snails, fish and rats anything they can lay their hands on, and drink the floodwaters, use mobile phones as torches and wait for days for help to reach them from somewhere. No one comes here wholl come to this death trap surrounded by floodwaters on all sides with the bund breached at two places? says Lal Babu Rai of Manika Chand village, which shares boundaries with the embankment.At several places on the embankment the flood-hit new settlers crowd around us mistaking us for government officials. The government has not given us the black tarpaulin sheets to cover our heads which people of other flood-affected areas have got what to talk of food or anything else! Were left at the mercy of the elements, says Ram Pravesh Kumar. His father Sivan Bhagat is ill and had taken to the only cot the family has. Life for us here is hellworse than hell, Bhagat says in a hushed broken tone. He has been suffering from diarrhoea for the past two days.The squalid, filth-ridden narrow pathway on the embankment is marked by open defecation and a fetid stench filling the air. Stray dogs scuttle through the crowded settlement while men and women lounge listlessly under the plastic-covered shanties seeking shade from the oppressive heat and humidity. The swollen floodwaters furiously lap against the walls of the embankment. The dwellers complain of snakebites and swarms of insects who have also made their home here. Diseases like diarrhoea and viral fever have gradually started surfacing.The other challenge is arranging fodder for the cattle. Cows, buffaloes and goats can be seen munching, almost mechanically, without fodder in their mouth. They are starving earlier we waded through the floodwaters to get something for them to eat but now everything is submerged, says Janak Sahni, adding, its a battle to save either our life or our cattle.The government records put animal deaths in the State at 192; compensation of Rs. 30,000 for the loss of every milch cow and buffalo and Rs. 3,000 for a goat has been announced. Its allbakwas(nonsense) when they cannot reach us, how do they know our cattle have died? The government officials make money in the name of relief and compensation to flood victims, complains Thakur.The flood in Muzaffarpur has left the villagers marooned in misery. Even the relatively well-off could be seen queuing for relief food packets distributed by a social organisation named Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation at Rohua. Nobody is sure how long the flood will take to recede... we had never seen anything this big before, says Mahendra Manjhi while taking a packet ofchhura(beaten rice) andgur(jaggery). His family will have to make do with this and a few packets of Parle-G biscuits for the night; tomorrow is another day.Politics of tokenismThe floods in Bihar have rendered 12.6 million people homeless in 21 districts with recorded deaths of over 370 people till August 24. The State government claims to have evacuated over 7,76,000 people. It has also been running 1,385 relief camps and 2,569 community kitchens. Overall, over 4,21,000 people have taken shelter in 1,385 relief camps and around 4,23,000 people are eating in those community kitchens. Altogether 28 teams of NDRF with 118 motor boats, 16 teams of the State Disaster Response Force with 92 boats, and seven teams of the Army with 70 boats and two helicopters have been pressed into service for relief and rescue operations in the flood-affected areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to make an aerial visit of the flood-hit areas of north Bihar on Saturday and hold meetings with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has regularly been making aerial surveys of the marooned districts and inspecting relief distribution operations. Opposition parties, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress, have demanded that the Central government declare Bihar floods a national calamity.The tragedy behind this recurring narrative is best explained by flood expert Dinesh Mishra, convenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymaking: Unlike the British, our elected governments do not keep records of movement of rivers they just believe in raising embankments, levees, roads and highways to stop flood and, above all, nobody is held accountable for the floods. Today, floods in Bihar ironically mean distribution of food packets, compensation, aerial surveys by leaders, and misuse of government funds in the name of raising heights and plug-ins of embankments, highways and roads, he says. But what is the solution? Were so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle, says Mishra. Veteran RTI activist Mahendra Yadav, who has been working for the welfare of victims of the 2008 floods in Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul, says, Nobody cares for the flood victims except providing them the customary 1.5 kg packet ofchhura-gurand setting up these unhygienic relief camps. He rues that forget the government, even NGOs distributes relief materials to places where they can reach conveniently.Highway to despairThis looks true as we travel on National Highway-57, which connects Muzaffarpur to Purnea. Hundreds of thousands of flood-hit people have taken shelter near Darbhanga on both sides of the highway under black tarpaulin-covered tent houses. Here, theyre not as unlucky as those living on the Budha Nagara Radha embankment in Muzaffarpur. Someone had come to distribute this black polythene to us, says Garbu Ram, who along with his family of eight members took shelter here after torrents of floodwater gushed into his village Kumarpatti, 15 km from Darbhanga town. Until a fortnight ago Ram had a thatched house, three goats, a cow and Rs. 4,000 in hand, but today he is penniless, living with his family under a temporary canopy of black tarpaulin. Most of the areas in Darbhanga-Madhubani districts are flooded this year. Like Ram, over 50 other families of his village too have made NH-57 their home for the past 10 days.Just inches away from the speeding trucks, lorries, luxury coaches, vans, cars and SUVs passing on the highway, the flood-affected families live in constant danger of being crushed. Their buffaloes, cows and goats loitering around are at greater risk. At night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past, says Ram Bhajan Sahu, who, along with his family of 12, has taken shelter on NH-57. All the time we hold them tightly to our chests, he says of the children in his family.Pointing towards their submerged thatched houses in the nearby Shobhan village, the NH-57 residents say that only three things have been on the rise in the last 10 days: our hunger and debt and the floodwaters. Most of them are daily-wage agricultural labourers who make 50-60 rupees a day, but ever since the floods, they have been unable to find any work.A week ago, Manoj Mallick and Ramesh Kumar saw a helicopter dropping food packets at some distance on the highway but before they could reach there, the food was claimed by some passengers on a bus. The government declares that relief camps have been set up for people like us but can you direct me to any of those camps nearby those camps in faraway villages have basically been usurped and controlled by upper-caste, well-off people, says one, adding, They sell the relief stuffs to ration shops and we buy them from there, paying money borrowed from well-off people on heavy interest.On National Highway-77, which connects Vaishali to Sitamarhi, the flood-hit families are living in rows under black tarpaulin sheets near Basaitpur bridge of Runni Saidpur block, badly affected by the swirling waters of the Bagmati and Lakhandayee rivers this year. There is just one handpump half a km away for drinking water. About 500 families have taken shelter on the highway but no one has come to take notice if it persists for a few more days, well die of hunger one by one, says Sanjay Ram. His newborn baby is sleeping just few inches away inside the tent from the speeding tyres of vehicles on the highway. A child aged nine met with an accident a few days ago with a speeding bus but survived miraculously. As a precaution, the highway dwellers have put cement boulders, bricks, banana stems and logs outside their dwellings to keep the speeding vehicles at bay.The condition of Sanjay Rams neighbours on the highway, Shambhu Manjhi and Ramesh Manjhi, are quite similar. They have been surviving on a handful of chhura-gur and snails and fish caught from the floodwaters. In 2004, there was a similar flood that hit Sitamarhi. At that time, the highway was in a poor, dilapidated condition. But the restoration work on this stretch in the intervening years has now helped those fleeing the floodwaters. At least here we can hide our head and wait for someone to come with a packet ofchhuraandgur, says Ram. He and other families also fear the dark for another reason: antisocial elements are on the prowl.As darkness falls, silence descends on NH-77. Suddenly, a van materialises laden withkhichdi(a mash of rice and lentil). The highway dwellers quickly surround it, but the van suddenly picks up speed and vanishes into the darkness. Life has been a cruel joke for us, says Sanjay Ram as another hungry night beckons and they all trudge back to the tarpaulin tents they call home.This government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisisSudha DeviFlood victimWere so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle.Dinesh MishraConvenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymakingAt night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past.

Would you rather go for a cheesy burger or grab a bowl of freshly cut fruits instead, in order to deal with your hunger pangs on campus? Bangalore Times went around colleges to find out what sort of food is served to students and here is what we found...While many colleges do offer traditional south Indian breakfast like Idly, Vada, Dosa and Pongal, there are also dishes such as Poori Bhaji, Chapatti, Bread Omlette, roti and sabzi that students opt for. Lunches usually consist of variations of Fried Rice, dal and rice and vegetable combos or thalis. On the other hand, some colleges also offer biryanis (both non-vegetarian and vegetarian) and pastas for lunch. But when it comes to snacks, junk food mostly takes precedence over healthy snacks. Chips, chocolates, soft drinks, Fried Bhajjis, Puffs, Brownies, Fries, along with noodles is the popular choice. Tanya Bagga, a third-year student from Jain University  CMS, says, ""There are lots of options in our college canteen such as sandwiches, burgers, pizza, juices, fruit salads, fries and such. I, however, mostly opt for sandwiches because it is good option and healthy because they use fresh vegetables and cheese. For an even more healthy option, there are fruit salads too.""Some students, though, make the most of the healthy options available in their canteens or mess. ""The food that we get is quite good. It's reasonable and tastes good too. The menu has expanded recently and includes a lot more items such as Chole Kulche, Pav Bhaji, Samosa, Masala Toast, Dosa, Bread Omelet, Parantha, Chicken Biryani, Rice, Chapati and more,"" says Souvik Mandal, a student from Symbiosis Institute of Business Management, Bengaluru, adding that though the focus in his college is on homemade food, in the cafeteria you do get items like chips, puffs and more.Though students think that there is a lot of junk food available in their respective college canteens, teachers feel that in spite of junk food, there are lots of healthy dishes available that students can choose from. ""I think the food you get over here in the canteen is really good. Junk food is there, but there are different combinations of hygienic food as well. It is the choice of the individuals to take what they want. You cannot force them. We have all kinds of food ranging from Roti and Sabzi, including normal junk food that you get everywhere,"" says Professor Jagadish Rao, of New Horizon College of Engineering.Students from the same college, however, disagree and say that though there has been an improvement in the past two year, more needs to be done. ""According to me, the food here is not hygienic at all. It is definitely better than what we used to get before around two years ago. But I do not think that the food is up to the level,"" says Gayathri T, a third-year student from the same college.When asked if colleges should include healthy options like salads and soups, students feel that though it may be healthy, it may not be filling. ""Salads and other healthy dishes don't really fill your stomach for the day. And being a student, we wouldn't want to spend more money for something that is not going to fill our stomach for long,"" says Mahima Bijlani, a final-year student, St Joseph's College.Nutrition and wellness consultant Sheela Krishnaswamy says that there are two things when it comes to the canteen food. ""There seems to be good healthy options when it comes to breakfasts and lunches. However, when it comes to snacks, healthier options like fruit salads, sprout salads, puffed rice, dhokla and usal can be included."" She adds, ""Institutions need to wean of dishes like noodles that are high in fat and maida. They are not high in nutrition at all.""But she also says that the onus is on students as well to make healthier choices. ""Students, too, need to make healthy choices. Once in a while, it is fine to have soft drinks and noodles but they hardly have any nutrition in them. Once the demand for junk food reduces gradually, the vendors or the management can cut down on the supply of junk food,"" says Sheela, adding, ""Dishes like pastas and pizzas can be made healthy. Instead of maida-based pastas, whole wheat pastas can be used with lots of vegetables and paneer and cheese for proteins. Pizzas, on the other hand, can be a better option if whole wheat base is used along with lots of vegetables."""

Though they will submit demand draft to the civil supplies authorities for month of November, they will not lift the stocks.Ration dealers in the state will go on a strike from November 1 as part of the nationwide strike call given by their apex body , demanding a uniform system of implementation. Presently, the commission rates for the dealers vary from state to state, and even the number of commodities sold through FP shops vary. On their part, the Telangana ration dealers are demanding monthly honorarium of Rs 35,000 in villages, Rs 40,000 in mandal head quarters, Rs 50,000 in municipalities and Rs 60,000 in GHMC limits.Leaders of dealers association said the rent of just one room (mulgi) in GHMC limits is Rs 10,000. Also, though the commission is Rs 70 per quintal, the state government is not paying them due to which the arrears have accumulated to nearly Rs 400 crore, they said.Telangana State Ration Dealers Welfare Association president Nayikoti Raju told TOI that the new pattern i.e., introduction of EPoS, electronic weighing machines, portability and other measures by the authorities have largely shrunk their revenues but the ir expenses have increased on the other hand. The transportation and hamali charges are also borne by the dealers.""The FP shop dealers should be paid Rs 70 commission on each quintal of rice. Of the total, Rs 35 is central government share and remaining Rs 35 is state share. In addition to this the central government has stated that Rs 17 should be paid for every quintal towards maintenance charges. But this commission is not being paid in full by the Telangana government and the arrears have mounted to nearly Rs 400 crore,"" Raju said.Civil supplies officials said they were confident of reaching an understanding with the FP shop dealers and persuading them to withdrawal strike proposal. The State government is positively considering their demands."

Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar has already stated that the government is planning to extend paddy cultivation to 1,000 acres in the Aranmula puncha and surrounding fields this year.The Special Officer of the Mission Green Aranmula project appointed by the government, J. Sajeev, told The Hindu that the department could launch cultivation in 250 acres in the puncha last year to produce rice worth Rs. 1.18 crore.Paddy cultivation was held in 250 acres of land in the Aranmula puncha against the original target of 56 ha, that too, at a far lower cost of Rs. 81 lakh against the original estimate of Rs. 154 lakh, sources said.Bonus cropThe government would provide financial relief worth Rs. 30,000 a hectare to the farmers groups (Padashekhara Samiti) and the Uma variety of paddy would be sown in the puncha, Mr. Sajeev said. Interestingly, the paddy seeds that had dropped in the fields during the harvest had sprouted and flourished well, without any fertilizers, to provide the peasants a bonus, amply indicating the natural soil fertility, said Ananthakumar, a Padashekhara Samiti leader.The Padashekhara Samiti has successfully launched cultivation in 14 acres of land that was previously included in the site marked for the controversial Aranmula airport project.Restoration of streamFarmers feel that the restoration of the Karimaramthode natural stream and the Aranmula-chaal, a major water reservoir, to their original condition was a must for the successful and smooth conduct of paddy farming in Aranmula Puncha.The district administration completed almost 90% of the stream restoration work a few months ago. Delay in carrying out the final leg of work has left the natural stream stagnant.Mr. Sajeev said that cultivation would begin in October itself."

The residents of the same colony come onto the street as their homes remain flooded. (Left) A girl walking in waist-deep water.G. RamakrishnaEast Anand Bagh Colony, parts of Malkajgiri, low-lying areas of Nacharam and Uppal were flooded on Thursday after water from Banda Cheruvu flooded its banks sending swirling waters racing through the streets into homes and residential colonies.I reached office at 4 p.m. when my mother called asking me not to go back in the night as the area was flooded. I was shocked. When I reached home, it was like Venice with cars floating, said Yeshwant, a program manager for Amazon, who stays in the worst-affected East Anand Bagh Colony.Dip in water levelCivic officials hurriedly tore down walls of the nala near Anand Bagh High School which finally led to dip in water level after nearly 26 hours of hellish experience for the residents.My home is between the lake and the nala. About a year ago, a wall was raised on the nala and today, the water from the lake filled up the surrounding area. Even the newly-constructed houses on the lake bed have been flooded, said Yeshwant.A series of satellite images between 2000 and 2016 show how the lake has been gobbled up by land sharks. According to the civic body officials, the 102-acre lake has shrunk to 39 acres. An earlier estimate put the number of encroachments at 500, but 700 more have come up, said an activist.Overflowing lakesBanda Cheruvu is a downstream lake of Ramarishnapuram and Safilguda lakes. Once the two lakes overflowed, the surplus water entered Banda Cheruvu which overflowed flooding the surrounding colonies.The rain began in the evening at around 4 p.m. and by 7 p.m., the water level started rising in the area. None of us slept and the first light showed the whole area covered in a sheet of water. It looked like a lake. Only the top of my car was visible. We stay in the first floor, so we didnt suffer any loss, said Praveen, who lives in Shirdisai Nagar Colony in East Anand Bagh area of Malkajgiri.From atop the Qadme Rasool hillock, the havoc wrought by water was clearly visible. Houses on almost all sides of the lake were surrounded by water.The water has started to recede only now. Till 5 p.m., we had knee-deep water in our bedroom. All the rice and groceries are spoilt. In the afternoon, a few people served hot food and chutney. But now, I dont know what we are going to eat, said Abdul Sami, whose family lives at Qadme Rasool near Moula Ali.The flooding was not limited to the East Anand Bagh Colony. Parts of Lalapet and Nacharam were also flooded as the water in the nala burst its banks and entered the surrounding localities.Police had to stop traffic on the busy Mallapur-Nacharam Road as the water flowing in the nala threatened to sweep everything in its path.I had to take a long detour and drive through waist-high water to reach my workplace which is just across the flowing water. But now, the water level has reduced and hopefully by night, it should recede to normal level, then I will go home, said Bharat Kumar, who works at a mall."

""This apart, we have to consider improvement of junctions, grade sep arators and underground drainage construction along the routes, apart from shifting utility lines. But the biggest component is land acquisition,"" said Reddy said.The cabinet has also approved a Rs 275-crore plan to study 25 district headquarter cities and towns and plan an outer ring road (ORR) for each of them.""A high-level panel headed by additional chief secretary (UDD) will study the 25 towns and plan construction of ORRs that will bypass them,"" Jayachandra said.The law minister said the committee will study the cities and towns over a period of five years.Government to bring a new law for urban development by merging all existing town and country planning acts with other acts.

These gems of information, however, could be lost forever if not documented in a timely manner.The formation of biodiversity management committees (BMCs) at village-level spells hope for recording the wisdom, expertise and knowledge passed down through the ages, while also spurring an inventory of flora and fauna, and heritage and historical sites for the benefit of future generations.""Of Goa's 190 panchayats, 111 have constituted their village (BMCs) after frequent reminders since 2014. Approximately 20 BMCs have submitted their preliminary drafts of the people's biodiversity register (PBR), which is a record of bio-wealth and traditional knowledge associated with biodiversity,"" said Pradip Sarmokadam, member secretary of the Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB).This is a preliminary yet significant step to protect every village's bio-wealth before rapid development destroys natural resources. The threat to bio-resources and products made from thembarring 588 daily-use commoditiesbeing exploited for commercial purposes also looms large.While the Biological Diversity Act was enacted by the Indian Parliament in 2002, rules for Goa were notified only this year. And despite the GSBB being formed in 2004, progress has been slow. Not a single BMC for protection of the state's unique ecosystems and endangered and critically threatened species was formed till 2014, largely due to administrative apathy and lack of cooperation from panchayats. The GSBB prodded the panchayat bodies into action only during last few years.Village BMCs compiling PBRs have multiple benefits for the environment, society and communities. ""The committees document different medicinal plants, practitioners, fish species, organic agriculture, and people involved in various occupations with knowledge of unique traditions and culture,"" Joseph Vaz, a BMC member of Rachol panchayat, said.The documentation will also prove to be a boon for authorities seeking geographical indication status (GIS) for various natural assets. This, in turn, can ensure conservation of biodiversity through sustainable utilisation and ensure equitable sharing of benefits among local people.""The board has proposed GI status for khatkhatem, a recipe unique to Goa, and maddachi (coconut) feni. A few others herbs, rice varieties like korgut, pulses like alsande (cow peas) among others, could also find place in the assets sought to be accorded GI status,"" Sarmokadam said.The state-wide exercise is also an assessment of threats from human impact or interference to heavily exploited resources. ""BMCs will help us to know if we have plants or other species that are vulnerable or on the verge of extinction and what we need to do to nullify the threats,"" Antonio Mascarenhas, a GSBB member, said.Mascarenhas pointed out that if one were to take a section from atop the Western Ghats to the coast, the most vulnerable appears to be the coastline. ""Other natural assets such as forests and water bodies can be restored, but beach dune systems, which are the most vulnerable of all ecosystems, are difficult to restore. Yet, they are being destroyed on a daily basis,"" he said.The GSBB is compiling a book on tradeable and potentially tradeable bio-resources of Goathe first of its kind to assist various stakeholders. It is also documenting the sacred groves and traditional healers of Goa, besides preparing a book on Panaji's biodiversity."

Most tribespeople lack a balanced diet consisting of iron, carbohydrates and proteins.K.K. MustafahK_K_Mustafah;K_K_Mustafah -Unlike in the past when poverty and malnutrition had caused a large number of infant deaths in the tribal regions of Attappady, congenital anomalies or birth defects are now taking a toll on the newborns here.Thirteen newborns have died of birth defects since January this year in the Attappady block which forms part of Mannarkkad Assembly constituency.In 2016, only eight cases of infant deaths were reported from the region. Health Department officials say this is the highest figure since 2015.In this largest tribal settlement in Kerala, most infant deaths this year was of birth defects related to heart, lungs and oesophagus. Though no maternal death was reported last year, a case was reported this year.Health officials confirm that foetal deaths also remain high in the region and six deaths have been reported so far this year. In the previous year, the number was eight.The deaths occur despite the implementation of a number of multi-crore projects to prevent poverty and malnutrition. We are also implementing a number of projects to enhance maternal health. The region requires serious studies to address this situation, said nodal medical officer Prabhudas.Death of 2-day-old babyOnly two weeks ago, a two-day-old child born to tribal couple Santhosh and Anita of Chindakki hamlet died of Jejunal Atresia, a birth defect that causes intestinal blockages.The Health Department has initiated steps to appoint an expert committee to look into the sudden rise of congenital anomalies among tribal babies of the region. After finding that lack of nutrition among pregnant mothers and adolescent girls as main cause for the high infant mortality rate, government has been implementing many schemes including the community kitchen in which nutritious meal is supplied for free.While most of the kitchens are providing only cooked rice and one variety of pulses daily, there is a demand to include milk, egg, pulses, millets, and quality rice in the scheme regularly.The continuing deaths expose the hollowness in the governments flawed vision on tribal welfare. What is happening in the region is a combined effect of poverty, lack of employment, land alienation, failure to provide forest rights, loss of traditional agriculture and loss of indigenous food. There must be a comprehensive vision to address the tribal issue of the region, says tribal activist K.A. Ramu.In the past, tribespeople had access to a variety of wild greens, tubers, pulses and millets. Now they lack a balanced diet consisting of iron, carbohydrates and proteins."

The gesture is expected to go a long way in setting an example for others to contribute to society in one way or another.The initiative, taken up by the farmers, was prompted by the efforts of former Medical Education and Irrigation Minister P. Sudharshan Reddy to build a good relationship between rural masses and future doctors. Its a small effort to make the future doctors responsible towards the society at a time when private healthcare is unaffordable for the poor, said Mr. Reddy.At the 500-member student management hostel, with a considerable number of girls, attached to the GMC, less than 50% of students get scholarship and fee reimbursement. Given this, paying a mess bill of around Rs. 2,500 a month is burdensome, with other expenses.The assistance by the farmers in supplying rice will certainly help the poor students as it would bring down their mess bill. If other philanthropists follow suit, the students will be relieved of a great burden, opined B. Vijay, a final year student.During the harvest, the farmers would keep aside paddy and send the same to specified rice mills. It would be converted into a fine variety rice and supplied to the hostel once in 15 days. Three rice mills have been identified for milling, storing and supplying the rice to the medical college hostel, Mr. Sudharshan Reddy told The Hindu .Suri Babu, a farmer from Bodhan, has announced 20 bags of rice as donation while about 20 farmers in Yedapally mandal have offered 100 bags. Muppa Ganga Reddy, a farmer in Mopal mandal, said he would donate five quintals of rice as his share. Given the response, the donation is likely to cross 500 quintals.L.

For many devout Hindus, fasting is an integral aspect of Navratri, especially in the Western parts of India. In fact, around this time of the year, many cooking blogs and cooking shows come up with a mind boggling variety of vrat or fasting foods  dishes that are technically allowed to be eaten while officially fasting. In retrospect, foodies tend to feast on fasting-dishes. The speciality of Navratri fasts is that the usual grains like rice and wheat are avoided. Some nutritionists deem the Navratri fast as a healthy detox since not only are the food items nutritious, they are gluten-free, high in fibre and low on fats, light on the stomach, and easy to digest. Grains, especially whole grains like millets, wheat, etc. slow down the process of digestion, that's why these are eliminated. Much importance is given to the consumption of daily products, fruits, juices, and light vegetables. Religious sentiment apart, fasting should be planned to be healthy rather than gorging on deep-fried snacks or carbohydrate rich food like potatoes, sago, buckwheat, etc. Fasting can detoxify your body, provided you have healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, low fat yogurt, nuts, seeds, milk, milk products and unsweetened beverages. It helps to by giving rest to the vital aspects of the digestive system. The benefits of fasting are purification of the gastro-intestinal tract, cleansing of the surrounding organs and balancing of the metabolic constituents.The gastric juices work to remove cholesterol from the system instead of digesting food during fasting. The respite to the intestines and related organs enable them to function better later.Many see fasting as an opportunity to merge devotion with practicing a lifestyle that can help one detox.The idea is to stay away or avoid processed food items as much as possible; which explains the preference of natural, unprocessed rock salt - sendha namak - over the regular, iodised, table salt. Similarly, gluten-free, and packed with nutrition - buckwheat flour is preferred to ordinary wheat-flour. Another ingredient that attains great importance during navratri and has now become one of the newest superfoods is amaranth (rajgira). Popular in the laddoos and chikki form, it is gluten free, enriched with antioxidants and essential vitamins and minerals.Avoid full-cream milk or preparations of condensed milk. Indulge in vegetables that are rich in Vitamins A, B and C. Eat a lot of fruits that flush the liver of cholesterol accumulation. Apple, orange, papaya, guava, pomegranate, lemon juice and pear especially help to bring down cholesterol.And to boost the detox, begin the day with lemon juice with lukewarm water. Soaked almonds and raisins add a healthy nutritious kick. Preparations of bottle gourd, pumpkin, fruits such as apple, pear, cucumber, phul makhane (puffed lotus seed) are advisable.Make a healthy choice, influenced by a tinge of religion; and chalk out a healthy fasting plan to make this Navratri a detoxifying ritual in all aspects  spiritually and physically.UMA CHODAVARAPU"

Kamalakannan on Monday accused the Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi of complicating the decision of the Puducherry Government in waiving the loans availed by around 5,000 farmers from the cooperative banks in the Union Territory.He told presspersons here that a decision was taken at a meeting of the cabinet to waive loans totalling Rs. 22 crore availed by farmers from cooperative institutions. The file relating to the decision was sent to Ms. Bedi. However, she returned the file with a query.The Lieutenant Governor wanted to know whether the waiver was restricted only to cooperative loans and why it should not cover the loans drawn from nationalised and commercial banks. Ms. Bedi had sent the file to the Government of India for clarification. The matter has been complicated by the Lieutenant Governor and the Puducherry government is not able to implement the decision, he said.Centres decisionMr. Kamalakannan pointed out that the waiver of farm loans from nationalised and commercial banks related to the policy decision of the Centre. The last such farm loan waiver was done during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) rule. He said that the Puducherry governments decision to waive cooperative farm loans was within the purview of the government. Governments in the past had waived crop loans and the decision was ratified by the Centre.The Centre had now sought a clarification from the Chief Secretary on whether the government would be able to bear the expenditure. Mr. Kamalakannan alleged that Ms. Bedis decision to forward the file to the Centre had complicated the issue. The government had not been able to waive the loans or sanction fresh loans over the last 15 months.Mr. Kamalakannan said that Ms. Bedi had sought a clarification from the government on disbursement of rice under the Public Distribution System (PDS) for Above Poverty Line (APL) ration cardholders. The abrupt withdrawal of rice would not be feasible and an elected government would become unpopular as a consequence, he said."

MoorthyG_MoorthyA steady decline in consumption of millets was a matter of growing concern, said speakers at the eighth edition of Madurai Symposium here on Friday.Entrepreneurs, farmers and scholars discussed emerging trends in processing and value addition of millets. Speaking to The Hindu , M. Karthikeyan, Programme Leader of Rainfed Farming Development at DHAN Foundation, said millet industry faced three problems - low production, difficulties in processing, and lack of popularity among general public.Millets could be grown in any area were rain-fed crops were raised. They were drought resistant, he said. The theme of the symposium is Building resilience for sustaining growth.N. Varadharaju, Head of Post Harvest Technology Centre at Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, said non-availability of subsidies discouraged farmers from raising millets such as proso, barnyard, foxtail and kodo. Free rice is supplied through Public Distribution System, leading to its large-scale use. Unless this changed and over emphasis on rice is stopped, millets cannot be promoted, he said. Some policy level changes such as Mission for Sustainable Dryland Agriculture (MSDA) were providing farmers with production and processing inputs, said Mr. Karthikeyan.Entrepreneurs T. S. Urmila and R. Rajalakshmi, who sell millets in Madurai and Chennai respectively, said lack of awareness kept people away from their products. Substituting a millet-based item instead of the popular rice or wheat will ensure better health, said Ms. Urmila from Madurai.With a view to promoting millets, the DHAN Foundation has taken up a research project in partnership with McGill University, Canada, and Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore."
