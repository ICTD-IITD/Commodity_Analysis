Over 31,000 hectares of land was brought under the SRI method in the present kharif season. Most of the area brought under the SRI method is sandy soil by nature in both delta and upland mandals.Introduced in the early 2000s in Krishna district, the farmers have found the SRI method suitable to get high yield than traditional farming method, apart from minimising the input cost. The farmers are after the SRI method given lack of availability of labour on time and yield per acre. The requirement of less water is said to be one of the reasons for the success of the method in Krishna district, Assistant Director (Agriculture Training) Mani Neelam said. According to statistics of the Agriculture Department, the yield per acre has been recorded 32-34 bags (each 75kg) in the SRI method as against 31 bags in the traditional method in the district."

Estimates put the pulse production at 8.61 million tonnes for 2017-18.Production of coarse cereals too might decrease to 31.49 million tonnes. Maize production is pegged at 18.73 million tonnesHowever, sugarcane production for 2017-18 will go up. That should be sweet news for consumers."

Proper planning on the part of the State government would help farmers harvest a good samba crop.Normally, the dam is opened for delta kuruvai and samba paddy cultivation on June 12 and would be shut on January 28.Monsoon failureHowever, owing to poor storage, the reservoir was not opened on the customary date for the past six years and delta farmers lost kuruvai paddy crop on all those occasions. Adding to their misery, farmers could not raise samba too last year due to Karnatakas refusal to abide by the Supreme Court directions and failure of monsoon resulting in a historical agricultural catastrophe.Surplus waterNow, as the Kabini reservoir has surplus water, the Krishna Raja Sagar dam is fast filling up and Karnataka has been releasing excess flood flow in the Cauvery, the storage in the Mettur dam is going up.Coupled with those developments, continued rains in the catchment areas of the Cauvery and widespread rains in the delta regions of Tamil Nadu have prompted calls for samba preparations.Though Pushkaram events increased the pressure on the delta farmers, things are turning better for us. We must not get unduly perturbed over the delay in the Mettur dam opening. More than 20 years back, I vividly remember delta farmers raising kuruvai late and that was harvested around Deepavali time after which they raised thalady or samba. Now, we might need 50 tmc ft for delta samba paddy operations and opening the dam once it reached the 90-foot-level will be a safe option, said Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association.It would be good if the Mettur dam is opened next week itself. The PWD must maintain full supply for 15 days without resorting to turnsystem at Grand Anicut to facilitate raising of nurseries, resort to direct sowing wherever applicable and make other preparatory works, observed P.R. Pandian, coordinator, Federation of Tamil Nadu Farmers Associations.After shutting the dam for a reasonable period to allow accumulation, the authorities could again open the dam depending on the farmers needs, he notes.Farmers need to gamble now, says Swamimalai S. Vimalnathan, secretary, Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association.The Mettur dam must be opened immediately and a supply of 16,000 cusecs must be maintained for at least 15 days to help water reach even the tailend areas. The State government must pressure Karnataka and the Centre to release water in the Cauvery.At least, Karnataka must make good the deficit of 119 tmc ft till September 15 and the Centre must step in to enforce that. Beyond that, farmers will look up to the skies to seek heavenly intervention, Mr. Vimalnathan said.During the Mettur dams 83 years existence, it was opened after its opening was delayed beyond June 12, the scheduled date, on 58 occasions.Only on 11 occasions, it was opened before the customary date and on 14 occasions the schedule was met."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"

Emiko Takahashi, a 73-year-old woman taking the course, admitted she had no confidence in her driving as she got older.Thats why I came here, she said, adding that she has no choice but to drive her ailing husband, seven years her senior, to the hospital every day.Fatal accidents caused by geriatric drivers now account for 28.3 % of the total, up from 17.9 % a decade ago, National Police Agency records state.And with the elderly set to account for 40 percent of the population by 2060, there is an increasing fear for public safety.Most accidents caused by elderly drivers, result from them mixing up the accelerator and the brake, or losing control of the steering wheel, the police agency said, calling it a pressing problem.Masato Zenyouji, an instructor at the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF), said one of the problems lay in the declining ability of older drivers to instantly make a judgement, such as suddenly hitting the brake.The driving course attempts to address this by physical exercises such as stretching, and drills to improve cognitive functions.Another factor in accidents, is overconfidence from drivers who have often been behind the wheel for decades, said Masabumi Tokoro, a professor at Rissho University who has been studying elderly drivers.Novel effortsAuthorities have taken steps with legislation, introducing laws in March, forcing drivers aged 75 or older to pass cognitive tests when renewing their licences.In some regions, they have resorted to novel ways to encourage some of the 4.8 million drivers over 75 in Japan to hand over their licence. These include deals for cheaper funerals and discounts on ramen noodles, along with more conventional methods such as cheap or free taxis and buses.But 67-year-old Kiyotaka Ukita, also taking part in the course, scoffed at these efforts. Free bus tickets arent attractive at all for older drivers to return their licences, said Mr. Ukita."

It is their beliefs and customs which are mainly responsible for the contentedness among them, especially among the aboriginal Raj Gond and Kolam tribes.The Pen da Dasra or Dev ka Dasara or the Dasara of the Gods celebrated by Raj Gonds, this year it was on September 25, at the remote Jangubai cave temple, provides an insight into their life, which is by and large tension free. The festival is a thanksgiving event to Goddess Jangubai and other gods like Persa Pen or Bada Dev for the harvested crop.PilgrimageThe Adivasis toil in farms for about six months and the remaining period is spent in pilgrimages to important temples. The latter period is also of festivities which ends with the marriage season between March and May.As part of the agriculture operations, the tribals people seek blessings of the goddess before sowing in the month of May and the Pen da Dasra is usually held five days before the Dasara festival when some of the crops would have been harvested. Before sowing however, the farmers do not seek bumper harvest and riches but restrict themselves to seeking blessings for their well being.Cave templeWe can consume the harvest only after we offer a portion of each of the variety to our gods, revealed Salam Sham Rao, who led his family to the thanksgiving event at the cave temple located in the forest near Maharajguda in Kota-Parandoli gram panchayat of Kerameri mandal in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.Thousands of Raj Gonds gather at the picturesque location for offering nivodh or naivedyam made of local variety of sesame, red rice or vanjin, green gram and black gram. We cook items like the garkang with green gram in the sesame oil that we ourselves produce, added Sham Raos wife Dhurpatabai.All the peasant families who arrived at the venue of the festival offered prayers to the over dozen gods at the place before crossing the small stream to reach the cave temple. Every devotee family offered chicken or lamb as sacrifice to Goddess Jangubai and later feasted together."

Das and his father will provide a vital service during the Durga Puja, which is incomplete without the almost continuous and hypnotic beats of huge drums, better known as dhaks.The drummers, or dhakis, are struggling to earn money during the five-day festivities in the capital. Das and his father are among the 200-odd drummers who have arrived here from tiny villages in West Bengal districts of Malda, Murshidabad, Midnapore and Birbhum. They are struggling financially as the floods last month destroyed their rice crop and fields.Playing dhaks at various pandals in the capital could help these part-time drummers recoup financially. Train services in north Bengal were severely affected by the floods since August and this forced the dhakis to hire buses to travel to Delhi this year, spending an exorbitant amount of money on travel. ""My father and my younger brother too came to Delhi to earn more. We need money badly,"" reveals Gokul, a resident of Egra in Midnapore.With people struggling to cope with the aftermath of devastating floods, many drummers could not even decorate their dhaks with the distinct feather frills that give the Bengal drums their unique look. ""There are no more feathers available and we are completing some of our work here by replacing feathers (usually dropped by Siberian cranes during winter season) with pieces of plastic. It has been really bad for us these days, some of our drums were also damaged due to the floods,"" says Malda resident Rabi Das, who is waiting on a footpath outside the New Delhi Kali Bari for a Durga Puja organiser to offer him a contract. Perhaps, this is the last time Rabi will play the dhaak during Durga Puja as he plans to sell his instrument to meet his expenses.The floods also forced some of the dhakis to cut trees growing on their land to make new drums. They usually save Rs 5,000 through the year for travel and stay in Delhi. ""We are staying at the New Delhi Kali Bari to save on expenses this time,"" says Ranjit Das , who has been hired for Chittaranjan Park B-block Durga Puja. He and his fellow drummers will earn Rs 12,00015,000 for five days.The traditional musicians are struggling as younger people are not keen on following a poorly paid career and competition from recorded music is eating into their income. ""Playing the dhak needs a lot of energy and also calls for a lot of movement and dancing, which most people do not wish to pursue. This is a dying profession, which even my children would not pursue until there is some incentive,"" says Prashanto Das, resident of Bolpur in Birbhum district. ""We've agreed to pay them more due to their plight. This is afestival of happiness, we don't want them to go back with gloom,"" said Swapan Ganguly , from the New Delhi Kali Bari Durgotsav Committee."
5a145c879855b76bf13e3905,Kharif foodgrain output may fall 2.78%: Govt estimates,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/kharif-foodgrain-output-may-fall-2-78-govt-estimates/articleshow/60837520.cms,2017-09-26,"NEW DELHI: India's summer-sown foodgrain production is likely to fall nearly 3 per cent , dashing hopes of higher farm income, because of erratic rainfall and farmers shifting to other remunerative crops.Output of kharif, or summer-sown crops, is expected to fall to 134.67 million tonnes from the record 138.52 million tonnes last year, a fall of 2.8 per cent , according to the government's first formal estimate of the harvest. It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."

Explaining the welfare schemes his government has implemented so far, Siddaramaiah said his government was distributing 7kg of free rice to 1.8 crore households covering over 4 crore people of the state's 6.5 crore population. He said the government has built 12 lakh houses for the poor to realise a hutmentfree state. He said milk is being distributed to schoolchildren five days a week covering 1.4 crore children. He claimed the government has irrigated 6.5 acres and spent Rs 60,000 crore for it.To a query about employment generation, industry minister R V Deshpande said 12 lakh jobs have been created.""While the national average has been negative, Karnataka has been positive in job creation,"" said Deshpande.Siddaramaiah said Nargund taluk will be declared an open defecation free taluk on Tuesday by vice-president M Venkaiah Naidu in Gadag.

Picture by Ashok Sinha Nearly 150 school and college students learnt on Tuesday how to transplant paddy seedlings in a field submerged in water, thanks to a programme organised for them by Tarumitra Ashram in Patna. The students lined up barefoot in a 1-acre field on the campus for the paddy transplantation activity in knee-deep muddy water. Hesitant and confused at the start of the job, most of the participants soon found their groove and enjoyed their date with nature. School student Akanksha was among the 150 participants who asked surprised: ""The field is submerged in water. How would I transplant paddy seedlings?"" Soon, she found out how, as the students learnt about the activity while listening to Raag Malhar and Khet Ropni songs of singer Ranjana Jha. Tarumitra officials, including Margaret Molomoo and Devopriya Dutta, explained the process to them. Tarumitra founder Father Robert Athickal could not resist himself from joining the students later in the day, transplanting paddy saplings along with them. Bauna mansuri, kunjunju and kakshan were among the rare varieties of paddy that were transplanted on the Tarumitra field on Tuesday. ""Paddy transplantation is considered one of the toughest part of the cultivation process,"" said co-ordinator Devopriya. ""You have to have plant the seedlings while maintaining the necessary gap between them. For schoolchildren it's not a very easy thing to do but the best part was many school students took part in the activity. ""For the first time in their lives, the students made small holes in a muddy field with their fingers and planted the seedlings. Once they got the hang of it, they went about the work effortlessly."" Ashish, a student of St Xavier's College who was among the participants, said: ""I didn't know exactly how I was going to do it but it turned out to be a great experience. I realised how much effort a farmer puts in at the fields to give us food."" Devopriya said the school and college students would also join Tarumitra in harvesting and threshing later. ""The rice paddy would be ready for harvesting by October-end or the beginning of November,"" she said."

Priced a little above `20 lakh, the harvesters are rented for anywhere between `1,800 and `2,000 per hour. They are brought to Palakkad every year during mid-September and are continuously put to use for two months before being shifted to Thrissur and Alappuzha.Though the ASCs have combine harvesters, most of them are under repair, said Mohan Kumar, an award-winning farmer of Olassery who harvested five acres of his land this week using the harvester he rented from TN.While farmers can rent combine harvesters from the Kerala Agro Industrial Corporation (Kaico) for `800 per hour, the padashekhara samitis which are allotted the harvesters on the recommendation of the Agriculture officer are supposed to bear cost of diesel and transportation of the harvesters, said Noushad, deputy chief engineer, Kaico,Thiruvananthapuram.We had purchased 150 machines of Japanese and German make under the Kuttanad package around five to seven years ago and another 50 machines of German make under the Kole package nearly two years ago. Of the 200 machines, 16 were given to the Kottayam district panchayat and four to local bodies. The fleet of the remaining 180 machines are rented from centres in Ambalapuzha, Tiruvalla, Vaikom, Thrissur and Palakkad, he said.The machines bought under Kuttanad package are relatively older than those bought under the Kole package. Since, using harvesters is a seasonal job, we only have about a dozen operators and few mechanics readily available in the districts, Noushad said.M S Vinunath, president of Puduppariyaram Thozhil Sena, said the state budget promised creation of special agro-economic zones with Kuttanad, Kole, Onattukara, Pokkali, Palakkad, Kaippad and Wayanad being identified for rice cultivation.If farming machines and equipment were available at least in theses districts, farmers would get them on cheaper rents, he said. Breaking down the numbers, Vinunath said a state-owned harvester could be hired for `1,400 in comparison to a private harvester the rent for which ranges from `1,800 to `2,100.Moreover, the presence of technology like GPS-connected meters will allow tracking and managing the usage of the fleet of hired combine harvesters and tractors. This, in turn, will ensure the operators are employed continuously for eight months. At present, state-owned machines show a meter-reading of just 200 hours per hour. A private harvester clocks over a thousand hours. This reflects the formers under-utilisation, he said.Sundaram, a native of Pothundy near Nenmara, who takes contracts from farmers and brings combine harvesters from other states, said various block panchayats of the state owned combined harvesters, but lacked any person to repair the machines if they develop a snag.Working condition questionableA former officer who was in charge of the Centres Mahila Kisan Sashastikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) said the Centre had sanctioned `60 crore for the scheme in June, 20011.The scheme was to be jointly implemented by the district panchayats of Palakkad, Malappuram and Thrissur. Of the amount, `40 crore was to be spent on purchase of farming equipment. Transplanters, mini tractors, power tillers, reapers, cono weeders and threshers have been purchased under MKSP, the officer said.But how many of them are currently being rented out or are in working condition considering their weak maintenance is a question, the officer said.Kannur-based Raidco also supplied combined harvesters to farmers under various government schemes for the past decade-and-half.We could supply only six combine harvesters in the state purchased under various Central and state-sponsored schemes, said Raidco marketing manager Minnush.Whos reaping the benefits?In the absence of working state-owned combined harvesters, Kerala farmers depend on Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for the machines.450The minimum number of combine harvesters purchased in the state under various Central and state-sponsored schemes.The Kerala Agro Industries Corporation (KAICO) owns and hires 200 combine harvesters under the Kuttanad and Kole packages.Raidco too rents out the machines and has supplied combine harvesters across the state in the past decade"

Since May 2017, cashless transactions at fair price shops nosedived and reached a mere 25 percent. Although Krishna district tops in cashless transactions across the State, the total number of transactions have come down.Officials state that the charges on e-transactions, which were largely waived by banks in the initial months of demonetisation, is back in vogue and banks are now charging a certain sum for every transactions. Also, some officials even claimed that the amount which needs to be paid at fair price shops is very low and people are quite comfortable in paying by cash.Speaking to Express, Krishna district collector B Lakshmikantham said, During the demonetisation phase, cashless transactions were on the rise as there was a cash crunch situations.But now, people have sufficient cash with them, for which they are opting for transaction via cash than digital transaction. Soon we might see zero digital transaction at fair price shops in Krishna district, as people are facing technical problems during cashless transactions.In Krishna district, there are around 2,260 fair price shops which are equipped with digital transaction enabled machinery. Over 12.4 lakh people in the district have ration cards to buy rice and sugar from ration stores.From July, the supply of sugar has been stopped and only rice is being supplied for the ration card holders. Occasionally, there is also supply of oil, dal and pulses with the monthly ration."

The Congress still hopes for an ""amicable solution"" to the crisis, but many leaders argued in private that there were better ways of dealing with the issues than creating an unseemly public spectacle. ""It would be naive to ignore the element of political vendetta in the entire exercise,"" a top party strategist told The Telegraph. ""Nitish broke away from the BJP and embraced a convicted Lalu to fight the Narendra Modi-led BJP. That time the JDU said they were aligning with a party, not an individual. Now they have staked the future of the alliance on an individual. If there is an ultimatum by the JDU for Tejashwi Yadav to quit, there should have been a simultaneous assertion that the alliance won't break. Why is there so much speculation about re-marriage with the BJP?"" the strategist asked. Nitish is understood to have said at a party meet that Tejashwi has to resign, but did not lay down a time-frame. Congress leaders have been asked by Rahul Gandhi not to speak against Nitish as they want to retain him in the secular alliance. But many senior leaders conceded the JDU was viewed with suspicion by most parties after its decision to support Ram Nath Kovind, the BJP's pick for President. ""We wonder whether Nitish was laying the ground for another somersault. Does he feel the Opposition doesn't have a chance in 2019 and it would be difficult to retain Bihar with Lalu in 2020? Why is he not ruling out the BJP?"" Another leader said: ""Nobody is saying corruption is not an issue but we can't surrender to the Narendra Modi government's political machinations. Let the probe establish Tejashwi's guilt. But we wonder why were repeated raids required at Lalu's house? Did the CBI or income-tax department not seize all incriminating material in one raid? How many times were raids conducted on BJP chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan in the Vyapam, rice and mining scams?"" Congress leaders also contested the perception that they too want Tejashwi to put in his papers, insisting that it was up to Lalu and the RJD to formulate their responses. They said the Congress understood there was a witch-hunt and hence the yardstick of political morality cannot be blindly applied in this case. They recalled how the Trinamul Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party, Samajwadi Party, NCP and the Congress were being selectively targeted while even serious charges against BJP ministers were ignored. Some leaders also asked if removing ministers on the basis of political morality by Sonia Gandhi during the UPA regime had paid off. ""We removed railway minister Pawan Bansal because his nephew was allegedly involved in transfer-posting. We removed Shashi Tharoor because of a cricket controversy and Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan because his mother-in-law had a flat in the Adarsh society. But Modi, who boasts of a clean image, didn't remove any of his charge-sheeted and convicted ministers when he was chief minister of Gujarat. He didn't take action against anybody after becoming Prime Minister, be it in the Lalit Modi scam or the Panama papers,"" said a leader. At a time when 18 Opposition parties have decided to forcefully fight the Modi government in the Parliament session starting on July 17, no leader is happy with the instability in Bihar. Ironically, political vendetta is one of the key issues the Opposition wants to take up, along with ill-effects of demonetisation, a flawed GST regime, agrarian distress and unemployment."

It came to light during the recent collectors conference held here. On the underweight and acute malnutrition among children below five years in the State, the ICDS has submitted the 2015 data to show that the situation is improving in the State. When asked to a senior official regarding presenting the 2015 data, he said that they used the data to compare it with the 2005 data to show improvement in the span of 10 years. He further claimed that the 2015 data is almost similar to that of 2017.Going by the 2015 data, 36.8 per cent of children in Vizianagaram district are underweight or malnourished. Krishna district has only 17.5 per cent malnourished children - the least in the State.The rise of malnutrition among the children is reportedly due to the short break given to the Balamrutham scheme after the bifurcation of the State. However, the AP government brought back the scheme in July 2017.Under the scheme, baby food (balamrutham) is prepared with roasted wheat flour, roasted Bengal gram flour, skimmed milk powder, sugar, refined palmolein oil and fortificants like vitamins and minerals at 50 per cent as per the Central government norms. Each pack of the 2.5 kg balamrutham is filled in a 2-layer laminated flexi pouch as a take-home ration and each pack meets the requirement of one child for a month  100 grams a day for 25 days. The Anganwadi centres are distributing the balamrutham mix to the children aged between 6 months and 3 years.Similarly, as part of the mid-day meal scheme, children aged between 3 years and 5 years are being served with spot meals with rice and vegetables with four eggs in a week at the anganwadi centres. The severe malnourished kids will be served with milk in addition to the daily diet.H Arun Kumar, Commissioner of WD&CW department, said, We are strictly monitoring these two projects with special teams from village-level to district-level. Soon, we will implement some real-time monitoring on these projects. Malnutrition doesnt solely depend on the food, it also related to sanitation, genetics etc. We are trying to make healthy children in the State."

It is gearing up to go ahead with the controversial river-linking scheme, raising the hackles of environmentalists and scientists.The Union Ministry of Water Resources has approved the `5.5 lakh crore project and its first phase was announced a few days ago. As many as 30 projects have been envisaged by the National Water Development Agency (NWDA) and the linking of the Pampa and Achankovil rivers in the state with Vaipar in Tamil Nadu is also part of it.While Kerala has decided to swim against the tide, its neighbour is gung-ho about connecting the rivers. Green activists and scientists also oppose the move tooth and nail, saying it could spell doom for the ecology of Central Kerala and concoct a recipe for environmental disaster in the Vembanad wetlands.In the NWDA study carried out two decades ago, it was found the water was excess in Pampa and Achankovil rivers. But they were wrong. From the mouth of the Pampa river to Aranmula, the water is scarce for more than 180 to 200 days every year, Pampa Parirakshana Samithi general secretary N K Sukumaran Nair told Express.Only the tailrace water from the Sabarigiri project is a relief to the river. The Achankovil river is also in the same condition and it is almost dry during the entire stretch. The Vembanad ecosystem exists with the flood waters of Pampa and Achankovil rivers, said K G Padmakumar, director of International Research and Training Centre for Below Sea Level Farming. If dams are constructed on the rivers, it will destroy the system. The salinity in the Vembanad Lake reaches almost half the salinity level of the sea in summer. If the flow of water decreases, it will destroy agriculture in the region. The study of NWDA did not analyse the real situation and they look only at the flood in Kuttanad during the monsoon. The linking project could dry up Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts, affecting 30 lakh people. Every year, around 4 to 5 crore devotees from across the country reach the Sabarimala pilgrim centre and they depend on the river. The level of pollutants in the Pampa is already high and, after the linking, it will go up further, destroying the river, the serenity of the temple and the Vembanad region, Padmakumar said.Water Resources Minister Mathew T Thomas told reporters in New Delhi the project will not be implemented without the permission of the state. The meeting of NWDA chaired by Union Minister Nitin Gadkari on September 12 has agreed to our demands. The demand for the project is based on unscientific studies, he said.Pampa-Achankovil-Vaipar projectThe project looks at diverting 634 cubic metres of water from Pampa and Achankovil rivers to Vaipar in Tamil Nadu through tunnels and dams. The aim is to irrigate three districts in the neighbouring state - Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar. It also looks at producing 500 MW electricity. Three dams at Punnamedu, Chittarmoozhy and Achankovil have been proposed. Punnamedu and Chittarmuzhi reservoirs are interconnected with an 8-km tunnel. Water from Achankovil reservoir has to be pumped to Chittarmuzhi reservoir. A 9-km tunnel will be constructed through the Western Ghats. A 50-km-long canal has been proposed to bring water from the tunnel to Mekkara dam. Six mini hydro power plants are also proposed in Achankovil, Punnamedu and in TN along the canal route.Estimated cost of the projectA2,588 cr(2000-01 estimate. 8 per cent annual escalation recommended in the estimate)Ecological imbalancesThree reservoirs will submerge 2,000 hectares of virgin forest and 10 sqkm forest land in Konni and Achenkovil divisions will be destroyed. The flow of water helps in purifying the Vembanad Lake and supports paddy farming in Kuttanad region, which produces around 1.25 lakh tonnes of rice each season. If the flow is reduced, the sediments deposited and saline water intrusion will destroy agriculture. The Vembanad eco-system will be devastated and more than 5 lakh inland fishermen will be rendered jobless.Potable water projects use water of Pampa and Achankovil rivers and they could be jeopardised as well."

Telegraph picture Imphal, July 13: The Manipur health department's food safety wing today cleared the eggs suspected to have contained plastic and collected at random from Imphal city market over the past few days. After posts on social media about alleged plastic eggs entering Indian market, including Manipur, were widely circulated, the food safety wing of the state health department collected 20 egg samples from the city wholesalers. State food analyst Ch. Sanajaoba Meitei said necessary tests had been conducted on the samples and the eggs were found normal with no evidence of the alleged plastic in the tested ones. The samples were brought to the state food testing laboratory on July 6, where physical, chemical and structural tests were conducted. ""With the news of the sale of plastic or artificial eggs in the market doing the rounds on social media, officials of the food safety wing of Imphal West collected samples from egg wholesalers of Ngari Gulli of Imphal city. Most of the eggs were brought from Andhra Pradesh,"" an official source said. The tests were also conducted after reports that a family in Imphal found one egg among seven, bought from the local market last month, did not match the colour of the other six when fried after boiling. The family told a local daily that when the suspicious looking egg was burnt with a candle, it smelt like plastic. ""The state food testing lab is currently conducting several tests and there are no signs of any plastic rice or eggs,"" state food safety consultant Dr S. Bimalkumari said. Several cases of adulteration of edible items were detected in Manipur in the recent past. Three persons were fined Rs 1,50,000, Rs 10,000 and Rs 5000 earlier this month for adulterating edible oil. The three were pulled up following a complaint to the food safety officials after 20 people fell ill during a community feast in Bishnupur. Official sources said three city fruit sellers were also arrested for using a chemical as a banana ripening agent last month. The three were granted bail. Police seized some adulterated bananas and the unknown chemical that was used is being verified. Sale of eggs dropped in the Imphal markets after rumours swirled about the presence of plastic in eggs. ""I used to sell about 500 eggs daily before the rumour of plastic eggs spread. Now the sale has dropped to nearly half after all this talk about plastic eggs,"" Raju Yadav, a grocery shop owner in Imphal city, said. Official sources said chief minister N. Biren Singh has directed the food safety wing of the health department to be on strict vigil to check the sale of adulterated food items."
5a1467729855b76bf13e3f31,Varanasi hub for 'miracle rice' maker,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170713/jsp/nation/story_161710.jsp,2017-07-13,"New Delhi, July 12: The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines is set to establish a South Asian Regional Centre in Varanasi that crop scientists say will help improve the yield and quality of rice mainly for eastern Indian states. The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi today approved the establishment of the IRRI's regional centre to be hosted at the National Seed Research and Training Centre, a government laboratory in Varanasi, and expected to be commissioned within six months. Indian rice research scientists say the new centre will elevate collaboration with the IRRI that dates back to the 1960s when it worked with Indian scientists to develop IR8, a rice variety with nearly double the yield used in the country then. ""The IR8 variety was called miracle rice - it set off the green revolution in rice in India,"" said Himanshu Pathak, director of the Central Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, Odisha. The IR8 yield was about eight tonnes per hectare compared with about three tonnes available from varieties used across India then. The IR8 was a semi-dwarf variety, Pathak said, and different from the rice varieties cultivated in India during the 1960s that were tall, low-yielding, and were not responsive to fertilisers. Its introduction and rice breeding efforts since then have allowed the country to steadily raise production. Many crop scientists believe the next big jump in rice production in the country is likely to be driven by increasing per hectare yields in the eastern states where the current average production is lower than in other parts of the country. The Varanasi centre will work on special rice varieties to further improve the per hectare yields of rice and improve its nutrition content through modern plant breeding strategies and on post-harvesting activities to reduce wastage, add value and generate higher in come for farmers. ""We're hoping to get new rice varieties rich in iron and zinc,"" said Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, a member of the coordination committee of the proposed centre. ""This will be through conventional breeding - our own scientists are already engaged in efforts to improve the nutritional value of rice. Some varieties rich in protein and zinc have been developed,"" Sandhu said. Senior officials in the Indian Council of Agricultural Research expect the regional centre to focus on rice varieties for use by farmers in eastern India as well as in South Asian and African countries. ""The average per hectare rice yield in many places in eastern India is significantly lower than in the north-western states,"" said Arvind Nath Singh, director of the National Seed Research and Training Centre that will host the laboratories and infrastructure for the regional centre. The IRRI is a member of a consortium of international agricultural research centres engaged in improving food security worldwide. Other consortium members are involved in maize, wheat, potato, semi-arid crops, aquatic resources, food policy and forestry."

Leaders from the Congress, Left, Nationalist Congress Party, DMK, Janata Dal United and Rashtriya Janata Dal advocated such a policy at today's Opposition meeting. Trinamul, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party members, however, skipped the meeting on a day the focus was on the presidential election. Adjournment motions, allowed only in the Lok Sabha, seek to draw the House's attention to matters of urgent public importance and need the support of at least 50 members. The possible subjects of the adjournment motions the Opposition is considering moving include the farm crisis, lack of jobs, China standoff, ""flawed"" goods and services tax (GST) and the Amarnath Yatra killings. Tomorrow morning, the Congress will gherao Parliament in protest against the implementation of the GST. Rahul Gandhi will address a farmers' rally in Banswara, Rajasthan, the day after. The main slogan proposed for tomorrow - ""GST ka jawab/Sansad ka gherao (The answer to the GST is a gherao of Parliament)"" - indicates the Congress is ready to abandon its nuanced position on the new tax regime and go all out against it. Sources said that today's meeting was divided on the extent of disruption to be wrought in Parliament but was unanimous about the need to haul the government up and seek answers. The Opposition also wants to raise the subject of the ""brazen political witch-hunt"" against some of its stalwarts and the lynchings by cow vigilantes. A bout of aggression by some parties may make Parliament difficult to run, at least for the first few days. Prime Minister Narendra Modi today attempted an outreach in the Lok Sabha, walking up to senior Opposition politicians and greeting them, but the gesture seems to have had little impact. Many Opposition members questioned Modi's appeal at yesterday's all-party meeting for support for his anti-corruption drive, alleging the Prime Minister was himself protecting tainted NDA politicians. They rued that the Prime Minister's decision to speak last had denied them a chance to counter him, and said the Opposition wanted a thorough debate on corruption in Parliament. ""We clearly see discrimination against Opposition leaders. There is duplicity in the Prime Minister's stand,"" CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury told The Telegraph. Yechury said in a series of tweets today: ""Political corruption is a menace, as shown by Sahara-Birla diaries, Vyapam, Lalit Modi, rice & GSPC (Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation) scams of the BJP. Why no action on them? Instead, by amending FCRA (Foreign Contribution Regulation Act) retrospectively and allowing secret corporate funding of elections, Modi government has legalised corruption in politics."" Janata Dal United senior Sharad Yadav, whose party has staked its alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar over a corruption FIR naming Lalu Prasad's son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav, too alleged selective targeting of the Opposition. Sharad tweeted: ""Corruption is a menace and stringent action should be taken but action needs to be taken against all and not against selected and in Opposition."" Modi's condemnation of the violence by cow vigilantes yesterday has left many in the Opposition wondering why he had not ensured tough action on the ground against the lynchings, which have been going on for two years now. ""Modi should look within the BJP and see where the virus of gau rakshak starts from,"" Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh tweeted today. ""Otherwise, it is all empty words."" Photographs showing alleged assailants with senior BJP leaders were attached to the message."
5a1468a79855b76bf13e4015,Global warming alarm for India,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170715/jsp/nation/story_162066.jsp,2017-07-15,"New Delhi, July 14: Unabated global warming may pose an ""existential threat"" to some countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the Asian Development Bank warned today, listing extreme hot days, flood losses, rising dengue burden and crop declines among India's vulnerabilities. The bank, in a report on the ""human dimensions"" of climate change in Asia, has said drastic changes in the weather, crop, fisheries and health patterns may reverse current development gains and degrade the quality of life for tens of millions of people in the region. The report, examining multiple impacts of global warming, said 13 of the top 20 cities with the highest projected annual flood losses from 2005 to 2050 are in the Asia-Pacific region and include Calcutta, Chennai, Mumbai and Surat in India. It has cited earlier studies that predict crop yield declines across the Asia-Pacific region, including a 5 per cent dip in rice yields in south India by the 2030s and an 8 per cent reduction in wheat across India with a 1 degree Celsius rise in temperature. ""Countries in the Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty and disaster if mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented,"" said Bambang Susantano, the ADB's vice-president for sustainable development, in a statement. Countries have through the United Nations been negotiating strategies to reduce emissions of Earth-warming fossil fuels to prevent temperatures from escalating to levels where they could have devastating impacts worldwide. The ADB report has also cited earlier projections on how rising temperatures will increase the burden of certain diseases. The average annual number of dengue cases in India is expected to increase from about 34,000 in 2030 to over 59,000 in 2050. Dengue-linked mortality in India has been predicted to increase from an average 287 in 2030 to 483 in 2050. And diarrhoea infections are expected to increase from 25 million in 2030 to 42 million by 2050. Many parts of India had suffered severe heat waves in 2015 and 2016 and, with increasing global warming, the report said such types of heat extremes are expected to intensify and become more frequent. Coastal and low-lying regions are most at the risk of flooding from sea level rise and India's coastal population is expected to more than triple from about 63 million in 2000 to over 216 million by 2060, the report said. In a global climate pact negotiated in Paris in 2015, countries had pledged multiple actions - slashing dependence on fossil fuels, accelerating renewable energy, increasing forests - to try and limit the average global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius. But President Donald Trump earlier this year pulled the US out of the Paris pact, injecting uncertainty over the future pace of collective global action to combat climate change. But many climate policy analysts believe the move towards clean energy is unstoppable."

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik recently reviewed the service in government schools and asked all inspecting officers to visit every school in the state this month. ""The focus is on providing quality food to children and to ensure that not a single child is deprived of the meal,"" said Gangadhar Sahoo, state nodal officer for the midday meal scheme. The government has also asked the officers to ensure that food was served hot to the students. Over 46 lakh children from classes I to VIII in 53,000 state-run schools fall under the purview of midday meal. ""Monitoring this gigantic scheme on a daily basis and in real time is the key to its successful implementation,"" Sahoo said. With an annual budget of Rs 800 crore, children in the state are served rice with one of dalma, soybean chunks or egg curry. The government has also created a Student Database Management Information System to tag the Aadhaar numbers of the students from classes I to X to the database. It has set a deadline of July 31 and district education officers have been asked to update the students' Aadhaar numbers within the stipulated time. ""Aadhaar has been made mandatory for students to get midday meal. The planning co-ordinators at the block education officer level will ensure that the database is updated within the stipulated time,"" said a senior school and mass education officer. Several schools across the state have reported incidents of finding insects in the meals. Most recently, it emerged that rice infested with weevil was being used to cook the meal in Malkangiri district. Parents of students have held a number of protests against the low-quality food served in schools. Naveen has also sought a report from officers on the timely distribution of textbooks. Apart from asking officials to provide two pairs of uniform to schoolchildren by the end of this month, he has also told them to ensure that bicycles were provided to eligible students before August 15."

The administration has not taken any initiative to address critical issues like the food crisis.""The state government has so far blamed the Gorkhaland supporters for not allowing supply trucks to enter the hills.

The move, initiated for the first time in the state, is significant as it would boost the rural economy and encourage more farmers to sell their produce directly to the government instead of being forced to go for distress sale. ""The FCI has agreed to buy 3 lakh tonnes of rice following a proposal from the Bengal government.... This is the first time that the FCI will procure rice from the state,"" a government official said. So far, Bengal's procurement target was restricted to the amount of paddy needed to be supplied to ration shops in the state. ""Until last year, we procured paddy that was needed to be supplied to ration shops. But this year, we set our goal high and brought more farmers under the minimum support price (MSP),"" said a food and supplies department official. The Bengal government has fixed the MSP for paddy at Rs 1,470 a quintal this year. In previous years, when the state procured only that much paddy that was required to be distributed among beneficiaries of the cheap foodgrain scheme, farmers who could not sell their produce to the government had to sell it in the open market, which often offers a much lower price. Officials said Bengal needed around 42 lakh tonnes of paddy this year to be supplied to the ration shops. But the state procured around 10 lakh tonnes more. ""This surplus paddy would be converted into rice and supplied to the FCI. In the first lot, the FCI has placed an order of 1.55 lakh tonnes of rice. We will deliver the order soon,"" the official added. The hike in procurement target from 30 lakh tonnes last year is likely to have a direct effect on the ground. ""If a farmer gets a proper price for his produce, he will be encouraged to reinvest in the next season. They might also be encouraged to cultivate exotic varieties of paddy, which is in demand in the international market,"" an agriculture department official said. A section of officials said the move to bring more farmers under the MSP was aimed at strengthening the Trinamul organisation in the rural areas for next year's panchayat polls. ""The cost of production is an issue in the rural areas. As more farmers are likely to get a proper price from now, it will definitely have an effect on the elections,"" a Trinamul minister said. Sources said the state needed to be extremely careful about the quality of rice it would send to the FCI in the first lot to ensure more orders in the future."

The private firm employee called up five of her friends, rushed to Siliguri and came back with bags of ration. Chhetri isn't stocking up her kitchen essentials. Every morning, she and her friend have been cooking food and feeding stray dogs and monkeys in Darjeeling town. ""Most of these animals would feed on leftovers from eateries, hotels and meat shops. Since all are closed now because of the strike, it has become difficult for them to find food,"" said Chhetri, who purchased 50kg of rice, 30kg of whole wheat and cartons of biscuits from Siliguri. ""As far as I know, five stray dogs have died and many are emaciated. Monkeys, too, are not getting enough food. Since I love animals, I could not just sit back and do nothing,"" the 20-something Chhetri said. The woman, who is employed with a business house, has been spending from her savings to buy food for the animals. She also runs a Facebook page titled Team WOOFF (World Of Our Furry Friends).

5a146da39855b76bf13e439d,For a few good men,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170720/jsp/opinion/story_162762.jsp,2017-07-20,"On my way to Basirhat, a couple of weeks after communal disturbances had been reported from this area in the North 24 Parganas, I noticed the landscape changing after the train - the Sealdah-Hasnabad local - had crossed Bahira Kalibari. The fields with standing crops - rice and, usually, vegetables - brick kilns, the occasional mango orchard and solitary scarecrows gave way to large water bodies that resembled bils. As the train approached Harua Road - Baduria is a 20-minute drive from here - I felt the atmosphere inside the compartment change ever so slightly. Most people got off, at Lebutala and Bhasila, before my destination, Harua Road, arrived. Those who remained were silent. I noticed one man poring over an old copy of a local newspaper (Jugasankha), which carried reports of clashes in a bold font. After getting off, I stopped for tea at a stall on the platform. Broken glass bottles had been stacked in a corner of the shop. On enquiring what the matter was, I was told that some people had vandalized the stall the morning protests broke out against a deeply offensive post on Facebook. I had travelled to Baduria to meet someone who had not lit the flames but had attempted to douse them. Mohammad Kamruzzaman is the secretary of the All Bengal Minority Youth Federation, an organization that works in the fields of education and employment. The work done by the ABMYF has given Kamruzzaman some leverage among the residents of Harua, Baduria, Deganga and Swarupnagar. His influence in these localities had turned Kamruzzaman into the local administration's right-hand man when disturbances had spread in Basirhat. Kamruzzaman and I got talking inside the educational institution that he has set up for needy students. A soft-spoken man, Kamruzzaman appeared to be an atypical community leader. He is equally concerned about such welfare measures as doles for imams as well as the poor representation of Muslims in education and employment, asymmetries, which, in his opinion, have created the conditions for the growing orthodoxy in thought among some segments of Muslim society. While describing his experience during the unrest - he had travelled extensively in Basirhat, requesting irate mobs to lift blockades - Kamruzzaman made an important admission. In places like Berachampa and Hamadama, where he succeeded in reasoning with the protesters - there were also occasions when the mob refused to listen to his pleas - he had talked of the need to preserve the honour of the grameen samaj, prioritizing the dignity of the rural community over religious identity, in order to secure a truce. Kamruzzaman's actions had been heroic. But I had other queries of him: what, for instance, are his views on the alleged radicalization of Muslims, the rationale cited by sectarian forces when intimidating minorities often with targeted, vicious assault? Political attempts, old and new, at radicalizing the majority community are a part of the public discourse. But it has been alleged that secular-minded citizens are diffident when it comes to addressing a similar contagion among Muslims. One of the reasons behind my visit to Baduria was to find out how a Muslim would respond to this supposed anomaly. Kamruzzaman agreed that radicalized elements exist among minorities, as is the case with any religious formation. But it is telling that he had to remind me of the obvious: that the radicals constitute the fringe. However, what allows the fringe to resemble the centre during conflagrations, in Kamruzzaman's opinion, is administrative laxity. The police's eagerness to rely on community leaders like him to defuse the crisis in Basirhat is a case in point. The absence of neutral but effective intervention on the part of the Trinamul administration opened the government up to charges of appeasement during the crises in Dholahat, Hazinagar/Halisahar, Dhulagarh and, more recently, in Raiganj where adivasi organizations indulged in arson. But the more serious issue in this context, Kamruzzaman insisted, was the failure to create a durable civil leadership among Muslims. The blame for this should be shared by India's political class - the Congress, the Left parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party, the least sympathetic of the political formations - that has been content with exercising control over minorities through the agency of the clergy or elected leaders who are indistinguishable from ordained functionaries. Kamruzzaman cited one more reason to explain organized as well as spontaneous violence, Basirhat being an example of the latter kind of disruption. The taste of power, however fleeting, as a means of retribution against an adversary, real or imagined, can be a decisive incentive for the underprivileged. Kamruzzaman is acutely aware of the risk of the falsification of the narrative of radicalism among minorities. This, we agreed, is the sinister trap that has been laid by political Hindutva. The snare works along these lines: provoke vulnerable segments among minorities to retaliate in areas where they have the numerical advantage through incitement, and then use it as evidence to legitimize a broader, brutal counter-mobilization movement against an entire community that has been demonized through sustained propaganda. But there is a way of breaking out of the trap. Kamruzzaman believes it lies in education. As proof, he introduced me to M.D. Irfan Habib, a 22-year-old with a wisp of a stubble, who is pursuing a higher degree in mathematics from Jadavpur University. Irfan talked spiritedly of his unshakeable faith in the scientific temper that helps him question everything, from the diktats of the ruling party to religious edicts. India's liberal constituency has its own entrapment to fight against. Its supposed hesitation to discuss the threat of radicalization in a small segment among minorities could be the result of a well-founded anxiety - that the spin doctors of the Far Right would co-opt such scrutiny to bolster the ongoing process of polarization. But the layered character and chronology of the violence in Basirhat, and elsewhere, must be talked about in the public domain, if only to expose the bigotry of Hindutva. Cancer, as we all know, spreads in silence."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, July 31: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will apprise Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the state's requirement for Rs 2,393 crore to repair infrastructure, including major breaches in embankments caused by the Brahmaputra and other rivers. An official source said according to a preliminary assessment made by the state government, of the Rs 2,939 crore, about Rs 1,800 crore would be required to repair and strengthen embankments and initiate flood control measures. The Prime Minister will chair a series of high-level meetings to review the situation and the relief operations in the northeastern states, particularly in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur. Chief ministers and senior officials of these states will be present at the meetings. The Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad, Assam, today appealed to the Prime Minister to visit the flood-affected areas and meet those still living in refugee camps, instead of taking an aerial route during his visit to the state tomorrow. The Parishad said time has elapsed since the last wave of floods unleashed by the waters of the Ranganadi dam and the floodwaters have receded. An aerial view will not reveal the magnitude of suffering that the people have undergone. A vast area of agricultural land in Lakhimpur district has been covered by silt. The role of the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh in the recent wave of floods in Lakhimpur was discussed by the organisation. Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad officials in Guwahati on Monday. Picture by UB Photos In a meeting of departments of the state government on July 3, 2010, several recommendations were made to Neepco. But these measures were not implemented in full, leading to the disaster this year, alleged the Parishad. It sought punitive measures against Neepco officials. Speaking at a press meet here today, the Parishad's publicity secretary, Dharmakanta Gogoi, said, ""The Prime Minister would not have come to Assam if the Gujarat floods had not happened and had he not gone there in the first place. After visiting Gujarat, he has been forced to come to Assam but after 22 days of the last wave of floods to hit Lakhimpur district, he will not be able to realise the suffering of the people. He should go to the flood-affected places by road and meet the people. He should visit places like Lakhimpur, Majuli, Morigaon and Kaziranga. ""A package of Rs 1,000 crore for the state and special relief package of Rs 200 crore to the worst-affected Lakhimpur district should be announced by the Prime Minister. It is a shame that the state government has distributed relief materials consisting of a total of only 4kg rice, two litres of water, one litre of mustard oil and a tarpaulin for 22 days. Can a family live on 4kg rice for 22 days? Moreover, neither the chief minister, Sarbananda Sonowal, nor the local MLA Utpal Dutta, or the MP, Pradan Barua, has visited Lakhimpur till date,"" added Gogoi. The organisation has raised several demands like announcement of the state flood problem as a national problem, a Rs 1,000-crore flood relief package for the state, special package of Rs 200 crore for Lakhimpur district, shutdown of the Ranganadi project, compensation to those who have lost their houses, compensation and food for two years to farmers whose fields have been covered with silt, punitive action against Neepco officials and investigation into alleged deviation from norms in the construction of the Rs 361 crore embankment on the Ranganadi river. Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass today said no special reception will be arranged for Modi during his visit to Assam tomorrow. Only six or seven members of the state unit will receive the Prime Minister at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. ""We have received instructions from the Prime Minister's Office not to arrange any reception programme for him. The PMO's office said Modi is coming to Assam only to review the flood situation. This way, he will pay homage to those who lost their lives in the flood,"" said Dass. ""By this decision Modi has shown his love for the people of Assam. In the previous government, no Prime Minister had taken such a stern decision,"" he added. Dass said the state government had prepared an audio-visual presentation on the flood situation."

5a1474f89855b76bf13e45c3,A false binary,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170731/jsp/opinion/story_164655.jsp,2017-07-31,"Imagine, for a moment, that M. Venkaiah Naidu did not belong to the Bharatiya Janata Party, that he was not the vice-presidential candidate of the National Democratic Alliance, that he was not an avowed devotee of Messrs Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. Imagine, instead, that he was a member of some other Opposition party, an ideological adversary of the sangh parivar, a fervent critic of the prime minister and the ruling party's president. You do not need a vivid imagination to visualize what would have happened last week in that case. On July 24, the Congress spokesman, Jairam Ramesh, cited the prime minister's oft-repeated invocations against corruption and the need for ""those holding the highest public offices [to] fully disclose their 'interests' as also 'special treatment' in shape of state largesse for themselves and for their kith and kin"". Ramesh went on to ask four questions of the NDA's nominee for vice-president. These related to: the Telangana government exempting the Swarna Bharat Trust of Venkaiah Naidu's daughter from paying various charges amounting to more than two crore rupees to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority; the Telangana government placing an order worth Rs 271 crore for purchase of police vehicles from two companies, one of which - Harsha Toyota - was owned by Naidu's son in contravention of rules and without floating a tender; the Madhya Pradesh government allotting 20 acres of land in Bhopal worth a few hundred crore to the Kushabhau Thakre Memorial Trust with Venkaiah Naidu as chairman for a pittance - an allotment which was eventually quashed by the Supreme Court which passed stringent strictures against political favouritism; and accusations of Naidu grabbing 4.95 acres of land in Andhra Pradesh in 2002 which he was forced to return after a public outcry. The same evening, Naidu answered the charges. Significantly, he confirmed two of the charges and did not adequately rebut the other two. The Telangana government, he said, had ""clarified"" that the Swarna Bharat Trust ""was not the first and the last to be given such an exemption"" and there was nothing in the law that prevented the state government from giving such an exemption. Regarding the allotment of land by the Madhya Pradesh government, Naidu said, somewhat plaintively, ""In my capacity as the BJP national president, I was the ex-officio chairman of this Trust and had no role in the allotment of land. Isn't it a fact that several trusts were similarly allotted land by various governments including the Congress governments?"" On the charge of his son's Toyota dealership getting a big order from the Telangana government, Naidu said, ""The fact of the matter is that Harsha Toyota as a dealer never directly dealt with the state government... The parent company i.e. Toyota, offered to supply vehicles as desired by the state government at DGS&D rates and the supply order was placed on the parent company i.e. Toyota Kirloslar and payment was also made to them."" By asserting that his son's company did not ""directly"" deal with the government, Naidu appeared to inadvertently confirm that it did have some role in the deal. As for the issue of land grab, Naidu said local Congressmen had raised it as early as in 2002 and had even moved the courts ""and the charges of land grabbing were dismissed"". The minutiae of the Naidu case, fascinating though it may be, are not really important. The larger point is that if such charges had been made against an Opposition member or indeed any perceived adversary of the government, there would have been a flurry of activity. Some ""right spirited"" citizen would have lodged an FIR against him or his family, the police would have registered a case with alacrity, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate would have swooped down to ""investigate"" the alleged wrongdoing by persons known and unknown, screaming headlines on the latest corruption scandal unearthed by the crusading Modi government would have greeted readers for days on end and shrill debates on prime time television would have declared Venkaiah Naidu guilty of using his office to get favours for the businesses and trusts belonging to his children. But since Naidu belongs to the right side of the political divide, nothing of that kind is going to happen. Just as nothing is ever going to happen to the Madhya Pradesh chief minister in spite of the gigantic Vyapam scam, or to the Rajasthan chief minister who helped out Lalit Modi, one of India's ""most wanted"", or to the Chhattisgarh chief minister who has been accused of being involved in a Rs 36,000 crore scam for the supply of rice to the public distribution system, or to the Union finance minister who has been repeatedly charged by his own party colleague, Kirti Azad, of being responsible for a huge scam in the Delhi and District Cricket Association. It is in this context of brazenly selective targeting of ""corruption"" that the perfidy of the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, must be seen. Much has been written about Nitish's latest political somersault and his complete lack of ideological conviction that feeds his greed for power. Many have already concluded that the coming together of the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) has ensured a sweeping victory for Modi in 2019. But Nitish has provided the BJP with much more than possible electoral gains. He has succeeded in peddling a ""corruption versus secularism"" binary to the extent that even opponents of the Modi regime appear to think that the secular camp is full of leaders who are financially dubious while the Hindutvawadis are squeaky clean. This is a dangerously false binary for at least two reasons. First, as the Venkaiah case shows, a person is deemed ""corrupt"" today only when the State decides to paint him as such. In some cases, favours can be received and bestowed at will. But no questions will be asked; no action taken. But for those who oppose the ruling regime - be they NGOs or lawyers, media houses or politicians - the entire might of the State will be used to systematically tarnish their image long before any proper investigation, leave alone conviction, takes place. Such is the power of the Modi regime today that neither media nor civil society groups can play their role freely or fearlessly anymore. That is why Nitish can get away with charges of corruption against a 28-year-old Tejashwi Yadav even before a charge sheet is filed and in a case that goes back to when the young man was merely 15 years old. But no cases are registered against wrongdoings by those in power; no one can even question just where the BJP is getting so much money to run its visibly expensive election campaigns or to buy up Opposition legislators in state after state. And so it can get away with claiming that it is ""clean"". Second, there is much more to corruption than just making money through unfair means. Over the last three years, we have seen mobs kill Muslims for what they wear or the food they allegedly eat; we have seen Dalits being attacked and their livelihoods destroyed; we have seen historical facts being overturned in textbooks; we have seen an army officer being honoured for using a human shield; we have seen dissenting voices being silenced through threats and intimidation, we have seen the tenets of our Constitution being trampled at will. Nitish Kumar has decided to overlook all of this. His ""zero tolerance"" for a specific case of alleged corruption cannot fail to hide his infinite tolerance for the many corruptions - the corruption of justice, the corruption of history, the corruption of freedom, the corruption of morality, the corruption of humanity, the corruption of the founding values of the republic - that are gnawing away India's soul. That is why, much like the emperor in the Hans Christian Andersen tale who strutted about in his non-existent new clothes, the halo Nitish Kumar is flaunting today seems hollow to the core.

(File photo | Reuters)NEW DELHI: India's rice output is likely to fall by 1.9 million tonnes (MT) to 94.48 MT in kharif season this year on account of poor rain as well as floods, official sources said.The production of pulses and coarse cereals is estimated to have fallen, dragging the overall foodgrains output in kharif (summer-sown) season to 134.67 MT from a record 138.52 MT in last kharif, as per sources.Kharif foodgrain basket comprises of rice, pulses and coarse cereals. Harvesting will start from next month. Barring sugarcane, the production of all major kharif crops is likely to decline.The Union Agriculture Ministry will release its first advance estimate on Monday.Rice ouptut is estimated to fall at 94.48 MT in the kharif season of the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the record 96.39 MT in last kharif, the official who did not wish to be named said. Pulses output could drop to 8.71 MT from the record 9.42 MT due to depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur and urad are pegged at 3.99 MT and 2.53 MT, respectively. Coarse cereals output is also seen lower at 31.49 MT against 32.71 MT in last kharif season.Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69 million tonnes from 306.72 million tonnes.Oilseeds output is estimated to be down at 20.68 MT in the kharif season of this year from 22.40 MT in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22 MT.The fall in kharif output is attributed to dry spell as well as floods in some parts of the country. The overall southwest monsoon, crucial for rain-fed kharif crops, was projected normal, but till first week of this month it was less by five per cent.Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states.The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting."

Hence we decided to adopt this strategy,"" Gupta said.On Saturday, Pepsico Holdings held an event here where bloggers - mostly young women - were told about Kurkure and the production process.With the assistance of an award winning chef, the participants also whipped up some dishes made with several variants of Kurkure.Gupta said: ""Any food that is taken in moderate quantity is good. The problem crops up when one overdoes something.""Queried about the usage of palmolein oil in the making of the product instead of other oils like rice bran oil, Gupta said: ""The oil suits well with the product. The usage of palmolein oil is not driven by costs.""""Many of our competitors play with the ingredient quantities when the prices fluctuate,"" she added.""Even at home it is advisable to change the oil brands once in two months so as to derive the benefits offered by them. In the case of Kurkure the oil quantity used may not be much. Only children above the age of five should be given salty snacks. All food stuffs should be consumed in moderate quantities,"" T. Shanthi Kaavery, a consulting dietician, told IANS.From one variant in 1999, Kurkure has 40 variants and is also exported to several countries.""Kurkure is made in our plants in Canada and Bangladesh. The product is exported to Gulf countries.""She said the organised Indian snack food market is around Rs 17,000 crore and is logging double digit growth.Gupta said the company offers various regional flavours under Kurkure brand."

There is a different energy that fills the air with the realisation of Pujo asche! (The Puja is coming). The chills in the air, Durga idols on the roadside, fresh flowers adorning the streets, pandal structures show the people of Bengal are getting ready to welcome Maa Durga.To aid in the festivities and soothe the strong pinch of nostalgia, DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Bangalore has come up with The Calcutta Connection  a celebration of the culinary flavours from the East India during Durga Puja. They bring together four special events from Saptami to Dashami, assuring to provide an unparalleled taste of Bengali cuisine in Bengaluru.

There was absolutely nothing bad at The Calcutta Connection. Here is my top five picks that were simply awesome.Golborir Kosha MangshoInspired by an old restaurant that is considered as a heaven for meat lovers in Kolkata, this is the best Kosha Mangsho I have ever had. The perfectly cooked mutton, that beautiful brown colour, the bubbles of different spices, the aroma filling your nose... absolutely lip-smacking stuff. The taste multiplies when you have it with luchi.Machcher PaturiI was speechless after I had a first bite of this Bengali classic. Machcher Paturi is prepared by wrapping fish Bhetki in a banana leaf with mustard paste. It is slowly cooked in steam and served. The strong flavour of mustard is the soul of this dish. This is something, you would not want to miss.Shiraz Mutton BiryaniThe taste of Kolkata Biryani is one thing that has been tough to forget over the years. The boiled potatoes, the basmati rice, the aroma of Asghar Ali attar specially used in Biryanis and the finely cooked mutton evoked the wonderful memories I had in Kolkata.Lau er Ghanto Bori DiyeThis is Bottle Gourd curry in a Bengali style with vada. The beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity. When so much of action is happening on the plate with the likes of fish and mutton, it tends to get sidelined. But a small portion of it with rice or chapati will restore your faith in it. It is usually cooked with minimal spices, coriander being the most dominant among all. The aroma of ghee adds the needed finesse.Darjeeling Tea Panna Cotta and Gold Flake SmokeTea in one hand and cigarette in another is a common sight in Bengal. Taking a cue from this, the chefs have prepared this dish."

Some 2,000 cows have also been evacuated from the flanks of the volcano.President Joko Widodo was due to visit crammed evacuation centres in Bali on Tuesday afternoon.Balinese residents, international NGOs and the central government have begun organising aid.Vehicles loaded with noodles, mineral water and blankets have been sent to the evacuation centres, while residents around the island have been collecting donations.Bali's ""sister village"" programme and tradition of communal assistance means evacuees have been able to stay in villages outside the danger zone.I Ketut Subandi, head of logistics at the village of Tana Ampo, said basic food items like rice, instant noodles, cooking oil and water were most needed.""This morning we were worried because we had limited rice supply, but now we have received more rice stocks from donors,"" Subandi said.Indonesia's national disaster agency has sent 640,000 face masks, 12,500 mattresses, 8,400 blankets and 50 tents. The central government has a relief fund totalling nearly $150 million to meet the cost of natural disasters, which could be tapped in case of an eruption.Officials announced the highest possible alert level on Friday due to the increasing volcanic activity and warned people to stay at least nine kilometres away from the crater.Operators have cancelled trekking tours on the mountain but officials have otherwise been at pains to assure tourists the island is safe.The airport in Bali's capital Denpasar, through which millions of foreign tourists pass every year, has not been affected, but several countries including Australia and Singapore have issued a travel advisory.Flights to and from the island have not been interrupted but airlines are watching the situation closely.Virgin Australia said it would be making an extra fuel stop in Darwin for some of its flights between Australia and Bali in case it is forced to turn back.Singapore Airlines said customers travelling between September 23 and October 2 could rebook flights or ask for a refund.Mount Agung is one of more than 120 active volcanoes extending the length of Indonesia, which straddles the Pacific Ring of Fire.It last erupted in 1963, killing nearly 1,600 people and sending ash as far as the capital Jakarta."

Expect Chholar Daal Narkel Diye (coconut flavoured chana daal), Aloo Posto (new potatoes tossed in poppy seeds) to go perfectly with a generous portion of ghee rice. We pay a lot of attention to the kind of potatoes we use in this dish. They need to be round, firm and tiny, informed the chef.

We waited with patience till the chef brought Kosha Mangsho (spicy lamb preparation).The meat pieces were cooked to perfection, the thick gravy only added to the taste.

Naidu offered holy water laced with turmeric, kumkum and flowers to the river before performing the harathi.Later, he inaugurated the Narasapuram anicut (barrage) constructed with an estimated `16.17 crore which aims at providing irrigation to nearly 3,500 acres in and around Kasimkota and Anakapalle mandals. Later, Naidu visited a photo exhibition and addressed a public meeting at Gobbooru. He announced `27 crore for a new irrigation project at Tummapala under the Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi scheme, ensuring irrigation waters for 19,541 acres.Women offer harathi to Sarada river at Narasapuram | ExpressI have sanctioned the fund and the works will begin at the earliest, the Chief Minister said.Naidu said that the government had undertaken Uttarandhra Sujala Sravanthi project to ensure adequate irrigation and drinking water from Godavari river at an estimated budget of `22,002 crore.He promised that the land acquisition process would be completed soon and the project will be ready before the next general elections.During his address, the Chief Minister rolled out statistics to explain the importance of water resources and the measures initiated by the government in this regard. The government is already spending nearly `40,000 crore on irrigation sector and ready to allocate `10,000 crore more. Additional funds of `10,000 crore available under the NREGS can also be utilised for the works, he said. As many as 4,017 village tanks, 15 lakh borewells, 1,135 lift irrigation units, 5,500 connecting tanks and 58,000 check dams have been set up in the State. Recently, we have finished the project of 6.16 lakh new connecting tanks. Fortunately, the North Andhra districts have a good groundwater reserve and farmers should dig for borewells to increase the crop acreage, but the water must be used prudently, he said.In a bid to create awareness among people about the importance of water and other natural resources, Naidu said the government has introduced three festivalsYeruvaaka, Jalasiri Ki Harathi and Vanam-Manam to safeguard the natural resources, especially water. Only half of the total 2 crore acre fertile land in the State have access to irrigation water. Another 20 lakh acres will be benefited after all the proposed projects are grounded. I suggest farmers to go for fruit cultivation so that the acreage can be increased from the present 40 lakh acres to 1 crore acres. Farmers must also concentrate on dairy trade, Naidu said.He exhorted the people to make use of the Praja Parishkara Vedika helpline (1100) to register complaints about the inconvenience at government offices. I promise that each complaint registered through 1100 toll-free number will be solved, he said. Later, he administered the Jalasiri Ki Harathi pledge to the gathering and assured that funds for the next phase of DWCRA loan interest waiver amounts would be released soon.

The CM also highlighted the initiatives taken to ensure a corruption-free government. We will not spare the guilty of any irregularity.

5a147ebb9855b76bf13e4d71,Festive focus,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/sep/25/festive-focus-1662600.html,2017-09-25,"HYDERABAD: Festival season is here. Time to add a glow to the skin! For glowing skin on the body, tie ingredients in a clean cloth, wet slightly and then rub the cloth bag on the skin while bathing. Mix powdered milk, ground almonds (badaam), rice powder and rose petals. The ingredients work on your skin, gently cleansing it and leaving it soft, smooth and vibrant. Night time cleansing is more important, in order to remove pollutants and make up before bedtime. For normal to dry skin, use a cleansing cream or gel. For oily and combination skin, use face wash or cleansing lotion. Tone the skin daily with chilled rose water, using cotton wool pads. Wipe and stroke the skin with them.Then, pat briskly with the rosewater-soaked cotton wool pads. Using facial scrub once or twice a week works wonders, removing dead cells and brightening the skin. Mix ground almonds with yogurt. Apply on face and rub gently, with small circular movements, washing off with water. Multani Mitti is said to clarify the skin and bring about a glow. For oily skin, mix it with rose water into a paste and apply on the face, avoiding the lips and area around eyes. Wash it off when it is dry. For combination skin, apply the mask on oily areas of the skin. For acne, add sandalwood paste, rose water and neem leaf powder.Hair Care and StyleFor dull hair, have a quick conditioning treatment before your shampoo. Mix one teaspoon each of vinegar with one egg or a little almond oil. Massage into the hair. Then do the hot towel wrap. Wash hair after half an hour. To soften frizzy hair, mix some water with creamy hair conditioner and put it in a spray bottle. Spray the mixture on the hair. Then comb the hair, so that it spreads through the hair.Long hair, with cascading waves and curls is in. The entire look is soft and feminine, with big natural waves, especially in the lower half of the hair. Fringes are in. Oval and long faces look good with a fringe. A layered fringe can make a large or round face look slimmer. Short fringes suit small faces. Pony tails and side braids (plaits) are in fashion.Make UpFirst, cleanse the skin and apply a liquid moisturizer. For oily skin, apply an astringent lotion with cotton wool. Wait for a few minutes. Then, cover blemishes with a concealer, before applying foundation. Or, use a lighter colour foundation on dark blemishes and then apply normal foundation on the entire face. Lightly apply powder to set the foundation.Highlight the cheeks with a blusher. Apply on the cheekbones, going slightly upwards and outwards. Then, apply light coloured highlighter on the cheekbones. Blend well. Blusher colours for the night need not match lip colour.For eyes, apply lighter brown shadow on the upper eye lid and dark brown eye shadow in the crease, to add depth. Outline the eyes with dark eye pencil or eyeliner. For a smudged effect, a dark eye shadow also works well on the upper lid, close to the lashes. Extend it a little beyond the outer corner of the eyes, slightly upwards. Smudging can be done with a sponge tipped applicator. Eye liner or dark eye shadow may be applied on the lower lid and then smudged.Highlight under the brows with gold, ivory or a light coloured eye shadow. Then apply mascara. While applying mascara on the upper lashes, look downwards. Apply on lower lashes too. Wait for a while and apply a second coat. Then brush out the lashes, with a small eyelash brush. To make lashes appear thicker, apply powder between two coats of mascara.Gloss is popular for the lips. For normal Indian complexion, go for warm earthy colours, like coral, wine, plum, strawberry, and shades of red in lipstick. A dark pink or rose-red would look good too. Look for a decorative stone-studded bindi, to match your dress."
5a147ec59855b76bf13e4d79,Respect women is the message of Bathukamma,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/sep/22/respect-women-is-the-message-of-bathukamma-1661265.html,2017-09-22,"HYDERABAD: Her phone buzzed incessantly as she jotted down to-do list on one hand and instructed her assistants on the other. All this, while addressing us on Bathukamma, a floral festival of Telangana nativity and its significance. Her hot green tea in a grey ceramic mug was getting cold but not her energy levels. Kavitha Kalvakuntla, Member of Parliament from Nizamabad district and founder of Telangana Jagruthi is a proof why women are called true multitaskers.Humming her favourite Bathukamma song, she says that this colourful festival is close to her heart and singing those songs during the festival is her favourite part of the nine-day long festival. Unlike every year where 12 Bathukamma songs get released, this year they released 60 songs by 12 artistes.Just like how dialect changes every 100 kilometres, songs too vary in every part of Telangana. Reflecting the soul of every area of Telanganas folklore is the list of songs released this year. Usually, the priest performs the rituals and others just worship. This is a folk festival, where everyone knows the song, participates and adds his or her own version to it, which becomes an extension of the festival. Keeping this in mind, we focused on the songs, besides the other needful arrangements, she informs.Generally in Telangana, people are more inclined towards Lord Shiva and Goddess. The songs are also based on them. It is close to our hearts because it is a semi-religious festival. There is no restriction and limitations, she shares while adding why the almost faded festival needed a revival. Kavitha says she is cool with Bathukamma song being remixed and played at parties. Caste issues or discrimination was not the reason for the destruction of this festival. The influence of globalisation and Andhra rule made Bathukamma take a back-step. Thanks to Telangana movement, the festival regained its glory, she rejoices.The way poetry was used during French Revolution, Kavitha used this folklore festival Bathukamma during Telangana separate state revolution. There were many revolutions in the world that failed because culture was not made a part of it. When I started Telangana Jagruthi in 2006, I started to work with Telangana rural women, who were not sanctioned loans by the banks. I realised we should pick up a point that would rally thousands of women into the movement. I was looking for a thread that could connect all the women.Taking inspiration from Bal Gangadhar Tilak, I programmed Bathukamma. Women taking up Bathukamma communicated that they were fighting for a separate state. Bathukamma and Bonalu became symbols of protest and not just festivals. Today, it is a celebration, she beams. We made Bonalu our state festival and our financial commitment is with it, she adds smiling.Last year, Kavitha travelled to nine countries to promote the importance of this floral festival but this year, she confines herself to attending Bathukamma events in Hyderabad.Going down the memory lane, Kavitha says she has fond recollection of celebrating the festival in her village along with her grandmother. Every year, we used to be off to the village for nine days. Wed enjoy watching the festival and even took part in the activities until my grandmother was alive, she smiles and also adds that the vacuum her her grandmother left was filled through the floral festivities.Kavitha was going viral not just on vernacular media but also on national media during Rakshabandhan for promoting the idea of gifting helmets to brothers. Speaking about the idea, Kavitha says, It was not my idea. I just promoted it as I liked it. A kid called Vamsi made a video saying, if sisters gift helmets to brothers, they will think twice to take it off or forget to wear it. I wanted to launch this on my brothers birthday, so I waited for it. It was a surprise for him too. I am glad, it made a difference on a national level, she laughs.Would she like to attach a cause to Bathukamma too? Pat comes the reply, There are already plenty of causes attached to Bathukamma. Teamwork, unity, protection of water bodies, protection of the environment, and of course enjoying every moment of life. The intrinsic message is being sensitive and respectful towards women and it begins at home. Women empowerment starts at home, enlightens the first women MP from Telangana.Africans are the oldest being on the planet. They danced around a centrally placed force. It could be fire or flowers. The same thing applies Bathukamma. They sing and dance in the circular motion around the force called  Shakthi. The format of the festival shows that it is an age-old festival, although we cannot determine the day it started, she shares while speaking about the history of Bathukamma. It is a and nice and fun festival yaar! she says. How does she see the role of men in the festival? Their role is in bringing the flowers and carrying it when it gets heavy and helping the same throw in the lake if the shore of the lake is slippery or broken. I dont have many Bathukamma memories with Ram anna (KTR). Earlier, holidays were given during Sankranthi and not during Dussera. I used to take leave and go with my parents but he used to study in a hostel and wouldnt make it to the festival often, the sister shares.Talking about the special food prepared during the festival, she says the home-grown items like corn, moong dal is prepared. In the folk culture, people treat God as one among of them. According to them, God eats what we do and does what we do. Thus the food consumed by us is offered to the God too. Malidha Muddalu, made of roti and jaggery is the special dish prepared during Bathukamma.On the ninth day, they offer saddhannam. It is nine varieties of rice items like curd rice etc because it can sustain for long. The significance is, we are sending the goddess back, so we are giving her food that doesnt perish immediately, she explains passionately also adding that her personal favourite is makka garalu (corn vadas).Her vision for Bathukamma is to make it popular like Onam or any other state festival. When people think of Kerala, they think of Onam. I want to live the day when people associate Telangana with Bathukamma, she concludes."

(File photo | AP)COX'S BAZAR: Bangladesh's refugee camps are on the brink of a ""public health disaster,"" Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has warned, saying filthy water and faeces flow through shanties now bursting with Rohinyga Muslims who have fled violence in Myanmar.More than 420,000 Rohingya have overwhelmed Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar in under a month, seeking refuge following an army-led crackdown across the border in Myanmar's Rakhine state, which the UN has described as ""ethnic cleansing"".The weary and wounded arrivals have shocked the world with stories of Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs driving them out of their homes with rape, gunshots and arson.Meanwhile in Bangladesh, there are dire shortages of nearly all forms of relief in what has become one of the world's largest refugee settlements.MSF on Thursday warned that a ""massive scale-up of humanitarian aid is needed in Bangladesh to avoid a public health disaster"".""We are receiving adults every day on the cusp of dying from dehydration,"" said Kate White, the group's emergency medical coordinator.""That's very rare among adults, and signals that a public health emergency could be just around the corner.""There are no official roads into the slum-like settlements that have sprung up outside official camps, complicating aid delivery in the hilly, mud-slicked terrain.""There is a complete absence of latrines,"" added White.

(Photo | AP)BANGKOK: Thailand's top court will deliver a verdict Wednesday on whether former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra is guilty of negligence -- but the fugitive politician will almost certainly be a no-show, having yet to publicly emerge since she fled the kingdom last month.Yingluck, whose elected government was toppled in a 2014 coup, faces up to a decade in jail for negligence over a rice policy.The Supreme Court ruling was supposed to be read on August 25, but the 50-year-old threw the court a curveball when she failed to show up, stunning thousands of supporters who had gathered outside.Yingluck has not made any public appearance or comments since her vanishing act, but there are widespread reports she has joined her billionaire brother Thaksin, a former prime minister also ousted in a 2006 coup, in Dubai.On Wednesday, as her lawyers arrived at the Bangkok court, several hundred supporters gathered outside chanted ""we love"" Yingluck, followed by ""Dubai!""On the eve of the verdict junta chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha declared his ""spies"" had informed him of Yingluck's whereabouts, but said he would not reveal her location until after the judgement was delivered.Yingluck's lawyer Norawit Lalaeng, meanwhile, told AFP he had not spoken to his client since her disappearance.""She hasn't contacted me at all since last month,"" he said.- Tight security net -Thailand's junta leaders -- arch enemies of the Shinawatra siblings -- deny having any prior knowledge of Yingluck's plan to escape.But many are unconvinced given the junta's tight security net and round-the-clock surveillance of the former leader.Analysts say Yingluck likely cut a deal with the military leaders, who are bent on scrubbing her powerful clan from Thailand's political scene.""By getting Yingluck out of Thailand, the military gets rid of a potential thorn in their side who could become a martyr if jailed, or a powerful politician again if she is not,"" said Paul Chambers, an expert on Thai politics.Yingluck's trial revolves around accusations that she failed to stop corruption in a rice subsidy scheme that pumped cash into her family's rural base in the northeast.The policy was wildly popular among farmers but slammed as a costly populist handout by her critics in the royalist, army-backed elite.Those divisions -- between Shinawatra supporters among the urban and rural poor and rivals in the traditional aristocracy -- have gnawed at Thailand for over a decade.While the Shinawatra clan has dominated electoral politics, their governments have been repeatedly knocked down by coups and court rulings backed by elites, triggering rounds of rival protests.Political unrest has been hemmed in under the junta, which has banned protests and smothered dissent.With both Yingluck and Thaksin now in exile, there are major questions about the future of their political dynasty and the pro-democracy ""Redshirt"" movement formed by their supporters.Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a politics expert at Chulalongkorn University, said a heavy sentencing Wednesday would jack up Thailand's political temperature but is unlikely to trigger any ""cataclysmic"" forms of unrest.If the ruling is ""harsh and seen as unjust, it will exacerbate and build up frustrations on one side of Thailand's polarised society,"" he told AFP."

Telegraph picture Ranchi, Sept. 23: Two teenagers and a youth, who got abducted on September 5 from Ranchi when they left home for a joyride without informing their parents, were recovered today from Saranda forest following a joint operation by Ranchi police and their counterparts in Chaibasa (West Singhbhum). Around a dozen criminals involved in the abduction, some from within the city and others hailing from outside Jharkhand, are learnt to have been nabbed. They are being questioned at different undisclosed locations in Ranchi, police sources said. None in Ranchi police wanted to divulge much about the way they cracked the case till the interrogations were over. The father of one of the victims confirmed the recovery to this paper. On September 5 (Wednesday) afternoon, Chutia resident Shivam Singh (16) took his father Madan's car and left for a joyride with his friends Gaurav Singh (15) and Shanky (23) around 1.30pm without informing his parents. When the three didn't return home, Madan filed a case in Chutia police station on September 6 after failing to contact them on their mobiles that were switched off. Around 8am on September 6, the car in which they left home, was found abandoned by the police on Ring Road under Nagri police station on the outskirts of the capital. ""It was a dead end for us as the car didn't give us any clue. There weren't any eyewitnesses either,"" an official of Chutia police station said. Shedding light on the way they went about the case, he said the top brass of Ranchi police set up around four teams with different briefings. ""As the mobile phones of the three victims were switched off, we tried to trace other phones that remained active around the place where the car was found. Other teams were engaged in tracking the activities of some of the notorious groups through informers. Meanwhile, Madan received a few ransom calls from a couple of unknown numbers whose locations kept on changing. After monitoring those calls for days, we could zero in on a few suspicious numbers active in Saranda forest,"" he said. Another officer of Ranchi police said a team visited a few places in Bihar and Bengal following a tip-off, but that didn't yield much success. He said ransom was the motive behind the abduction. Chutia police station OC B.K. Bharati said a formal news meet was expected in a couple of days. Talking to The Telegraph over phone, Madan said his son and his two friends arrived at 8.15am today morning. ""We left with the police last night for Saranda (Goielkera) from Ranchi and a special operation was launched in the deep jungles around midnight. The boys were not allowed to take bath all these days and were tied with iron chains in the jungle. They were only fed rice and dal,"" he said, hailing the police's efforts in handling the case sensitively.. "" Shabd nahi hai police ki tariff ke liye. Unhone sensitivity se is case pe kaam kiya. Hume sabse bada Puja gift de diya. (I don't have words to praise the police for the way they have handled the case so sensitively. We got the biggest Puja gift),"" he said.

5a1483489855b76bf13e5124,Move to find dealers to deliver foodgrain,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/northeast/story_174802.jsp,2017-09-25,"DELIVERY AWAITED Guwahati, Sept. 24: The food and civil supplies department will float fresh tenders to find ""authorised dealers"" from private parties to deliver foodgrains to all fair-price shops in the state. The decision follows Thursday's order by Gauhati High Court, asking the state government to ensure that foodgrains are delivered only through authorised dealers. It barred the Gram Panchayat Samabay Samitis (GMSS), co-operative societies and fair price shops from lifting foodgrains. An official of the department said according to the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, the state should deliver foodgrains to the fair price shops through authorised dealers only. But in Assam, the GMSS, cooperative societies and some fair price shops had been lifting foodgrains from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns. After the NFSA was implemented, the GMSS and cooperative societies had said they should be allowed to deliver foodgrains like before and moved the high court. The court in October 2015 in an interim order had asked the state government to maintain the status quo. ""The court had clubbed all petitions that it received from different Samitis and cooperative societies. After dwelling upon the provisions of the NFSA, the court gave the verdict in our favour,"" a source said. The GMSS or cooperative societies are financially weak and they often resort to protests if the process of release pending bills gets delayed, affecting lakhs of people living below the poverty line. ""However, the Samitis are free to participate in the tender process. If they can fulfil the required criteria, no one will stop them from supplying foodgrains,"" the source added. He said the court's direction will help the state government maintain transparency and streamline the delivery process. ""The role of cooperative societies, Samitis and fair price shops in the public distribution scheme (PDS) in Assam has to essentially remain confined to the scope and ambit of the licences under the order of 1982. As the order does not confer any right upon the cooperative societies and GPSS to transport foodgrains, such a right cannot be recognised by this court in favour of the petitioners,"" the court said. ""Under the targeted public distribution system, it shall be the duty of the state government to take delivery of foodgrains from the designated depots of the central government in the state at the prices specified in Schedule I, organise intra-state allocations for delivery of the allocated foodgrains through their authorised agencies at the doorstep of each fair price shop,"" the NFSA said, regarding the delivery system. There are 38,000 fair price shops in the state that supply rice under the PDS to 2.52 crore people."

Here's how you can opt for healthy ready-to-eat...,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/canned-food-got-you-in-a-pickle-here-s-how-you-can-opt-for-healthy-ready-to-eat-meals/story-69mV8NyIUMsBFC4D0osBzK.html,2017-10-01,"Theres nothing more satiating than relishing a traditional home cooked meal after a tiring day at work. But, thanks to our lifestyle, cooking after work feels like a tiresome chore. And, this is the reason why we are increasingly opting for ready-to-eat processed Indian meals, packaged chutneys and pickles. The appeal of these processed products is simple. You dont have to cook; they go straight from spoon to mouth. However, we conveniently ignore the fact that these processed foods come laden with preservatives that are extremely unhealthy and ecologically unsustainable. To combat the rise of packaged unsustainable Indian foods, many food enthusiasts are popularising homemade Indian sustainable products, which include pickles, condiments and ready-made meals. I love cooking traditional South Indian meals. Every time I used an age old recipe, I struggled with getting authentic masalas. The ready-made condiments available in the market lack authentic flavour and aroma. Thats when I decided to make my own masalas. I make gunpowder, sambar powder and tamarind rice mix at home. They became so popular among my friends that they prodded me to launch my own range of masalas. We use traditional recipes to make preservative free, fresh, natural, and healthy products, says 50-year-old Sudha Raj. She started her venture last year in August, under the name of Zing, along with her 58-year- old sister, Sushila Srinivasan. Sudha says its a myth that homemade masalas and condiments have a very short shelf life. The shelf life of these products can go up to one year, depending on the product. Her products start at Rs150.Preserving our rich culinary traditionApart from being healthy, sustainable food products help preserve our rich culinary tradition. Our recipes have been handed over through generations. I dont think you can enjoy authentic Indian food if you club processed product to your food. What we make at home is free of chemicals and added colours. Our raw papaya, tomato and garlic relish and pickles such as adrak ka achar and hari mirch ka achar are very popular . The starting price of one jar is Rs100,says 34-year- old chef Chandrashekar, who has been making homemade preservative-free pickles for 4 years now.Economic ChallengesMango chilli jam available at Rummy Kitchen .Despite various benefits that come with sustainable products, economic challenges are a barrier to making it a preferred choice for consumers as compared to packaged products. Organic, fresh ingredients are expensive to acquire. Competing with big brands that produce in bulk and sell at low cost, is difficult. Consumers also prefer buying off-the-shelf products. And convenience and pricing become the determining factor, says 45-year-old Inderpreet Nagpal, who started her food venture Rummy Kitchen, three years ago.Inderpreet makes organic pickles and jams. Her range includes chicken, surmai, pork, prawns, keema pickles and jams such as mutton chilli jam and bacon jam. The starting price for one jar is Rs200.Apart from the expensive ingredients, getting a license to market homemade products to grocery stores is also a challenge. You need to register and get a license to market your product. To get a license to sell, you need to show a turnover of at least Rs12 lakh minimum. This is why our products dont make it to grocery stores, says Sudha Raj.Aloo Goli available at Just 2 Eat.So, how does one deal with the economic challenge? 42-year-old Manmohan Singh, who started his venture Just 2 Eat, six months ago, believes that one can deal with economic hindrances by mass producing sustainable food items. We produce packaged Indian food without using preservatives. Through our NGO Singh Educational Welfare Association along with the help of KVIC (Khadi And Village Industries Commission), we impart culinary skills to children above the age of 16 years in rural places. The advantage of this is that we are able to produce mass quantities of sustainable Indian food. These kids acquire the necessary skills to start their own small venture in the near future. Also, it stops rural migration of the children to metropolitan cities, says Singh. His products start at Rs90 and include ready-to-eat dishes such as Aloo Gobhi, Rajma Chawal, and Chicken Biryani.Expert opinion on preservativesPreservatives contains chemicals such as formalin and sodium metaborate. They are high in sodium content. In the long run, they can harm our internal organs such as heart, liver and the kidneys. They also cause high blood pressure and obesity. Packaged products that have a very long shell life are risky, as they contain too many preservatives. Preservatives can make us feel lethargic and irritated. - Dr Mohsin Wali, cardiologist and former honorary physician to the President"

The Centres initiative is likely to aid in better understanding of erosion activities on the island New Delhi, Sept. 20: The Centre's biotechnology department today announced plans to launch a floating laboratory on the Brahmaputra to study the biodiversity and ecosystem along the river's floodplains to help guide river and flood management policies. The so-called Brahmaputra Biodiversity and Biology Boat (B4) initiative will place a barge equipped with laboratories to analyse soil, plants, microbes and water at different points along the river to generate new knowledge for multiple agencies involved in river management, senior biotechnology officials said. The lab on the boat will provide scientists an opportunity to study plant biodiversity along the river's floodplains, interactions between the water and biodiversity and impacts of humans on the ecosystem, said biotechnology secretary Krishnaswamy VijayRaghavan. A group led by Utpal Bora, professor of bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, is likely to anchor the research activities on the boat. ""The information from such research could feed back into decision making on issues such as dealing with floods,"" VijayaRaghavan said. The B4 initiative, developed in consultation with the Union ministry of development of the northeastern region (DONER), is expected to start in December this year with the first laboratory on a boat that will move along the river from Pasighat in Arunachal Pradesh to Dibrugarh, Neematighat, Tezpur and Guwahati in Assam.. A senior biotechnology official said one possible goal would be to understand better the long-standing erosion activities on Majuli, the world's largest river island that has been shrinking. Scientists from Dibrugarh University and a Council of Scientific and Industrial Research laboratory in Jorhat had in 2003 documented that Majuli had an erosion rate of about 1.9 square km per year between 1920 and 1998. ""We'd like to understand better whether certain species of vegetation might help control such losses,"" the official said. Over time, the biotechnology department will introduce a larger barge that will have two floors - one for scientific staff housing analytical and study equipment, while the other floor will host local citizens to help them understand the experimental process of science data generation. Under a suggestion from the DONER ministry, the biotechnology department also plans to add smaller boats that could conduct similar scientific studies along smaller tributaries and river channels. Union science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan said the proposal of floating lab on the Brahmaputra is part of multiple biotechnology department initiatives in the Northeast, including a ""major mission"" to look for new medicines in traditional plants. Vardhan said the Rs 50-crore ""phyto-pharma plant mission"" will seek to identify, conserve and propagate the cultivation of key medicinal plants, tapping if available into the traditional ethno-botanical knowledge and the biodiversity of the Northeast. The mission's goal would be to help cultivators in the northeastern states to grow botanical raw material that could be used by the phytopharmacerutical industry worldwide. The department has also initiated an effort to use biotechnology interventions to increase the yields of the aromatic rice varieties in the northeastern region. The aromatic rice, particularly Joha and Black rice, have high aroma content but are currently viewed as poor yielders and susceptible to pest attacks. Vardhan also announced a biotechnology department plan to distribute an inexpensive microscope crafted out of origami - a foldoscope - to dozens of schools and colleges across the Northeast. The foldoscope, developed by Manu Prakash, an assistant professor of bioengineering at Stanford University in the US and expected to cost about Rs 70, will allow students to study microscopic objects in the absence of traditional, more expensive, laboratory microscopes. The minister said the biotechnology department had decided to commit 10 per cent of its annual budget for programmes in the Northeast. This year, the department expects to spend Rs 200 crore on initiatives in the northeastern states."

According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

Youll be served the yellow arhar dal every night, a family tradition. But all her neighbours in Manocha Apartments know she is actually a closet radical.You see, Ms Saxena is famous for making dishes that look like chicken and fish but are vegetarian. For instance, she might churn out something that looks like chicken biryani but its rice cooked with kathal (jackfruit). Her gobhi ka keema is not cauliflowers cooked in keema (minced meat) but minced soyabeans.This evening, we are at her home in West Delhis Vikaspuri and shes rustling up kacche kele ki machli for us.No, it is not fish simmered in some banana-based gravy. True to form, it is just humble kela. Ms Saxena will simply steam the banana, after which, when I press each soft piece with my hands, it gets flattened and looks exactly like a fish fillet, complete with its while stringy veins.Ms Saxena, who works in an embassy, learned the recipe from her mother-in-law, Sarla, who learned it years ago from her mother, Draupadi, who had a large banana orchard in western UP.After the dish is done, the table is laid out and we sit down with Ms Saxenas family, which includes her husband and daughter.Our verdict on kachhe kele ki machhi? It does not taste like banana at all. It may even be fish, if we didnt know the truth. Whatever it is, its delicious. And, oh yes, theres arhar dal too.KACHE KELE KI MACHALI (Serves 4 people)INGREDIENTSKache hare kele (Raw bananas) 1/2 kgOnions 2 bigGarlic 6 clovesGinger 1 inch cubeTurmeric 1 tea spoonRed chili powder 3/4 teaspoonCoriander powder 2 teaspoonGaram masala a pinchSalt to tasteMustard oilFresh Coriander leaves for garnishingRECIPECut bananas into half, place in cooker, add one cup water.

With Rs 100 price hike every day, farmers are earning Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 per acre, said Rajesh Kamboj, a farmer from Radaur in Yamunanagar district.Raj Kumar, a farmer from Ladwa of the district, said, We have Pusa 1509 variety and the prices are good this year. This will help us pay the debts as we did not see any hike in the prices of paddy since 2013.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.As the prices of basmati varieties generally depend on the demand outside the country, it is for the first time since 2103 the prices have crossed the Rs 3,000 per quintal mark in the beginning of the procurement season. It may even rise further and the lateral variety of desi basmati (Taraori) may cross the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark, said Sohan Lal of Shri Ram Trading Company in Kurukshetra.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.Even as several high-yielding paddy varieties are sown in the region, the farmers says that Pusa 1509 is considered the best because it is the only basmati variety which takes 90 days to mature, a month less than the other long-grained varieties. In this case, the farmers get an extra month to sow other crops like mustard and winter vegetables.What caused price riseSome people claimed that the basmati prices have increased following a demand in the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Rice exporters, however, are of the opinion that the prices have jumped after a tax exemption on paddy and rice following implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST).Talking to HT, former president and governing body member of all India Rice Exporters Association Vijay Setia said there is no additional demand this time and it is the 5 per cent tax exemption before the GST that caused the rise. New traders had invested in the rice industry when demonetisation took place and they will make profit in the next few months, he said.But the increase in prices is not stable and nobody can predict what will be price of the basmati next year. The overall acreage under Basmati has dipped by 10 per cent in Haryana, he said.Haryanas share in basmati exportAs per the All India Rice Exporters Association, Haryana and Punjab each have 40 per cent share in the total 40 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of basmati export from the country. Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts make a significant contribution to the states 16 lakh MT basmati production."
5a148ccc9855b76bf13e575f,Ec(h)o-friendly Diwali | Anatomy of a cracker: A toxic affair,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/ec-h-o-friendly-diwali-anatomy-of-a-cracker-a-toxic-affair/story-ZSZlLEjNALbc1J21GGjB4L.html,2017-10-18,"The glitz and glitter of the festive season hide its dark underbelly, which is manifested in various ailments caused by the polluted air, noisy surroundings, and toxic waste.Crackers and chemicals used in them: Rockets: Barium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sulphur, aluminium powder, carbonAtom bomb: Potassium nitrate, barium nitrate, sulphur, aluminium powderWheels: Barium nitrate, potassium nitrate, aluminium chips, aluminium powderFountains: Barium nitrate, potassium nitrate, aluminium chips, aluminium powderSparklers: Barium nitrate, cassia gum, iron filling, aluminium powderEvery year, crackers burnt on Diwali release a massive amount of pollutants in a short time. A cracker is generally made by tightly packing potassium, carbon nitrate and sulfur in several layers of paper. In the beginning, the aim was to create a loud bang, but increasingly crackers also emit a large number of colours. While it is difficult not to admire the riot of colours in the sky, the toxins emitted in the air are harmful for the lungs.Prafulla Chandra, a senior research fellow at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, says Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), when inhaled in high concentration, damages the lung tissues and triggers respiratory ailments.In 2016, the ambient concentration of SO2 on Diwali night (a 12-hour average from 6:00 pm to 6:00 am) was 118 ug m-3 , which was 23 times higher than the concentrations observed on the pre Diwali night.Prafulla further warned that SO2 also causes irritation in the nose and mouth as it can form aggressive sulphur containing acids on reacting with moist surfaces inside the body leading to the destruction of the tissues.In 2016, the ambient concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) on Diwali night was as high as 1100 ugm-3 , which was five times higher than the concentrations observed on the pre Diwali night. Particulate matter consists of tiny particles in the air that cause the air to appear hazy and reduce visibility.Chemical and Risks Barium nitrate: Health risks. Like all soluble barium compounds, barium nitrate is toxic by ingestion or inhalation. Symptoms of poisoning include tightness of muscles (especially in the face and neck), vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscular tremors, anxiety, weakness, labored breathing, cardiac irregularity, and convulsions.Sulphur: It irritates the nose, throat, and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or a tight feeling around the chest. The effects of sulfur dioxide are felt very quickly and most people would feel the worst symptoms in 10 or 15 minutes after breathing it in.Potassium nitrate: Any contact with it can cause eye and skin irritation. Inhalation of its fumes can irritate the nose and throat, causing sneezing and coughing.Aluminium powder: It can cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract.The smaller the particles, the deeper they can penetrate into the respiratory system and the more hazardous they are to breathe. Particulate matter was declared as Class 1 cancer-causing agent (carcinogen) in 2013 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). PM2.5 particles cause lung irritation, aggravate chronic lung diseases, and cause changes in blood chemistry resulting in clots and cardiovascular diseases.What doctors sayThe annual light and sound festival can have quite an adverse impact on your health. Whether it manifests in the form of respiratory diseases, eye infections, or burns, doctors across hospitals in the tricity witness a sudden surge in the number of patients flocking to them.Dr A K Janmeja, head of pulmonary medicine, GMCH, Sector 32, told HT, The rise in air pollution during this period leads to a stark increase in respiratory problems among people, especially those suffering from asthma, bronchitis or other allergies.Check out your enemies Air pollution: The crackers, the heavy traffic and the burning of rice stubble by farmers take a heavy toll on the air. Air pollution goes up by at least 50% during Diwali.Smog: The bursting of crackers also leads to smog (smoke + fog), which is not only injurious to health but also obstructs the vision and causes accidents.Global warming: The oxides and dioxides of sulphur and nitrogen released while burning crackers are not only harmful to human health, but also harm the environment by depleting the Ozone layer, the earths protective shield.Noise pollution: One of the most adverse effects of this festive season, it not only impacts human beings but also animals, including our pets, whose ears are more sensitive than humans.Injuries and wounds: In many cases, people lose their eyesight and even lives by bursting crackers recklessly.Garbage disposal: The garbage lying on roads after Diwali is laced with chemicals and very difficult to dispose of. This could impact the health of those living in the proximity as any contact with these chemicals can increase the level of toxins in the body.Additional health hazards: Pregnant women are advised not to leave their homes during the bursting of crackers.He added that the inflammation caused due to poor air quality makes it doubly difficult for people battling respiratory disorders.The hospitals also see an increase in the number of accidents caused due to unruly traffic and choked roads, which prompt commuters to throw rules to the winds.Every year, we see a surge in the number of accident cases around Diwali, said Dr Janmeja, adding that doctors work round the clock on the D-day to treat patients suffering from the side-effects of this festival.Older people are more susceptible to flu or pneumonia during this period. Eye-related injuries and burns are commonplace among patients across all government and private hospitals during Diwali.But while the Diwali air may not be healthy, the festive cheer does wonders for patients. Dr B S Chavan, head of psychiatry department, GMCH 32, said he had noticed a decline in mental health ailments and stress-related issues during this period.People are usually happy during such festivals as they get to spend time with their loved ones. Even if there are minor concerns, they overlook them to join in the festivities"

Many were injured, with the elderly on makeshift stretchers, and women balanced family belongings - pots, rice sacks, clothing - on their heads.We couldnt step out of the house for the last month because the military were looting people. They started firing on the village. So we escaped into another village, said Mohammad Shoaib, 29.He wore a yellow vest and was balancing his jute bags, carrying some food and aluminium pots, on a bamboo pole.Day by day things kept getting worse, so we started moving towards Bangladesh. Before we left, I went back near my village to see my house, and the entire village was burnt down, Shoaib said.They walked to join some 536,000 Rohingya Muslims who have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape.Myanmar rejects accusations of ethnic cleansing and has labelled the militants from the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army who launched the initial attacks as terrorists who have killed civilians and burnt villages.FOOD, AID RESTRICTEDThe refugees who arrived in Bangladesh on Monday said they were driven out by hunger because food markets in Myanmars western Rakhine state have been shut down and aid deliveries restricted. They also reported attacks by the military and Rakhine Buddhist mobs.Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya had already been in Bangladesh after fleeing previous spasms of violence in Myanmar, where they have long been denied citizenship and faced restrictions on their movements and access to basic services.Myanmars de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has pledged accountability for human rights abuses and says the country will accept back refugees who can prove they were residents of Myanmar.The United States and the European Union have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmars military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, although they are wary of action that could destabilize the countrys transition to democracy.EU foreign ministers will discuss Myanmar on Monday, and their draft joint statement said the bloc will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers.The powerful army chief, Min Aung Hlaing, told the United States ambassador in Myanmar last week that the exodus of Rohingya, who he said were non-native Bengalis, was exaggerated."

It will be completed by March next year, said,water resources minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh.For several decades, the Durgawati project has been lying dormant owing to factors like funds crunch, land acquisition technicalities and absence of works machinery. Its reservoir was completed a few years back following which former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi inaugurated the project in 2014.But, officials said, water from the reservoir could not be channelized due to the canal system, called the command system, was not fully functional in last couple of years. Only two or three canals were built when the project was inaugurated in 2014.Now, the work on the canals is in full swing. The target month set for completing the works on canals is March next year, said principal secretary, water resources, Arun Kumar Singh.The canal system is expected to irrigate 33,000 hectares of land in Kaimur and Rohtas districts, known for producing high quality rice and wheat due to the fertile soil. Lack of irrigation facilities has been a major grouse for farmers in this belt and affected their production, adversely.Officials also said work on the proposed Indrapuri reservoir on Sone river at Nauhata block in Rohtas district was being pursued on a priority and the reservoir, having a water level up to height of 70 metres, is expected to be completed by 2019.The reservoir would provide water for irrigation in the entire Rohtas belt. The potential of irrigation from this reservoir is 8.74 lakh hectares. A 395 MW hydro-electric power plant would be also set up at the reservoir.In March this year, chief minister Nitish Kumar had visited the site of the upcoming reservoir and dam to inspect the progress of the work. The survey work of the dam has been going on and earth work has started, officials said."

I will help more to master scientific farming skills for better-off lives in the countryside, said Wang.Wang will be among 2,287 delegates selected to attend this 19th National Congress of the CPC to be held in Beijing from October 18.Attendees will include high-ranking government officials, Party leaders, and military officers as well as grassroots Party members from frontline production and manufacturing such as workers, farmers, technicians, nurses and teachers, an official statement announced.The CPC national congress, held every five years, unveils new leadership and sets a roadmap for national development for the next five years."

It was taken up on directions of the Yogi Adityanath-led state government which took charge in March this year.During the drive, the district authorities in Ghaziabad scrapped nearly 95,000 ration cards which were issued to ineligible residents by the former state government. The ineligible ration card holders were identified and their cards scrapped after physical verification.There were nearly 3.99 lakh ration card holders in the district before we started the physical survey for scrapping the ineligible card holders. After we scrapped 95,359 ration cards following a physical survey from May to July, we have a total of 3,67,792 valid ration cards at present, district supplies officer Sunil Kumar Singh said, adding that many eligible families who were not being able to reap the benefits of public distribution system (PDS) were also added.Effectively, nearly 30,000 card holders were scrapped as we added more eligible families after physical inspection, he said.Based on the number of ineligible ration cards scrapped, the department computed the monthly savings estimate for an assumed family of four members.As per the norms, the annual family income of ration card holders should be below Rs 3 lakh; the house should be built on plot size smaller than 100 square metres, commercial space should be less than 80 square metres and the card holder should not be an income tax payee.The family members of a ration card holder receive 3kg of wheat and 2kg of rice per month per member from the PDS. Further, 2 litres of kerosene is also issued on a single ration card for a family in a month.The district supplies department has also issued new ration cards to beneficiaries, whose cards bore the picture of former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. The department has replaced such cards across the state.The ration card cover with an image of former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav came under severe criticism as it was provided to beneficiaries just before the announcement of state assembly elections in 2016.In yet another initiative to save stock and make ration dealers accountable, we have provided biometric devices to nearly 516 out of 723 dealers in the district. The devices have their locations mapped and are also linked to the Aadhaar card of family members. The devices check stock pilferage and the entries of disbursal and receipt of stocks are automatically updated on government sites, Singh said.Sources said that due to the introduction of the biometric devices in the PDS, nearly 67 dealers surrendered their dealership to other eligible persons.The biometric devices are linked to the government control room. The opening and closing time of stock distribution, daily processing and issue of stocks on rations cards, etc. automatically get updated in government system.Nearly 10 lakh Aadhaar cards are still to be linked to biometric devices provided to PDS distributors.Officials expect that the provision of the rest of biometric devices and linking of Aadhaar with devices will be fully complete by the end of December."

The family had not received any ration since February after their ration card was allegedly cancelled due to a failure in Aadhaar seeding, but subsisted on doles and the midday meal Santoshi would get at her school.The allegations surfaced this week and sparked outrage, forcing the government to order a probe. The local administration has denied that starvation killed Santoshi and claimed that she was suffering from malaria. State food minister Saryu Roy has also said that Aadhaar cards werent necessary to get rations.Simdega deputy commissioner Manjunath Bhajantri confirmed that he had received complaints that Koili Devi was attacked and asked the police to provide security to her family.Although villagers have said that no such incident occurred in the village, we are providing necessary security to the family, Bhajantri told Hindustan Times. Koili Devi returned to the village after police protection was provided. She alleged the local ration dealer, whose licence was cancelled after the controversy surfaced, orchestrated the attack along with some other villagers, said activists.Read more: Central team to probe death of Simdega girl: Union minister PaswanKoili Devi also disputed the district administrations report that fixed malaria as the cause of Santoshis death, saying she never gave her thumb impression on the document, as claimed by the three-member probe team.My daughter did not die of malaria, she was crying for rice while breathing her last. I have not given my thumb impression on any such report saying that she died of malaria, she was quoted as saying by activists. Bhajantri said that he would have to verify the allegations as he wasnt a part of the three-member team.A local government health worker was also suspended, triggering allegations that the action was motivated by a video that showed the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) Mala Devi as saying that she didnt know that Santoshi was suffering from any disease. Bhajantri said Mala Devi was suspended after the administration found she did not perform her duties properly.The state government has pushed for Aadhaar seeding for all welfare schemes in line with the Centres plan of using the controversial 12-digit biometric identity number to weed out fakes and duplicates from welfare rolls. Last month, the administration declared that 1.1 million people had been struck off the rolls as fakes or duplicates.But activists have flagged a number of implementation snags with the seeding process, especially in far-flung areas with feeble internet penetration, and say genuinely poor people might be denied their entitlements because of the rush in seeding. The Supreme Court has repeatedly said the Aadhaar number could not be made mandatory to access benefits."

I started screaming, but a second soldier hit me in the face with his hand and undressed me fully. I was silent when they raped me, there was nothing I could do, Nurshida said.Her two friends were thrown to the floor next. As they were raped, smoke was rising in the distance  her native Naisapru village was on fire, one of many set alight in the exodus.All of the schoolgirls were raped and there were loud screams everywhere, said Nurshida, sitting in a mud hut in Bangladeshs Kutupalong camp where she is waiting to register as a refugee.Authorities say her story fits a horribly familiar pattern.The stories we hear point to rape being used strategically as a weapon of war, aid Rashed Hasan, a lieutenant colonel in the Bangladesh army.Women of all ages and backgrounds have reported similarly brutal sexual assaults  as well as witnessing family killings, losing children and being forced from their homes.Rape is an act of power. It knows no discrimination in terms of age, sex or ethnicity, Saba Zariv of the United Nations Population Fund told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Pregnant, raped, abandonedAt nine months pregnant, Jannet says she was brutally tortured and raped at her home in Myanmar.My husband was killed five days before soldiers attacked our village. Our three children have never been seen again since, she said, cradling five-day-old Fatima in the flimsy makeshift tent she now calls home.Fatima, who was delivered in a rice field, is her only remaining family member.Late into her pregnancy, Jannet said she was alone when the army marched into Fakira Bazaar village. While everyone scattered into the jungle, the 22-year-old chose to hide.Several soldiers broke the door. They saw that I was pregnant, but they all raped me. At the end of the day she was left naked, beaten, her children gone.I cried and screamed for them, but I still dont know where they are, she said. I never want to go back to Myanmar ... I have lost everything.Yet safety is not guaranteed in the chaotic Rohingya refugee camps that are quickly becoming the worlds largest.Parvin, 20, said she has been rejected by her in-laws after soldiers beheaded her husband and raped her while she was five months pregnant.They beat me unconscious, she said. I woke up to an empty village and my in-laws searching for me. I was lying naked on the floor of their house.The last thing Parvins mother-in-law did for her was help her wash after the rape. They told me they didnt want to take responsibility for me and rejected me.Now she lives alone in a bamboo house, terrified of men.I can never get married again now that I was raped. I have no choice but to raise my baby alone, she said. Thats all that drives me now. I have lost all else."

Returning Rohingya may lose land, crops under Myanmar plans",http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-awaits-them-returning-rohingya-may-lose-land-crops-under-myanmar-plans/story-fXaHgcbAcgU79io4EDqmPJ.html,2017-10-22,"Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters.Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since August 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army.The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return.Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the governments thinking on how Suu Kyis repatriation pledge will be implemented.Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back.Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers - land contracts and receipts - that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind.I didnt carry any ornaments or jewels, said the 35-year-old. Ive only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.Rohingya Muslim refugees wait to receive food distributed by a Turkish aid agency at Thaingkhali refugee camp in Ukhia on October 21, 2017. (AFP)The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice.It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who dont have citizenship, said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops.Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognise Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations.Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters.Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new model villages, rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticised in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps.The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees place of origin.OWNERLESS CROPSThe exodus of 589,000 Rohingya - and about 30,000 non-Muslims - from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials.Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by national races - meaning Myanmar citizens - or Bengalis, a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.Rohingya refugees line up to get food from Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) near Balukhali refugees camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. (REUTERS)Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of ownerless Bengali land.Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control.The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labour to harvest manually if necessary.An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice.The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it, he said.Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.You cant call a rice crop ownerless just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country, he said.A Rohingya Muslim boy, who crossed over from Myanmar into Bangladesh, carries drinking water and crosses a flooded field on a footbridge at Thaingkhali refugee camp, Bangladesh. (AP)MODEL VILLAGESMany refugees are fearful to return and are sceptical of Myanmars guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centres, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages.International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya internally displaced persons (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time, said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response.Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW.Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda.The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were not systematic, and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement.In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, theres no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages, Soe Aung said.Rohingya refugees who crossed the border from Myanmar this week take shelter at a school in Kotupalang refugee camp near Cox's Bazar. (REUTERS)IDENTITY CHECKSThose who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centres, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters.At the centres, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members.For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population.Officials will accept as evidence national verification cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.We are not going to go back like this, said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this."

What is adding to their woes is the state governments failure to ensure that their paddy produce is procured from their villages. The poor farmer is harassed all across the district as the designated authorities or officials that are to purchase their crop remains absent from duty.With no government official from any of the five procurement agencies there to supervise the process, private rice millers have a field day.This HT reporter travelled to two villages, Makha Chehlan and Anoopgarh, to find 500 farmers here, complaining bitterly about the state government.The designated purchase inspector for the two villages and the Bhikhi town, a person named Ravi, from the Punjab Agro Industries Corporation Limited (PAICL), has been irregular, farmers claimed.To escape fleecing, farmers travelling to urban marketThe rice miller harasses us and demands extra bags of rice from us to purchase our crop. The purchase inspector remains away from the grain markets and in his absence we are tortured in the name of measuring moisture content in our produce, said Jiwan Singh from Anoopgarh village.Many other farmers second him. Other farmers alleged that to escape the money lenders and sell their produce, they travel to grain markets in the urban areas of the district, where they get better price.This, however, entails extra expense as from these villages, the urban markets entail a to-and-fro travel of at least 50-km.For a farmer, this is like choosing between a rock and a hard place.From our field, we have to travel to the grain markets and from there we have to hire another vehicle to reach the grain market in cities. Braving accident, security and other issues, we travel to the grain market risking everything, said another farmer while loading his grain onto the tractor.Farmers claimed that one such trip with the cost of overnight stay usually costs them Rs 5,000.High moisture content in the paddy crop has also added to the worries of farmers.The permissible moisture content is around 17 units but the rice millers return our produce raising the issue of high moisture despite this being approved by the purchasing inspector of the food procurement agencies, said Amarjeet Singh from Makha Chehlan village.District president of BKU (Ugrahan) Ram Singh met the DC and raised the issue of harassment meted out to farmers. We discussed as how the purchasing inspector and private rice millers are hand-in-glove harassing and stalling the lifting of paddy from grain markets in rural areas, said Ram.When contacted, PAICL manager Balwinder Pal Singh rubbished the claim that farmers were harassed and instead commended the lifting procedure being supervised by the agency. Our purchase inspector has been supervising all the grain markets allotted to our agency and we have not allowed private millers to harass farmers."

The little boy was crying out louder than he ever had in his life. He did not know how to swim.Papa! Papa! Help Me! Papaaaaa.Just moments before, they had huddled together in the relative safety of a small fishing boat filled with refugees from Myanmar that was bound for Bangladesh. They were part of the largest human exodus in Asia since the Vietnam War  a colossal tide of more than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims whose homes had been torched by Buddhist mobs and soldiers.What happened next, just 1,000 feet (300 meters) from shore, would take the lives of at least 50 people, most of them children, in the deadliest tragedy of its kind since the crisis exploded in late August. Through interviews with more than a dozen survivors, The Associated Press has reconstructed their ill-fated journey late last month  an odyssey that underscores the perils faced by all those who flee.For Jafar, the most haunting part was not when the wave as big as a mountain swallowed everything in the blink of an eye.It was the moment after, when he surfaced in shock vomiting saltwater, and heard the cries of the people who had been hurled into the dark mouth of the sea.His wife of eight years and their newborn twins were among them.So, too, was his beloved son.Leaving everything behindShort and stocky with a fiery temper, Jafar grew up in a small village in northwestern Myanmar called Moidaung.It was a quiet place of immense beauty: Emerald rice fields. Lush mountains. A river that snaked through the land. For the Rohingya, though, it was also a prison. They could not travel without consent from authorities, and the northern half of Rakhine state was largely off-limits to outsiders.Although the Rohingya had inhabited the region for generations, the countrys Buddhist majority saw them as foreign invaders from Bangladesh. The government denied them citizenship and basic rights; the United Nations called them the most persecuted minority in the world.Despite their plight, Jafar had managed to do well for himself. The 25-year-old farmer lived in a four-room house made of wood and bamboo surrounded by coconut and mango trees. He owned a verdant rice field, and a boat that ferried passengers up and down the river.In 2009, he married the love of his life, Tayiba Khatun, after saving enough to pay her dowry in gold: a necklace, a pair of earrings, and a small nose-ring. A year later, they had a son, Mohamed Zobair, an energetic boy who loved soccer and school.Rohingya refugees wait to receive humanitarian aid at Balu Khali refugee camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. (Reuters)Mohamed learned to read not only Burmese, but English as well, and Jafar could not resist spoiling him. He bought whatever the boy wanted every time they went to the market.In July, their family grew once more. Khatun gave birth to twins, a boy named Yasin and a girl, Noor Khaida. The twins big brown eyes melted their hearts. But the happiness was short-lived.On August 25, Rohingya insurgents armed with rifles and machetes attacked dozens of police posts and an army base. The military responded with a ruthless counter-offensive, and mobs backed by security forces began setting entire Rohingya villages ablaze.Word came to Moidaung of children shot and women raped. Too afraid even to venture into their fields, the Rohingya in Moidaung cowered in their homes.When ethnic Rakhine Buddhists began marching into the village with sharpened bamboo sticks and machetes, escorted by soldiers, Jafar and his wife watched from a window in their home.This is Buddhist land! the men shouted. It does not belong to you!Get out! Get out!Two days later, just before dawn on September 25, the mobs came back.Woken by the crackle of gunfire and screams in the distance, Jafar looked outside and saw flames and smoke rising on the far end of Moidaung. Whole families had already begun fleeing on foot, carrying everything they could in huge plastic sacks.How can we just leave everything behind? Khatun asked.Jafar tried to console her, wiping the tears from her cheeks.We have no choice, he whispered. We cant stay here. Our belongings are not going to save our lives.The road leading out of the village was overflowing with an endless stream of families  hysterical parents carrying children, exhausted children hauling babies on their backs.Jafars family joined them, and word soon passed down the line. There was a beach where refugees were boarding boats for Bangladesh. To get there, they would have to cross the forested spine of the Mayu mountains.The pathway up was slippery from the monsoon rains, and they moved slowly, grabbing onto saplings jutting out of the ground. Many of the refugees were barefoot, including Jafars eldest son, Mohamed.Wearing only a cheap pair of flip-flops, Jafar struggled to carry the twins, who were cradled in a pair of sacks that hung on opposite sides of a stick across his shoulders.His wife carried another sack filled with childrens clothes, food and a mosquito net. Inside it was all their gold, the deed to their property, and all their savings  about $225.Fifteen minutes into the forest, they began to smell something nauseating.Jafars brother, Sona Mia, saw the bodies first.The bloated corpse of a man with a wide gash in his throat lay staring up at the sky. A few meters (yards) further on, another dead man was curled on the ground, white foam bubbling from his mouth.It was unclear who they were, or who killed them. Mia counted seven in all.Nobody stopped, Mia said. Nobody said a word. We couldnt. We just kept going.Far behind them, on the edge of the forest, a volley of gunshots rang out.They hiked for two days, scooping cold water from streams and sleeping on the ground. After reaching the bottom of the mountain, the greenery gave way to roads, and they passed the remains of an empty village blackened by fire.On the morning of September 27, they finally spotted the coast  where the mouth of the Naf River, separating Myanmar from Bangladesh, opens into the Bay of Bengal.The sound of waves crashing against the boatJafar had never seen the ocean before. It seemed infinite, and to him, unreal. It also gave him hope. He thought the hardest part of their journey was over. On the beach in Alel Than Kyaw, the massive scale of the exodus became apparent.Thousands of refugees from other parts of Rakhine were already camped there, exhausted. Each family had a story to tell, of a village burned, a husband shot, a wife raped.Makeshift tents were scattered across the beach, which was littered with trash and the abandoned clothes of those who preceded them. Dozens of soldiers wandered among the crowds, interrogating the men.Rohingya refugees who crossed the border from Myanmar this week take shelter at the Seagull Primary School in Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. (Reuters)Jafar found a spot to sit, and Khatun rested her head on his shoulder while their children played in the sand.In his stomach, Jafar could feel a huge knot. Just a few days earlier, he had owned land and a house and provided for his family. Now, all that was gone.A few hours after nightfall, a dozen fishing boats suddenly appeared, their distinctive bows and sterns each curved upward like wooden bull horns. Jafar and his family jumped to their feet and rushed forward with the crowds.The boatmen, from Bangladesh, told the refugees they had been sent by your relatives  Muslim nations  to take you across the river.One of them pointed at Jafar.How many?Five.The boatman counted off about 75 more people, including as many as 50 children, and told the adults they had to leave their luggage behind. Jafar tucked the gold he had given his wife as a dowry into a small plastic bottle cap, then wrapped her pink veil around it in a knot. He stuffed their cash and land deed into the other end.They waded into the warm water and climbed inside a 20-foot-long boat with outer planks painted light blue with white trim.They found a spot in the rear, and scrunched down together, the twins in their arms and Mohamed huddled between. They were pressed together body to body, knee to chest. The boat was packed.Several refugees not among those chosen grabbed onto the bow, begging to be let aboard. A boatman shoved them away.When the engine started and they pulled away, the sea was calm. A crescent moon hung in a clear sky.Khatun squeezed Jafars hand. It seemed as good a time as any to make the crossing.The southern tip of Bangladesh was only about 10 kilometers (6 miles) away.At first no one spoke. The only sound was that of waves crashing against the boats wooden hull, and wind whipping across its bow.Jafar kept checking his watch. One hour passed. Then two.By then, he knew they should have arrived. But when he raised his head to peek over the edge, there was nothing to see but darkness.Mazi, what are you doing? a passenger called out, using the local word for boatman. Why arent we there?Shut up, you illiterate, one of the boatmen shot back. Do you know how to steer this thing better than me?Jafar was not worried. He thought they might have taken a longer route to avoid Bangladeshi naval patrols or border guards ashore.Over the next few hours, though, the weather grew steadily worse. Clouds began to obscure the stars. The wind began to pick up. And the air, once hot and sticky, grew chilly.One by one, the refugees began to notice that the water, which had no perceptible scent at the mouth of the river, now smelled bitter. It was saltwater. Something had gone terribly wrong. They were at sea.Lost at seaAs the waves grew, small children began throwing up. Then the adults, vomiting into their clothes and cupped hands. Jafar felt ill.When someone asked the mazi how much further they had to go, the response was blunt, emotionless.I dont know, the boatman replied, staring ahead into the night. We are lost.The comment set off a panic among the refugees, who began praying to God, to Allah. They had strayed far off course, deep into the ocean. The boatmen never explained how.Steeper waves began battering the boat, splashing cold water inside. Children screamed.Oh my brother, one of the refugees, Rasheda Begum, begged a boatman. Please take us to any village. Be it a Muslim or a Buddhist village. Just take us to land.In the darkness, while Mohamed slept, Jafar could hear his wife weeping. He wrapped his arm around her. Please dont worry, he told her. Please dont.As the night wore on, it took on a terrifying presence all around them. They could see nothing else.After a few hours, someone spotted the twinkling lights of a large ship cruising slowly in the distance. They waved scarves above their heads and shouted across the waves.Thirty minutes later, the lights had faded away.At dawn, a new feeling of dread set in. All they could see, said another refugee called Malika, was water, water, water.There was no land in sight.Rohingya refugees who arrived from Myanmar by boat, get into another boat to go to the main land, in Teknaf, Bangladesh, on October 7. (REUTERS)We thought at that moment we were going to die, said Malika, who only uses one name. Children were crying, hugging their fathers and their mothers. Everyone prayed.Jafars wife turned angrily to her husband, fighting back tears again. How could you do this to us? Why? she said.Jafar said nothing, and Khatun went on: They are burning our villages. Theyre torturing our people. But this  this is even worse. The ocean is going to kill us all.This wasnt a mistake, Jafar said. Maybe we will die here, but right now we are alive.Sunrise brought one small ray of hope. It pointed the way east, which meant the coast of Bangladesh  had to be in the same direction.By then, though, two of the boats four plastic fuel drums were almost empty. And the crew had begun scooping water off the floorboards.Soon, the mazis made a grim announcement: the boat was dangerously overloaded.When they began grabbing small bags and bottles the refugees held in their laps and hurled them overboard, fights broke out.We begged them not to do it. We told them we need food and water for our kids, that these things arent heavy, said Lalu Mia, who was travelling with his wife and five children.Some thought the boatmen were trying to seize valuables and jewellery. When one man, Mohamed Kasim, resisted, a mazi queried him angrily.Is this more important than your life? You have to decide. Do you want to keep this, or do you want to survive?Jafar didnt struggle when the water bottle and biscuits he was holding were ejected into the sea.His familys valuables, he knew, were tucked safely inside Khatuns scarf.For what felt like an eternity, the boat sailed on. The stench of puke mixed with the smell of sweat and urine. There was so little room to move, some children relieved themselves under their clothes.The lack of water made Jafars throat yearn for it. His stomach grumbled.When his son asked for a drink, he told Mohamed to wait  it would not be much longer. In whispers, though, he and his wife began to discuss the unthinkable.Please forgive me, Khatun said, if I ever did anything wrong to you.As the boat rocked endlessly back and forth, they drifted in and out of sleep. And then they were startled to hear one of the mazis, wide-eyed, yelling. Its there! Its there!Jafar thought he was dreaming. But when he lifted his cramped body up he saw it, too: the top of a green hill peeking out of white clouds on a coast.No one knew what country it was. No one cared.For the first time since they fled their village, Jafar saw people smile. Their two-hour trip turned into 18 might finally be about to end.His wife squeezed their children.Oh, blessed Allah, he knows where we are, Khatun said. Maybe we will be OK. Maybe we will get there.As the boat motored toward the shore, though, the wind began to pick up again. The sky darkened. Torrential sheets of rain began to fall.And then, somewhere around 3:30 pm, the engine died.Final prayersStanding in front of his store on Inani Beach, shopkeeper Ahmed Hossain saw what he thought was a fishing boat emerge from the storm.He knew it shouldnt have been there. The monsoon battering the coast was so large and powerful, it had already shut down the airport at Coxs Bazar, 30 kilometers (20 miles) to the north.Out on the boat, the refugees didnt know if they had run out of fuel, or if the engine had broken down.As one of the mazis yanked the engine cord repeatedly, people began reciting final prayers and crying out.Please Allah! Please save us!The desperation angered the crew, and they shouted at the refugees.Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!Without power, the boat was at the mercy of the waves, which tossed it around like a toy. Although the shoreline was just a few hundred yards (meters) away, most of the children aboard did not know how to swim.The boat drifted into a precarious position: perpendicular to the waves, which were now tipping it perilously back and forth.When the giant wave hit, it thrust the boat upside down. It threw Jafar into the surging ocean with the twins, who were wrapped around his chest in a longyi.Arms thrashing, he surfaced, trying to keep their heads above water. He could barely see, but he spotted his wife, and his son. He heard Mohamed crying out.Papa! Papa! Help Me!Papaaaaa.They were not far away, maybe 10 feet, when the second wave crashed down. He lost sight of them as the swirling ocean carried him away.People gather around bodies of Rohingya Muslim refugees, on the shore of Inani beach, near Cox's Bazar on September 28. (AFP)For half an hour, Jafar struggled to swim on his back in the current. But the waves and the weight of the twins kept pushing him down. He didnt know if they were dead.He was exhausted. When he realised he would drown if he held on to them any longer, he untied the longyi, and let go of his babies.By the time he crawled onto the beach and collapsed, it was twilight. A stranger rushed forward and knelt beside him, asking if he was OK.Where am I? Jafar asked weakly.Brother, the man said. You are in Bangladesh.Sleep brings nightmaresThat night, Jafar searched desperately for Khatun and Mohamed and the twins.When he found their bodies, laid out on the sand by rescuers, he broke down and wept.He says he can barely remember any more about that moment. He can hardly even speak of it.Of the 80 refugees believed to have been on the boat when it capsized on September 28, only 24 are known to have survived.Police collected 23 corpses from the shore. The rest  mostly children  are missing and presumed to have drowned. It is not known what happened to the crew.Khatuns scarf, with the gold, money and land deed, was never found.It is two weeks after the disaster, and Jafar is slicing bamboo poles to build a shelter on the edge of a new refugee camp.His older brother, who was also on the boat, is beside him. But he cannot bear to be here without his own family.Sleep brings nightmares. Daylight brings ghosts. Wherever I look, I see my kids, he says. I see my eldest child every day. He comes and sits in front of me, even now.Bangladeshi volunteers bury Rohingya refugees children, who died when their boat capsized when crossing from Myanmar into Bangladesh, at a graveyard in Sha Porir Dwip in Teknaf on October 9. (AFP)Jafar cant stop thinking about what happened. He feels helpless, overcome with guilt.Why did I bring my children here and let them die in the water? he asks. Wouldnt it have been nice if I, too, had died? Wouldnt it?The mass grave where his wife and children are buried is not far away.It lies in a clearing in a small coastal village lined with coconut trees and rice paddies.There are no names. Just a trio of palm fronds stuck in the dirt like tombstones.From there, its a short walk to the place where the doomed boat washed ashore the night it capsized. It was ripped in half.Two weeks later, nothing is left. Even the smallest wooden planks have been dragged away by the tides.Bangladesh says 28 boats carrying Rohingya refugees have capsized in its waters since August, killing at least 184 people. Despite calls to end the violence in Myanmar, the exodus continues."

The government rushed supplies and tried to improve the villagers lives. When Mamata Banerjee came to power in 2011, she made the village her showcase project -- constructing roads, providing water supply and electricity, and subsidised ration.But despite the spotlight, Hindustan Times has found that the tribal-dominated village has been living in darkness with no electricity for more than two months, because the sole transformer was struck by lightning and has not been repaired, or replaced, since.The reason: Most of the consumers live in abject poverty and cant afford to pay pending electricity bills. Amlashole lies near the Bengal-Jharkhand border at the heart of Jangalmahal that was once dominated by Maoists.Power to Amlashole is supplied through a transformer located at Kendgara Para.Incidentally, the village is inhabited by tribals such as the Mundas and Sabars, who are not only poor but also socially marginalised . During British rule, the Sabars were even categorised as a criminal tribe under the Criminal Tribes Act 1871.We are poor people who earn our daily bread with meagre wages doing odd jobs. How will we pay electricity bills? The chief minister is giving a lot of things to Jangalmahal including rice at Rs 2 a kg, she also can give free electricity to us, said Madan Sabar, a villager.The villagers pointed out that during her visit to Amlashole in January 2014, Banerjee assured supply of all basic necessities to the impoverished area.During her three-day visit to the district on October 9-11, the chief minister instructed the officials that they should not ignore the complaints and problems of the tribals.The people of Amlashole submitted a complaint. We are taking steps to repair the transformer, Ujjwal Roy, the divisional manager of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company told HT.I shall try to solve it within 24 hours, power minister Sovandeb Chatterjee told HT on Saturday after learning about the problem.According to officials in West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company, there are about 2 lakh consumers in Jhargram area, out of whom more than 1.5 lakh have not paid their bills for several years. The dues have run up to almost Rs 100 crore, the board said.Officers of the power utility said residents of Amlashole have not paid up even after they were told to pay the due in 24 instalments.Their bills from November 2008 till July 2014 were waived after intervention by Banerjee."

HT could not independently verify the claims made in the video.GC Kandwal, designated officer of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) for Dehradun district, said samples have been collected from the restaurant and that the same will be sent for analysis at the state-run food testing laboratory at Rudrapur in Udham Singh Nagar district.However, well be able to comment on whether its plastic rice or not only once the (lab) report comes out. Till then, were also planning to inspect other places (like eateries, markets) as a precautionary measure, Kandwal told HT.He, however, asserted that no such thing as plastic rice had ever been confirmed in the state so far and that it was a natural tendency of rice to become hard like a ball due to presence of starch in it, but that doesnt confirm that the rice is made of plastic.Food adulteration is a serious issue and the department will certainly take action if any irregularity is found anywhere. But such unconfirmed claims (of plastic rice) only lead to confusion and panic among the public, Kandwal said.In June, a similar scare of plastic rice being allegedly sold in the markets of Haldwani in Kumaon region had surfaced, following which the Nainital district administration raided several shops. Lab reports of collected samples, however, later dismissed the claims of plastic rice.Notably, many experts including senior agriculture scientists have called out the plastic rice scare as myth citing how no conclusive proof for the same has been discovered so far. According to snopes, a fact verification site, the claims of plastic rice have yet to be proven.Meanwhile, Kandwal said an improvement notice had been slapped on the said restaurant under Section 32 of the Food Safety and Standards Act for preparing food under unhygienic conditions."

Again, if you think only Hindus celebrate the festival, dedicated to the Sun God, think again.Elaborate preparations have been made even inside Bihar prisons, where hundreds of under trial and convicted prisoners, including Muslims, are performing Chhath Puja across the state. As the festival, ending Friday, demands, many are observing fast and following all the rituals that go with it.In the 58 jails, including eight central jails spread across the state, prisoners, cutting across religious beliefs have geared up for the strict Chhath rituals. On their part, prison authorities are extending all help to them.The devotees prepared kheer, made of milk and rice, on Wednesday, to offer it to other prisoners, as well as officials.In view of the strict norms associated with Chhath, the jail administration has banned non-vegetarian food until the completion of the festival. The inmates have been singing devotional songs over the public address system as part of the rituals.Over a dozen Muslim convicts, serving life term in Beur model jail in the outskirts of Patna, besides several in Muzaffarpur and Bhagalpur central jails, are also observing fast and performing other rituals of Chhath, the most popular Hindu festival of Bihar, prison authorities said on Wednesday.This has strengthened the bonding. Prisoners of all communities are helping each other on the occasion. Chhath demands a very high level of purity and hygiene. All jail inmates - whether Hindus, Muslims or Sikhs - have been actively engaged in cleaning and decorating the premises. There is a complete change in the environment. It doesnt look like a jail at all, said Beur Jail superintendent Rupak Kumar.Manoj Kumar, superintendent of Motihari central jail, said why Chhath was such an important religious festival was evident in more ways than one. It has a huge spiritual impact. Those facing serious charges also seem completely taken over by the Chhath spirit, which calls for utmost devotion. As it is a matter of faith and piety, jail authorities provide all help to the devotees, he added.The Muzaffarpur jail superintendent said that a pond had been dug up inside the jail premises and filled with fresh water mixed with Ganga Jal. All devotees have been provided new clothes and puja material, including fruits, milk, sugar, rice and flour, he added.A senior official of home department told HT that though no centralised data regarding the number of Chhath devotees in the prisons is maintained, it was a fact that several of the inmates in various jails undertook fast and performed rituals on the occasion.Many prisoners volunteered and cleaned the campus as well as decorated the premises. May be it is also a way of performing penance and reforming. The entire environment here has turned spiritual, he added."

While the acceptable levels of lead in blood are pegged at less than 0.05 mg/litre for children and less than 0.25 mg/litre for adults, the presence of the element varied from a minimum of 5 times (in fish) to 2,911 times (in vegetable) of that limit.File picture. The presence of lead in samples of fish was found to vary approximately between 5 to 71 times higher than the permissible limits in adults and 26 to 356 times the limit suitable for children. (HT Photo)The GSI team identified diesel exhausts of the city traffic and soil in the nearby areas where vegetable is grown as the major sources of excessive lead. The lead has come from diesel exhausts. This type of study is rare in the world. A few have been conducted in the US and France. A new machine has helped us to pinpoint diesel as the chief source of lead and there is no ambiguity in the findings, Dipayan Guha, director of geochronology and isotope geology division of GSI told HT.The outcome of the study, conducted by project director Dipayan Guha and a team of six scientists, was published in Environmental Science and Technology and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. The studies began in 2014 and continued till March 2016.Read: How indoor air pollution is leading to stunted growth in Indias childrenIn rice the presence of lead was a minimum of seven times (of the limits for adults) to a maximum of 30 times. It implied a level that is 36 times to 149 times of the safe limits for children. The presence of the element in chicken is as high as 38 times the permissible limit for adults and 191 times of that for kids.Samples of rice were found to contain lead that was 58 times more than the permissible limit for adults and 287 times of the ceiling for children. (HT Photo)The maximum Pb concentration in rice was 14.39 mg/kg in the Khidirpur sample from west Kolkata. Vegetables sold in the sampled markets had a Pb concentration ranged from a low of 3.28 mg/kg to a very high value of 145.47 mg/kg, read a GSI statement.The GSI team collected samples of polished rice, red lentil (masoor dal), chicken, fish (without scales), spinach, biscuits, spices (cumin seeds) and tulsi from 12 roadside markets from north, south, east and west of Kolkata.Even if one washes the items in water, one can get rid of 50% of the lead, said Guha.Read: Killer in the air: WHO says polluted environments kill 1.7 mn children a yearThe maximum concentration of lead was found in the soil at and near Dhapa, the citys principal dumping ground.The GSI team also found the lead content in the street dust alarming. The mean concentration of Pb found in the 29 sites was 383.2 mg/kg with a range from 23.82 mg/kg to a very high value of 2,697.24 mg/kg at Amherst Street in north Kolkata, a GSI release said.The GSI spokesperson told HT that they chose samples from the roadside markets since common people buy from these.Since much of the contamination is caused by exposure to air, one can expect that packaged items sold in closed conditions will have less lead, said the spokesperson.Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the state Pollution Control Board, told HT there was no immediate relief in sight. CNG is not available in Kolkata and is only expected to reach here in 2020. Even after it reached the city, it will take a lot of time for the commercial vehicles to switch from diesel to CNG. The autorickshaws, however, have already to LPG, said Rudra."

Kennedy, bending to CIA and FBI appeals, while the National Archives came out Thursday night with a hefty cache of others.I have no choice, Trump said in a memo, citing potentially irreversible harm to national security if he were to allow all records to come out now. He placed those files under a six-month review while letting 2,800 others come out, racing a deadline to honor a law mandating their release.The documents approved for release show federal agents madly chasing after tips, however thin, in the days after the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination and juggling rumors and leads worldwide. The materials also cast a wide net over varied activities of the Kennedy administration, such as its covert efforts to upend Fidel Castros government in Cuba.In a Sept. 14, 1962, meeting disclosed in the files, for example, a group of Kennedys senior aides, including brother Robert, the attorney general, discussed a range of options against Castros communist government.The meeting was told the CIA would look into the possibility of sabotaging airplane parts that were to be shipped to Cuba from Canada. McGeorge Bundy, JFKs national security adviser, cautioned that sensitive ideas like sabotage would have to be considered in more detail on a case-by-case basis.As for the unreleased documents, officials say Trump will impress upon federal agencies that only in the rarest cases should JFK files stay secret after the six-month review.Despite having months to prepare for disclosures that have been set on the calendar for 25 years, Trumps decision came down to a last-minute debate with intelligence agencies  a tussle the president then prolonged by calling for still more review.Part of a web page showing the page from the National Archives showing a listing of records released on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, in Washington, relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. (AP)In the meantime, experts will be poring through a mountain of minutiae in search of significant revelations.Much of Thursday passed with nothing from the White House or National Archives except silence, leaving unclear how the government would comply with a law requiring the records to come out by the end of the day  unless Trump was persuaded by intelligence agencies to hold some back.White House officials said the FBI and CIA made the most requests within the government to withhold some information.No blockbusters had been expected in the last trove of secret files regarding Kennedys assassination, given a statement months ago by the Archives that it assumed the records, then under preparation, would be tangential to whats known about the shooting.But for historians, its a chance to answer lingering questions, put some unfounded conspiracy theories to rest, perhaps give life to other theories  or none of that, if the material should add little to the record.Researchers were frustrated by the uncertainty that surrounded the release for much of the day.The government has had 25 years_with a known end-date_to prepare #JFKfiles for release, University of Virginia historian Larry Sabato tweeted in the afternoon. Deadline is here. Chaos.Trump ordered agencies that have proposed withholding material related to the assassination to report to the archivist by next March 12 on which specific information meets the standard for continued secrecy.That standard includes details that could cause harm to the military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement or conduct of foreign relations, Trump wrote in his order. The archivist will have two weeks to tell Trump whether those recommendations validate keeping the withheld information a secret after April 26.Part of a file, dated April 5, 1964, details efforts to trace Lee Harvey Oswald's travel from Mexico City back to the United States, released for the first time on Thursday, Oct. 26, 2017, is photographed in Washington. (AP)Publication of this latest trove of evidence could help allay some suspicions of conspiracy  but not for all.As long as the government is withholding documents like these, its going to fuel suspicion that there is a smoking gun out there about the Kennedy assassination, said Patrick Maney, a presidential historian at Boston College.The full record will still be kept from the public for at least six months  and longer if agencies make a persuasive enough case for continued secrecy.The collection includes more than 3,100 records  comprising hundreds of thousands of pages  that have never been seen by the public. About 30,000 documents were released previously  with redactions.Whatever details are released, theyre not expected to give a definitive answer to a question that still lingers for some: Whether anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the assassination.The Warren Commission in 1964 concluded that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted.The 1992 law mandating release of the JFK documents states that all the files shall be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years  that meant by Thursday  unless the president certified that continued postponement is made necessary by an identifiable harm to the military defense; intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations.That doesnt allow the president, for example, to hold some records back because they might be embarrassing to agencies or people.In any release of this size, there always are embarrassing details, said Douglas Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.The law does not specify penalties for noncompliance, saying only that House and Senate committees are responsible for oversight of the collection."
5a149e2c9855b76bf13e62a3,Surface ozone is damaging wheat and rice crops across the country: Study,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/surface-ozone-is-damaging-wheat-and-rice-crops-across-the-country-study/story-ATrw25PIoFHlYeQsqG7YDJ.html,2017-10-31,"Surface ozone, a plant-damaging pollutant could be destroying up to 15% wheat crop and up to 6% rice yield every year across India, a first-of-its kind study based on ground observations of ozone, has revealed.A multi-institute study comprising 14 scientists and led by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL), Ahmedabad, under the Department of Space, has estimated that every year, surface ozone is likely to wipe out 4.014.2 million tonnes (MT) of the total 95 MT of wheat produced in India, and 0.36.7 MT of the total 105 MT rice grown.Surface ozone  also called a secondary pollutant  is generated through chemical reactions between primary pollutants such as oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds, in the presence of sunlight. The sources of these primary pollutants are power plants, vehicles, industries, and bio-mass burning.With a projected rise in man-made pollution including surface ozone, researchers said the findings are important since a decrease in crop yield in India, which is the second populous country, will have a serious impact on its food security and economic growth.Wheat and rice are important crops for India since they form a staple diet, said professor Shyam Lal, principal investigator, PRL. Photosynthesis takes place during the day. When ozone molecules, which are generated in the presence of sunlight, get into the plant cells, the plant gets affected and can get damaged.Previous studies have calculated the annual loss of wheat crop in the range of 5% to 30%, and between 2.1% and 16 % for rice yields. However, these high estimates were based on either limited observations  restricted to some states only  or regional and global chemistry transport models.Ozone is a very new phenomenon in India now, and ozone levels are rising. The findings are important, as we now know from different sources of the impact of surface ozone on vegetation and crops, in addition to health. This means that pollution is ultimately reaching food security, said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy and head of the air pollution and clean transportation programme, Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi, who was not involved in the study. Ozone reduction strategies have to become an important policy focus now.The present study, drawn from data on surface ozone recorded at 17 locations across India, has found that general pattern of ozone variability shows higher ozone in AprilMay, lower in August and again increasing in October November.This is because high pollution levels and strong sunlight especially between March and May results in high levels of surface ozone damaging crops. Low surface ozone levels recorded during winter months when pollution levels are high but sunlight is low will either not damage crops or the loss is less.Though there is a permissible human exposure level for surface ozone set by the Central Pollution Control Board, there are no safe levels prescribed for plants.For the study, researchers used two internationally adopted methods to assess the exposure of crops to surface ozone  average ozone levels for seven hours during the day for three-month cropping period and second, accumulated ozone levels that exceed 40 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) over the same period.[S2] In the present study, exposure to wheat in the north and west-central regions of India crossed the average surface ozone 40 ppbv threshold between January and March. The North Indian region includes Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand, while west-central regions comprise Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.Average ozone levels during the wheat crop duration of three months were highest in the west/central region at about 47 ppbv followed by north India at about 41 ppbv. The corresponding accumulated ozone levels recorded in the west was 16,300 ppbv*hr and it was about 7,200 ppbv*hr in the north. However, a major part of the wheat crop is grown in north India only.The damage to rice though lower was also pronounced in northern and western-central parts of the country. The seasonal average ozone levels in the north and west-central were 33 ppbv and 27 ppbv  and the corresponding accumulated ozone levels in both these regions were 4730 ppbv*hr and 3400 ppbv*hr.Researchers said as compared to wheat, crop loss for rice is less because surface ozone levels are lower as the main harvesting period is soon after the summer monsoon. Also average surface ozone levels are lower in the eastern and southern regions of India where large quantity of rice is grown.India has two cropping seasons  Kharif and Rabi. Sowing for rice, a kharif crop, takes place between June and July, and its harvested from September to October. Wheat is a rabi crop that is sown between November and December, and harvested from February to April.North India logged the highest annual loss of about 9 MT of wheat. For rice, the maximum loss of about 2.6 MT every year was recorded from the countrys eastern region of Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha, Chattisgarh, Assam, and Jharkhand.With pollution levels set to rise further including levels of surface ozone, international studies have predicted higher losses for wheat and rice for India by 2030.Ozone is a very reactive gas, and while it is very harmful for health it also has a huge impact on vegetation. Ozone will increase if emissions of gases from combustion of sources such as vehicles and industries increase. If you have to control ozone, then need to control emissions from nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, said Roychowdhury.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that wheat, 73% of which is cultivated in north India alone, should be sown as early as possible starting November so that it is grown in the period when ozone is relatively lower.Wheat and rice cultivars, which have resistance to ozone damage, need to be developed. We would like to suggest policy makers to work out plans to reduce air pollution, particularly in the northern India. This will take care not only of the losses of the crops but also health of the public, read the study.."

Action will certainly be taken on the basis of the report.The move came just weeks after Rawat issued marching orders to Kumaon regional food controller VS Dhanik in connection with the Rs 600 rice scam.Incidentally, the civil supplies department is among the departments which will face special audit, a source said. Other departments include Uttar Pradesh Rajkiya Nirman Nigam Ltd (UPRNNL), State Infrastructure and Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Ltd (Sidcul), Technical University and state cooperative bank.Cabinet minister Madan Kaushik confirmed that the order was issued. The order was issued after complaints were received against those departments, he said, confirming that UPRNNL is one of the departments to face audit.The order for a special audit of construction works carried out by UPRNNL was issued after the government received complaints, Kaushik said, denying the reports that such steps were initiated with an eye on the local body polls and the Lok Sabha election.The anti-graft measures we have been taking are in line with the CMs stated policy of zero tolerance to corruption. As it is, the general election is more than a year away.The government was duty bound to initiate action on all kinds of complaints, including those related to corruption, he asserted.The old constructions carried out by UPRNNL would be audited as the venture was banned in Uttarakhand. A decision to ban UPRNNL was taken after we got complaints relating to construction works it carried out, parliamentary affairs minister Prakash Pant had said.Political observers took a different take on the issue. I have no doubt that the anti-corruption measures being taken by this government will benefit the BJP in all elections, Prof MM Semwal of HNB Garhwal (Central) University said. But, he said, the government has to be consistent in initiating anti-graft measures.It introduced the law but its effective implementation in terms of providing timely services to people is yet to be carried out, Semwal said, citing the example of the Right to Services Act."

The entire scheme is expected to be rolled out by January.At present, only rice is being supplied to the consumers through public distribution system (PDS). By converting these fair price shops into village malls, the government wants to improve the lifestyle of rural population by giving them access to high-quality grocery and nutritious food products, cosmetics, stationery items, commissioner of civil supplies B Rajasekhar told Hindustan Times.At present rice is being supplied through state civil supplies corporation at Re 1 a kg. To supply grocery and FMCG products at a cheaper rate to these village malls, the Andhra Pradesh government in July called for open tenders from reputed retailing companies.It has engaged noted consultant KPMG to conduct the bidding process. The technical bids were opened on August 28 and financial bids on September 8.After the bidding process, we have short-listed two major companies  Reliance Retail and Future Group as suppliers for village malls. The final decision will be taken by the chief minister shortly, a KPMG spokesman said.According to official sources, Reliance Retail has grabbed the bid for supply of commodities in 10 districts and the Future Group, which operates the retail store chain under the name of Big Bazar, in the remaining three districts.The bidding period is three years. The two companies will extend their logistic support to the malls through their supply chain management, IT systems, manufacture linkages, a source said.While a Reliance group spokesman refused to comment on the concept saying the company was yet to get the confirmation, an official spokesperson of the Future Group confirmed that it participated in the bidding.The fair-price shop dealers can order products from around 350-550 food brands and 250-300 non-food brands.The dealers will be provided products at up to a maximum of 30-40% below MRP on food items and 25-45 % below MRP on non-food items. The dealer can retain 40 % of the negotiated margin and pass on the remaining 60 per cent to the consumer.The consumers can expect to get the commodities at least at a 20 % lesser rate than the market price, minister for civil supplies Prathipati Pulla Rao said.He said to set up the malls, FP shop dealers will have to pay 50% of the total investment. The government will bear 25% of the investment and remaining 25% will be mobilised through Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana or other bank loans.The loan can be used by the dealers for undertaking civil work for physical facelift of shop and for working capital requirement to purchase items from the two suppliers, an official source said.As per the bidding agreement, the suppliers will bear 50% cost of fixtures, branding, decoration etc, the source added.In the coming days, the government aims at extending more services and products through village malls such as banking, telecom, medicines, electronics etc, the sources added.The opposition parties are, however, not amused by the concept. They said it was a ploy to do away with the PDS and also alleged some underhand dealings.It looks like Naidu has chosen Reliance Retail and Future Group in a calculated manner, because his family concern Heritage Foods has business links with both these group, YSR Congress party MLA Ramakrishna Reddy Alla alleged.While Heritage Foods sold out its retail wing to Future group, retaining a 3.65% stake last year, it has recently taken over the dairy wing of the Reliance Retail.Essentially, the village mall concept appears to be meant for helping these business groups to expand their activity in the entire state at the cost of FP shops and local retail markets, Reddy said.Former MP and CPI (M) leader P Madhu said the village malls will completely destroy the PDS and corporatise the rural markets.In the long run, they will also monopolise the village markets and convert the FP dealers into their workers, he alleged."

5a14a5f39855b76bf13e668d,A menu to suit your dosha,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-menu-to-suit-your-dosha/article19766643.ece,2017-09-28,"How do you eat food that matches your temperament and keeps you balanced in mind and body? Perhaps Ayurvedic meals are the answer. A culinary experience tailored to suit each guests dosha was curated by The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi recently. In Ayurvedic medicine, doshas are the three energies  Vata, Pitta and Kapha - believed to circulate in the body and govern physiological activity.Dr Ipsita Chatterjee, Ayurveda expert at Forest Essentials, supervised the Ayurvedic menu with the finalised dishes based on feedback provided by guests who were given a common questionnaire earlier.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal. You must have noticed that some people may not be exceptionally beautiful, but have a natural aura, charm and vivacity. This is because of their inner beauty, says Chatterjee. Whatever you eat reflects on your skin. And whatever you eat should be put on your skin.Another myth that the dinner dispelled was that Ayurveda has no place for non-vegetarian cuisine. According to Chatterjee, its a misconception that Ayurveda encourages only vegetarianism. In fact, Ayurveda also encourages eating of non-vegetarian food, says Chatterjee. Acharya Charaka in his book C haraka Sutra clearly mentions that alcohol in moderation ignites your digestive juices and relaxes your mind and body. It was written about 2,500 years ago but the text of this ancient book is relevant even now.Understanding doshasFor those with Vata dosha, the body constitution symbolises air and space. Meat meant for them needs to be cooked with plenty of butter and ghee, says Chatterjee. Vata dosha people are thin, have prominent jaw bones and can eat without putting on weight. They have dryness on their skin. They are creative, and intelligent people but can often be indecisive.Pitta, which represents fire, symbolises romanticism and commitment to work. People with Pitta dosha are born leaders. They have a regal way of life and are passionate and intense about what they do. They take pride in their work but life is never stable. Their temperament can both hurt and enlighten, says Chatterjee. To douse this fire, Pitta dosha people must consume cold foods, herbs, salads and ice cream. They must avoid garam masala and chillies. Mint, fennel, and coriander should be used liberally in their food. Rose white tea is recommended. Other coolants are white coriander or a bit of candied rose petal (gulkand) with chilled milk, she adds.But what if theres a craving for red meat? Warming red meat is contrary to Pitta. So use mint and fennel in your meat portions. You can enjoy your meat and the mint will act as a cooling agent, says Chatterjee. After meat, have a glass of rose milk. Chicken is a light variant but chillies and mustard are to be strictly avoided. Egg whites can be eaten in moderation.Kapha people are like water and earth. Generally they reflect lot of water attributes, says Chatterjee. These people are very loving and patient. They listen to people and are loyal friends. Its difficult to break into their inner circle.Taste testI got to taste a customised menu that was less on flavours but high on keeping me cool. Aubergine Quinoa and Tofu Salad with mint dressing, steamed fish with mint and coriander and Gulab Phirni, kept me relaxed and in a happy state of mind. Even though I felt like tasting the Irani chicken with saffron rice that was being served with vata dosha, I was advised not to deviate from the menu. Apart from chicken, guests with the vata constitution, enjoyed including fresh pea soup with pumpkin seed pesto and Andhra sauted sweet potatoes.For the steady, cautious and stable Kapha personalities, the menu focused on fresh vegetables, fruits and legumes consisting of dishes like Chickpea and Pink Lentil Ragout, Buckwheat Pancakes, fish steamed with star anise and ginger and Spiced Apple and Walnut Phirni to complete the meal.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal"

It did not reveal the cause of the crash.The purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed thousands of global business leaders to Riyadh for an investment summit, showcasing his reform drive that has shaken up the kingdom.The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history, said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal... would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community, Ulrichsen told AFP.Meteoric riseThe crackdown follows a wave of arrests of influential clerics and activists in September as the 32-year-old prince, often known as MBS, consolidates his hold on power.Analysts said many of those detained were resistant to Prince Mohammeds aggressive foreign policy that includes the boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar as well as some of his bold policy reforms, including privatising state assets and cutting subsidies.The latest purge saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah sacked as the head of the National Guard, an elite internal security force. His removal consolidates the crown princes control of the kingdoms security institutions.To analysts, Prince Mohammeds meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.At the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June."

The suspects were not named.The cabinet reshuffle saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah replaced as minister of the National Guard by Khaled bin Ayyaf, while Economy Minister Adel Fakieh was removed in favour of his deputy Mohammed al-Tuwaijri, according to a royal decree carried by state-run media.Prince Miteb, the preferred son of the late King Abdullah, was once thought to be a leading contender for the throne before the unexpected rise of Prince Mohammed two years ago. He had inherited control of the National Guard, an elite internal security force built out of traditional tribal units, from his father, who ran it for five decades.Saudi Arabian Prince Miteb bin Abdullah at the Elysee Palace in Paris. (Reuters File Photo)Prince Miteb was the last remaining member of Abdullahs branch of the family to hold a position in the upper echelons of the Saudi power structure.What the cabinet shuffle doesThe move consolidates Crown Prince Mohammeds control of the kingdoms security institutions, which had long been headed by separate powerful branches of the ruling family.Prince Mohammed, the kings 32-year-old son, already serves as defence minister and was named heir to the throne in a June reshuffle that sidelined his older cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who had also served as interior minister.Read | Drug addiction and intrigue: Why Saudi King ordered Mohammed bin Nayef to step aside for younger princeHe has been responsible at the same time for running Saudi Arabias war in Yemen, dictating an energy policy with global implications and behind the plans for the kingdom to build a future after oil.Prince Mohammed, who has pledged to go after graft at the highest levels, will now also head up the new anti-corruption body, which was given broad powers to investigate cases, issue arrest warrants and travel restrictions, and freeze assets.The homeland will not exist unless corruption is uprooted and the corrupt are held accountable, the royal decree said.New economy ministerThe countrys new economy minister, Tuwaijri, is a former Saudi air force pilot and former chief executive of HSBCs Middle East operations who has led the economy ministrys programme to privatise some $200 billion of government assets.He replaces Fakieh, who served as the point man for the kingdoms wide-ranging economic reforms since his appointment as economy and planning minister in 2015.A former food executive with a reputation for pushing through politically sensitive reforms, Fakieh had previously served as labour minister, health minister and mayor of Jeddah.Fakieh faced down fierce opposition from the business community as labour minister when he established quotas for foreign workers to boost jobs for Saudis.Read | Saudi kings son plotted to oust his rival as crown princeUnder Prince Mohammed, Fakieh led the development of a national transformation plan and privatisation drive launched last year to end the kingdoms vulnerability to an unpredictable oil market. His replacement comes as the kingdom makes adjustments to that plan, a process dubbed NTP 2.0.The royal decree did not say whether Fakieh would hold any other government position. Former ministers often serve in advisory roles after leaving their posts.The arrestsAl Arabiya television reported that the princes, four current and dozens of former ministers were arrested as the commission launched a probe into floods that devastated the Red Sea city of Jeddah in 2009 and the deadly outbreak of the Mers virus some years ago.State-run Saudi Press Agency said the commissions goal was to preserve public money, punish corrupt people and those who exploit their positions.Saudi billionaire Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal was among those arrested, Saudi news websites said though there was no official confirmation.

He told his family they could repair their house and marry off his daughter after selling the harvest.But then a swarm of brown planthoppers struck. The green leaves turned orange-yellow. Sahoo, 51, tried fighting the insects, known to feed on rice plants, with pesticides. It didnt work.Soon, the leaves were brown and plants bone dry, signalling the onset of hopper burn, a condition that kills the plant as the insect sucks the sap.Sahoo knew his crop had no chance against the pest and neither did he.On October 31, he set fire to his wasted crop at Kalapani village in Bargarh district, about 350km northwest of Odisha capital Bhubaneswar.According to his family, it was a debt-ridden farmers desperate bid to catch the governments attention. The next day, Sahoo drank poison and died while being taken to hospital.Farmers Alaya Jena of Sanakhemundi block in Ganjam district and P Nabin Kumar of Nuakhairpali village in Bargarh have done the same since then, unable to fend off the brown planthopper that Odisha farmers call Matia Gundi (brown insect that reduces crops to dust).Jena died on Sunday, the fourth Odisha farmer driven to suicide this year by a pest attack.On October 25, chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced a drought relief package for farmers in 15 of the states 30 districts. There was no mention of crops ravaged by pests.On Sunday, the government acknowledged pests had hit crops in nearly 1.78 lakh hectares (1 hectare = 2.47 acre) across nine districts.A brown planthopper. (International Rice Research Institute, Philippines)State development commissioner and additional chief secretary, R Balakrishnan, reviewed the pest damage with district collectors. Pest attack is a natural calamity and affected farmers will be compensated as per Odisha relief code, he told HT.Odisha farmers are familiar with the brown planthopper but the infestation is severe this season. Reports of farmers setting fire to paddy fields are coming in from the nine affected districts.Sahoos elder brother, Nagat, also a sharecropper, or a tenant farmer who gives a part of the crop as rent, blames pesticides. We faced the pest onslaught successfully in 2015, but this year pesticides have been ineffective, he said.Patnaik and his ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) are facing criticism from farmer bodies and opposition.The agriculture department was late in sending subsidised pesticides to the states 314 blocks this year as discussions dragged on over a notification indicating price list of several farm products.The notification that helps farmers get pesticides on 50% or even 100% subsidy was issued on November 1, the day Sahoo died.The notification is usually ready by August. Even if delayed, we get it by September. But it came in very late this year, said an agriculture department official who did not want to be named.Farmer Brunda Sahoos daughter, Preeti, outside her home. (Debabrata Mohanty/Hindustan Times)Kalapani sarpanch and farmer Bhira Reddy said the pesticide might have been of inferior quality. The local dealers are stocking sub-standard pesticides manufactured by smaller companies in Chhattisgarh, he alleged.The views were echoed by Sahoos daughter, Preeti. The pesticides failed to kill the insects, but killed my father, said the 18-year-old.Bijay Sahoo, a pesticide dealer in Bargarh, said he had not compromised on the quality. I think the humid climate played a role.Mayabini Jena, principal scientist and head of crop protection division of National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, said early action is the best bet against the brown planthopper. Once humidity and temperature increase, the female moths lay more than 100-150 eggs every day. If there is a delay in spraying of pesticides, it becomes difficult to control, she said.To add to the problem, these insects populate the roots and in areas where farmers plant paddy very close to each other. It is difficult to spot such insects. Most farmers dont spray on the paddy roots where the insects thrive, Jena said.The pest attack has dealt a body blow to farmers battling high input costs. Sharecroppers such as Sahoo often depend on local moneylenders who demand exorbitant rates of interest.Sahoos son, Rajesh, admitted his father, too, was worried about money. Also, the pesticides and fertilisers were taken on credit from local traders who would have taken a share of the harvest in return, said Rajesh.Sahoo would also have to give a bulk of the produce to the land owner as per their contract.It is agriculture minister Damodar Rout who is responsible for the death of the farmers. Why were pesticides not supplied on time? asked Anant Padhi, president of Bargarh district Congress committee.Odisha BJP chief Basant Panda demanded that Patnaik sack Rout, who faced criticism on Saturday for saying the government would not extend aid to farmers who set fire to their crops."

He is also the president of the New Patel Nagar resident welfare association.Singh was appalled at the dismal conditions of hundreds of residents of the colony living on roadsides. He decided to feed them after noticing the residents, especially children begging for food.Since the demolition drive, the street in front of my house has been filled with several homeless families. I have been living in this area for last 40 years, but never saw so much chaos. It is a pitiable condition, said Singh.So, last week, he hired a cook and bought 100 kilos of rice and 30 kilos of dal. In a few hours, lunch was prepared to feed over a hundred people. Then he went about distributing it.Encouraged by his efforts, Singhs friends also joined him. The gurdwara authority approached him and began distributing food during dinner time among the homeless persons, Singh said.Similarly, the church in New Patel Nagar has turned into a temporary shelter for few residents, where they are provided food and water.From 8 am onwards, Rupa Massey (20), one of the church members, begins making tea in the kitchen of the church. She lives in Najafgarh but comes to the church everyday to prepare morning tea and lunch for the residents of Kathputli Colony. By 10 am, she finishes making several rounds of tea.Sukhvinder Singh (52), popular among the residents as Sardarji, hires a cycle rickshaw and goes among the homeless with two containers filled with rice and dal.The ground floor of the church has become a temporary shelter for the homeless. Massey and several others like her work in the church kitchen from morning till evening to feed these residents.Morning tea is served in disposable glasses along with a toast. We give it to every resident of Kathputli Colony, who has been coming to the church ever since their houses were demolished. They have no means to feed themselves, so we have been preparing food for them daily. Those who come to the church never go back hungry, said Massey.For lunch, the church members prepare several kilos of steamed rice, dal and hundreds of rotis. They also make huge quantities of potatoes and cauliflower vegetable curry.The people of Kathputli Colony, whose homes were destroyed last week, have been spending most of their time in this church. We prepare food and provide them shelter at night. Its an open floor for them. We help them in whatever way we can, said Mark, the churchs pastor.People are living out in the open.Their houses were razed to the ground in a"

The government announcement to begin paddy procurement from Sunday has come as a relief to farmers in the district.K.K. MustafahThe decision of the government to begin direct procurement of the first paddy crop from Palakkad on Sunday has come as a relief for farmers across the district.Though harvesting began in the district two weeks ago, disputes with owners of 52 private rice mills across the State over paddy handling charges have delayed the procurement.The Agriculture Department has decided to directly procure paddy in association with the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco) without involving the mills following the intervention of Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar.The agencies have arranged godowns of private individuals and the Kerala State Warehousing Corporation to initiate the procurement drive.Officials say the mills attempted to delay the procurement to ensure that the market price of unprocessed paddy goes below the government procurement price of Rs. 22.80 a kg. As far as handling charge is concerned, the LDF government is paying Rs. 214 a quintal in place of Rs. 138 offered by the previous UDF government. The officials estimate the yield in the district at 1,10,000 tonnes.Though the farmers welcome direct procurement of paddy, there are anxieties over the ability of Supplyco and the Agriculture Department to complete the procurement on a war footing.In the previous years, private mills procured paddy via their collection agents. The dispute between the government and the mills emerged after the mills collected about 20,000 tonnes of paddy.The farmers are worried as harvesting had been hit by raids by wild animals and incessant rain.While harvesting is over in about half of the paddy fields in Palakkad and Alathur taluks, it is yet to begin in Chittur taluk, which has the largest extent of paddy fields.Meanwhile, the Deseeya Karshaka Samajam has demanded blacklisting of the private mills.

For him, selling the BPL rice is the only option as his daily earning is not enough to buy vegetable for his six-member family. Similar is the plight of several below poverty line families who are feeling the pinch of high vegetable price.For middle class families, non-vegetarian food has become a cheaper option. But we cannot afford to have non-vegetarian food daily, said Kathia Jena of Rajpur.The worst-hit are vegetarian hotels of the district. Dipu Nayak, owner of a vegetarian hotel, said, For the last few days, I am incurring a loss of Rs 500 on a daily basis. Now, I feel compelled to include non-vegetarian food in the menu to retain my customers.According to local traders, the vegetable market here depends on neighbouring States such as West Bengal, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. Due to hike in prices of vegetables there, the market here has been affected, they said.The demand for vegetables has increased in the wake of marriage season and this is another reason for the price hike, said Valu Khanaa, a vegetable vendor. Sources in the Regulated Market Committee said vegetables worth Rs 7 lakh are sold in Bhadrak town daily. The sales double during marriage season.Sources said vegetable farming is being hardly given any importance in the district with over 95 per cent of vegetables being imported from other States. Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bhadrak, Tankadhar Behera said due to lack of storage and irrigation facilities, farmers show little interest in vegetable farming."

Clarity on revenues will emerge both for the Centre and State after three to four monthly cycles as the Centre also extended time to the traders for filing of returns in view of the glitches in the GST network, official sources said.While there has been concern in various sectors about the delay in release of funds, government sources reel out statistics that, already Rs. 53,000 crore has been spent so far this year  Rs. 25,000 crore towards establishment expenditure including salaries, pensions and interest on loans and Rs. 28,000 crore spent on various flagship programmes of the government.Financial situation is tight but not desperate, is how senior officials sought to explain the present financial crunch.Though the most vocal demand about pending dues is from the educational institutions under fee reimbursement scheme, sources clarify that so far Rs. 477 crore had been released and Rs. 220 crore was pending for the second quarter out of Rs. 2,800 crore budget for the year.We released Rs. 4,000 crore towards crop loan waiver, cleared bills to the tune of Rs. 6,000 crore for irrigation, released Rs. 1,896 crore towards power subsidy, Rs. 1,331 crore for rice subsidy, Rs. 384 crore for Shaadi Mubarak and Kalyana Lakshmi and Rs. 2,500 crore for social security pensions so far, sources said.Expenditure wise, it is normal for the State to spend about 40 % of expenditure in the first half of the year and the expenditure is greater in the second half. Of total budget of Rs. 1.5 lakh crore, if expenditure was around 80 to 90 % by the end of the year, it is considered good performance, sources point out.Another unexpected burden on the State was 12 % GST on public works and roughly it would amount to Rs. 8,500 crore. But half of it would come back to the State as its tax revenue share.In the remaining half, the Centre would devolve part of it to the State.However the State is hopeful that Centre will at least bring down the tax rate from the present 12 % on earth work component of the public works projects to bring the burden further down, sources say."

However, the food will not be served on government holidays.The officials said that the meals will consist of rice and sambar, vegetables, eggs, 200 ml milk, jaggery, soaked Bengal gram, and other nutritious foods.

Other districts will be covered under the decentralised procurement system as and when paddy starts arriving at the mandis (market yards), Chief Secretary Aditya Padhi told reporters.The Government has set a tentative target to procure 36 lakh ton of rice (around 53 lakh ton in terms of paddy) during the 2017-18 kharif marketing season covering both kharif and rabi crops. However, there is no bar for procurement of any higher quantum if more paddy comes to mandi from registered farmers with approval of the Government, he said.The Chief Secretary said, kharif paddy will be procured from farmers who are registered in the online portal of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) Department and the operation will continue till April 2018. Paddy will be procured as per the minimum support price (MSP) declared by the Central Government. Padhi reviewed the preparation for paddy procurement at a high-level meeting attended by Agriculture Production Commissioner GK Dhal and Secretaries of Agriculture, FS&CW, Cooperation and Panchayati Raj departments.The State Government has planned to procure 44 lakh tonnes of paddy during kharif and 9 lakh tonnes during rabi season.

For, the Directorate of Prisons and Correctional Services has decided to launch organic farming over the five-acre agricultural land available on the jail premises.Director General of Prisons Bijay Kumar Sharma, who visited the Balasore Jail on Monday, has permitted Ashok Panigrahy, an expert on organic farming, to introduce the farming model on the jail premises.Currently, the jail inmates grow vegetables, mostly during winter, using the conventional methods on four acre land. Annually, about Rs 3 lakh worth of vegetables are grown and sold from the jail counters. Greens apart, rice is also grown on the farm land.Using the organic methods, the production can be raised but it would require infrastructure which the Directorate has agreed to create following a proposal from Panigrahy, a former Zoology Reader of FM Autonomous College and Principal Investigator of UGC-funded projects in Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts.Organic farming can raise the produce by three to four times and the jail can provide necessary raw materials for vermi-compost generation, Sharma said. A vermi-compost bed would also be created for the purpose.The organic farming process will not only increase earning which can contribute to the welfare fund, it is aimed at enabling inmates to learn the process which they can use once released.In his proposal, Panigrahy had sought funds for vermi-composting and permission for housing two pairs of bullocks and cows for generation of the manure. Once the model succeeds, he said, the Directorate can replicate it in other prisons.Organic farming apart, the Prisons Directorate has started works for renovating four huge ponds where fish farming was the norm in past. However, heavy siltation and non-maintenance rendered the ponds unusable. The Directorate has already taken up the matter with Fisheries and Animal Resources Development Department to de-silt the ponds so that freshwater farming can be resumed.The Balasore District Jail, set up in 1847, is one of the few jails which is underpopulated. Against a capacity for 480, there are 360 inmates in the prison.The Prisons and Correctional Services Directorate has decided to transfer some inmates from Bhadrak which runs at 200 per cent capacity."

The suspended teachers are Chittaranjan Kar of Mandia Primary School under Dharmasala block and Bharat Chandra Barik of Korei Nodal Upper Primary school under Korei block in the district.The step was taken against the accused after they were apparently found guilty in the inquiry reports submitted to Jajpur Collector Ranjan Kumar Das. They had allegedly registered fake names of students in the school attendance record. Das had ordered a probe into the matter after several public complaints were received against the duo at the Collector Grievance Cell. The Collector had director the DEO and the DPC to probe into the matter.Following Dass orders, the officials paid surprise visits to the schools and detected several irregularities, including misappropriation of MDM funds, unauthorised absence of teacher, fake attendance of students, sources said.During spot inquiry, it was found that the headmaster had listed names of more than 250 fake students in the attendance register. He was even drawing funds and rice for Mid-Day meals from the block office, said the DEO.Though as many as 420 students names were enrolled in the MDM attendance register, in reality, 150 students were taking the meals on daily basis, he added.Similarly, Dharmasala Block Education Officer (BEO) was asked to probe into the allegation raised by the locals. When BEO paid a surprise visit to the school there, he found that the headmaster had put down the names of more than 50 fake students in the attendance register.MDM scheme is a nation-wide food programme to help improve attendance in schools while providing adequate nutrition to potentially malnourished students. Stern action will be taken if any school teacher is found to be involved in corrupt practices, the DEO warned."

The Japanese ensured that the elegantly designed ultra-modern glass and steel structure would impress foreign visitors, whose numbers were bound to grow as Vietnam opened up to the rest of the world. Vietnams focus on its new terminal, which over time will service 15 million passengers, is in itself an indicator of the countrys intent to engage with the globe.Just like China and the Tiger economies, Vietnam has correctly diagnosed that its prosperity will have to ride on a judicious integration with the world economy. That means inviting foreign capital, which would come owing to the countrys low labour costs and business-friendly rules. A complementary focus on infrastructure  highways, railroads, ports, airports and services  would also ensure that Vietnam soon becomes a significant trading nation.A short distance from the airport, the imposing Nhat Tn Bridge comes into view. This too has been built by the Japanese and is among the largest cable-stayed bridges in Southeast Asia. At night, the five spans of the bridge, representing the five gates of the ancient capital, are each illuminated in distinct colours.The Philips Color Kinetics, which has been responsible for the illumination, claims that a staggering 16.7 million colours can be generated to light up the bridge that spans the Red river.The Red river begins its journey in mountains south of Dali, in Chinas Yunnan Province and enters Vietnam in the Lo Cai Province. Joined by two major tributaries  the Black river and L river  it terminates at the Gulf of Tonkin in the South China Sea. The delta area is the heart of Vietnams rice production, and has been central to its food security. The river has also been pivotal for the rise of Vietnams Haiphong port.Korea, the biggest investorApart from the Japanese, the Koreans are investing big in Vietnam. In fact, Republic of Korea is, by far, the largest foreign investor in Vietnam. Last year, Seoul pitched in $5.5 billion, edging out Japan, which invested $868 million.Samsung is Koreas flagship investor. It is estimated that nearly half of its smartphones are churned out by its two factory complexes in Bac Ninh Province and Thai Nguyen Province, near Hanoi.Indias engagement with Vietnam has so far taken a different route, with geostrategy taking precedence over economics. Vietnam is the centrepiece of Indias Act East policy, which has the consolidation of its ties with the ASEAN at its heart. However, there is now a clear recognition of the need to impart a greater balance to New Delhi-Hanoi ties.We are hopeful that in the coming years the economic and people-to-people dimensions, including tourism, would be added to an extraordinarily solid, special and friendly relationship, says P. Harish, Indias Ambassador to Vietnam.Indian shipping could also benefit greatly as Vietnam consolidates its position as an international export hub serving the Indian market. Industry specialists point out that rapid development of ports along Indias east coast would be vital if India is to take advantage of its favourable maritime geography. Modern Indian ports along the Bay of Bengal from Chennai to Kolkata can also become profitable trans-shipment nodes for shipping goods from Asia to other parts of the world, said an industry specialist who did not wish to be named.Japan and Korea are taking advantage of the liberalisation of Vietnams economy by making big-ticket infrastructure investments. Can India follow suit?"

Kandasamy on Thursday dropped a bombshell offering to quit citing interference in governance by the office of the Lieutenant Governor that came in the way of implementation of welfare measures.The Minister said he proposed a fast in front of Parliament to condemn the Union Government for failing to rein in the Lt. Governor.Mr. Kandasamy said he had expressed his desire to resign from the Cabinet as he was not able to implement welfare measures but had been restrained from doing so by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy.CMs adviceSpeaking at a government function, he said there was unnecessary interference from certain quarters and even free rice distribution was getting disturbed. But the Chief Minister has advised me not to do so, he said. In his address, the Chief Minister said resignation was not a solution to the present situation but the need of the hour was to fight it politically.Later, in a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Kandasamy launched a scathing criticism against the Lt. Governor.Ever since our elected government took charge, no welfare schemes could be implemented in time or effectively. Pay arrears, allowances and salaries to staff of the government and government undertakings could not be paid, Mr. Kandasamy said. Our announcement to waive farmers agricultural loans obtained from primary agricultural co-operative societies could not be made available to farmers till date despite the file was duly processed through Finance and Law departments and because of negative approach of the Lieutenant Governor, Puducherry.The file was unnecessarily referred to the Government of India to drag the proposal and as a result the assurance of the government is pending till date thereby leading to the agitation of farmers from Puducherry to the national capital, the letter said.Besides, vis-a-vis, the proposal for 100% free education (full reimbursement of tuition fees for Scheduled Caste/Tribe students undergoing various professional courses) got frequently turned down by the Lieutenant Governor despite the proposal being routed through the Law and Finance departments. In spite of repeated justifications by me and the Chief Minister, the proposal has been turned down by the Lieutenant Governor without any proper reasons. I could not extend any assistance to our youth. Although he hailed from the Scheduled Caste community, as a Cabinet Minister he could not fulfil the social security needs of his community because of the negative approach of the Lieutenant Governor, he said.Contending that while he had been making efforts for the development of fisherman, development of minor Port Department, dredging work, etc., the Lieutenant Governor had been personally engaging private individuals and NGOs who are exercising anti-government activities and lodging baseless complaints with the help of NGOs to stop the works of Port and fishermen welfares. The government was now not in a position to disburse the ongoing schemes of free rice, free clothing items to BPL families during festival occasion well before the festival, he said.Funds crunchThe department had been receiving more than 15,000 applications continuously on their eligibility for grant of financial assistance from poor families and individuals under old age, widow and destitute pension since 2016, but the same could not be considered due to heavy financial crunch.However, I have made attempt to submit the proposal for provision of additional funds to consider at least 5,000 applications out of the total applications received. But the Finance Secretary declined to consider the same on the advice of the Lieutenant Governor, the letter said.The Minister claimed that for the last two months, the Finance Secretary on the advice of the Lieutenant Governor, had been exercising tactics to turn down the files and (create) obstacles for the implementation of welfare schemes. Neither Minister of portfolios nor the Chief Secretary to the government was kept informed of any action taken, he said.Mr. Kandasamy accused the Lieutenant Governor of passing orders to government secretaries by warning that she had received corruption complaints and the same was being forwarded to Central Vigilance Commission for taking action.Mr. Kandasamy alleged that apart from these anti-government activities, the Lt. Governor had unilaterally appointed three BJP candidates as nominated MLAs with the connivance of the Centre which was now being challenged in the court.The file on farm loan waiver was unnecessarily referred to the Centre to drag the proposal, and as a result, the assurance of the government is pending till date"

As a peoples representative, officials allowed him to visit the godown to witness the precautionary measures taken to control the pest.Though the foodgrains were stored scientifically in the godown, the infestation of weevils in the foodgrains could be witnessed. He had suggested the officials to put up a cover similar to a mosquito net for about 20 to 30 feet height on all sides of the compound to prevent the pests from entering the residential areas.D. Lakshmi, a resident of Shriram Nagar 1-st Cross Street adjacent to the compound of the godown, said that they were going through sleepless nights for the last several years.The insects could be seen inside rice containers and other foodgrains and even in the water.The insect often went into the ears of the children. Many two-wheeler riders fell on the road after hit by weevils, Ms. Lakshmi added.Officials in-charge of quality control department of the godown said that they were regularly undertaking permeating and spraying process soon after finding the infestation.For the last few days, they undertook this process in morning and evening to control the infestation. They said that the menace would be brought under control in another two or three days.The godown with 1.1-lakh tonne capacity had 96,000 boiled and raw rice as of now, the officials added.When contacted, FCI Area Manager N.

However, this may not be for everyone, especially those diagnosed with diabetes, doctors have warned.Beginning at sunrise, the fast lasts for about 12 to 15 hours and may or may not entail consuming a glass of water or juice in the afternoon. The fast is broken only once the moon rises.Good way to detoxWhile the day-long fast is a good way to detoxify the system, and condition the body and mind, it is also imperative to assess the risks that it may pose for women with conditions such as diabetes, caution city doctors.They said that on the occasion of Karva Chauth, it is crucial to raise awareness about the implications of fasting without adequate precautions, especially for those with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.Dr. Sanjay Kalra, Endocrinologist and vice-president, South Asian Federation of Endocrine Societies, said: Intermittent fasting has many proven health benefits. However, in women living with diabetes, fasting, without adequate safe guards, can lead to hypoglycemia. Karva Chauth requires women to abstain from water all day. This can cause dehydration, dyselectrolytemia, and hypotension. Once the fast is completed, they tend to over indulge in food that is high in fat, carbohydrate, and calories. This can cause peaks of hyperglycemia and worsen glycemia variability. Those with Type 1 diabetes are at a higher risk of developing hypoglycemia. It is possible for women living with diabetes to enjoy this festival provided they take good care of their dietary regimen.Early meal vitalDoctors say that the meal before the fasting starts, consumed early in the morning, should ideally be a nutrient-rich meal as it will enable them to sustain themselves throughout the day. It holds even more importance in case of those living with diabetes. A sargi rich in protein and complex carbohydrates is ideal before beginning the fast. It is important to break the fast with light food, adds Dr. Kalra.Doctors advise avoiding food rich in trans fats right after breaking the fast. Start by sipping water or juice to hydrate yourself. This can be followed up with some protein-rich food rather than consuming sweets and fried foods. Include vegetables, curd, wholegrains in the form of chapatis, rice with pulses or dal as part of your post-fast diet.Fasting may be a spiritual belief and part of our culture. However, it is beneficial only when done in a planned and healthy manner, especially those living with diabetes, doctors said. Apart from patients, it is also imperative for doctors to ensure that they create awareness among their high-risk patients about the dangers of keeping a fast without taking adequate precautionary measures, say city doctors."

Khader, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, has said that all district headquarters will have Indira Canteens to supply subsidised food within three months in the State.Addressing presspersons here on Saturday before chairing a review meeting at the Deputy Commissioners office, he said that the government has started the process to open the canteens across the State simultaneously.With regard to giving LPG connections to poor families, the Minister accused the Union government of not giving connections to all poor families in the State under the Prime Ministers Ujwala scheme.This will create social imbalance and discrimination against the poor families. The Union government should ensure LPG connections to every poor household and not limit it to certain families, he said.Stating that the Union government was giving LPG connections to only around 10 lakh families while the State has around 30 lakh families that have no LPG connections, Mr. Khader said that the State government would provide connections to the remaining families under the Chief Ministers Anila Bhagya Yojane.The State government will start calling for applications within a fortnight for giving LPG connections to the deserving people in the State, the Minister said.About ration cards, Mr. Khader said that the Ministry has cancelled around 10 lakh bogus BPL cards saving around 40,000 tonnes of rice given under Anna Bhagya Scheme in the State.He said that the Ministry was in the process of converting around 24,000 ration shops into Seva Sindhu Centres where people could get other benefits such as PAN and Aadhaar cards along with monthly ration.He said that as of now, only 10 such centres have been opened in Bengaluru. However, they would be extended to the entire State in a phased manner.He said that while by December-end, 10,000 ration shops would be converted into Seva Sindhu Centres, by May-end next year, the government plans to convert all 24,000 shop into such centres."

5a14bfa29855b76bf13e7762,Together to promote pesticide-free paddy farming,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/together-to-promote-pesticide-free-paddy-farming/article19825393.ece,2017-10-09,"It was a different experience for the residents of Mankurussi and surrounding villages in the district on Sunday when a group of former technocrats from Kochi joined hands with the local community to organise a paddy seedling transplanting festival.The festival was part of the efforts to initiate paddy cultivation in 73 acres of land in the village on a group-farming basis. A mud football tournament, the first of its kind in entire Palakkad district, and initiation of over three dozen college students into paddy cultivation activities were also part of the programmes.A dozen teams of budding farmers from Ottappalam and Parali took part in the mud football, which was organised in a field prepared for seedling transplant. The youngsters were provided with practical training in paddy transplantation activities.According to Suresh Kunhupillai, a former technocrat with Infosys, it was about three months ago that he and a few of his friends floated Farmers Collective, a start-up promoting cultivation of pesticide-free paddy using scientific agricultural practices across the State. The Mankurissi initiative is our first attempt and it will be replicated soon in the Kole wetlands of Thrissur. More such initiatives are in the pipeline and they are aimed at helping traditional farmers to approach paddy cultivation with confidence. We will not use pesticides but the rice will not be classified as organic, said Mr. Kunhupillai.Expenses to be metAccording to technocrat Rijesh Rajan, who hails from Mankurissi, the experiment in the village is in collaboration with over a dozen local farmers. Our start-up will find agriculture loving entrepreneurs to meet entire expenses of paddy cultivation here. The farmers need not spend any money on agricultural activities. They can just supervise and safe keep the cultivation, he said.The Farmers Collective is now in the process of formulating an e-commerce platform to sell the rice to buyers across the globe. We will procure the entire paddy at a higher price than what the governments procurement agencies are offering. We are also prompting the farmers to grow ducks close to the farmland as they would eat the insects. Framers will not lose any money as the crops will be insured, said Jinu Thomas, another coordinator of the collective."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

The court will now decide on the matter. Jay has moved the court, he said at a programme organised by a news channel here.As far as the company is concerned, it has not done business worth a rupee with the government.

They are saying the companys turnover rose to Rs. 80 crore from a mere Rs. 50,000, but they are not showing that it incurred a loss of Rs. 1.5 crore. This is a high-volume, low-profit business.

5a14c6679855b76bf13e7be3,Invincible at 71: Odisha in the Naveen era,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2017/oct/16/invincible-at-71-odisha-in-the-naveen-era-1675172.html,2017-10-16,"The years between 1995 and 2000 were the turning points in Odishas political history. With political instability and natural disasters ripping off the State, it was looking for a way out of the situation. People were in search of a leader, who could arrest the stunted growth and put the State on a rapid development path. Naveen Patnaik took over the reins of Odisha at a critical juncture. For his pro-people and reform-oriented governance, he is today the undisputed leader in the State and country.Turning PointWhen Odishas mass leader Biju Patnaik passed away in 1997, the State witnessed a political vacuum. This was when Naveen emerged as an accepted leader, the real successor of Biju Patnaik.Naveen began his political career as a Lok Sabha member from Aska. He was, of course, a novice in politics then. One who never tasted political waters stood up to the challenge. Not only did he begin his political journey, Naveen knew the need of the hour. He could also identify the barriers in the path of the economic growth.Centres step-motherly treatment to Odishas interests rattled him. He realised that only a regional party can safeguard the interests of people and put the State on a growth path. This was when the Biju Janata Dal was established and Naveen devoted all his energy in leading the State.In the initial phase, he forged an alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and became a coalition partner in the NDA Government. Naveen became a Union Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Government.Development EraThe Super Cyclone of 1999 had devastated the State beyond imagination. The Government then was unable to handle the situation and the mass dissatisfaction coupled with political instability and economic devastation had led to a vulnerable situation. During this critical period, Naveen and his Biju Janata Dal turned out to be the silver lining. In the Assembly Election of 2000, people voted the party to power and Naveen was sworn in as the Chief Minister for the first time. Development in Odisha began from here.The first task of his Government was to bring back smiles on the face of the poor and underprivileged. Naveen realised that unless the socially backward people are taken out of the morass, no development can take place. The Biju Janata Dal started the process by announcing several programmes for this section of the society. Infrastructure development also started with construction of roads, bridges and other similar projects.The new Government worked with an aim of bringing Odisha out of the ignominy of a laggard State and make it a progressive one. Thus, began the Naveen era.New Political JourneyNew development initiatives and administrative reforms were taken up simultaneously. Naveen ensured that all developmental benefits should go to the people at the grassroots. His determination and dedication paid him big dividends and Naveen won the 2004 Assembly Election with a thumping majority. He was sworn in as the Chief Minister for the second time in a row along with the BJP as the alliance partner. However, the alliance did not last long.There was a breach of trust between the two partners. Making things worse, the 2008 Kandhamal riots brought a bad name for the State Government and Naveen. A secular Naveen could not withstand the forces that were dividing the State along communal lines. The alliance ended and the BJD fought the 2009 elections on its own. The electorate reposed their faith in Naveen this time as well. Naveen became the Chief Minister for the third time and he could prove his political might and pervasiveness even without the BJP. After forming the government for the third time, he took major steps to announce pro-people policies with focus on poverty alleviation. To ensure food security, he brought in the Rice at 1 rupee a kg scheme.Empowerment of women through Mission Shakti and helping pregnant women and the children through the Mamata Yojana were the two other flagship programmes of the Naveen Patnaik Government. By establishing food canteens for the poor in urban areas, Odishas beloved Chief Minister became an example for others.Development did not stop here. Tribal rights have been protected and there is a fair treatment towards forest produces. By ensuring stipends to tribal and Scheduled Caste children, he made them self-reliant.The slew of development-oriented programmes has brought the Naveen Patnaik Government closer to people. His pro-people schemes helped him win election one after the other and the polls in 2014 broke all the previous records.Simple Living, High ThinkingEven after becoming Chief Minister four times consecutively, Naveen continues to lead a simple life. Donning a white kurta and a pair of chappals, his simple living has become a point of discussion in the national media.The Chief Minister has never tolerated corruption and has taken tough action against those involved in unfair practices. He has been harder towards those who have shown negligence while dealing with problems of the common man. This is also the reason why Naveen has been able to maintain his popularity and an unsullied image.Naveens administrative acumen and the style of governance has become a benchmark. Other leaders are, in fact, measured by this yardstick."

Diwali marks the beginning of four-day festival, which also known as Bandhna.The festival will begin on Thursday with Goth Puja during which rice is worshipped by villagers. They collect cow dung, sun-dried rice, vermilion, mithi (a kind of spice), rice powder and all these are placed in a winnow which is taken in a procession to Goth (grazing ground of cows). The priest then offers prayer on behalf of the community.Later, the rice is offered to Maran Buru and other tribal deities. A community feast follows at the Goth for which the priest prepares a dish with sacrificed fowls. In the evening, cattle are taken to the Goth.They then let the cattle loose at the venue for the feast and owner of the cow that feeds on the leaf plate used by the priest, is considered the lucky one. He is asked to supply a pot of handia (rice beer) for next years festival and is crowned as hero of the community who is blessed with good cattle and harvest.On second day, fowls and pigs are sacrificed at the altar of Goddess Kali. The rituals include washing of agricultural equipment and anointing them with rice powder and vermilion. The animals scarified are cooked and eaten by tribal families. In the evening, tribals assemble near Akhara (village yard) to sing and dance. The third day is devoted to cattle sports.A ritual Jale Hilok is observed on the fourth day when Majhihardam (village head) goes around the village telling people that Sohrai is over. A week later, he calls the villagers to his house and offers them rice beer. It is called as Chatiar Handi which marks the end of the festival."

Even those not knowing the language are sure that I am singing from my heart, he explains settling down for a quick lunch at The Parks Fire restaurant. When I sing in other languages, I do it phonetically but am unable to put my soul behind it. This gets translated to the audience as they know kuch toh fake kar raha hai, he quips.After a quick look at the menu, Raghu asks for Caesar salad with lots of lettuce, kothamalli pestro, baby mozzarella and cherry tomatoes while agreeing to try Andhra quinoa and beetroot, suggested by the staff. Back to the point, he observes, Before singing, I always explain the lyrics. The language barrier is only for the first few minutes then it takes a back seat as audience feel assured with our passionate singing. The other day I sang for 150 people with just my guitar and other accompaniments. Yet, I made people sing Kannada songs.He maintains lyrics are the prime reason for his bands success in India and abroad as the songs have philosophical and positive messages. I dont do it deliberately as they are already embedded in the poems on which I compose music. He explains with examples. In Gudugudiya Sedi Nodo, poet Santa Shishunala Sharif asks how does one feel after smoking hookah in which materialistic pursuits are burnt in a chillum called faith. Youngsters realising the poems gravity remark, That is really deep. Similarly, the song Lokada Kaalaji Maaduthinanthi, by the same poet says, dont worry and be happy in life. Relatable, the audience connect to it. He feels even if two out of 10 are drawn to know about these poets and their writings, he feels happy. Today, as soon as we release a new song, my hardcore fans immediately want to know the meaning.Colourful attireThe colourful and printed lungis and dhotis of band members also make Raghu Dixit Project stand out. It is a take off from what I learnt in Bharatanatyam. Its aharya abhinaya relates to costumes and make-up. I incorporated these dresses to highlight who we are. I wear bells on my feet as it is rhythmic. Moreover, the dress gives us a unique look which is unlike other groups who perform in jeans and T shirts.The Caesar salad is laid out. It is fresh and light, he remarks. Not very fussy about food, he prefers Southern cuisines like Manglorean and Chettinad. I like rasam, sambar, idli, dosa, bisi bele bath, yengai and puliyodharai. In fact, curd rice can carry me anywhere in the world. What about Andhra food? As it is spicy, I dont eat it regularly but do so when suffering from severe cold. Believe me, one meal and it simply vanishes, he jests.Describing himself a decent cook, the singer reveals he learnt the art during his bachelor days. I would call up my mother in Mysore and ask for recipes and directions. Hit and trial and pots of luck made me learn this art which though similar to singing is much tougher. Elucidating, he explains: Both need ones heart and soul and they have to be done for joy and not for commercial gains. The two help in building lasting human relationships. On our tours, fans invite us to share lunch and dinner with them. Once desperate to have rasam in New York, I posted a request on the Facebook. I instantly received 30 invitations!Surprisingly, Raghu doesnt follow a strict diet. I eat everything vegetarian, including street food, like gol gappe, chaat, dahi bhalle, vada pav and misil pav. Perceiving my surprise, he explains, The throat should get used to everything to make it immune to ill-effects. Now he is speaking like a microbiologist. For the uninitiated, Raghu is a post graduate in Microbiology and worked for years in Belgium before moving to singing. Trying the Andhra quinoa and beetroot, he reveals, I learned Bharatanatyam for 18 years and once wanted to be a professional dancer. It was a challenge by a friend to do something macho like singing and playing guitar instead of dancing that made me turn to music. I learnt to sing 500 Miles Away From Home with a guitar in two weeks flat much to the friends surprise. Then I realised what a beautiful thing it is to play an instrument and sing. I became aware I had a voice and it is nice to sing. Felt like breaking barriers and do whatever I wanted to.Appetising journeyStill stage performances, cutting albums and composing for films like Chef , was a distant dream. Working in Belgium, Raghus landlord asked him to lend his recordings. I gave him a CD of songs I had written and sung in India which he sent to Radio 21 . It was well received and I was flooded by calls and mails asking for more . That set me thinking. If I could impress people who did not understand a word of what I am singing, then things could be better. Ten days later he quit and returned to India. I had been collaborating with my friend Bhaskar and had no band. So I quickly put together one. Named Antragani, we played in front of an audience of 40000. What an experience! relates Raghu.The group was later disbanded and he formed Raghu Dixit Project which cut albums, Raghu Dixit Project and Jag Changa. The project is a novel initiative as it is an open house for people to join to collaborate and continue till they wish to. It is a fluid arrangement and outfit and is working well, he reveals.With filmmakers opting for independent musicians to score for movies, Raghu got his chance. Besides Kannada and Tamil, he composed music for Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge and Bewakoofiyaan . His latest is Saif Ali Khan-starrer Chef for which he composed and also sang songs with Shugal Laga Le becoming quite popular. Initially, director Raja Menon asked me to compose one song which I disagreed as I wanted to compose the entire score. He gave me the script and I produced scratches which he liked immensely. Describing composing for movies challenging, Raghu says, Film music is bound by its storyline, characters and situations unlike independent music. The upshot is you can reach a wider audience. The group also appeared in the film. Calling it fun, he says, Raja asked us to fly to Mumbai to perform Shugal Laga Le. Saif was absolutely cool during shooting and the scenes and song were shot much to Rajas satisfaction.One assumes Chefs popular appeal will ensure more filmy collaborations. Live performances are and will be my first preference, he sums up before rushing for rehearsals."

He jotted this down on November 4, 2002, when he visited the hill station bordering Tamil Nadu and was asked to write a note.Many other visitors had entered their opinions about the tourist place in the diary of Sabu Ramakkalmedu. He has been maintaining the diary, that doubles up as a visitors book, for the past 25 years. Writers such as M. Mukundan, Malayalam actors such as Jagathy Sreekumar, politicians, and noted personalities in other fields are among those who have written in the diary, which is changed every year.It has become a habit, said Sabu. He began the practice when Ramakkalmedu was not known as a tourism spot. When he was as young as six, he used to come to the place daily to graze the cattle his father reared. Till I completed SSLC, I had to do this work every day after school. It was our only income source, he said. While on the job, he explored the area, caught glimpses of the vast stretches of Tamil Nadu villages from there, and revelled in its pristine and soothing beauty.After finishing school he wrote to the then District Collector about the beauty of the place. The Collector visited Ramakkalmedu and gave him the idea of keeping a diary of visitors. The district administration immediately took the initiative to develop the tourism potential of Ramakkalmedu.Slowly, visitors started to pour in and he put up a small shop for tea and cool drinks that still functions. After completing pre-degree he secured a job as a forest watcher at Vallakkadavu, near Kumily, while in the first year of graduation. Three years later, he resigned and came back to Ramakkalmedu. He says the deep bond between him and Ramakkalmedu pulled him back. Till 1976, Ramakkalmedu was the main entry point from Tamil Nadu for transport of rice from Cumbom Valley to Kerala.Men carrying sacks of the grain on their heads passed through the area round the clock. It was from here that the grain was transported to other places in the State, Sabu said.Over the years, Ramakkalmedu has lost the relevance as a transit point of rice. It is now known more as a tourism destination, with nearly 4,000 visitors on weekends. Every such thing is entered into his diary, which has become a history log of Ramakkalmedu."
5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

A total of 69 species of butterflies belonging to 54 genera and five families were recorded from the study area. Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

If someone talks critically about Mr. Vijayan or the CPI(M), it could not be deemed as a criticism against the State.The claim that he and the CPI(M) were responsible for all the development in the State itself was baseless. The achievements were the outcome of concerted efforts of social reformers. The CPI(M) got the chance to reap the benefits of the hard work of such reformers.But the State had not developed any further. The onus for the present predicament was on the rival fronts that ruled the State since 1956. The State was still surviving on the returns from the sale of lottery tickets, liquor and NRI returns. Kerala was still relying on other States for all its needs, from vegetables to rice and other commodities, he said. He welcomed Mr. Vijayans initiatives to make the State an investor-friendly destination."

We will provide all necessary help to SKDRDP and assist it in its work to reach government welfare schemes to more people, he said.Lauding the achievement of 99 % in repayment of loans to central banks by SHGs through SKDRDP, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that such a good loan recovery rate can only be seen in SHGs. He said that a similar feat has been achieved by women SHGs formed by the government. Such a good recovery rate from SHGs has made him announce interest free loans up to Rs. 3 lakh to SHGs formed by the government. These SHGSs were paying 4 per cent interest for this amount earlier, he said. To realise the dream of achieving a hunger free State, the State government will set up 500 Indira canteens in all the district and taluk centres by January. Like in Bengaluru, these canteens will provide breakfast at Rs. 5 and lunch at Rs. 10. One such Indira canteen will come up in Belthangady. The State government was giving seven kg rice free to each of the four crore below poverty line card holders with an expenditure of Rs. 4 crore.Though the State has seen severe drought for the last two years, there is not a single death resulting from hunger, he said.The government was also working on bringing transformation in health and education sectors too. On November 15, the State government will launch a universal health scheme under which every citizen will get free treatment at government and empanelled private hospitals. The government was taking care of the health of 10 lakh lactating and pregnant women through the Matru Poorna scheme and providing milk to one crore children across the State.Expressing happiness over the recent spell of rainfall across the State, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that this has brought smiles on the faces of farmers in the State where a majority of agriculture land is rain-fed. The bountiful rain in the last few days across the State will help farmers in getting a good yield for the Rabi season. The rainfall has helped fill 1.6 lakh agricultural ponds built by the State government at a cost of Rs. 100 crore.Earlier, Mr. Siddaramaiah symbolically launched the exercise to transfer to members of self-help groups the dividend earned by SHGs linked to SKDRDP. As many as two lakh SHGs are distributing dividend of Rs. 201 crore. Three beneficiaries of governments agriculture schemes received aid from Dharmadhikari of Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala D. Veerendra Heggade.The Chief Minister felicitated Mr. Veerendra Heggade on completion of 50 years of anointment as Dharmadhikari. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Heggade said that the SKDRDP has been working on women empowerment through SHGs and also helping people make good use of the various government schemes.Ministers B.

Karinjeshwara is located about 44 km from Mangaluru on the BC Road-Dharmasthala highway, where one has to turn right while going from Mangaluru at Vogga to reach Karinjeshwara.While climbing the steps, one first approaches the temple dedicated to Parvathi. This temple can also be reached by road. However, steps are the only means to reach the hill top where the temple dedicated to Shiva is located.From the top as well as while climbing down, one can have a panoramic view of surrounding areas. The hill-top where the Shiva temple is located is very small and cannot accommodate large gatherings.The Shiva temple is said to be more than 10 centuries old and mythology connects the location to the Ramayana as well as the Mahabharatha. The hill is inhabited by a good number of simians and they are revered here. After the Naivedya (food offering) at the Shiva temple, the rice is placed on a special stone platform from where the monkeys feast upon the food.This offering is called the Vanaraanna Seva. It is said that the leader of the simian group, called Karinja Dadda, takes the first bite.A large natural tank, called Gada Tirtha, at the foothill of Kodyamale said to have been created by the mace of Bheema of the Mahabharatha, is another tourist attraction.

Efforts to sustain and protect organic rice tracts in the region and to enhance production are under way as part of research activities initiated by Kerala Agriculture Universitys Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Pilicode in Kasaragod.As part of the development programme launched in 2000 under the aegis of RARS, four saline-tolerant high-yielding organic varieties named Ezhome - 1, Ezhome - 2, Ezhome - 3, and Ezhome - 4 were released. They are now being cultivated along with traditional varieties such as kuthiru and orkayama. A society of farmers, Malabar Kaipad Farmers Society (MKFS), was formed in 2010 to promote the cultivation of the traditional and new varieties. Though MKFS area of jurisdiction comprises the three districts, its activities are at present confined to Ezhome, Pattuvam, Cherukunnu and Kannapuram panchayats here. Incidentally, they have a large extent of Kaipad fields. Following a State-level workshop for coastal rice farmers here in 2014, the idea of a new agency for Kaipad farming was conceived, said T. Vanaja, professor at RARS and principal investigator and breeder of the kaipad rice variety development project.RARS had already submitted all documents, including draft bylaw, to the government, Dr. Vanaja said, adding that a final discussion on the formation of the agency will be taken by Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunilkumar.The agency is planned as an apex society with the Minister for Agriculture as chairman.The society is expected to co-ordinate efforts to extend and enhance production in kaipad fields with the introduction of the new Ezhome variety along with the traditional ones.The new varieties released by RARS have outperformed the local varieties in the national trial conducted in various other States as party of the All India Co-ordinated Research Programme, said P.R. Suresh, professor and Associate Director of Research at RARS. He added that seeds of the traditional Kaipad rice varieties were deposited at the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR), New Delhi, for preservation under cryogenic storage condition.A major achievement of the Kaipad development programme is the Geographical Indication tag for Kaipad rice in 2014.With Kaipad rice securing entry in the GI register, MKFS is the sole intellectual proprietor of the produce. All rice varieties, including Ezhome, come under the Kaipad rice category."

As per eyewitnesses, around eight Naxalites reached the spot in a motorboat. Two of them got down and shot the victim, killing him on the spot.The assailants then escaped in the same boat to the remote cut-off area of the reservoir.It is suspected that this motorboat may have been the one looted by them on October 16. The boat was carrying rations for the security personnel posted at Kunturpadar in the cut-off area.The recent killing occurred while a weekly haat was being held at Chitrakonda. Mr Pangi was an easy target for the Maoists as he was selling petrol and rice at the ghat. It is suspected that the Maoists accused him of being a police informer.Due to the Maoists threat, around two years back Mr. Pangi along with his family had left his village in the cut-off area and shifted to Chitrakonda. According to Malkangiri Superintendent of Police Jagmohan Meena, around 50 families like that of Mr. Pangi have been rehabilitated at Chitrakonda. We advise them to be cautious. Mr Pangi had also been advised not to sit for long at the spill-way launch ghat, he said.Meanwhile, ration was delivered to the Kunturpadar camp by a Pawan Hans helicopter on Sunday."

However, the BJD is claming credit for the cheaper rice. Now the people have seen through this game of the ruling party.Dubbing the BJD Government as inefficient, Javadekar said the State, despite its immense potential, has failed to witness the desired development in the last 17 years which is a long time.As people are unhappy with the performance of the State Government, they want an answer from the ruling party regarding lack of development during the past several years, he said.Refuting Javadekars allegation, the BJD said the `1 a kg rice was launched in the State before Narendra Modi came to power. The Food Security Act was passed during the UPA Government and the BJP has nothing to do with it.When the economic situation in the country is getting worse day by day, the Union Minster should give a reply to people, BJD leader Subash Singh said.The BJPs posters campaign exposing the claim of the BJD on the cheaper rice scheme is believed to have paid rich dividend to the saffron party in the last panchayat elections.Cong-BJD backlashBhubaneswar: THE ruling BJD and opposition Congress have strongly reacted to the statement of Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar that rice at D1 per kg provided to below poverty line (BPL) beneficiaries in Odisha should be described as Modi rice as Centre contributes D27 per kg while the State provides only D2."

The patient was discharged a few days later and he went back to his residence in Kothakaluva area in Nellore rural limits.Soon, the pain relapsed after he reduced the daily dose of medication and he could not go to work at the rice mill there because of the increasing pain.Accompanied by his wife Janaki, the worker again visited the General Hospital on October 27. This time, the doctors got an X-ray taken which showed the presence of the scissors. The doctors told his wife that Chalapathi must undergo another surgery immediately.Two days ago, the surgeons conducted the operation and took out the scissors. The patients condition became critical following two surgeries conducted within a months time.As the incident came to the surface late, the hospital management began damage control efforts.We have ordered a thorough enquiry.

They grew up in each others homes, sharing their lives and plates of food. The thought of working together didnt cross their minds. That is, until they opened a bottle of gin. Shetty had invited Prabhakar over for lunch and they were having a conversation in kitchen over drinks. At that point we were both on a sabbatical. I said, You know what, we should work together. She said yes and thats how our journey began, shares Prabhakar, with a laugh.The duo began Bengaluru Oota Company (BOC)  a tasting room and catering service offering Gowda and Manglorean food  two years ago. This month, the duo will be doing their first pop-up outside the city, at The Bombay Canteen. We want to introduce people to authentic tastes of Karnataka, featuring dishes made from recipes passed down generations and using traditional methods of cooking, says Prabhakar.Taste testBoth women share a background in the hotel industry. Shettys family  her father, brother and husband  are in the business, while Prabhakar has worked with hotels from a sales and marketing viewpoint. They didnt want to start just another restaurant. We wanted to do regional food and stuff thats very typical to the state but not available in Bengaluru, says Prabhakar. She belongs to the Gowda community whereas Shetty is Manglorean and belongs to the Bunt community. BOCs food is a mix of both cuisines. They decided the concept based on what they were comfortable with  creating something that isnt 24/7, and which incorporates their own food philosophies of minimal wastage and cooking everything fresh.While BOC started off as a catering service, Prabhakar and Shetty soon realised that corporate catering was focused on the cost perspective and not quality. We changed our focus and decided [to cater] for homes and people who appreciate quality. At that time, we found this cosy space about two minutes away from our home, and decided to try a tasting room format, says Prabhakar.Once or twice a week, BOC hosts meals for folks interested in trying out authentic Gowda and Manglorean cuisines. Shetty cooks the Manglorean food and they have a team of women  who trained with Prabhakars mother  for the Gowda dishes. Theyve also recently started hosting pop-ups of home chefs who focus on regional cuisines.In the spirit of keeping things local, both women ensure their families are part of BOC. The recipes come from their mothers, aunts and grandmothers, and go back generations. Both their mothers are unofficial quality controllers and Prabhakars father is tasked with buying the meat. They still do catering by the side. The success of their venture has to do with how many people, especially from the Gowda community, will pass off BOCs cooking as their own.Two communities at onceBOC promises an authentic regional Kannadiga culinary experience. At the Mumbai pop-up, their menu has been created to give an introduction to both cuisines. And just like at BOC, both women are on hand to talk about the food and how it is meant to be eaten. Mangalorean food has influences of its different communities, the Saraswat Brahmins, Bunts and Catholics. Being a coastal region, theres a lot of seafood, spices are roasted whole and ground, and generous amounts of coconut  in oil, milk or simply grated. Theres more to Mangalorean food than just kori roti and gassi, says Shetty.Theres the Pundi Ajadina  steamed rice balls tossed in masalas and coconut; Kane Fry  whole ladyfish coated in a rava batter and fried; and Jeeguje Fry  marinated and fried breadfruit with a nice meaty texture. The Manoli and Cashew Upkari is a light gravy of tendli and cashews cooked with coconut and dried red chillies, and eaten with sannas  unlike the Goan ones, these are not sweet and dont have toddy. The last course before dessert is the Curd Rice (flecked with pomegranate seeds and served cold) paired with the tangy and sweet Pineapple Mensakai.The Gowdas are a farming community and thus landlocked. Their food features vegetables and mutton (from nose to tail), green chillies, garlic and plenty of coriander, in fresh form or seeds. Our curries are more green and brown, says Prabhakar. The highlight of the meal is the Maamsa Saaru  a typical Gowda boneless mutton curry cooked with coriander and whole spices and served with ghee and ragi munde. Theres a particular way of eating the dish  the plates are kept at a slant so that the gravy accumulates at the bottom and pieces of the ragi balls are broken off, dipped in the gravy and then swallowed without chewing. Ragi in this form doesnt have flavour so if you chew it, it coats the mouth. Swallowing it ensures you can taste the flavours of the mutton curry, says Prabhakar. The curry tastes equally good with ghee rice.Dessert is a combination of both cuisines. The Chiroti and Ghasaghase Payasa is essentially a fried flaky Manglorean pastry made with ghee, and the creamy khus khus poppy seed pudding is a Gowda specialty. It just goes to show that our cuisines, just like us, work well together, says Prabhakar.The Bengaluru Oota Company pop-up at The Bombay Canteen, Lower Parel is ongoing until November 15; a la carte for lunch and Yele Oota (banana leaf meal) for dinner; Rs 2,400 plus taxes for vegetarian Yele Oota, Rs 2,800 plus taxes for non-vegetarian Yele Oota for two; a la carte dishes priced between Rs 450 to Rs 750 plus taxes.We want to introduce people to authentic tastes of Karnataka, featuring dishes made from recipes passed down generations and using traditional methods of cookingDivya PrabhakarFounder, Bengaluru Oota Company"

As many as 10 lakh duplicate cards have been removed.Yet, there has been little impact on the quantity of rice being supplied through fair price shops across the State. In September 2016  two months prior to the enforcement of the NFSA  the offtake of rice was 3,19,548 tonnes. Exactly a year later, the figure was more or less the same  3,19,343 tonnes.One explanation that immediately comes from officials of the Civil Supplies Department is the enhancement of entitlements under the NFSA. Even though the Act stipulates the supply of 5 kg per adult per month, a single-member card should get 12 kg, the norm which the State followed prior to the introduction of the law. Also, the original ceiling of 20 kg per card per month has been removed. So, if any card has 10 adults, the entitlement is 50 kg per month. As has been the case since May 2011, rice is being supplied free of cost.Ground realityAnecdotally, however, the assertions of officials are not borne out on the ground. Padma, a resident of Perungudi, for instance, goes to Telephone Nagar in the area to get her monthly entitlements. Despite her family card having five adults, she has never been given 25 kg of rice in the last one year. Initially, I was given 20 kg of rice. For the last six months or so, 15 kg of rice has been given. Of course, 5 kg of wheat is offered. (The department gets 14,000 tonnes of wheat too).Padmas case is not solitary. Sampath of Tindivanam, who has been running a campaign against bogus cards in Villupuram district, says he has not come across anyone telling him about the enhanced entitlements. Zahir Hussain, who runs a consumer protection body in Puliankulam of Coimbatore, says he has been offered only 5 kg of rice every month against the revised quantity of 16 kg. S. Pushpavanam. Secretary of Tiruchi-based Consumer Protection Council, Tamil Nadu, acknowledges that the level of awareness about the revised entitlements in the wake of the NFSA is abysmally poor.Though the officials say they have made efforts to generate awareness on the matter, no data is readily available about the details of family cards getting the revised entitlements.Plugging leakagesThe reduction in the number of beneficiaries coupled with reports of non-implementation of the law on the enhanced entitlements does raise questions regarding the prevalence of leakages in the PDS of the State. Two separate studies including one by the Central government, in the recent years, indicated that the rate of pilferage is of the order of 11% to 12%. The officials also say there has not been any increase in the incidence of rice diversion in view of the NFSA enforcement.A source says the figure is certainly much higher and it is at least 30%. The government would do well if it plugs this leakage effectively, as it has to purchase four lakh tonnes of rice annually over and above the routine allotment and tide over allotment, and spend about Rs. 1,000 crore."

He decided to propagate this variety. Initially, it was on just one cent of land, but later, it was expanded to one hectare. Mr. Kumar has been conserving the Krishna Kamod, a basmati rice variety from Gujarat known for its taste, colour and aroma on one hectare for the past seven years.Last year, he harvested nearly 2,500 kg of this paddy and sold it as seeds to farmers at Rs. 200 a kg, rather than in the open market.While farmers procure the rare rice variety as seed, others buy it as a gift, or keep it in their pooja rooms and offer it to temples, Mr. Kumar said.Fights drought, pestsHe spent Rs. 85,000 as costs and earned Rs. 5 lakh.

To ensure better price for such farmers, a separate market was indeed necessary. As there would be huge demand for organic products, it is necessary for farmers to be transparent and committed.There is also the possibility of farmers deviating from the responsibilities and getting into the routine farming to meet the demand for supply using pesticides and fertilisers. Officials should be thoroughly invigilating and ensure that the organic farm products are only supplied in the market.He urged the farmers to take up organic farming to keep people away from diseases like cancers.District admin supportDeputy Commissioner Priyanka Mary Francis said Savayava Santhe will be held on Sundays. Non-certified materials should not be permitted. The produce would get better price and all marketing facilities will be provided by the district administration. The area would be made an organic hub. Around two tonnes of organic vegetables and fruits were sold out in barely two hours in the first market, she added.The Savayava Santhe had organic vegetables, foodgrains and fruits from Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Chikkamagaluru districts. Six organic farming clusters are established in Udupi district and 632 farmers have been practising organic farming on 655 hectares of land since 2013-14 under the Savayava Bhagya Yojane introduced by state government. The clusters include Hirebettu, Kadur, Kattingeri in Udupi, and Belinje in Karkala and Japti and Yelajith in Kundapur.

Pushpa Raj said here on Monday the Commission was booking cases suo motu in three instances of gross irregularities (brought to light by the media) in the implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and mid-day meal schemes and the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) that involved misappropriation of a few hundred crores of rupees.The biggest scandal of them was the diversion of the PDS rice to foreign countries through the Krishnapatnam and Kakinada ports, he said. Addressing the media along with Director of Civil Supplies G. Ravi Babu, Mr. Raj said the other two major frauds were the procurement of eggs for Anganwadi centres at Rs. 4.65 a piece against the stipulated Rs. 3.50 at a cost of Rs. 110 crore, and supply of substandard eggs under the mid-day meal scheme.These frauds had adverse health outcomes for pregnants and lactating mothers and children apart from causing avoidable financial loss to the government, he said.Mr. Pushpa Raj said the APFC enjoyed quasi-judicial powers equal to that of a civil court and it was striving for convergence with the activities of the State Consumer Affairs, Food and Civil Supplies Department as food was a Concurrent List subject.He said the Food Commissions had been tasked with the implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013 whereas the States own food-related departments were mandated to make the stakeholders comply with the respective Food Safety Acts.Asked what was being done to check adulteration of food, Mr. Pushpa Raj said it was the domain of the State departments concerned as the Food Commissions were supposed to ensure the people were not deprived of their Constitutional right to food.However, the A.P. Food Commission was cracking down on the adulteration which, he said, was thriving in Vijayawada and Guntur."

There are hundreds of units that produce veneer, plywood, and block boards, located mainly at Vengola, Rayamangalam, Vazhakulam and Asamannoor panchayats and in Perumbavoor municipality. Except quality control, most skilled and unskilled work is carried out by migrant workers, notes the study conducted by the Centre for Migration and Inclusive Development (CMID) with support from Thummarukudy Foundation.Skilled workersEngaged informally at the units are workers from Odisha, West Bengal, and Assam, while the skilled workforce mostly comprises workers from Assam.The monograph on migrant workers in the district, jointly written by Benoy Peter and Vishnu Narendran of CMID, records their presence in the construction industry; hospitality sector; furniture industry that is thriving at Nellikuzhi where eminent craftsmen from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh known for their wood carving skills function; textile and apparel units around Kizhakkambalam; cement factories on Willingdon island; fishing industry at Thoppumpady, Munambam, and Vypeen; rice mills at Kalady, and other industries at Airapuram, Angamaly, South Vazhakkulam, Edathala, Edayar, Binanipuram, Nellad, and Kalamassery.They are also engaged as housekeeping staff in luxury hotels (the only exception being men and women from the northeast manning lobbies of hotels), fuel stations, restaurants, malls, and hospitals.Work at quarriesSeveral workers from Odisha and West Bengal have been engaged as gardeners. Quarries spread along the district also have migrant labour.The study has identified Nagaon-Ernakulam and Mushidabad-Ernakulam as the two arterial, and the longest, migrant corridors that have emerged in India in the past two decades.It also throws light on the education facilities available for wards of migrant labourers in the district."
5a14e5419855b76bf13e8da4,Setting a different tune to begging,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/setting-a-different-tune-to-begging/article19909038.ece,2017-10-24,"Every morning, Maruti Ganachari and his father Channappa go around the streets of Belagavi singing Dasara Pada and Marathi Abhangas, seeking alms. The harmonium and tabla are their accompaniments.While Channappas style is distinctly folk, Marutis is a cultivated voice typical of a classical singer. If you delve further, you will learn that Maruti holds a certificate in classical singing from the famous Veereshwara Punyashrama Music School at Gadag, where he also learnt to play the tabla and harmonium.But this does not seem to have changed his fortunes. Maruti belongs to the Bahurupi family, who are traditional artistes who dress up as characters from mythology and perform in villages during Dasara, Deepavali, harvest season, and so on. But the once-respected community finds no place in todays world..Though a career in music was his dream, Maruti was forced to join his father in beggary. I could not afford to pay fees for a guru. I had to start working to support my family, says Maruti, who occasionally gets invited to sing in temples and at Ganesh mandals. But, unlike established singers, we never get paid much, he adds.Maruti also says that he lacks networking skills. In most of the musical events, the artistes are chosen on recommendations by fellow musicians. They tend to recommend their friends and acquaintances. As we dont move around those circles much, we dont get recommended often, he says.The Ganacharis belong to Telugu-speaking families from a backward community hailing from Lakshmeshwar village in Gadag district. In Belagavi, the family of six lives in a tent in a public park in Shahapur. They all go around the localities singing every morning.The State government has not been of much help to the Ganacharis either. Kannada and culture officials have sponsored only one of our programmes till now, says Channappa who is in his late 50s. They say I will not get any pension or financial assistance till I turn 65. He has no documents as he never went to school. He does not have a below poverty line ration card as he does not have a stable address. However, the family members have got Aadhaar during a recent drive by the Belagavi city corporation.Of my six sons, three learnt to sing. The others began selling fruits and plastic covers for bikes. Now they have moved to the big cities, while we put up tents in Belagavi, says Channappa. Though illiterate, Channappa has learnt to sing in Kannada, Marathi, Telugu, and Hindi.Every winter, all the members of the family shift to their native village to take part in dance dramas. Farmers will be free as the sowing season has ended. We go around 11 villages. Some pay money to Bahurupis, while others give away rice and wheat. We go back to begging by the end of January, Channappa says."

The two projects that the university completed last month are being tailored into training modules for small farmers and dairy farmers.Scientists T. Thirumalesh and Ramachandra Sangam and research scholar S. Jayashankar used residue from various dry land and irrigated crops and proved that they could be turned into fodder.Dried roughage is cleaned and cut or powdered. It is then mixed with urea dissolved in water in the ratio of 1:10. The mixture is packed and kept in an air-tight enclosure for three weeks. This breaks down bonds in the crop residue and makes nitrogen available. The animals digestive tract converts the mixture into protein and other nutritious material.A farmer with one acre of land can feed up to three large animals or six small animals.Crops like sugarcane, banana, rice or maize on one acre each yield enough crop residue to feed two or three large animals or six or eight small animals for a year. With minimal cost of processing, the farmers can save money on fodder or nutrition inputs, Dr. Thirumalesh said. Once the processed fodder is taken out after three weeks, it can be kept for months and fed in small portions daily.Though we started with crops like sugarcane, banana, rice and maize, we have realised that residue of most crops can be treated this way, he said. The research team has also achieved success with cellulose containing material like wood shavings.Training has already started in Bidar and Shivamogga. The other five colleges of the university and 10 information centres are gearing up to train farmers, S.M. Shivaprakasha, director of extension of the varisty, said.Developing new methods by research is easier than making farmers adopt those methods, says Ramachandra Sangam, head of the department of nutrition in the university.The research project was completed in two years.We have been telling farmers not to burn stubble and crop residue. Experiments by us and agriculture scientists have demonstrated that 100% of the crop residue can be reused for fodder or for mulching, he said."
