In the past several years, those farmers who do not have access to sub-surface water had to leave the land fallow during the kuruvai season due to water scarcity.The TNAU was seized of the issues confronting delta farmers before coming up with maize and pulses as suitable alternatives to paddy in the kuruvai season. The ideas were put to field test by introducing hybrid maize as alternative crop to paddy on 300 acres equally distributed in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts.A total of 167 farmers came forward to undertake the pilot project under the TNIAMP.World Bank fundingThe World Bank provided Rs. 86 crore to the TNAU with an objective to promote climate resilient and market-led agriculture in 66 sub basins of Tamil Nadu and maize was selected for the Cauvery delta region.Maize is adaptable to growing environment, is less water consuming and relatively not affected by pest and disease besides fetching a handsome return for the grower. The TNAU took up the initiative to raise maize as an alternative to kuruvai paddy in the Cauvery delta. Private companies supplied hybrid maize to farmers, the TNAU imparted technical guidance while the Broiler Coordination Committee, Palladam, assured market for the cultivated maize, explained B. J. Pandian, Director, Water Technology Centre and Nodal Officer, TNIAMP.It is planned to demonstrate maize as an alternative to kuruvai paddy on a larger scale and it is also part of implementing water saving technologies, over the next six years, for which the World Bank has allotted Rs. 10 crore to the Tamil Nadu Rice Research Institute, Aduthurai, its director V. Ravi said.While farmers in Thanjavur district waited for the hybrid maize to mature and supplied the produce to poultry units, those in Manalmedu region of Nagapattinam district harvested the fresh green cobs and sold them, in just three quarters of the normal cultivation period."

They are unable to draw rice at FPS in Karimnagar.A 90-year-old woman Sharada Bai, with the help of neighbours, came to an FPS in Kattarampur in Karimnagar on Friday to get rice under Anthyodaya scheme. The FPS dealer took her thumb impression many times but failed. The dealer Satyanarayana told her thumb lines have weakened.For over an hour, she sat in front of the shop. The dealer said that before e-POS system, he used to distribute 35 kg rice at her door step as she was unable to come to the FPS. Not only Sharada Bai but other elderly people are also finding it difficult to draw rice at the FPS and are requesting government to think of an alternative.Ch Narsimha Rao, Village Revenue Officer (VRO), said that such problems are arising at some places and the department is thinking of alternative methods. The department will give access (thumb impression) to one of the staff and the person concerned can come on a particular date to draw food on behalf of elders, he said. The respective dealer should take responsibility to bring the elderly to the FPS, he added."

With growing instances of irregularities by fair price shop dealers, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, at a review on civil supplies department here on Saturday enquired about implementing the direct benefit transfer scheme (DBT) in the public distribution system.The state government is spending `6,500 crore for distribution of subsidised rice and other essential items to the poor through PDS. There have been complaints of diversion of PDS rice and hoarding of the rice illegally. The fair price shop dealers too are frequently threatening to go on strike. To put an end to these problems, the state government is examining implementing the DBT system instead of providing rice through fair price shops.The officials informed Rao that DBT is being implemented in various Union Territories like Chandigarh, Puducherry, Dadra Haveli where the authorities are depositing money directly into the accounts of beneficaries instead of supplying the essential commodities. In 2013, the then UPA government had brought in Food Security Act 20/2013 which also suggested the money transfer as subsidy to the beneficiaries. It also explained how it would be beneficial to transfer the money instead of distributing the essential commodities.The officials said at present rice was being supplied at a fixed time. Instead, if the money is transferred to the beneficiaries, they can buy whatever commodity they need at their convenience. Responding to this, the chief minister asked the officials to study the feasibility of the DBT scheme. Meanwhile, officials said they were making alternative arrangements against the strike notice given by the dealers."

He said it would create scarcity of essential commodities for the poor and middle class and affect food security.Speaking to mediapersons in the city, Madhu said the latest proposal was part of the big plan of Modi-Chandrababu Naidu combine to hand over the Public Distribution System to corporates.The government is planning to convert fair price shops into village malls. They will be controlled by big corporates like Reliance and Future Group which has a stake in Chandrababu Naidus family business -- Heritage, he said.The government proposes to transfer `25 into the account of the beneficiary so that they can purchase what they like from the village malls. Everyone is aware as to what is the price of rice in the open market. `25 is not sufficient to purchase even one kg of rice in the open market. The suggestion of the government to ration card holders is ridiculous, he said. In protest against the nefarious intentions of the TDP government to corporatise the PDS, the CPM will take up agitations across the State from November 1 to 10, he said."

Of those, 188 are Indira Kranti Scheme (IKP) centres and 200 are primary cooperative societies. Officials estimate that about five lakh metric tonnes of paddy could arrive at all these purchasing centres. To ensure farmers do not face logistical issues, purchase centres are being set up at convenient spots, said officials. This is based on the difficulties reported by farmers last year in transporting their produce to purchase centres.Authorities have increased purchase centres in Sangareddy district to 86 from 50 last year. Of these, 55 are IKP centres run by women and remaining 31 are cooperative societies. Sangareddy Joint Collector Vasam Venkateshwarlu assured that the government would arrange vehicles to transport produce to avoid hassles for farmers. He said the quantity of produce could be less compared to last Rabi season. In the Khariff season, he said, most farmers store some of the paddy for personal consumption. I appeal to the farmers not to worry as all the paddy brought to the centres will be purchased. Paddy arrived at the centres will be immediately sent to concerned rice mills, the official said.Medak district Civil Supplies manager V Ramulu said they will set up a total of 203 purchasing centres in the Medak district. 40,000 acres in the district have been utilised for paddy crop, he said. We are expecting a production of 1,60,000 metric tonnes in the district, Ramulu said.Siddipet district Civil Supplies manager R Ravinder said they would establish 99 paddy purchase centres in the district. Of those, 56 are IKP centres and 43 are primary cooperative societies. He said they are expecting good yield from Shanigaram project, Koheda, Usnabad, Dubbak and other areas of the district. Minimum support price will be `1,590 for A-grade paddy and `1,550 for B grade.Provide bonus for paddy cropsBJP Mahila Morcha state vice president and former Zilla Parishad Chairman C Sushini Reddy accused Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao for not keeping his promise of paying Rs 1,000 bonus per quintal to farmers on all crops.Speaking to media persons at her residence on Saturday, she said the chief minister had failed to come to the rescue of farmers who were struggling to get minimum support price for their produces. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh government is providing bonus on paddy. The TS government should also provide similar bonus to our farmers, she said."
5a14ffb09855b76bf13e9c26,Mumbai's love of dogs is no stray feeling,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/637236/mumbais-love-dogs-no-stray.html,2017-10-10,"Mumbai's love of dogs is no stray feelingBy Jeffrey Gettleman, International New York Times Oct 10 2017, 23:56 ISTIndia has some of the most pro-dog laws on the planet. It is illegal here to kill healthy strays, and the result is millions of themcanine haven: A woman with some of the 10 stray dogs she cares for in her small home in the Colaba, Mumbai. India, whose Constitution says that every citizen should ""have compassion for living creatures,"" has a long tradition of caring for strays, or 'community dogs.' NYTMumbai turns out to be a pretty good place to be a dog. The poorest people living on the streets barely have enough food themselves, but they feed strays. And the rich, well, some go completely overboard.One Bollywood actress provides steaming vessels of chicken and rice every morning for dozens of neighbourhood dogs. Another woman drives around in a specially outfitted Honda delivering meals to more than 100, sprinkling in special spices depending on the season. (Turmeric is good during the monsoons, she says, to help boost the dogs immunity.)India has some of the most pro-dog laws on the planet. It is illegal here to kill healthy strays, and the result is millions of them  perhaps as many as 30 million across the country.Packs of dogs trot through the parks, hang around restaurants for scraps (which they usually get), and sprawl on their bellies inside railway stations as rushing commuters leap over them.That is not necessarily a good thing. It is no coincidence that India also leads the world in deadly rabies cases. In Kerala, vigilantes saw strays as such a threat that they began methodically hunting dogs down until last November, when the Supreme Court ordered them to stop.More typically, though, the dogs are widely cared for. Some people will not even call them strays, preferring the more respectful label of community dogs.And within India, Mumbai is considered something of a sanctuary city for them. But that reputation briefly hit a bump a few weeks ago, after some dogs took a dip in a Mumbai river and came out blue.Photos of the Blue Dogs of Mumbai went viral, and initial news reports speculated that the dogs fur had changed because of some weird pollution effects.Upon close investigation, it turned out that a dye company had released products into a drainage ditch that flowed into a Mumbai river where the dogs liked to play.Colouring for clothing had stained the dogs fur, and the monsoon rains soon blasted it off. What was interesting  and moving  was the community efforts to rally around the blue dogs and help them.India is pretty unique, said Ingrid Newkirk, the British-American co-founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who grew up in India.Maybe its a karmic sense, this idea that the dog could be you, and if you dont watch out in life it could be you again.Or, she wondered, maybe its just that the poor have greater compassion because they can relate to other individuals who are having a hard time trying to survive.The neighbourhood where this happened, Taloja in central Mumbai, is heavily industrialised. Trucks carrying rolls of steel rumble down the roads. Big plants grow out of the sidewalk. Factories stretch to the horizon and smokestacks spew out who-knows-what, leaving a rotten-egg taste in the air.As Dilip Bhoir, a contractor here, put it, No matter how expensive the perfume you wear, youll never be able to get rid of that stink.Still, Taloja is teeming with canines, and the line between a stray and a pet is blurry. Factory workers and villagers feed certain dogs and even buy shampoo to wash them. But the dogs do not live inside homes and are free to roam around.Most of Indias street dogs are about two feet tall, short-haired, curly-tailed, trim but not scrawny, and descended from an ancient breed related to the Australian dingo.After some factory workers spotted a pack of dogs that were bright blue, Taloja sprang into action. Workers called a neighbourhood human rights activist who then called a neighbourhood animal rights advocate who then called a nearby animal hospital. An ambulance was rushed to the scene.A few days later, in another incident near a factory, villagers waded into a ditch coursing with nitric acid and rescued a dog that was trapped.Niharika Kishan Gandhi, the wealthy woman who feeds 100 dogs from the back of her Honda in suburban Mumbai, took a stab at answering the question of why Indians, in general, seem especially friendly to animals.It comes down to tolerance, she said. Weve lived under Moghul rule, under British rule. Its crowded here, its diverse, and to survive, you need to be tolerant. She added, The more tolerant you are, the more compassion you have.In Mumbai, a dozen robust charities, including one called The Welfare of Stray Dogs, cruise around the city, treating sick dogs and taking healthy ones to animal hospitals for vaccinations and sterilisations before depositing them back exactly where they were found, as the law requires. (It is illegal here to displace a dog.)Compassion for animalsIndias government has made a decision not to kill strays but to reduce the population gradually through sterilisations. The result in Mumbai, animal welfare experts say, is a virtuous cycle.Sterilised dogs, which do not have puppies or prowl around for mates, tend to be more relaxed, which makes people less fearful of them, which makes the dogs friendlier, which makes people even more accepting of them.Respect for animals is enshrined in Indias constitution, which says that every Indian should have compassion for living creatures. Few places are as emblematic of this as the animal hospital in Thane where the Taloja residents took the acid dog and the one blue dog they were able to catch.On a recent day, the hospitals patients included: 37 dogs, eight cats, six soft-shell turtles, two ducks, two rabbits and a cattle egret with a broken wing.A commotion erupted when a group of burly men burst through the door, moving through the hospital corridors as one, huddled around a small brown object: a monkey electrocuted while climbing a power line. The vets set to it, calling out for IVs, scissors, medicine and tape.For the blue dog, all the vitals were checked. After five days of observation, he (the dog was a male, about eight years old) was discharged in good health.The acid dog did not have such good luck. The hospital named him Babu, and he is now basically blind. The other day, Babu did not look so good. He stood on shaky legs inside a cage, a thick worm of red and green mucus hanging out of his nose.Dont worry, said Madhavi Irani, one of the caretakers, nonchalantly wiping the dogs nose with her fingers. Babu just has a little cold."

The temple trust board committee members on Tuesday convened a meeting at Madapati Guest House to discuss the various development projects being executed and reviewed the arrangements to be taken for the smooth conduct of Bhavani Deeksha at the temple premises from October 30 to December 14.It may be recalled that in December 2014, the devasthanam reduced the weight of the laddu from 100 gram to 80 gram but charged the same price (`10). At that time, the temple authorities faced severe criticism from the devotees. However, they did not revise the price and continued the same till date. In the recent meeting, the trust board committee members agreed to increase the price of laddu, Sri Chakra laddu, tonsuring, parking on the Ghat Road. Chakra Pougali Prasadam, made with rice and dry fruits, will be introduced again this year. 150 gms of the prasadam will cost one `20.Temple Executive Officer A Surya Kumari said steep increase in essential commodities has forced the devasthanam to increase the price of laddu prasadam. Directions have been given to the cooking staff to improve the quality of the laddu. The content of dry fruits like badam and cashew nut will be increased in each laddu after the price revision. The EO also said that the devasthanam is also developing the ghat road and the surroundings keeping in view the increase in footfall over the years.The existing ghat road is being recarpeted and parking slots will be made available for the devotees, she said. She further added that elderly devotees and physically challenged can make use of the power lift facility free of cost available at the Mallikharjuna Maha Mandapam.Focus is also being laid to tap on ways to augment revenue for the temples adopted by the devasthanam by conducting special rituals like Satyanarayana Swamy Vratham and other sevas, said Surya Kumari. Temple trust board committee chairman Y Gouranga Babu and other members also present at the news conference. The temple is focussing on providing accomodation to the pilgrims at C V Reddy Charity free of cost. A nominal charge would be collected from devotees availing air-conditioned rooms.Dasara presentThe temple has given a bonus of J5000 to its 600 employees for the services rendered during Dasara. Previously, the bonus was J3,000"

Thank heavens. Not that I have anything against khichdi. Indeed, its my dish of choice on rainy days, accompanied by deep-fried pakoras, papads and prawn pickle. But khichdi as national dish? Thats like saying drab is my favourite colour.My objection is to foisting one national dish on a country that displays such culinary diversity. (For that matter, I believe its difficult to impose anything by diktat in a temperamentally-anarchic society like ours.) As food historian Pushpesh Pant says, its a sad, bad idea to nationalise cultural heritage. People should have a sense of ownership, unprompted.Thats what legacy is all about. Two, I love my greens but dont see why our national dish should be vegetarian. Which is why I hugely enjoyed all the sarcy memes and jokes that were sparked by the reports of the chawal-dal mix being singled out for national honour, and was just gearing up for a candle march to Jantar Mantar in protest when Union Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur clarified that khichdi was just being celebrated as a dish that represents Brand India; nothing more, nothing less.Now that a few days have passed since the outrage and I know we dont need to click our heels and salute every time khichdi turns up at the table, I think the minister and celebrity Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who cooked over 800 kg of the stuff in a 1,000-litre capacity kadhai at the World Food India event in the capital on Saturday, to symbolise Indias great culture of unity in diversity at its best, may be onto something. Because after much mulling over our regional cuisines, the humble khichdi does seem to be the only dish that finds expression in kitchens across the country.Sweet, salty, spicy, vegetarian, non-vegetarian, we have khichdis in all flavours. Theres pongal in Tamil Nadu and bisi bele bhath in Karnataka. Hyderabad has the spice-laden keeme ki khichdi. In addition to the watery gruel cooked for patients, Uttar Pradesh has the amla khichdi that must be had on Makar Sankranti; Bengal the ghee-soaked khichuri packed with cauliflower and peas, and Odisha the yummy mix thats served as bhog to one lakh pilgrims a day at Puris Jagannath Mandir.In the West, Maharashtra has the sabudana khichdi and Gujarat the sola khichdi with vegetables, cream andwait for itmincemeat. Like other signature Indian dishes like the samosa, biryani and halwa, the khichdi too evolves, triggered by regional and seasonal imperatives like availability of produce and local palate, explains Pant.Not just geography, the dish works across history and religions as well. Historians mention Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya dipping their fingers in it while Moroccan traveler Ibn Batuta talks about having kishri, containing rice and beans, during his travels in India around 1350. Later books have Aurangzeb chomping on Alamgiri khichdi, containing fish and boiled eggs, while Wajid Ali Shahs favourite is said to have been a rich khichdi packed with almond slivers and pistachio. I wonder which version Minister Kaur likes personally.Shampa Dhar-Kamathshampa@newindianexpress.com"

Already, the millers have conveyed to Supplyco, which has been entrusted with paddy procurement, they will not be able to comply with this requirement due to the existing climatic conditions.As per the quality standards, the moisture content of paddy should not exceed 17 per cent. But in Kerala, our paddy fields are situated below the main sea level (MSL).Hence, the moisture content of the paddy cultivated here will be between 20-25, with this reaching upto 28 per cent in some cases. Through processing, we need to bring it down to 14 per cent, which will result in the quantity of output, said George Mathai, assistant manager, paddy procurement, Supplyco.The Centre has made it mandatory the outturn after processing one quintal of paddy should be 68 kg.It is not an issue for the other rice-producing states as they are not cultivating the crop on wetlands. Here in Kerala, the rice mill owners are only able to come up with a maximum outturn of 64 kg by processing one quintal of paddy. The Supplyco cannot procure the processed rice back on this outturn ratio as it is against the rules. It cannot also suffer the loss of 4 kg per per 100 kg of paddy processed.This is why we have recommended the government approach the Centre for relaxation of the existing clause, he said. Supplyco chairman and managing director A P M Muhammed Haneesh said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had promised to take up with the Centre any issue linked with paddy processing. We are awaiting a favourable decision from the Centre, Mathai said.Last year, the Supplyco had procured 4.52 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers across the state, with Rs 1,018 crore being paid to 1,60,000 peasants. So if the mill owners decide to procure rice from outside Kerala, the procurement and supply chain will also get affected. Supplyco will have to get more rice from the other states if the millers refuse to process the paddy.The number of rice mill owners, who process paddy for Supplyco has come down to 52 from 75 in 2016. This year, it has again come down to 45, said Mathai."

Express takes you aboard a KSWTD boat for a two-and-ahalf- hour ride through the backwaters on the Kottayam- Alappuzha stretch at a throwaway price. Rub shoulders with commuters and globe trotters and soak in the countryside vistas as the vessel chugs past islands, paddy fields and moveable bridgesEver heard of any form of entertainment lasting two-and-a-half hours and costing less than onethird of a dollar? Believe it or not, it can happen only in Incredible India. You can enjoy an enchanting journey through the ravishing backwaters of Kerala at a throwaway price of just Rs 18 a ticket. The 33-km-long dream ride on the Kottayam-Alappuzha stretch is operated by the Kerala State Water Transport Department (KSWTD). As they say, appearances can be deceptive. Travellers may tend to be put off by the sight of the boat as there are no fancy trappings or luxury facilities save for a TV screen inside. The wooden seats with their rough coir-stuffed upholstery can be a tad annoying.But, do not get upset as a warm reception from the crew awaits visitors. For the 11.30 am trip from Kodimatha in Kottayam on a week day, most of the seats are occupied. It is a mixed crowd: Tourists, both local and foreign, as well as commuters from the islands dotting the waterscape who depend on the boat to reach the mainland. As the vessel chugs through the meandering channels, visitors can unwind and soak in the picturesque settings and get a feel of the life in the countryside. It is a very slow ride, as it stops at more than 40 places before reaching Alappuzha, boat driver M S Rajeev said.The Kottayam-Alappuzha boat service is getting agood responseThis has a maximum speed of 10 nautical miles. But we are not in a position to clock that as we have to stop and pick up all the passengers, even if there are only one or two, as they do not have any other mode of transportation. So, it takes more than two hours to reach Alappuzha. It takes 30 minutes to reach Kanjiram, which is two-and-a-half km away from Kodimatha (by water).Thats because the boat stops frequently to pick up people on both sides of a narrow canal. However, the lush green vegetation and its shade make up for the slow speed. On this stretch, there are five bridges which can be lifted - four of them manually and one mechanically - to allow the boat to pass through. The Kottayam-Alappuzha boat service was disrupted for five years after the work on a bridge commenced at Kanjiram, said Rajeev.So, the services from Alappuzha ended at Kanjiram. Now, there is a night service from Alappuzha which concludes at Kanjiram due to the inability to lift the bridges at night. The boat which reaches at 9.15 pm will make a return trip at 5.15 am. For most of the travellers, the lifting of the bridges is a not-tomiss spectacle and a novelty. Though we travel a lot, this is our first trip by boat, said travel enthusiasts George Mekkalloor of Kanjirappally and Anish Shyam of Erumely, who make most of their trips on motorbikes. We wanted to experience this when we learned about it. We reached the jetty with the help of Google Map. This is an entirely new experience.After reaching Alappuzha, they plan to head for the beach, a distance which can be covered by bus. For many like Vasumathy of Daivatinte Moola, a stop on the route, there are no other means other than the boat service to reach Kottayam. In her late 70s, she travels to Kottayam, where her children reside, to buy essentials. Though the children invited her to stay with them, she is not in a mood to leave behind her poultry and cattle. So, she stays alone in a small house in this remote place. She is happy with the place where she lived with her husband, said Kuriakose, one of the two lascars in the boat, as an elderly woman stepped out at one of the jetties.Valerie Kattenfeld, Austrian authorThere are stops even for a family or a single person, like Kamalamma of Pathinalayiram, he added while the boat passed through vast stretches of Marthandam, Chithira and Rani paddy fields which earned the Kuttanadu region in Alappuzha the sobriquet of the states rice bowl. It would take only 80 to 90 minutes to connect these towns which are 49 km apart by road. There are two main roads and it would cost between Rs 45 and Rs 60 in the state-operated buses.However, the stress-free travel and enticing scenic ride skimming through the backwaters are twin advantages coupled with the cheap rate. There is a considerable increase in the number of passengers and collection after the service resumed from Kottayam. For example, till October 4, when the service stopped at Kanjiram, the daily collection was below Rs 3,000 with nearly 800 passengers. Now, it has increased to Rs 13,000, said Najeeb, the Station Master at Kodimatha.However, there are some complaints about the timings of the service. At present, there is a gap of nearly four hours between the first and second trips from Kottayam. It would have been better had there been a service during the office hours or in this gap. Also, a facility to take passengers in a limited stop boat on holidays would also help to meet the big rush, said an officer.Kottayam-Alappuzha boat service timingsThree boats operate on this stretch. There are five services from Kottayam, each with a return trip. The boat leaves Kodimatha jetty at 6.45 am, 11.30 am, 1 pm, 3.30pm and 5.15 pm. The boat services from Alappuzha are at 7.30 am, 9.30 am, 11.30 am, 2.30 pm and 5.15 pm. The final service, beginning at 8 pm, halts at Kanjiram at 9.15 pm. The service resumes from Kanjiram at 5.15 am with a trip to Alappuzha.Moveable attractionsThere are five bridges whose spans can be lifted for boats to pass using a pulley and cables. Theyare situated at Cherikkathara, Pathinaril Chira, Parechal, Kanjiram and Chungathu Muppathu.While Chungathu Muppathu is a mechanised bridge, the rest are lifted manually by daily wage labourers arranged by the Kottayam Municipality. The bridges were made of wood initially and later they were replaced by steel structures. However, SWTD officers say these bridges are unacceptable under the national waterway norms. They say houseboats too could have reached Kodimatha had there beenno such bridges"

There are cases of adulteration every month and inaction of food safety officials is failing to put a check on this.In the earlier days, the adulteration menace was limited to rice and milk. But with adulterators becoming even more active, things have taken a drastic turn  resulting in adulteration of spices, ghee, essential daily commodities like cereals, chilli powder, vegetables, fruits, sweets and confectionery, tea powder and last but not the least, salt.These adulterers are focusing on lower class sections and marketing their products in the localities to make huge profits in less time. The recent raids on one such manufacturing unit in Satyanaranapuram on September 23 revealed shocking facts where the accused makes a profit of `10 lakh per month by selling adulterated ghee in small sachets. Not only ghee, the cops found that adulterated shampoos, mouth fresheners and spices were being sold under reputed brand names such as Bharati, Gayathri and Siri.The technique they used for making huge profits is that instead of selling huge quantities, they have been selling these items by dividing them into small quantities.Manufacturers will not get much profits if they sell any item in bulk as the poor people do not purchase daily commodities in huge quantities. To attract the poor, adulterers are packing products in 50 gm and 100 gm sachets, said N Purnachandra Rao, regional officer of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Explaining the operations being conducted to crack down on the adulteration racket, Rao said his department has collaborated with the task force and vigilance department to curb the menace from its roots by doing surgical strikes on the guilty. As a part of the operation, we are checking licenses of all manufacturing units and will cancel if they found to be irregular. Also, people should be careful while purchasing essential commodities from the market, he said.The menaceFSSAI officials conducted as many as 20 raids in Vijayawada from Jan- 2017 to till nowOf this, more than 10 raids were conducted in the surroundings areas of SatyanarayanapuramSpecial care was taken on areas where poor live more and in school zonesWith no checks, adulterated food product sales go unhinderedConsuming the food prepared with adulterated commodities will lead to serious health complications like food poisoning or even cancer"

However, the continuing confusion over whether the local unregistered brands of rice would invite a 5 per cent tax means the full benefits of the price fall has not been passed on to the customers. The price of Bodhana rice variety which was Rs 34 last month has come down to Rs 31.50 a kg, Kuruva from Rs 36 a kg to Rs 33, Ponni from Rs 34 per kg to Rs 31 and Jaya from Rs 37 per kg to Rs 35. We could have slashed the prices more but there is no clarity yet on whether the local unregistered brands will be levied a 5 per cent tax or not.Therefore, the traders have kept a buffer and are charging `2 per kg more from the consumers since if we are asked to pay more at a later date, we will have to do so from our pockets, said a prominent wholesale rice merchant who did not want to be named.As per the sub clause (d) of the GST norms A mark or name in respect of which actionable claim is available shall be deemed to be a registered brand name for the purpose of levying 5 per cent GST. However, the millers and packers in the neighbouring states, who supply rice to wholesale and retail merchants in Kerala, dispatch them under local names like Ravi , We Two etc to denote the quality of rice.The Grain, Rice and Oil Seed Merchants Association has said the 5 per cent GST will not apply if the person concerned (manufacturer, miller or packer) voluntarily forgoes any actionable claim or enforceable right on such brand name subject to the condition he files an affidavit to the effect that a) he is voluntarily foregoing his actionable claim or enforceable right on such brand name with the Jurisdictional Commissioner of Central tax or State Tax. b) prints in indelible ink, both in English and local language on each such unit (bag) that in respect of the brand name printed on the unit he has voluntarily foregone his actionable claim or enforceable right, said Chamber of Commerce district president A Balakrishnan.However, the wholesale rice and retail merchants told Express a large section of the population in Kerala purchase local brands of rice loose after ensuring its quality. Since the merchants are still confused, they continue to charge a nominally higher rate to offset any adverse decision by the GST Council in the future. Otherwise, the price of rice should have come down by at least Rs 3- Rs 5 per kg. We have given a representation to Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and he has promised to take up the issue at the next GST Council Meet scheduled for November 10 which is expected to remove all ambiguities in this regard, said a trader."

Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has taken a decision to this effect at a review meeting at the State Secretariat on Friday.In the first phase, 6,500 fair-price shops would be upgraded into Anna Village Malls. These malls are being set up in collaboration with Reliance and Future Group.Naidu wanted Anna Village Malls to be very attractive and wanted a special logo designed for them.Each village mall would be set up in an area of 200 sq ft. The State would bear 25 per cent of the cost while the dealer would furnish 25 per cent of investment in the form of Mudra loan. These malls would sell products of DWCRA, MEPMA and agricultural products of GCC, which the State government procures from farmers.There would be desi foods too like Bandar Laddu, Kakinada Kaja and Telugu chutneys. The government would allow anyone to sell his products in the Anna Village Mall. White ration cardholders, who have given up their right for rice, would be allowed to purchase food products at Anna Village Malls for the value of the rice they forego.Naidu asked the officials to appoint dealers for 4,599 fair-price shops which had been without dealers for quite some time now."

They were served rice, pulses, and a soyabean-potato curry; policemen provided for Santoshis familys security following threats from villagers. (Express Photo by Ratan Lal)Her hair brushed back, a comb tucked in her bun, Gudiya (26) is at ease this Tuesday afternoon. People from the administration are hovering around her, while six policemen keep a vigil on visitors. Officials from Jaldega block in Jharkhands Simdega district, a Naxal-dominated area, have come to the house in Karimati village to help the family encash a cheque of Rs 50,000 given by the administration to Gudiyas mother, Koyli Devi (45). They escort her to the bank located at Jaldega, where Koyli is told she can withdraw the money next week.Breastfeeding the youngest of her children, a two-and-a-half-year-old boy, half-an-hour later, Koyli talks of all she can buy with the money. Or could have bought for Santoshi. On September 28 night, her 11-year-old daughter died  Koyli says of starvation  seven months after the family stopped getting their rations as their Aadhaar wasnt linked to PDS. Later, the familys name was struck off the ration card list. Santoshi was the third child Koyli lost; the other two died of illness.Read | Santoshi died of starvationApart from the Rs 50,000 cheque and the Rs 15,000-odd in aid given by visiting leaders, Santoshis death has brought the family 75 kg of rice from the government and other benefactors, 20 kg of potatoes, two litres of edible oil, adequate kerosene oil, 10 soap bars, some green vegetables and tomatoes. Koyli is planning to stock up on more vegetables and pulses at the Wednesday haat.Then, once the cheque is encashed, Koyli will make other purchases. Family members are saying I should get a mobile phone. Also, we need things for the house. We will buy a box (suitcase), she says. The family, including Koyli, husband Tatya Naik, daughters Gudiya and Chando Kumari, and son Prakash, lives in a mud house, with mud-baked tiles for roof. The house comprises a large room, with a small area partitioned off as kitchen.The rest of the money she would keep in the bank, Koyli says, as saving  a new luxury for her.Earlier that day, Koyli indulged in another small luxury. When Chando, 8, asked for something to eat, she gave her Rs 10 to buy coconut biscuits. She likes fancy things to eat and was crying, Koyli says, with a faint smile.Santoshi was never fussy about food, the 45-year-old adds. She only kept asking for rice, but there was not a single grain at home.***************Rice for breakfast, rice for lunch, rice for dinner. Thats been Hemanti Kumaris routine all 10 years of her life. She is in Class 5 of Upgraded Primary School, Karimati. Santoshi cleared Class 5 from here too early this year, but never went on to the middle school (Classes 6 to 8), in the nearby Pangur hamlet.A sprightly girl, barely over 3 ft in height in her slippers and school uniform, Hemanti is happy as today has been a special day. In the morning, she made herself two chappatis and boiled some potatoes  that will be her evening snack, a rare fourth meal.Read | After starvation death case: Jharkhand minister scraps top state officials order on Aadhaar-PDS linkHer mother Padma Devi sits next to an earthen chulha, dug in the verandah of their mud house. She has placed twigs as cooking fuel, and from time to time, stirs a potato curry with tomatoes on the chulha.Hemantis father Gurucharan Mahato works as a labourer, taking up odd jobs. Padma cant do much work as both her legs are amputated. They live at her brother Nareshs home, and are grateful they have only two children to raise. Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

That is enough coal to produce nearly 32.5 million tonnes of steel or 4,400 times the metal that was required for the Eiffel Tower and almost 600 times the steel that was required for the Burj Khalifa, the worlds tallest building, in Dubai. But in its efforts to dock and profit from the coal, the Central government-owned port, Goans say, has spread the devils dust onto their homes and roads, putting at risk entire villages and towns.The infrastructure upgradation to facilitate the coal movement has left families clinging onto ancestral properties, traditional fisherman worried about their livelihood, farmers anxious for their fields and ecologists agonising over the impact on the land.

(Express photo: Abhinav Saha) Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi with Senior Assistant Editor Manoj C G at The Indian Express office. (Express photo: Abhinav Saha)MANOJ C G: How is the DMK benefiting from the political developments in the AIADMK?I wouldnt say that the DMK is benefiting. But, obviously, when the ruling party is in disarray, any opposition party will benefit from it. People have lost faith in the AIADMK and the ruling government in Tamil Nadu today. They are sick and tired and are turning towards the DMK.There are no industries, there is no investment coming in. You must have heard about the dengue epidemic, its really bad and nothing has been done to contain it.The DMK has had its differences with Jayalalithaa, her style of administration and governance etc, but I dont think that the people who voted for her deserve this.The entire Cabinet says that it lied about what happened to the former CM  her medical condition, the treatment that was given to her. We were a progressive state. We were doing very well economically, our social indicators were good, people were looking up to Tamil Nadu. But now, it is very sad that Tamil Nadu is grabbing national medias attention for the wrong reasons.MANOJ CG: What about sympathy for Jayalalithaa? Will that not play a role in the next election?Im not saying there is no sympathy. People are angry and they want to know what happened to her. They hold her in high respect and there is a lot of affection. But as far as sympathy is concerned, they are not looking at AIADMK leaders as people who have been loyal to her (Jayalalithaa). That is the truth. EPS (Edappadi Palaniswami, Tamil Nadu CM) has not been loyal to her nor has OPS (O Panneerselvam, Tamil Nadu Deputy CM), and there is a lot of anger against the family that was around her. So, people dont look at them as loyalists, and have no sympathy for them.RAVISH TIWARI: How do you look back at Jayalalithaa and her politics? What is your assessment?She was a very strong leader. She kept the party together after MGR (M G Ramachandran, AIADMK founder) passed away. She had to face a lot of trials. In her own words, It was trial by fire. As a DMK person, of course, I do not approve of her methods of working in politics, like stalling every project the previous government introduced. So, we had our differences, but nobody can deny that she was a very strong mass leader. Also, while you cannot look at a politician after a point as a woman or a man, but we all have to agree that it is much more difficult for a woman to be in politics, and to be at the helm of affairs, and she did that. In that sense, she was an achiever.AMRITH LAL: There has been a lot of talk about how the DMK didnt do enough to take advantage of the crisis in the AIADMK. You had the numbers, you could have pushed for a vote of no-confidence and toppled the government.Everybody is saying that the DMK should have done something. I would really want to know what the DMK should have done? There are anti-defection laws and our working president (M K Stalin) is very clear that we do not want to bring the government down, and come into power in this manner. We do not want to get into horse-trading  buying MLAs and bringing them to our side and then toppling the government. The DMK has taken a clear stand on the matter.COOMI KAPOOR: Do you see space in Tamil Nadu politics for a third party to emerge?I cannot predict what is going to happen in the future. But if there are elections now, I definitely see a DMK government (coming to power).COOMI KAPOOR: What do you make of the role of the Speaker and the governor in the present crisis?Earlier, we had a governor whom we had to share with Maharashtra, and who was hardly there. Every time people wanted to meet him, he was not there and we simply had to wait for the governor to come. That became an excuse to delay a lot of things too. Now, finally, we have a governor and I think there will be a big change in how things function.HARISH DAMODARAN: Is your party averse to doing business with the BJP? Do you see a difference between the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP and the Modi-led BJP?There are a lot of issues that Tamil Nadu has with the present BJP government. But, I think, decisions such as these need to be taken at a higher level in the party. I think now the Opposition has come together nationally. Lets see how that works.Look at what happened recently in Tamil Nadu with regards to NEET (National Eligibility and Entrance Test) A girl lost her life (Dalit girl S Anitha, who fought against implementation of NEET in Tamil Nadu committed suicide in September this year). (It shows) the rigid stand and the refusal of the BJP government to understand Tamil Nadu The incident shocked everyone. A lot of our students lost an opportunity. Tamil Nadu stands for social justice. Such cases go against the core and grain of Tamil politics and Tamil society. How can we compromise with something like that?The way they treat the minorities, weve all seen the lynchings, their stand on food and Hindutva Everything is very different from what it was.LIZ MATHEW: Do you think a party like the BJP can find space in Tamil Nadu politics? And if not, what do you think is blocking the BJP in the state?Tamil Nadu is very clear about certain things  its stand on religion, language, the Tamil identity and social justice. A party that does not accept these cannot find space in the state. Whoever it is. If the AIADMK loses, I dont think they can ever expect to come back to power.SHOBHANA SUBRAMANIAN: How successful do you think Kamal Haasan would be if he were to finally join politics?I really cant say because I dont know what he stands for and what he will bring to the politics of the state. A political party should clearly state how it plans to achieve its goals. They need to have a clear stand on issues  the Cauvery issue, NEET etc. Without knowing these things, it would not be right for me to comment (on Kamal Haasan).RAVISH TIWARI: Why is there political support for prohibition in Tamil Nadu?I understand where your question is coming from but it is a major issue in Tamil Nadu. It is not social drinking we are talking about, we are talking about alcoholism. Just because we have to take care of the interests or entertainment of a small number of people in cities who are social drinkers, we cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening in the state. Alcoholism is rampant. There are so many young people who are addicted and cannot work. There is nothing that they can give to society, because the first thing they do is get up and go to TASMAC (the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation, which sells alcoholic beverages in the state) shops.Families are suffering. It is a very big problem. So, we have to let go of some things to take care of the larger majority that is being affected really badly.MUZAMIL JALEEL: Can Rahul Gandhi lead the Opposition against the BJP in 2019?He is doing well. There is a lot of hope in him and the Congress. He connects with people. When he addressed the public in Tamil Nadu, they were very happy with the issues he raised.LIZ MATHEW: Do you think succession will be an issue in the DMK?The DMK is very clear that (Stalin) is going to take the party forward. There is no issue or confusion there.SHOBHANA SUBRAMANIAN: You said that in Tamil Nadu politics, certain issues matter. However, at the end of it, it all seems to boil down to a contest of freebies  fridge, TV, laptops, cycles etc.There are two ways of looking at everything. You say they are freebies, but they can also be looked at as welfare schemes. You look at giving rice at Re 1 as a freebie but I look at it as a measure to make sure that nobody goes hungry to bed. Cycles are not a part of our schemes, Jayalalithaa introduced them, but I will talk about that as well. In villages, when you finish Class 5 or 6, then a high school isnt close by. You have to travel and the buses are not that frequent. For a girl, it is very important to find transport to reach school or else she will be stopped from attending classes. So every scheme serves a purpose, it is important. They are not just freebies.And it happens not just during the elections. These are poll promises which are then executed. When the DMK promised rice for Re 1, we delivered it. We didnt forget about it after the elections.Our farmers have been protesting here (in New Delhi) for months. They want to meet the Prime Minister. Nobody is talking about them. Our leader Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi) waived off farmers loans, which helped agriculture. Today, look what is happening to agriculture and farmers all over the country. How many suicides are we talking about? So everything is not an election freebie. There are things which people need.When the DMK government was in power, our CM Kalaignar announced a scheme which promised a girl educated up to Class 8  now it is Class 10  Rs 25,000 for her wedding when shes 18. Many people asked us why put the Class 8 condition, why not just give it to any girl. The reason was that at least families will ensure that the girl child is educated up to Class 8 because they are getting Rs 25,000 for it.SHAILAJA BAJPAI: You said that women find it very difficult to grow in politics. Can you share your own experience with us? Also, what do you think of dynasty politics?I cannot say that I faced many hurdles. I come from a political background and I grew up with people from the field around me. I cant say that they treated me badly. But when you are a woman, in any field, you have to be twice or thrice as good as the man next to you to be treated equally. Thats the case in politics also. You can make an argument, but when the man makes the same point, its heard more seriously, keenly and more attentively. Thats a fact.Even in the case of Jayalalithaa, you can talk about her governance etc character assassination is common while targeting a woman in public life. When you talk about a man, its a feather in his cap. So thats a big difference. It hurts and it is not that easy to walk away from it. I am a part of the womens wing of the party. When a woman worker comes in, the way she is treated the problems are not the same that a man faces. There are other kinds of issues. The family has problems with her timings  in politics you cant say I will come in at 9 am and leave at 5 pm.Everybody supports 33 per cent reservation for women (in Parliament), but it doesnt happen. Men find it convenient to have a woman who will listen to them, who will not question them Politics is about power and it is very difficult for a man to give up that space of power. It is human psychology. I am not blaming the men, but the struggle is much bigger for a woman.(On dynasty politics) It is easier to get into something if you are familiar with it. It is easier for me and it is easier for the people to accept me. There is an initial push and I cannot deny that. But after that, unless you prove yourself, you cannot be there. You stand for an election, people have to vote for you. You have to prove yourself to continue and be successful in politics.HARISH DAMODARAN: Why is it that despite the good social indicators of the state, the status of women and Dalits is still backward in Tamil Nadu?Sadly, there is a revival of caste in many states. That is also happening in Tamil Nadu. Until a few years ago, Dalits were treated much better. I am not saying that we had done away with caste and untouchability, but it was much better. Now we have reached a very sad low. Action is not being taken when there are atrocities against Dalits.As for women, I think they are treated badly everywhere, not just in Tamil Nadu. We have a long way to go. Womens education is much better, there are more working women in Tamil Nadu, but there is a lot more that needs to be done.AMRITH LAL: The Dravidian movement has been accused of being anti-Dalit.There is criticism, but it isnt true. The Dravidian movement is against oppression, so how can it be against Dalits or anybody who is oppressed?MUZAMIL JALEEL: How do you look at PM Modi and how is he looked at in Tamil Nadu?I think the DMK has made it very clear that we are not with the present BJP government and many of its policies. Initially, we did welcome demonetisation but the way it was implemented, we had a lot of issues with that. Even GST the way it has affected businesses, we have strong objections to it.COOMI KAPOOR: You were jailed for the 2G scam. Can you share with us your experience in prison?It was an experience, it opened up a lot of things to me. Being from Tamil Nadu, Im not that exposed to how people live here (in Delhi). (In Delhi) I have only met politicians, writers and journalists. I havent met women from backgrounds other than mine. (The jail experience) opened me up to that  what they go through, how they think, the issues they face. It was an important experience for me.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The prince was not reachable for comment.An aviation source told AFP that security forces had grounded private jets in Jeddah, possibly to prevent any high-profile figures from leaving.Meanwhile, the kingdom's top council of clerics tweeted that anti-corruption efforts were ""as important as the fight against terrorism"", essentially giving religious backing to the crackdown.""The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.""The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, if true, would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community,"" Ulrichsen told AFP.The purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed thousands of global business titans to Riyadh for an investment summit, showcasing his economic reform drive for a post-oil era.It follows a wave of arrests of influential clerics and activists in September as the 32-year-old prince, often known as MBS, cements his grip on power.Analysts said many of those detained were resistant to Prince Mohammed's aggressive foreign policy that includes the boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar as well as some of his bold policy reforms, including privatising state assets and cutting subsidies.The latest purge saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah sacked as the head of the National Guard, an elite internal security force. His removal consolidates MBS's control of the kingdom's security institutions.To analysts, MBS's meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.At the time, Saudi television channels showed the bearded MBS kissing the hand of the older prince and kneeling before him in a show of reverence. Western media reports later said that the deposed prince had been placed under house arrest, a claim strongly denied by Saudi authorities.Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.At the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June.Foreign diplomats predict MBS, set to be the first millennial to occupy the Saudi throne, could well be in control of Saudi Arabia for at least half a century."

5a150ff39855b76bf13ea797,Bring pulses under public distribution system: IPGA,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2017/oct/21/bring-pulses-under-public-distribution-system-ipga-1678957.html,2017-10-21,"NEW DELHI: Pulses industry association Indian Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) has demanded that pulses be brought under the public distribution system (PDS). According to IPGA, doing so would be beneficial both to farmers incomes and citizens nutrition.The demand has been placed with the consumer affairs ministry through a letter, which pointed out that under the National Food Security Law, while the Centre provides 5 kg of substantially subsidised wheat and rice per month at Rs 2-3 per kg to over 80 crore people, there was no such policy for pulses. Wheat and rice subsidies cost the exchequer a cumulative Rs 1.4 lakh crore per annum.IPGA strongly recommends for inclusion of pulses in PDS, which would have a salutary effect on demand supply disparities, seasonal deficiency and better price stabilisation all year round  building a case of adequate supply leading to nutritional security for the country, the association said.The demand comes amid falling realisations from this years kharif crop, a significant portion of which are pulses. Express reported last week that many kharif crops were being sold at throw-away market rates lower than the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government for public procurement.The IPGA pointed out that bringing pulses under PDS would act as an incentive for farmers as the government procurement will ensure appropriate price realisation. With farmers earnings improving, they will be keen on adopting more advanced techniques and better quality seeds that will help them meet the demand of pulses, it said. It added that this would ensure that lower income groups would be able to consume pulses, helping improve the nations nutritional security.WHO recommends 80 gram of protein per person per day. This would mean that every household (generally consisting of four people) should consume 3.84 kg of pulses a month. India as of 2015-16 consumes not even half that amount, the letter said.Indias pulses production touched a record 22.95 million tonnes in the 2016-17 crop year (July-June), almost equal to domestic demand  the country imported around 5 million tonnes of pulses last fiscal. Restrictions have been placed on this years imports, however, due to high yields and low farmer realisations."
5a15110c9855b76bf13ea887,For the ‘sake’ of spice,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/25/for-the-sake-of-spice-1683056.html,2017-10-25,"CHENNAI: I have been in Chennai for over two months. Although I specialise in Japanese and specifically Teppanyaki cuisine, my love for food is undying. I had an Indian friend in Solomon island s who made biryani for me and I loved it. So when I came down to India, that was the first thing I tried. It has so many flavours and spices in it. People might wonder how a Japanese chef would say that, but I do enjoy spicy food (chuckles).Photo: Sunish P SurendranI began cooking Japanese food in the Philippines, where I worked for nine years before moving out. Having travelled to different places such as Solomon Islands, Cyprus, and Papua New Guinea, I have been lucky enough to serve some Japanese and Teppanyaki food to people there and also managed to learn some basic European, Continental and even Korean food from my fellow chefs.Lot of people who dont know much about Japanese food often tend to think that its all about sushi. Any Japanese meal isnt complete without the soup. Our most popular soups include the Ton-jiru soup, which is a pork based miso soup and is usually served with fried pork cutlets  tonkatsu; the seasonal vegetables, mushrooms, tofu, meat or seafood and the suimono, which is nothing but clear soup made with subtle ingredients and flavours.The flavours in Japanese cuisine are very light. The very commonly used and must-have ingredients in every Japanese kitchen are  Sake, which is a kind of Japanese alcohol and is used like white wine is used in western cuisine; Mirin, rice wine similar to sake but contains lesser amount of alcohol and gives a sweet taste. And the last ingredient is the Hon dashi or the fish stock powder.Teppanyaki is basically a kind of Japanese cuisine in which the food is cooked using an iron griddle and includes grilled, boiled and/or pan-fried food items. We mainly cook shrimps, pork, beef, lobsters, scallops, etc. For some dishes that have to be made with pork, I substitute chicken here because not many people eat pork.Another interesting thing about Teppanyaki cuisine is that the style of cooking is quite entertaining. We love to entertain our customers and hence perform a couple of tricks like the machine gun, where I chop a particular ingredient and make it go like bullets shooting out from a machine gun; the helicopter, wherein I rotate the knives; the basketball, which is a favourite for many kids, wherein I throw a piece of the omelette into their mouth and theyve to catch it, I also perform certain tricks with the fire as well.The Japanese food that I cook here for the Indians is quite different from traditional flavours. Indians prefer a little spicier food  so I often add in the chilli-mirin paste that I have made. However, I have noticed that in other countries I have worked in, I have never had to make such changes. In fact, the miso-oyster sauce and soy sauce, which are commonly used to give a light flavour to Japanese food, is added more to the fried rice and chicken when made for the Indian customer, because they dont like the food too dry.Samurai MakiIngredients: Sushi rice  100 gm, Nori sheet  1, Sushi vinegar  2 tbsp, Soy sauce  as dip, Pickled ginger  for plating, Salmon  sashmi grade raw, Avocado  a handful,Cucumber  a handful chopped, Crab stick  one for eachMETHOD: To make the sushi rice, mix it with a special sushi rice vinegar first.Then lay out a preparation area with your maki rolling mat. On this, place a Nori sheet and cover two thirds of one side of your Nori with your sushi rice (approximately 1 cm height).Now add your ingredients in a line on top of the rice in the centre. You can choose any combination of ingredients that compliment each other according to your taste. I have chosen the salmon and avocado.Now, start rolling up the ingredients, while keeping the roll tight. The moisture from the rice will help it stick together.Finally, cut your roll in to 4-8 pieces and serve with soy sauce, Wasabi, and pickled ginger."

Well, you could give them a funky twist, and all you will need is some paper and glue.You heard it right! An art that originated in 17th Century France, Decoupage is derived from the French word decouper which means to cut.From there, it spread across different regions of the world and soon became a famous past-time in places like Italy, France and even England.Of late, namma Chennaiites too have been redecorating their home  chairs, tables, boxes, and vases  with vibrant and colourful papers.With several workshops being held in the city, people are finding it easier to learn decoupage and hence give their homes a new look.What to useChristina Ranjan who has conducted almost 20 workshops so far says that more people are curious to learn a new craft and there is also an urge to use customised and handmade products. I learnt a few basic techniques of decoupage when I was in school. My interest grew and I explored many other techniques. This is really trending in the city today and more people are interested in learning it well, she adds.Decoupage can be done on different mediums such as furniture, wood, glass, ceramics, rexin, canvass, jute, candles and even on stones. And requires materials such as Paper  Bob and Betty decoupage papers, craftreat decoupage papers, papericious decoupage papers, rice papers; decoupage napkins, glue, paint, varnish, scrapper and scissor. There are so many different kinds and techniques and each one is simply fascinating. I have learnt around 10 different techniques including the fabric decoupage, ceramic decoupage, rexin decoupage and glass decoupage, explains Sasitha R, a Class 11 student.Expensive classesAlthough the end results of the hardwork are pretty looking products, the classes and workshops that are conducted are expensive. It starts from `5,000 and sometimes goes beyond `20,000 for advanced classes. Meenakshi Nagappan, an IT sales professional, opines: They are a teensy bit expensive, but its worth it.Sachitha too was sceptical about the cost but the classes taught her a lot. The products we used at the workshop were brought from the US, Italy, Germany, Australia, etc. It is tempting to see the tools and products from different countries under one roof. That adds to the cost of the classes too.How long it takes to makeSri Lakshmi, a homemaker, says that the amount of time usually taken depends on the medium that is chosen for decoupage. Since the process involves a lot of cutting, painting, varnishing and drying, the size of the material or medium determines the time taken. For a smaller surface, it would take two to three hours. However, a larger surface may take up to six hours, and if you are working on a furniture decoupage, then it can take up to even two or three days, she explains.How easily are all these materials available for us? Priya Sivaraj, The Craft Shop, has been sourcing and selling decoupage materials for a long time. There are a lot of buyers today for these materials. It shows how much the art is trending in the city, she points out.Sri Lakshmi concurs and adds, Most of these products are easily available today, especially the basic ones. As the demand for the art is more, so is the demand for the materials as well.How to make Take any MDF (Medium Density Fiber board) product like a pen stand, watch box, etc. Take any decoupage napkin and cut out the images. Paint the product with any colour (the colour should match the napkin) Use sand paper to smooth the surface. Use mod podge (matte/gloss) to paste the cut images. Remove the air bubbles with the scrapper Apply decoupage varnish (matte/gloss) to finish. Dry the product for a few hours."

Between 2007 and 2017, China brought down prevalence of hunger to improve its ranking from 47 to 29 among 119 countries on the Global Hunger Index. In the very period, Indias ranking slid from 94 to 100. On the face of it rankings are about how well or how poorly an entity does as compared to others.In 2007, India at 94/119 was trailing 93 countries. In 2017, India is trailing 99 countries. What illustrates this better is the performance of others. In the immediate neighbourhood, Nepal is ranked at 72, Myanmar at 77 and Sri Lanka at 84. Bangladesh, which trailed nine places behind India at 103 in 2007, is ranked at 88 in 2017.It is not just the neighbours, smaller poorer countries such as Malawi and Mali have moved ahead, and Rwanda has caught up with India. Indeed, strife-torn Iraq is ranked at 78 and totalitarian North Korea at 93 out of 119 countries. And how does India compare to its peers from the BRICS grouping? BRICS aficionados may note that Brazil is ranked at 18, Russia at 22 and South Africa at 55 among the 119 countries.Comparative ranking does not quite capture the state of grief and misery. To get a perspective of the reality on the ground, translate the weights and scores of the Index created by the International Food Policy and Research Institute (IFPRI) to assess the gravity of the situation, of distress and death, the magnitude of the silent crisis.The IFPRI data spells out that 14.5 per cent of the populationthat would be nearly 190 million persons or roughly the population of the UK, Italy and France put togetherare undernourished, that is, they do not receive the required calories per day. The most vulnerable are the most affected21 per cent of the children under five are wasting and 38.4 or a third of children under five is stunted. Causes lead to consequencesIndias under-five mortality rate is 4.8 per cent. Translated: every year over 10 lakh childrenthat would be over 100 an hourdie before reaching the age of five.And which region or rather which states are the most affected by the problem of hunger? Like many other issues in India, the answer lies between the known and the unknown. Past studies on poverty and malnutrition reveal that the most affected are the most populated, under-developed and poorly governed states, otherwise known as Bimaru states.A 2008 study supported by IFPRI looked at Inter State Hunger Index for Indias states. Typically, Bihar, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh were at the bottom of the rankings. The study classified hunger in 12 states as alarming and added that these states ranked below several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, such as Cameroon, Kenya, Nigeria, and Sudan, even though per capita income in these Sub-Saharan African countries is much lower than in India. It could be argued that in the decade since 2008, matters may have improved but that flies in the face of the fact that the overall ranking of India has slid.It is not that there have not been policy initiatives. There is a menu of authentic acronym soupsPDS (Public Distribution System), TPDS (Targeted Public Distribution System), ICDS (Integrated Child Development Services), and MDMS (Mid-day Meals Scheme)crafted by successive regimes to deliver food security.The PDS, which is the mainframe of welfare delivery, was launched in 1939. It was later redesigned as Targeted PDS and followed up with the Antyodaya Schome during the Vajpayee regime. The ICDS is more than four-decades old. The MDMS is essentially M G Ramachandrans mid-day meal scheme launched in 1982. Following the `2/kg rice scheme pioneered by N T Rama Rao, several states followed suit. In recent years, states have launched meal canteens inspired by Jayalalithaas Amma Canteen.Each programme came with the promise of addressing the issue of hunger among adults, among children and mothers. In fact, food security is a justiciable right for Indians since 2013 following the legislation of the National Food Security Act, which promises five kilograms of food grains per person to 75 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population across the country. That there are millions suffering despite a justiciable provision in law is a testimony to the level of apathy.For years, governments have wallowed about resources. Money does play a role in funding interventions to mitigate hunger, but it is not just about money. Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladeshtogether have a GDP of less than $225 billionare considerably constrained than India with its $2 trillion economy. Indeed, between 2007 and 2017, Indias food subsidy bill has shot up from `24,014 crore to `1,45,338 crore for 2017-18that is a jump of over five times in the space of 10 years.The ready-to-use alibi about Indias many failuresreflected in its human development indicatorsis its population, its geographical scale, its complexity and its diversity. China has a larger population than India and is three times in area. The question is about commitment to outcomes, about redesigning of programmes and about cutting down leakage, theft and waste.There is the cost of wanton waste. In a country where millions are struggling for the per day calorie count, over `92,000 crore worth food produce is wasted. Earlier this year, the government informed the Parliament that over 11,889 tonne of food grains rotted under the watch of the Food Corporation of India between 2015-16 and 2016-17that is ration for over 2 million as per the National Food Security Act.And then there is the price of do-little policies. Ronald Reagan once said, status quo is Latin for the mess we are in. A parade of committees has suggested an overhaul of the food security regime. The Shanta Kumar Committee detailed the level of leakage and the unsustainable architecture of food subsidy apparatus. Almost every committee has highlighted the issue of procurement, storage and carrying cost of distribution and called for a more decentralised operation. Change is trapped between persuasive politics of status quo and systemic sloth.Finally, the best antidote for poverty and hunger is creation of income opportunities. For a reality check look at the rise in Chinas GDP between 2007 and 2017.It trebled!shankkar.aiyar@gmail.com"
5a1512209855b76bf13ea974,A walk in the clouds,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/nov/01/a-walk-in-the-clouds-1689552.html,2017-11-01,"(Photos and text by Abinaya Kalyanasundaram)I am a creature of the mountains...always have been. Nothing gets me more excited than layer upon layer of massive mountain ranges disappearing into the horizon. My friend and I went on a week-long trip to the abode of the clouds, but consciously decided not to plan the full seven days, and just go where the curving mountain roads took us. We chased the clouds and hunted for hidden turquoise blue ponds in the lush green wilderness, among other adventures.Guwahati to ShillongLanding in Guwahati, we took an airport AC bus right into the heart of the busy, noisy city of Guwahati. If you have time, you can hang around here and visit a few famous temples, but we weren't quite the religious type, so off into the mountains it was, immediately!Sitting for five hours straight can be a bit of a bummer (pun intended), but the higher you go, the cooler and stronger the wind gets, and soon, the hard seat is not a problem anymore. The clouds would tease us with occasional drizzles, and then the sun would admonish them occasionally with bursts of sunshine.We reached Shillong around 4 pm, enough time to ride around this cosy hill-town, with a bakery in almost every corner. We threw our backpacks into the third hotel we found at Laitumkhrah, a decent neighbourhood filled with great cafes and restaurants, took a quick hot bath, and set off to a small restaurant to have hot momos and soup for dinner.The warmth of the air steadily dropped with sun, and as we observed from our perch on the road-side caf, Shillong grew busier with the night. Taxis plied, vegetable vendors harped, and the busiest square of Shillong shut shop only around 10.45 pm, by which time were well snuggled in our warm blankets in slumber.Cherrapunji- Tyrna-NongriatThe living-root bridges of Meghalaya are well hidden inside its forests. Tyrna is the last point till which vehicles can ply. You can park your cars/bikes here, get a parking ticket (`40) and begin trekking down the concrete steps toward Nongriat, the village where the Khasi tribes live, the legends who built, or rather wove, the living-root bridges. (Tip: The local Khasi boys will offer to be your guide throughout the 3-hour trek for `800, but it's not really necessary unless you have heavy luggage, or are not the wilderness outdoor-y type).If you're lucky, it won't be raining, so you don't have to worry about tripping while walking down the 3,000 or so steps (I lost count). The deeper you descend, the louder the nosies of insects around you, and larger the butterflies become. You will soon find yourself right in the middle of the wilderness, not a soul in sight, the concrete steps the only markers of any civilisation.You have to descend for two-thirds of the journey, and if your knees aren't feeling weak already, you have to cross two narrow bridges across deep gorges, along the way. When you first come across the narrow iron-rod bridge, you would probably regret not hiring the guide back up there, but just hold tight to the iron railing, look-straight ahead, and if possible hum loudly to prevent the noise of the thundering water below. The second bridge is far less scary, with a wider base, stronger criss-cross steel and a small shop selling Maggi at the end as a reward.After that, a short ascent leads you to the old village of Nongriat. There are only three homestays here, and we chose to stay with Santina's homestay, a kind Khasi women whose smile was welcome enough after the unnerving journey down here.That evening we walked to the double-decker root bridge, and as the monsoon had just ended, the small waterfalls and pond was accessible. Sitting right inside the pool, the evening was spent gazing at the root-bridge, wondering how many years the roots of the Banyan tree would have grown stronger, holding the many feet that crossed over it.Shillong to CherrapunjiWe wore our rain-gear and followed the traffic out of Shillong. We stopped at Elephant falls, first. A tourist spot it is, yes, but we did enjoy the first of the many falls we would spot soon. From there, the highway juts on the edge of the hills, and if we hadn't stopped for a hot-maggi break, we would have missed this red-riding lad zip-lining across two mountain ranges. We rushed to the spot, paid, and waited our chance. It costs `800, non-refundable.I had to trust a narrow metal rod, and some small metal equipment, with my life. And I loved every bit of that frightening ride across a deep valley, a strong wind teasing me that Im going to fall to my death any minute. The local guy who helped me laughed when I reached the other end. Tip: Dont carry valuables. Dont look down or sideways. Follow instructions.Back on the highway, we realised why this is the abode of the clouds, the blackroad had disappeared into a wispy, cold fluff of moving grey clouds! A slight diversion takes you toward Nohkalikai Falls, probably the most-photographed falls in Meghalaya, and the tallest plunge waterfalls in India.The legend behind the falls is disturbing. In a village upstream from the falls, lived a woman, Ka Likai.She worked as a porter, leaving her infant daughter at home. Her husband was jealous of the child, and one day he killed her, cooked her meat and threw away her head and bones. When Ka Likai returned home, ate the meal and started searching for her daughter and husband. Ka Likai found a severed finger near the place where she usually cut betel nuts and leaves. She realised what had happened, went mad with anger and grief, and jumped into the waterfall. Nohkalikai Falls is named after her.Scary story aside, the falls is beautiful. We discovered a set of steps that seemed to lead right to the bottom of the falls, but halfway through, the path got slipperier, scarier and overgrown with plants. We were warned by two men, who had bloodied feet, to not go any further. We later realised the blood was from the leeches there.We got back on the road, and after a few kilometres found a decent homestay in a small town along the highway. A late evening walk up to a small hillock, we caught the sun shining its last rays through the mountains, seated amidst high grass plains. We soon realised we were sitting amid grass filled with the itchy-spiky black worms and shouting, ran down the hillock much to the amusement of the local kids playing football on the street below.NongriatA short, but rough, trek from Nongriat will lead you toward the Rainbow Falls. We were told by a fellow traveller the previous day, that off the beaten track, if we dared to explore, we could find secret hidden pools of water to take a lonely dip. We started our trek around 10 am, Santina's packed lunch in our small bags, with a quest to reach rainbow falls, and also find that hidden pool of turquoise beauty.One more root-bridge and one frail wire-bridge later, we felt suddenly a bit lost and unsure. How do we know where to step off the track? There are no sign-boards in this wilderness, and we spent a good few minutes just walking along the path, hoping Mother Nature would guide us. And guide she did!A short jump from a rock, hidden beneath tree branches, we heard a faint sound of a waterfall, and something told us this was it. Exhilarated, we trekked further down, and alas, found one of the many such hidden pools in the forest. There was not a soul in sight. Taking some time to protect our belongings and clothes from the wind, we waded as far as we dared into the bone-chilling waters. Imagine this: water gushing pleasantly all around you, a small falls in the distance, leaves raining down occasionally from the trees and gentle sunlight offering warmth.We never made it to Rainbow Falls. We spent the whole day in the pool, chasing bubbles and butterflies. And by afternoon, it began to rain, and we had to rush underneath a rock, where we stayed till the rain stopped and headed back. As we neared Nongriat, a few boys were returning home from a game of football. We made our way back the root-bridges, amid pleasant company and conversation.Dinner that night was comforting, with rice and dal, fresh spinach soup and a spicy omelette. Santina's husband returned from fishing with a basket full of toads for dinner, which we politely refused.Dawki-Krang-shui falls-ShillongRay had promised to take us fishing in the turquoise blue river early morning, but because of rains that had lasted all night, the water was a deep muddy-brown! Nevertheless, we helped Ray remove water from his boat, and tried our hand at fishing for a good-hour, before giving up and heading to the river-side dhaba that served hot pooris and channa, while Ray told us about how this part of the India-Bangladesh border was very friendly.From Dawki, we decided to head back to Shillong, with just one stop on the way at a cave waterfalls, Krang-shui. You can stand right behind the falls, within the caverns and watch the water fall in front of you. We had lunch at the entrance to the falls, with a view of rolling green hills in the distance, wishing we never had to say farewell.After seven days of raw wilderness, we had grown accustomed to the silence, the chill, the sharp sun, and the solitude. Returning to the city wasn't easy, but it was worthwhile; And now, it was time to say goodbye.Nongriat- Tyrna-DawkiWe hated to say goodbye to Santina, her home, her children and a cute kitten that was their pet. But we promised to send her a photograph once we reach home. The trek back up to Tyrna took much less time than the descent, and soon we were on the way toward Dawki after retrieving our bike.For some geographical context, so far, we had explored the Khasi hill ranges of Meghalaya, and now were heading toward the Jaintia hill region. The landscape and climate is slightly different between both, with the Jaintia hills proving to be testimony as to why Meghalaya is called the Scotland of the East. I'll let the photographs show you why.Dawki is a small town located right at the border between India and Bangladesh. Little did we know that there are no hotels or homestays in this town, and as it was already late evening when we reached, a few friendly BSF officials helped us find a local man, Ray, who rented out a tent right on the banks of the Umngot river!Though we were apprehensive about safety, we were assured by the presence of the BSF watch tower nearby. Once all the tourists had left, and the sun had set well, we took a dip in the river, in the moonlight, staring into the distance where we could see the line of lights that marked the border of Bangladesh.How To Reach And Go AroundDaily flights ply from Chennai to GuwahatiFrom Guwahati, you can rent a bike/car to be self-sufficient throughout your trip. Highly recommended for the many pits tops you'll be taking once on the road. Word of caution, though  the roads are great but unless you have previous experience riding in mountainous roads, be careful on those U-bends. Helmets are mandatory, by law, both government and human.Best Time To VisitCherrapunji, Meghalaya, is quoted to be the rainiest place on Earth, but September is the time when the monsoon JUST stops, except the occasional drizzles. The rivers are full and leaves fresh, just the right time to visit, in my opinion.General Tips:The Khasi hill tribes follow matriarchy, which means the women handle the principal earning for the family. It is overall a safe environment for women solo-travellers, though it is always advisable to carry pepper-spray and other safety equipment.While going on unplanned trips is more adventurous, I advise advance-booking the homestay at Nongriat during tourist season. Accommodation and food is very basic, but neat, and remember these are villagers opening their homes to you. So be kind and respectful of their food and lifestyle. You will be rewarded with their warmth."

My passion for food led me to Bengaluru, where I completed hotel management course in 1990s. I started my career from Ludhiana as kitchen executive in 2000. After two years, I moved to Shimla, where I worked for two years. From Shimla, I moved to the UK for three years and from there to Bangkok for a year.After years of exploring international cuisines, I decided to come back to India and came straight to Hyderabad, where I worked for two-and-a-half years. From there, I moved to Fairmont Hotel in Jaipur, where I worked for five years and then joined Inter Continental, Chennai Mahabalipuram Resort, as executive chef.I have been learning and cooking a lot of different cuisines ranging from Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, Peshawri, Asian, Continental and so on. Because of my extensive travels to different regions and countries, I got various opportunities to learn newer cuisines. My cooking style has improved so much. The more you travel, the more you learn about the flavours, ingredients and the culture of the food itself.Whatever cuisine I cook, I am particular about using fresh ingredients and also maintain the authenticity of the flavours and the cuisine itself. Earlier acquiring the right kind of spices and ingredients were a bit difficult, but today everything is easily available in every place.Its fascinating how one dish can be cooked in different ways, depending on the region it comes from. In Hyderabadi biriyani for instance, the raw meat and raw rice is cooked together and it is spicier. Whereas in Lucknowi biriyani, the chicken and rice are cooked separately, after which it is layered. And the flavouring is little bit on the sweeter side they use ingredients like saffron, star anise and cinnamon, hence giving a sweet flavour to it. My favourite biriyani is Hyderabadi because.I cook a lot of Asian as well, and that is one of my favourites  Chinese, Thai, Sichuan, Cantonese, etc. If you ask me my favourite dishes, it has to be the Hon Shimeji, Baby Sea Bass and Pan-fried Chicken Shanghai. Authentic Chinese food too differs in terms of flavouring and ingredients depending on the region  using of wild herbs or using a different method to cook like pot-roasting or stewing, etc. Flavours are altered according to the taste the people prefer.There have been several embarrassing mistakes I have made. One in particular was during my initial days of training when I was on a night shift. I was supposed to boil potatoes that night for the next day. So I put them in the container for boiling and I just stepped out for a bit, only to return four hours later and realise that I had left the potato. By then, it was too late! When you are a fresher, you tend to get all excited and make such mistakes, but thats how you learn.Pan-fried Chicken ShanghaiChicken:150gramFlour:30 gramChives flower:10 gramChilli oil:10 gramSalt: 5 gramSugar:10 gramGarlic Oil:5 mlSeasme Oil:5 mlOil: 5 mlWater: 30 mlMethodMake the dough with flour and water.Cut the dough into 15 gm each and allow it to rest.In the mean while mix minced chicken with spring onion,seasme oil, chili oil and seasoning.Roll the pre-portioned dough and fill it with the prepared filling.Give it your desired shapes.Steam it for 5 minuits and then pan sear it till it gets a golden brown colour.Serve hot.Hon ShimejiGlass noodle:50 gramShimeji mushroom:50 gramMitsukan vinegar:40 mlSugar:40 gramChinkiang vinegar:20 mlSichuan pepper:5 gramChilli oil:5 mlChilli peppers:10 gramPeanut:10 gramTaro: 10 gramSalt:5 gramAroma powder:5 gram5 Micro cress5 Goji berriesMethodClean the shimeji mushroom, keep it aside.Make the dressing using mitsukan vinegar, sugar and chinkiang vinegar.

But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?An exaggeration in the press has lit a fire under khichdi, which is being promoted by the government as a Brand India food (whatever that means) that is valued all over the country. This weekend, a celebrity chef will promote the brand by cooking up 800 kg of khichdi in a single pan at India Gate, in an attempt for a Guinness Book record. His weighty creation will be distributed to diplomats, to sit uneasily on their kitchen counters alongside the tagliatelle and the sashimi or whatever, according to nationality. In British diplomatic kitchens, it could also go eye to eye with its estranged relation, kedgeree, a colonial breakfast dish chiefly featuring smoked haddock, often eaten cold, thereby transgressing three khichdi taboos.But when was the last time you went in search of a nice khichdi? It is the Brand India food only by government diktat. Had the choice been left to the masses, biryani (mutton, chicken or veg with lurid pink sauce, according to taste) would have won hands down. Like khichdi, biryani has a nationwide footprint. The clincher is that one clearly recalls when one last went looking for a biryani, and firmly resolves to do it again. As soon as possible.But then, even commentators with deep experience of biryani have spoken up for khichdi. In the 14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote of a kishri made of rice and moong dal. The Mughals were not averse to it, either, and Abul Fazl recorded seven variations on the theme. The dish is politically salad bowl-like, in the sense that every region has its own variant, from the khichuri of West Bengal to the pongal of Tamil Nadu. But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

And for the health conscious among us, what if the thokku was made out of bittergourd or capsicum? Will you still say yes to it? Meet Rajalakshmi Allen, who began Jhos Kitchen in January this year out of her sheer passion for food and cooking. I was pursuing my PhD part-time and had to discontinue due to health issues. So while I was at home, I thought of doing something and at the same time take care of my daughter too. So I entered this field, she explains.Rajalakshmi Allen with her motherThe venture which is named after her two-and-a-half year old daughter Joshita, she says is run by her family. I havent employed anybody from outside. It is solely run by me and my family. Every member in the family helps out and this is the result of their support, she smiles.From podis, appalam and thokku to different varieties of ready rice mix, Jhos kitchen caters to most South Indian vegetarian dishes. Their speciality however is their variety of thokku  onion, green chilli, capsicum, ginger, bittergourd, tomato, garlic, etc. I do cook continental and north Indian food as well. But, for the time being I am only selling my South Indian varieties. I try and experiment with as many vegetables as possible to make my thokku. These are the ones you wont get anywhere in the market. People often assume that bittergourd thokku will be extremely bitter and dont prefer it, but it doesnt have a bitter taste  it is a mix of flavours she points out.What quantity is the thokku sold at? I sell a minimum of 100 grams. The prices usually vary with the availability of the vegetable in the market, like the pudhina podi  when the prices in the market go down; I buy it and make the podi. I always prepare it fresh and dont store it for longer period. So is the case with the pickles too  lime, mangoes, gooseberry  it all depends on the season, she adds.Apart from the regular sambar and rasam mix, Rajalakshmi also makes the Kandanthippili rasam podi, which has many medicinal values. It is very good for curing ailments like cold, cough and fever.Although Rajalakshmi hasnt done any marketing for her venture yet, she says that the responses have been good so far. When people taste it, they come back for more. Mostly people learn about Jhos Kitchen through word of mouth. The stall at Kadaiveedhi was my first till now and I have learnt so much through this.What was the best compliment you got so far? The best compliment was that my capsicum thokku is awesome. It started with vengaya thokku, when people said that it was awesome, then it shifted to other vegetables, she says. With a set of compliments from those who buy and constant support an motivation from her family, Rajalakshmi seems all pumped up to take her venture further and even plans to introduce more varieties of thokku.For details, call: 9445614242"
5a1516929855b76bf13ead72,"Freeze! To save plants’ genes for posterity, TNAU building cryobank",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/09/freeze-to-save-plants-genes-for-posterity-tnau-building-cryobank-1668858.html,2017-10-09,"CHENNAI: Soon genes from plants of the State can be stored for over 1,000 years. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University is building a cryobank  a gene bank that uses cold liquid nitrogen  to preserve germplasms of plants in temperatures as low as -196 degree Celsius.Gene banks are safe locations for germplasm  living genetic resources such as seeds or tissues of animal and plant  against catastrophe and loss in purity. These banks are also used by researchers and plant breeders. A typical gene bank would preserve seeds or vegetative tissues at extreme low humidity and temperatures.By keeping the moisture low, we increase the life of seeds, said Ganesh Ram, head of the department, Centre for Plant Breeding and Genetics, TNAU.The K Ramaiah Gene Bank, in TNAU Coinbatore, has successfully preserved over 27,000 germplasms since its inception in 2010. The bank has a repository of germplasms of various types of rice, maize, millets, cotton and medicinal plants, preserved in two kinds of storage: medium-term (20-30 years at five degrees Celsius) and long-term (up to 60 years at -20 degrees celcius).About one lakh different germplasms can be stored in K Ramaiah Gene Bank of which half is accounted for by medium-term storage and the other half by long-term.An average seed has about 15 to 20 per cent moisture content. However, within the bank, moisture is maintained between six to eight per cent for mid-term storage and three to five per cent for long-term. This is achieved by circulating dry cold air that gradually removes the moisture from the seeds. The seeds are then periodically checked for viability before distribution for research and breeding. A major limitation of this gene bank is that it can only store seeds.Enter the cryobankThe new cryobank that would be operational in less than a year is being built to not only preserve these genes for posterity, but also to preserve the germplasm of plants that reproduce vegetatively or through roots.The new gene bank would use an extremely cold nitrogen atmosphere to preserve germplasms. Nitrogen can either be used in its liquid form at -196 degrees celsius or in its vapour form at -140 degrees celsius  depending on the nature of the germplasm, said V Thiruvengadam, assistant professor, Centre for Plant breeding and Genetics, TNAU.The gene bank would have three main components: liquid nitrogen generator, intermediary vessel (to store nitrogen) and cryo vessels in which the germplasms are preserved.The liquid nitrogen generator we are implementing, will suck nitrogen out of atmospheric air and isolate it, thus bringing down the cost of having to supply raw materials, said Thiruvengadam.The technical infrastructure and equipment are ready to be functional. The gene bank has to be built with a nuanced architecture that supports these equipment and offers facility to build proper exhaust in case of nitrogen leakage, said Ram, adding that a budget of `2 crore has been sanctioned for the bank.K Ramaiah Gene Bank already holds several drought-resistant varieties of rice and cotton. The new bank would extend the scope of this preservation.Need for seed banks1. To have genes that plant breeders need to increase yield, disease resistance, drought tolerance, nutritional quality, taste, etc. of plants used in agriculture (i.e., crops or domesticated species)2. To stop loss of genetic diversity in rare or imperiled plant species in the world3. Many plants that were used centuries ago by humans are used less frequently now and seed banks offer a way to preserve that historical and cultural valueWhat is a cryobank?1. The word cryo in Greekmeans cold. The gene banks preserve germplasm in extreme low temperatures thus preventing decay or degeneration2. To prevent microbial growth, they couple the cooling with low humidity. Once the atmosphere is arid, the relative humidity between the atmosphere and the sample increases3. The circulating air draws moisture from the samples, de-humidifying them4. The samples are stored in vials which are arranged in neat stacks in super-cooled containers called cryovessels where they remain until theyre used by researchers or plant breeders."

The insurance companies have sanctioned a total of `2,263 crore, of which `1,802 crore had been released so far and subsequently `1,730 crore was credited into the respective bank accounts of the claimant rice producers across the State.The performance of Tamil Nadu Agriculture department came in for special mention at the Rabi conference held in New Delhi recently. The Union Minister for Agriculture Radha Mohan Singh made a special mention about the achievement of our department on the disbursal of crop insurance at the Rabi conference held at New Delhi last month. He admired the department for maximum insurance claims on crop under the PMFBY, an official told Express.He added that Tamil Nadu stood first in maximum claims of crop insurance and hoped to disburse rest of the claim sum in a short period. The State stood first in enrolment of non-loanee farmers, 12.04 lakh, under PMFBY. The main factors that helped achieve the feat were setting up of one-stop information centres and help desks at the block level, creating awareness through multi-disciplinary participation, better coordination with insurance firms and weekly coordination meetings of top government officials to monitor the progress of the scheme from enrolment for disbursal.Since Tamil Nadu was reeling under severe drought and acute water shortage triggered by truant monsoons failing to bring adequate rain, the State government tried to bail out farmers by expanding insurance coverage and special packages. However, several farmers organisations blamed the government of failing to provide the succour to all affected ryots and expand the coverage of insurance. The claims of insured crops other than paddy, which included millets, oilseeds and pulses, are expected to be settled in a few months as the cultivation details are yet to be collated.Another senior official of the agriculture department said the harvest of these crops was completed during June-July this year and the details are being compiled. We are yet to collect the crop yield details based on the crop cutting experiment. Once the paper work is completed, the process for getting the claims sanctioned will be initiated, he said. For the current year, farmers can insure paddy (Samba/Thaladi/Pishanam) till November 30 under the PMFBY which is implemented to protect the farmers from production risks, ensure food security, encourage crop diversification, besides enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

But Chennai generates more than 5000 tonnes of domestic waste every day. Where will all the waste go?People love complaining about the ever-growing, towering landfills but dont do anything to stop the mess from growing bigger.Almost three weeks in, the waste segregation campaign launched by Chennai Corporation to bring down solid waste has failed to gain traction. Thirty-five-year-old Raja*, a conservancy worker from Zone 10 thought his work would become easier after the corporation launched it on October 2. However, he is yet to sift through remains of last nights sambar rice (a biodegradable waste) to retrieve an empty packet of potato chips (non-biodegradable).Very few people have started segregating waste. Most leave the unsegregated waste outside and arent available so we cant even tell them to start segregating waste, Raja tells Express. Even when segregation is done, it isnt done carefully. Lakshmi R, a resident of Guindy, has been taking down only the kitchen dustbin when bio-degradable waste is being collected. However, she admits that empty oil, masala and noodles packets also go into the dustbin. I think about disposing of them separately, but its inconvenient, she says.It is very clear the two dustbin system hasnt debuted in the majority of the households in the city and the most recent initiative taken by the corporation might fizzle out. Zonal officers have also been observing a lack of enthusiasm. We have given residents a three-month grace period. After that, we will stop taking waste from households which dont comply, said a senior official from Solid Waste Management (SWM) department.Signs of hopeJoseph Jagans kuppathotti.com, a doorstep service which collects recyclables, has managed to attract around 40,000 households who regularly segregate their waste. Going to the local scrap shops is an inconvenience for this time-crunched society. So that is where we come in, he says. The families which subscribe to kuppathotti.com have a two dustbin system which helps them easily send the non-biodegradable waste to be recycled.These 40,000 families might seem like a drop in the ocean of the city which has a population of 7.1 million but it shows that the system is sustainable. Kurien Joseph, a professor at the Centre For Environmental Studies, Anna University, deems the two-dustbin system essential. Around 80 per cent of the waste generated can be either composted or recycled, he says. With public cooperation, waste which reaches landfills every day can be brought down to around 1000 tonnes.In Manali, where waste segregation was first introduced as a pilot project, the number of public dustbins came down from 267 to 68. This clearly shows the amount of waste generated will comprehensively come down.Giant dump yardsThe Kodungaiyur and Perungudi landfills have been in existence for almost three decades. With a combined total area of more than 400 acres, these landfills are also more than 20 feet tall.A senior official from the SWM department says that incinerators are imminent and that waste would have to be burned to reclaim the land. We have been planning to reduce the area occupied by the two landfills and a sacrifice has to be made, he said.The two landfills have both been known to generate leachate, which pollutes the groundwater of nearby areas. The Corporation also plans to launch waste to energy plants in both landfills. The energy generation might not be great but something is better than nothing, said the senior official.Need for penaltyThe Corporation says the domestic waste of those who dont comply after the grace period will not be collected. However, activists believe people shouldnt be let off so easily. MB Nirmal, the founder of EXNORA, an organization that began talking about waste segregation almost three decades ago, believes in spreading awareness through local welfare bodies. However a penalty should be levied on defaulters, he says. Segregating waste just makes the job of the conservancy worker easier  is a common misconception which stops people from taking the initiative.However, in addition to saving Raja the trouble of sifting through last nights sambar rice, it can also stop the mounds at Perungudi and Kodungaiyur from growing bigger."
5a1518099855b76bf13eaeb2,Branding the humble Khichdi cooks up mishmash of a debate,http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2017/nov/05/branding-the-humble-khichdi-cooks-up-mishmash-of-a-debate-1692210.html,2017-11-05,"New Delhi: Its not often that a common mans food becomes fodder for debate on social media and the Internet. But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"

Hes a picky eater; he will not finish his food without potato or eggs, complained his mother, Kalaivani. On Thursday, however, Sanjay sat eating lemon rice  no potatoes or eggs, from an upturned orange frisbee, amidst the rubble that was only hours ago, his home.Sanjay lost his home at Nalla Thanni Odai Kuppam near Kasimedu to the recent eviction drive by revenue officials of Ambattur on Wednesday. Around 130 houses in the fishing hamlet were demolished on a single day and residents allege that they werent even given time to recover their belongings.Residents of NTO Kuppam had to sift through the rubble to recover their belongings | P jawaharExpress had earlier reported how the land on which these 130 houses were built is not exactly necessary for a proposed highway. Around 230 families had earlier been evicted in the first phase six months ago, to make way for the Ennore Expressway that was proposed in 2005. A senior official from Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation (TNRDC) had told Express that the land cleared in the first phase is enough for the highway and this was one of the reasons the remaining residents of NTO Kuppam questioned the need to evict them.But none were ready to hear their arguments and after Wednesdays forced eviction, the hamlet looked as if it were rocked by an earthquake. Clothes, kitchen utensils, toothbrushes, mirrors, and almirahs lay buried under asbestos sheets and bricks.Residents with their prized possessions on the road after the eviction drive by revenue officials | p jawaharNothing. We were able to take nothing out; all my marksheets are buried inside, said 17-year-old Mercy, Sanjays neighbour. Sanjay and his brother Ajay also lost their textbooks in the debris. But I pulled the frisbee out, and some of my other toys, said a proud Sanjay.However, the 130 families have no place to take the broken, torn or bent remains. Land for resettlement of the residents of this hamlet was allocated but not a single brick was laid by the Slum Clearance Board so far at the site three kilometers away.It still hasnt been cleared of weeds and plants. We dont know when the government will begin the work, said Kalaivani. As per the State governments own statement on September 20, the government had only then decided to expedite the tender for construction of tenements.Classified as encroachers, these families cannot raise questions. But these families have been living in the hamlet for at least three generations and kept moving inward due to coastal erosion.Nothing prepared his family for what was to come. First came the oil spill, and now this. After the oil spill, business fell and it still hasnt recovered. We used to make a maximum of Rs 6000-Rs 7000 a month. Now it has halved, said his mother Kalaivani, who sold fish, like most other women in the hamlet, for a livelihood.So, when the government authorities handed them Rs 20,000 per family around six months ago during the first phase of evictions to find accommodation, they used it for food instead. What do we do when theres no income? Besides, how do they expect us to find accommodation for over six months with Rs 20,000? It wont even cover the advance,  said Kalaivani.After the eviction, none of the residents moved. They stayed the night in makeshift tents and some, in the temple, the only structure left standing. It was a bad night as it rained. The rain was heavy last night. We didnt have money to go anywhere else as all our relatives are here only. We took shelter in the temple but I still got wet. Look, I have running nose, said Sanjay. Many of the aayas were crying all night long.None of the nearly 50 students in NTO kuppam will go to school at least for a week or until the families manage to find another house. Around a kilometre away, Jonitha John, Sanjays favourite teacher at a corporation school in Washermanpet, was a worried woman.She had heard about the evictions. The students flocking around her had whispered that Sanjays house has been demolished. Jonitha described him as a street-smart kid brilliant at arithmetic. He loves outdoor activities, she said. She recollected the numerous butterfly cocoons he had brought to class so the entire class could watch it magically turn into a butterfly.However, Sanjay wasnt the perfect student. Ever since his father got arrested a few weeks ago for a petty crime, Sanjay had resorted to hitting his classmates and using violence to solve issues. He was a loner. So we started involving him in lots of group activities, said Jonitha. And things were looking up. She is worried that the break could hamper the progress. There was another boy, Adithya, in the other section. His family also belonged to NTO Kuppam and was evicted six months ago in the first phase. Hes dropped out since, lamented Jonitha.Sanjay said he wants to become a police officer when he grows up. With school no more the priority as he picks out his toys and books from the rubble, one can only hope the sudden tragedy will not further fuel the bouts of violence he exhibits and take him on the footsteps of his father.The rehabilitationAs reported by Express earlier, the State government had promised to build tenements for NTO Kuppams residents in the 2.28 acres of land belonging to Arulmigu Thiyagarajaswami Temple some 3 kms away.

The worst situation is where the central government controls social programmes but has no serious commitment to them. That is the way things are going today.Man-made famines are pa rt of Indias cultural memory, dating back to colonial times ending with the Bengal famine that killed millions in the 1940s. Recent reports of hunger deaths in Jharkhand have brought the focus back on food security, particularly among populations that are crucially dependent on the Public Distribution System (PDS).That after so many years of independence, India still struggles to reach food to hungry mouths and shows up big on the world map of malnutrition, despite its overflowing granaries, speaks volumes about the countrys serial administrative failure. The latest move to link Aadhaar to food rations seems to have compounded the problem, though ironically it was devised to supply foodgrain to targeted populations without intermediate pilferage and corruption.The Sunday Standard got in touch with development economist Jean Dreze, whose work on food security in India is well-known and who has been specifically studying the Jharkhand situation, to understand whats ailing the system.Dreze believes the policy of linking Aadhaar to PDS is not so much the problem as the insistence on online biometric verification at the village level. What succeeded in Andhra Pradesh failed in Jharkhand, resulting in hunger and deaths, because of inadequate infrastructure. Smart cards would be a far better option, if not offline Aadhaar, he suggests in an email interview.Excerpts from the interview:The recent hunger deaths that have been reported from Jharkhand, are they entirely a fallout of the policy to make Aadhaar mandatory for access to food rations? Or are they the compounded effect of chronic malnutrition?Chronic undernutrition is certainly the larger problem. It creates a dependence of millions of people on the Public Distribution System for food security. When the system is disrupted, as is happening today, intensified hunger is the logical consequence. As far as Aadhaar is concerned, the main problem in Jharkhand is not just that Aadhaar is mandatory for food rations but that Aadhaar-based biometric authentication is compulsory in most villages.In a recent article you cited studies showing how Aadhaar has adversely impacted the already delicate food security situation, ration intake, particularly in an impoverished tribal state like Jharkhand. As a general assumption, this may be a valid one to make. But had Aadhaar been solely responsible, would there not have been a wider effect clearly and demonstrably occurring post-Aadhaar?There are indeed clear and demonstrable effects, visible for instance in official statistics and field surveys. Even in Ranchi district, more than one year after biometric authentication was made compulsory, the official records show that a significant proportion of people are deprived of food rations every month. This does not mean that Aadhaar is solely responsible for failures of the Public Distribution System, as you put it. The point is that compulsory biometric authentication is making things worse.If the insistence on seeding Aadhaar to a food rations obtained through PDS is having a disastrous effect, do you think immediate corrective measures should be taken? What do you suggest -- an immediate rollback of the order or an alternative mechanism where the targeted food subsidy/ration reaches the right homes/recipients without pilferage?By way of immediate damage control, I would suggest switching the entire system to offline mode. There is an offline option in the system, which does not require connectivity or biometric authentication. The next step would be to assess carefully whether this offline option is adequate as a permanent arrangement, or whether there are better options, such as a simple smart-card system. What must be avoided at all cost is dependence on connectivity and biometrics at the ration shop.No political party or government in a democracy would subject the population to obvious harm, or consciously adopt a lopsided policy that results in hunger deaths. Do you think the recent cases are a result of insensitive administration, an entrenched official apathy at all levels?I think that it is a combination of over-enthusiasm for sophisticated technology and lack of clarity or concern about the hardships that inappropriate technologies can cause to poor and powerless people.Or do you think the sudden shift towards a very centralised policy planning far removed from ground realities thats causing the distress? After all, in Chhattisgarh, another tribal state, we have a CM who is called Chawal Baba -- whose cheap rice distribution scheme is seen to be one of the reasons for his electoral success.I think that centralisation is indeed a growing problem with many social programmes in India including the PDS, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the Integrated Child Development Services and social security pensions. There is no reason for these programmes to be held hostage to sweeping instructions issued from time to time in New Delhi, often without adequate understanding of their consequences. The worst situation is where the central government controls social programmes but has no serious commitment to them. That is the way things are going today.Was underdeveloped Jharkhand, with a large tribal BPL population, a wrong choice to run the Aadhaar-PDS scheme? Given the fact that the state simply does not have the infrastructure to seed the Aadhaar numbers to ration cards or the online facilities that could help run the scheme efficiently?Yes. Biometric authentication in the PDS was tried earlier in Andhra Pradesh, with somewhat better results. But there is a world of difference between Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, both in terms of infrastructure and state capacity. Even in Andhra Pradesh, there are significant problems with biometric authentication, and this should have alerted the central government to the fact that this technology is not suitable for states like Jharkhand. But the central government is not interested in evidence, it is sold to Aadhaar and determined to promote it come what may.Though the Food Security Act came into being during the fag end of the UPA, isnt it true that the priorities of successive governments since liberalisation have been lopsided, which is what gives us these terrible human indices? Do all policy initiatives on food, nutrition, cheap housing, drinking water, healthcare, basic education have to be tokenisms? As a throwaway line that says, oh, we think about the poor too?Theres some truth in that. Social policy should be regarded as the first and foremost responsibility of the state, but in India it tends to have low priority. This bias goes back to 1947, it did not begin with liberalisation.Back to Aadhaar, as a form of immediate course correction, should the elderly and women-led households be left out of its ambit? Because its not just the poor and hungry in interior hamlets who are being hit by it but also the middle class in urban areas -- an elderly woman living alone has to trudge to the bank to get her account linked to Aadhaar to access her money....It is true that Aadhaar-based technologies such as biometric authentication tend to be particularly difficult to use for the most vulnerable. For the elderly, in particular, biometric failures are very common. But rather than creating exemptions, I would prefer to put in place a system that works for everybody. One possibility is smart cards. This is a well-tested technology that does not require biometrics or connectivity. It is used in ATMs, metros, milk booths, shopping centres, what have you. Why not the PDS?How far do you think the hunger situation has been compounded by demonetisation?Nobody really knows. But it stands to reason that demonetisation must have made things difficult for many people who lived on the margin in the first place. As far as Jharkhand is concerned, we conducted two small surveys of the effects of demonetisation in Ranchi last year, one of small traders and one of casual labourers. Both suggested that incomes had declined by about 40 per cent on average, during the two months that followed demonetisation. That alone would mean intensified hunger for many. Pushing so many people to the wall, without any clarity about the goals of the exercise, is a grave injustice."

On of the best part about Diwali is food. Aromas of the lip-smacking gulab jamuns, jalebee and malpuas breeze through almost every home. Each community in chennai has its traditional set of sweets and snacks which they make during this festive occasion. Most recipes are guarded like family heirlooms and passed on from one generation to next. And the unwritten rule dictates that ingredients, portions and taste have to remain the same every Diwali! Thushara Ann Mathew brings you a taste of how Chennai celebrates Diwali.BengaliNeela Ganguly Sundaram, Cooking enthusiastOne sweet that is specially made for Diwali for Bengalis is the famous Malpua  a delicacy that is made with rice flour and milk; and in snacks it is Nimki  a triangle or diamond-shaped snack made out of maida, ghee, jeera, etc. Diwali is the time to munch on sweets and snacks. We also make other delicacies such as payesh and sandesh. I make them every year. Although I do not do it as a business, I do make them for friends and others because I want people to know more about such Bengali delicacies. People give me really positive feedback. The recipes have been passed on to me by my mother and grandmother, and although the quality and taste remains the same, today we tend to add some extra ingredients to enhance the taste. The malpua that my grandmother made used to be white in colour, but since we add khoa to it these days, it comes out in a yellow shade, but the taste remains the same. These days we garnish it with almonds or pistachio, etc.MalpuaMilk: 1 litre, Plain Flour: 100 gramsSemolina: 2-3 spoons, Fennel Seeds: 2-3 spoonsGhee, Oil, Dry fruits: for ganrishBoil the milk and condense it to half the quantity, cool it for a bit. Mix the plain flour and semolina into this and blend it well into a proper consistency. Now add the powdered fennel seeds into this mixture and stir till there are no lumps. Keep aside for 10-15 minutes.Take a flat pan, mix a bit of oil and ghee in half proportion each and heat it well. Take a small-cupped ladle and take one scoop of the batter and cook both the sides until golden colour.Prepare a syrup of sugar with a bit of cardamom and saffron.Once the malpuas are made, put in the sugar syrup for a while and serve it with dry fruits garnished over it.RajasthaniVineeta Jatia, Spoonful CateringRajasthani food is supposed to be extremely rich in flavour and taste. And on a festive occasion such as Diwali, the level of richness just increases, as it is a part of the tradition that we are supposed to eat good and really rich food on this day. Traditional Rajasthani sweets and savouries that are prepared on this day include besan laddoo, gond ka laddoo, shakkar para, mathri/ suhali, etc. During the festival we mainly have three days of puja, what we call as Dhanteras, Roopchaudar and Badi Diwali. We even worship Lord Yama, Ganesha and Lakshmi, along with worshipping Ram. Some of the snacks and sweets are kept aside for the Gods as an offering on this day. Like I mentioned earlier, Rajasthani food is quite heavy and usually doesnt suit Chennais climatic conditions. But we cannot have a Diwali without these delicacies, and since most of the ingredients are easily available here, it becomes easier to make it as well.Besan ladduFlour: 2 cups gramGhee:  cupSugar:  porousCardamom powder:  tspAlmonds and pistachio for garnishRoast the gram flour in a pan by adding little ghee for about 30 minutes. To this mix, add the porous sugar. You can add few small pieces of almond into it(optional). Cool the mix for a bit and make small balls out of it. Garnish with pistachio/almonds or even kesar.Kumbakonam Tamil BrahminR Prabhuram and Kala Jagannathan, Svadishta FoodsThe main sweets and savouries that we make and sell for Diwali are rava laddu, badusha, jhangri, boondhi laddu, gulab jamun, kara sev, mixture, ribbon and omapodi. Traditionally we also prepare a special Diwali leghyam (Diwali medicine), a day before Diwali, with all the herbs  this helps in balancing the excess food that we tend to consume during such festivals and also avoids any stomach uneasiness. Although the above mentioned are the traditional sweets and savouries that are prepared for Diwali, the trend keeps changing according to demand. Today, people prefer to eat other sweets such as Mysore pak, kaju katli and other cashew and milk based varieties as well. We prepare traditional Kumbakonam Brahmin style food and stick to our authentic recipes for all the delicacies, which have been passed on from generations.Rava LadduRoasted rava (sooji):  Kg,Powdered sugar:  KgGhee:  Kg,Broken Cashews: 100 gms.Cardamon powder: 2 pinchesRoast the rava and make a fine powder. Into this, add the powdered sugar and cardamon powder. Roast Cashews until light brown and add to the powder mixture. In a pan, melt the ghee for few minutes and pour this into the powder and mix well. Make the laddus before the mixture cools.GujaratiParul Bhatt, authoring a cookbookDiwali is the most important festival for Gujaratis and our celebrations last for five days. I make traditional sweets and savouries every year which sweets include delicacies like ghughra, Magas and sweet sakkarpara, and the savouries include poha chevada or mixture,7 pad Farsi puri, methiya,chorafali etc. The five-day long festival includes  Dhanteras, Kalichaudash, Chopada Poojan, Govardhan Pooja and Bhaibeej. And each day includes a set of worship and we also make sweets like sooji halwa to give as an offering to the god. I have been cooking for several years now and distributing the same with friends and family. Most recipes have been taught by my grandmother and mother. So I am particular about the authenticity of the recipes, as that is exactly where the taste lies.MagasBesan(chickpea flour): 3 cupsMilk: 2 table spoon, Ghee:  cupSugar: 1 cup, Cardamom: 4, powderedAlmond and pistachio: 10 each (soaked, peeled and cut into long strips)Warm the milk and add two teaspoons of ghee in it. Add the chickpea flour and milk and mix well. Let it rest for 20 minutes, before sieving it well and ensuring there are no lumps. Heat some ghee in a heavy bottom broad pan, to this add the flour and keep stirring. Cook on low heat,till pink and then take the pan off the gas. Let it cool and add sugar, cardamom powder, almonds and pistachio and make small balls/laddus out of it.KannadigasPavithra Lakshmanan, PR professionalWe make traditional Kannada sweets and snacks based on demand, and that seems to be more especially during Diwali. The traditional sweets have a background story. We make Somasi (that resembles Lord Krishnans Shanka  shell) and Chakli, a savoury that resembles Chakra. So it is believed that Lord Krishna used these as the weapons to kill the demon Naragasura. We also make the Kanadigas go-to dish Obatu (sweet poli) and Hayagrivamidi. We have not deviated from the traditional recipe as it simplest wont taste the same. Also in a way it is remembering our lineage Every Diwali, my mother makes the same sweets besides the other fancy ones (like badam halwa). She has so many stories about cooking with fire wood during her childhood days. I guess that is the only thing that has changed in todays scenario.SomasiMaida: 1/2 cup, Roasted rava: 1/2 cupBaking Soda: a pinh, Ghee: 2 spoonsSugar: 1 cup, Fried gram: 1 cupGrated desicated coconut (kopparai):  cupDry fruits, Cardamom powder: to tasteMix maida and rava with a pinch of baking soda and ghee. Make a dough and keep side for two hours. Prepare the filling powdered pottukadalai and sugar. To this add the grated coconut and mix well. Add fried cashew, raisins and grated almond. Finally add some cardamom powder, mix well and keep side.Take a lemon size ball of the dough roll into thin puris, put a spoonful of the powder and fold to half to get a semi circle. Seal the edges tightly with little water, and cut the edges with a somasi cutter so that it looks like a semi circle.Heat oil in a kadai, and fry the somasi one by one, till golden brown. Arrange them in a plate and sprinkle some powdered sugar on top.PunjabiSurbhi Vohra, Food enthusiastPunjabi cuisine, like we all know is heavy on ghee and butter. And all the ingredients we use are in its purest form. For Diwali, we prepare sweets like red gajar ka halwa, rice kheer, besan ke laddu, gulab jaamun, pinni (a sweet made out of wheat, dry fruits, ghee,etc) and savouries like mathri and also food items like chole bathure and rajma chawal is a staple in most Punjabi houses, during the festive season. We also have a tradition of buying silver coins every year on Diwali and we clean it on the day of Lakshmi puja with milk and water. Apart from this, we also make a special delicacy called as charnamrith  which is made out of milk, curd, honey, sugar, rose petals,etc and we add the new silver coin into it as well. After the puja is performed, this is then served to everybody. Although I make Diwali special sweets and savouries for people, I miss the flavours of the ingredients I get back home in Punjab. Especially, while making the gajar ka halwa, we dont get the red, long carrots here, like we get back home, and that really makes a difference in the taste and flavouring of the sweet.Red gajarka halwaRed carrot: grated 1 kgMilk: 2 kg, Sugar: 1 kgCream of milk:according to tasteGhee:for garnish and fryingDry fruits: for garnishIn a pan, fry the grated carrot in little ghee. Now pour the milk into the grated carrot and mix well. Add some of the cream/malai into it. Stir well, till the milk is reduced and the mix becomes thick. Keep stirring as you add the sugar into it. Stir and put 2 spoons of ghee just for the flavouring. Garnish with dry fruits like cashews and raisin."

To begin with, the menu will be the same as that of Bengaluru canteens. In addition to this, coffee and tea will be served. Tea and coffee, however, are not served in the BBMP limits. All these canteens across the State will be located close to a bus stand and other easily accessible places.Chief Minister Siddaramiah in his budget announced that 198 canteens for urban poor would be started in BBMP limits. In August this year, 101 canteens were opened. At present, around 120 are functioning.Breakfast is served for Rs 5, while lunch and dinner are served for Rs 10. With State assembly elections ahead, the government is now considering to extend it across the State.Recently, Urban Development Department said 250 canteens will be opened outside BBMP limits. Official sources from the department said preparations were on to set up Indira Canteens in designated places.To begin with, 99 Indira Canteens will be set up in the old Mysuru region including Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Ramanagar, Tumakuru, Kolar , Chikkaballapura and even Chitradurga. One canteen for every one lakh population. Government order has been issued, sources said.All the canteens outside BBMP limits have been entrusted to Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited for construction. The model will be similar to that of BBMP canteens, but these are kitchen-cum-canteens. Unlike Bengaluru, canteens and kitchen will be at one place. Since we are planning per taluk or per district, distance will be a constraint, an official said.The department is also issuing an order to serve food wherever there are labourers between 50 and 250 within a 10 km radius. It might be not possible for those people to come to canteen, so we decided to take food there and they can pay on the spot. Each day, it comes to around Rs 55 including breakfast, lunch and dinner. Of which Rs 25 is collected from people. We are getting 30 per cent subsidy from the Labour Department, the official said.On the menu, they are mulling whether to have a similar one like in Bengaluru canteens or to have a regional specific dish. We are calculating the cost. If it is more, we might go for rice items across the state, said an official. However, sources said they might go for a regional specific menu as there are not many rice eaters in North Karnataka and coastal Karnataka.Whats on the new menuExpect Raagi mudde to jowar roti on plate (region specific)Get coffee and tea for Rs 1.50 per cupIf there are around 50 to 250 labourers working at a site, food will be served at their place"

Ravidas, a rickshaw-puller, did not have either a BPL card or a ration card for the past several months, said the local people. He died at his home at Manghra village in Dhanbads Jharia block on Friday.This death was not caused due to starvation. I spoke to officials and they said this man had died due to health complications. I have asked the secretary of the food and public distribution department to visit the village and submit a report, said Jharkhands food and public distribution minister Saryu Rai, who was on a visit to Patna on Sunday.Ravidass family members told journalists that there was no rice in the house for the past fortnight and that they had not been given a ration card despite having applied for it. Ward councillor Shailendra Singh of ward number 37 said the district administration was indifferent to applications for ration cards.Dhanbad deputy commissioner A Dodde said Ravidass family was not extremely poor and that he died due to a highly aggravated condition of asthma. Dodde, however, admitted that Ravidas did not have a ration card.Ravidas had made an online application for a ration card in his wife Pavati Devis name on September 22 and its processing is in the final stage, added Dodde. I have asked for a probe to find out how this familys earlier application for a ration card was delayed by months, he said.Santoshi Devi, an 11-year-old girl in Karimati village in Simdega districts Jaldega block, died on September 28 allegedly after an eight-day starvation because the local PDS dealer had refused her family food-grains without Aadhaar linkage of their ration card."

The number is reducing every year as the department is trying to take measures, he said.A senior official from the department, on anonymity, said that on an average, every year in Karnataka, 200 new boilers are added.These boilers need routine inspection. The wear and tear also cause damage. We can prevent accidents, provided it is routinely checked and maintained.The owners focus more on production than maintenance, official said.Further, an official said, though there are 3,000 boilers, there are hardly 10 officials, including the Joint Director, Assistant Director. Normally the inspection is conducted by inspectors, with one inspector for every 300 to 400 boilers. How can one person inspect so many boilers in one year? Some boilers need inspection twice a year to get certified. We need people to conduct a routine inspection. The department is planning to hire three more people, but even then it wont be enough, he said.When contacted T G Manjunath, Director of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health, said, there is a shortage of inspection staff but they are trying to manage. The government of India has also given some relaxation on inspection.All these years, it was a department official. Now, third-party inspection is also possible, where an external private agency is given authorisation to do a periodic inspection. This will certainly lessen the burden, added the official."

Out of the 20,372 fair price shops in the state, 13,150 shops have been equipped with PoS machines. Somebody from Kalaburagi for instance could have moved to Bengaluru and they can get their rations from the shop in Bengaluru provided both shops have PoS machines, so that there is no duplication. By December, almost all the shops will be equipped with PoS machines, he added.The department is also in the process of collecting the authenticated phone numbers of all the card holders as it plans to send a barcode via sms to all the numbers. The barcode can be used to get rations, if shops are unable to process the biometrics of the card holders, Khader said.Wheat back on the list againThe supply of wheat which had been removed from the list of items supplied under PDS will be restored for 13 districts in North Karnataka from December. Khader said they had received several representations from North Karnataka districts stating they wanted wheat as well.From December we will supply 5kg of rice and 2kg of wheat to these 13 districts. We have also written to the Centre to supply wheat and reduce the quantity of rice being supplied. We have instructed the Deputy Commissioners to send a report about how much the demand is, Khader said. The supply of wheat had been stopped about a year and a half ago.Meanwhile, the Department has sought a report from the Regional Commissioners on why 30,000 tonnes of wheat lying idle in various warehouses for eight months have not been disposed of. If the wheat is found to be fit for human consumption, then it will be supplied to North Karnataka, where there is a demand, or else it will be used as cattle feed, Khader said."

Started by Bikash Parikh, who worked in the sports sector earlier but had a dream of starting his own place, the concept of the restaurants is driven on him wanting to break the myth that healthy, vegetarian food isn't tasty.The menu is limited, and the food is all made fresh. We don't store anything, the food is all made fresh. And because of that, if your meal takes about ten minutes more to get ready, says Parikh.We started the meal with a carrot and ginger juice and a peanut butter smoothie topped with granola. Both were delicious and just right on the sweetness factor. The Mezze Platter looked healthy, sounded healthy and was high on taste, with homemade multigrain breads, beetroot humus, chia seed humus and tahini. Next was the Raw Papaya and Soba Noodle with Som Tum dressing salad  one of the best raw papaya salads we have tried of late, with just the right amount of Asian flavours and spice. We also tried the Vietnamese Pho with Soba Noodles, the flavours hit the spot that chilly evening. Global cuisine at pure vegetarian eateries wasn't common in the city. This is something I wanted to change, and that's why you find Asian, Italian, Mexican cuisine on the menu, says Parikh.For the mains, we tried the Whole Wheat Spaghetti with Tomato Ragout and the Cottage Cheese steak with Mexican Rice. The spaghetti had a very home cooked feel to it, as did most of the food, and was loaded with vegetables. Though not a fan of cottage cheese, the steak was grilled and topped with a sauce that complemented it perfectly, and when paired with the rice and grilled vegetables, the overall experience was a satisfying one.If you want something sweet (and healthy) after your meal, ask for the special of the day. Although they didn't have any of the specials that day, as the desserts are all made with fresh ingredients, we did sample some sweet treats from the in-house bakery called The Bakehouse. We tried an oreo chesecake and a salted caramel tart, both of which tasted like they came out from your mother's oven, simple, flavoursome and comforting.The decor is also eco-friendly. The limestone and mud walls, along with the rustic artifacts and restored teak wood floors, resonate Prikh's belief of keeping things local, and that you don't have to spend exorbitant amounts to make a space look good.If you're in the mood to eat simple and healthy, then Little Green Cafe is just for you. They've just started to experiment with stand-up comedy and live gigs, so check their social media pages to find out more.Cost for two: Rs 800 (approx)"

According to Kamakshipalya police, one youth was shooting the video while three others narrated and blamed the government for failure on their part to provide hygienic food.The video was first posted by Hemanth Kumar on Fight for Right Facebook page at around 7.15am on Saturday. Later, it went viral. The incident reportedly took place in Malagala on October 20 around 9 am and the entire episode was shot in mobile cameras. A man in khaki and another who is walking out of the canteen with anger is seen claiming in the video that Food served is stale and unhygienic. Cockroach and other insects were found in the food.Another man sporting blue shirt is heard saying, Instead of serving food with cockroaches and insects, it is better they close down. In the video, while a dead cockroach could be seen in a rice dish, a dead insect was spotted in Upma. BBMP Mayor Sampath Raj said A complaint was filed to know the truth. We have even shared the recorded footage with police officials. I watched the video and it appeared to to be fabricated. However, police are yet to start probing the case.There are some people who cannot digest the success of Indira Canteens which provide food at subsidized rates. It is quite possible that the people in the video would have themselves brought insects and put them into food items just to tarnish the governments image, the Mayor added."

Narrating about his entry to politics, Moily said he did not have any interest in politcs.It was D Devaraj Urs who kindled my interest. I was an advocate working for the poor who would often become victims of atrocity by land owners. Urs tempted me to join politics with the Land Reform Act which he wanted to bring.

When I became CM in 1992, I was backed by Vokkaliga and Lingayat MLAs who were more in number, he said.I started revolting when I was fourMoily, who disclosed that his original name was Giriyappa, said, When my mother went to admit me to a school, though my mother said Giriyappa, the teacher entered it as Veerappa and gave the second name Moily, which is my caste, in the records. It was he who came up with my birth date. This is how they treated backward class people. When I was just four years old, the land owner came to throw us out of the house. That was the first time I raised a rice bowl to throw at them. On another occasion, I touched a Shivalinga inside a temple and the entire temple was washed later. We were insulted every now and then, people used to enjoy it. That fire inside me made me what I am today, he said.They tried to kill meSoon after I started practising law, I started working for the landless poor. One day, a mother-son duo came to me seeking legal help. I told them that I would not take up their case and advised them to stand up for their rights. Fifteen days later, they returned to me after having sorted out their problem. The woman would look out against trouble even after I became CM. As an advocate, when I was fighting for the poor, some people tried to run a lorry over me and once even got me to consume poison. But poor people stood by me and saved me. Because of them, I won the election with just `5000, Moily recalled."

In January, huge quantity of wheat was sent to various godowns of the district. The unused wheat is now damaged by insects.According to sources in the district food and civil supplies department, there are 13 public distribution system (PDS) godowns in the district and 1,976.53 quintal of wheat has been stored in these godowns for the last 10 months only to rot.Recently, Yellapur tahsildar D G Hegde wrote to the deputy director of the district food and civil supplies stating they have 84 quintals of wheat at Yellapur taluk godown. The wheat is already damaged and now the insects are spreading to rice stock leaving the taluk administration staff a worried lot.According to godown maintaining staff in Karwar, wheat at the godown cant be consumed. It has become a big headache for them to maintain the wheat stock. When contacted, deputy director of Uttara Kannada district food and civil supply department Raghunath B said there is 1,976.53 quintal of wheat in various godowns.

PWD minister H C Mahadevappas son, who is involved in illegal sand business, is out on bail. Most of the ministers have amassed thousands of crores. It will be exposed if I-T conducts raids on their premises  B S Yeddyurappa, state BJP presidentBENGALURU: Political parties in the state are already on election mode and the leaders are working overtime with their backroom boys to weave strategies to outsmart each other. While the ruling Congress is working on plans to trike at the very roots of its main rival BJPs support base with issues such as Lingayat religion and Kannada pride, State BJP president B S Yeddyurappa says he is ready with fresh ammo to end the Siddu raj. In an interaction with TNIE, the former Chief Minister dwelt on his strategies to derail Congress designs and rip off Siddaramaiahs image by exposing a string of scams in the coming days. Excerpts from the conversation.TNIE: How is your poll preparation going?BSY: Preparations are on and will gain full vigour with the launch of Nava Karnataka Parivartana Yatra on November 2. Apart from our national president Amit Shah, we are expecting Prime Minister Modi too to participate. It would be held in two parts, one will start from Bengaluru and cover the southern districts, and other from Hubballi and will touch the northern districts. The yatra would span over 75-80 days. We will cover three assembly constituencies in a day, explaining the failures of the Siddaramaiah government and highlighting the achievements of Modi government at the Centre and welfare programmes implemented by the previous BJP government in the state.TNIE: BJPs fight against Siddaramaiah government seems to be losing steam.BSY: Not at all. The agitations will attain their peak at the right time. You will see that soon. The Parivartana Yatra will be a game-changer as we hit the road, address rallies in every taluk and district. Our workers will fan out to every village and reach every house. We will deflate Siddaramaiahs claims on Anna Bhagya as the credit should go to the Modi government, which is paying a subsidy of `30 per kg of rice being distributed under the scheme while state is contributing just `3.TNIE: Your agitations against corruption in the Siddaramaiah government and demanding resignation of ministers D K Shivakumar and K J George fizzled out within no time, why?BSY: This government is thick-skinned. They do not care for political agitations and peoples demands. Practically speaking, they need a stronger pinch. We will do that in the days to come.TNIE: Siddaramaiah is emerging stronger after the partys victory in the bypolls. It looks like he has stumped the BJP with issues like imposition of Hindi and separate Lingayat religion. How do you counter him?BSY: This is just a feeling. But we are ready with our own strategy to expose his true colours. Our blitzkrieg to expose corruption in the Siddaramaiah government has started and it will be sustained by exposing a series of scams involving Siddaramaiah, his family members and ministerial colleagues. You will see BJP exposing a scam with necessary documents every three days. There is enough ammunition to destroy Siddaramaiahs Mr Clean claims. We will also distribute hand bills to every house explaining the loot by this government, their failed promises to farmers, failure to utilise central funds and betrayal of backward classes and dalits. It will become impossible for Siddaramaiah and his ministers to defend themselves or face the people.TNIE: Congress is questioning your credibility to talk about corruption as you had to go to jail on corruption charge...BSY: Yes, I had to go to jail only because I did not get bail. But have I been convicted? No. Not even a single charge has been proved against me. Even Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi are out on bail. PWD minister H C Mahadevappas son, who is involved in illegal sand business, is out on bail. Most of the ministers have amassed thousands of crores. It will be exposed if I-T conducts raids on their premises.TNIE: Congress, by reviving the Lingayat religion issue, seems to have managed to split the community, which has been a strong support base of the BJP. You seem to be clueless to resist it.BSY: We have decided to maintain a silence over the separate Veerashaiva-Lingayat religion issue. Siddaramaiah is fanning the issue to divert public attention to cover up his failures. The Lingayat religion issue will boomerang on him. I do not want to dwell deep, just wait and watch. As for the Karnataka flag issue that the Chief Minister has tried to misuse, there is no issue. We all have accepted the state flag which is in use for a long time. And, calling use of Hindi in a few Metro signboards as a move to forcibly impose Hindi is gross exaggeration.TNIE: The BJP in Karnataka is still beset with infighting and groupism even after Amit Shahs tough talking.BSY: It is true that the party suffered due to differences between me and senior leader K S Eshwarappa. But that is a closed chapter now. As for reports about a rift between me and B L Santhosh (BJP national joint secretary - organisation), it is baseless and non-existent. Someone is spreading rumours to mislead the people. We are working together like two brothers. We are interacting with each other almost every day. All of us are together.TNIE: BJP seems to be depending too much on Brand Modi and Amit Shahs strategies win elections in Karnataka .BSY: Achievements of the Modi government are definitely part of our campaign. Siddaramaiah has been accusing the Modi government of discrimination in granting funds for the state. We will present the true picture. For instance, the NDA government has released `1,145 crore for disaster relief so far which is much higher than the `6,67 crore released during the previous UPA regime. Central grants to Karnataka are set to touch `2.19 lakh crore in 5 years of the Modi regime, against `88,583 crore in the last 5 years of the UPA government.Apart from that, we will also highlight the achievements of the previous BJP government in Karnataka. Besides, we will be holding massive rallies starting with one for Vishwakarma community. People from backward and SC/ST communities are being drawn to the party in a big way. They are all disillusioned by the Siddaramaiah governments false promises.TNIE: Dont you think the BJP will pay a heavy price in northern Karnataka due to Modis reluctance to intervene to resolve the Mahadayi dispute?BSY: The previous UPA government at the Centre deliberately allowed the dispute to fester. Even now, the Congress will try to keep the dispute alive. But we are on the job to resolve it amicably through talks with the Chief Ministers of Goa and Maharashtra. People of Karnataka can hope for a breakthrough soon. I dont want to elaborate further.TNIE: Amit Shah wanted you to contest from northern Karnataka to shore up BJPs fortunes in the region. But, you seem to be reluctant?BSY: People of my Shikaripura constituency are not ready to allow me to contest from elsewhere. I became an MLA and then a Chief Minister with their love and blessings. They have taken a pledge to ensure my victory without me campaigning there, so as to enable me to devote my time for campaigning elsewhere. I have a bond with Shikaripura which is difficult to break. I will discuss the issue with the national leadership and am optimistic about convincing them.We could have done better for Bengaluru. We willTNIE: Bengaluru is crumbling, people are dying on pothole-riddled roads. Why has the principal opposition party BJP remained blind to their plight?BSY: Congress has destroyed Bengaluru, Congress has killed Bengaluru, Congress has become a curse for Bengaluru and the Siddaramaiah government is dead for Bengaluru. What have they done for Bengaluru? Even one centimetre of rain causes flooding all over the city. The Chief Minister says they have spent Rs700cr for improving drains. Where has the money gone? The Chief Minister claims that he has given world class infrastructure for Bengaluru, but the city is suffering without even basic infrastructure.TNIE: Then, why is the BJP not fighting for Bengalureans cause?BSY: The false claims and the loot in the name of developing Bengaluru have been exposed. The sorry state of drains and roads, and deaths of people due to potholes tell the tale of the big loot that has happened in the name of taking up infrastructure works. Yes, I accept that we as the principal opposition party could have done better in taking up the cause of the people, raising our voice to their plight. I myself will have to take the lead. I will do that. You will see BJP leaders and workers hitting the streets of Bengaluru to fight for civic amenities, to fix the battered roads.TNIE: What are your plans for Bengaluru if voted to power?BSY: First, we will expose the loot perpetrated by this government in the name of developing Bengaluru. We will come out with concrete plans for the city in consultation with senior leaders like Ananth Kumar, urban development experts and officials. Roads need to be concretised and encroachment of drains should be removed without any delay. We will do that. We will also use our influence with the Union government to bring liberal grants to improve the citys infrastructure."

His daughter, Manodi Marandi, said he died of hunger as the family had gone entirely without foodgrain for two weeks.We have not had a single grain of rice at home for weeks. The neighbours lent us some for a few days. My father died because he has not eaten for more than five days, Manodi told reporters. She said her family had gone without PDS rations in September and October because her fingerprint apparently did not match the one stored in PDS dealer Dharmadev Chaudhurys device.Manodi insisted her father had been physically fit and was not ailing, but local officials claimed his death was caused by illness. Similar claims were made after the alleged starvation deaths of Santoshi Kumari, 11, of Simdega on Sept 28 and Baidyanath Ravidas, 50, of Dhanbad on Oct 21.Mohanpur BDO Ashok Kumar, who visited Manodis house along with a doctor, said Rooplal had died of natural causes and that there was no need for an autopsy. Manodis fingerprint did not match the one in the fingerprint reader, said the local PDS dealer, Chaudhary. The device often does not work because of power failure and network problems. I had asked her to come later, but she did not, he added.A probe has been ordered into the denial of PDS foodgrain."

(AP)RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA: Saudi Arabia pursued a sweeping purge of the kingdom's upper ranks on Sunday, saying it would freeze the accounts of dozens of princes, ministers and a tycoon arrested as the crown prince cements his hold on power.Prominent billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal was among the princes arrested late Saturday, a government source told AFP, immediately after a new anti-corruption commission headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was established by royal decree.Separately, the head of the Saudi National Guard, once a leading contender to the throne, as well as the navy chief and the economy minister were replaced in a series of high-profile sackings that sent shock waves through the kingdom.The dramatic shake-up comes at a time of unprecedented social and economic transformation in ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia, as Prince Mohammed steps up his reform drive for a post-oil era.Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television reported that 11 princes, four current ministers and dozens of ex-ministers were arrested as the commission launched a probe into old cases such as floods that devastated the Red Sea city of Jeddah in 2009.The government official gave AFP a list of 14 of the most high-profile names including Prince Al-Waleed, ranked among the richest men in the world.The information ministry separately said the bank accounts of those arrested will be ""frozen"" and any assets related to the corruption cases will be registered as state property.""The suspects are being granted the same rights and treatment as any other Saudi citizen,"" attorney general Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said in a statement, adding that a number of investigations had been initiated.""A suspect's position or status does not influence the firm and fair application of justice.""A new eraShares in Kingdom Holding, 95 percent of which is owned by Prince Al-Waleed, dived 9.9 percent as the Saudi stock exchange opened Sunday after reports of his arrest. The share price later recovered some of its losses to end the day down 7.6 percent.In a statement Kingdom Holding said it was ""aware"" of Saturday's developments but insisted that it was ""business as usual"" after the chief executive of the company was assured of support from the government.Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said the crackdown ""heralds a new era and policy of transparency, clarity and accountability"".""The decisive decisions will preserve the investment environment and boost trust in the rule of law,"" the Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying.The kingdom's top council of clerics also lauded the anti-corruption efforts as ""important"", essentially giving religious backing to the crackdown.An aviation source told AFP that security forces had grounded private jets at airports, possibly to prevent high-profile figures from leaving the country.There was fevered speculation on social media that the arrested figures were being held at Riyadh's Ritz Carlton, a palatial hotel originally planned as a palace for guests of the royal family.The hotel appeared to be closed off to the public on Sunday and its website said the property was fully booked.""The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.""The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, if true, would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community,"" Ulrichsen told AFP.The purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed thousands of global business leaders to Riyadh for an investment summit, showcasing his reform drive that has shaken up the kingdom.Meteoric riseIt follows a wave of arrests of influential clerics and activists in September as the 32-year-old prince, often known as MBS, consolidates his hold on power.Analysts said many of those detained were resistant to Prince Mohammed's aggressive foreign policy that includes the boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar as well as some of his bold policy reforms, including privatising state assets and cutting subsidies.The latest purge saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah sacked as the head of the National Guard, an elite internal security force. His removal consolidates the crown prince's control of the kingdom's security institutions.To analysts, Prince Mohammed's meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.At the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June."

(Associated Press)BANGKO: Thailand has revoked the passports of ousted premier Yingluck Shinawatra, who has yet to publicly emerge since she slipped out of the country two months ago ahead of judgement day in her negligence trial, officials said today.The former prime minister, whose elected government was toppled in a 2014 coup, was sentenced to five years in prison in absentia last month for failing to stop graft in a rice policy.The verdict, which closed the curtain on her political career, was lambasted by Yingluck's supporters as a junta- backed effort to boot her out of Thai politics for good.""All of Yingluck's passports have been revoked now,"" Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai told reporters in Bangkok today.""We don't know of her whereabouts, only reports that she is in United Kingdom but not exactly which city,"" he added.Yingluck had four Thai passports -- two personal and two diplomatic, authorities said.Thailand's deputy police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul said authorities are still working to confirm the former premier's location as they seek her extradition.""But no country has replied and said they have seen Ms Yingluck,"" he said.Yingluck, whose once-active social media accounts have gone silent since she fled, is only the latest from her powerful political family to fall victim to Thailand's coup- prone military and courts.The Shinawatras are wildly popular in Thailand's rural heartlands, where voters have helped them dominate elections for the past decade.But they are loathed by Bangkok's traditional army-allied elite, who have branded them as corrupt opportunists and repeatedly cut down their governments with coups, court rulings and protests.Yingluck's elder brother Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup, has been living in self-exile for years to avoid a graft conviction.The ruling junta has vowed to hold elections in November 2018, though previous dates have been postponed.Even if polls are held, they will not restore the same level of democracy the kingdom enjoyed before the coup.Under the junta's new charter elected politicians will be straightjacketed by an appointed Upper House and requirements to stick to a 20-year master plan."

(Photo | Associated Press)PARIS: Extreme weather caused some $129 billion (111 billion euros) in economic losses last year, said a report Tuesday that warned the bill will keep climbing as climate change boosts droughts, storms and floods.There was a 46-percent increase in weather disasters from 2010 to 2016, with 797 ""extreme"" events recorded last year, according to research published in The Lancet medical journal.These ""resulted in $129 billion in overall economic losses"" -- a figure roughly matching the budget of Finland.Losses were counted as damage to physical assets and did not include the ""economic value"" of deaths, injury or disease caused by extreme events.An observed increase in weather disasters in recent years, the report said, cannot yet be unequivocally be attribute to climate change.But the evidence ""might plausibly be interpreted as showing how climate change is changing the frequency and severity of these events"", the authors wrote.Climate scientists are loath to blame any particular weather event on global warming -- a phenomenon that needs to be monitored over decades.But looking to the future, the authors are under no illusions that climate change will fuel the ""frequency and severity"" of tropical storms, droughts and flooding around the world.The finances of poor countries are disproportionately hard hit, said the report compiled by experts from 24 academic institutions and inter-governmental bodies including the World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization.Their losses from freak weather events were more than three times higher in 2016 than in 2010, and as a proportion of GDP, much greater than in rich nations.- Wheat and mosquitoes -In high-income countries, about half of economic losses were insured, compared to less than one percent in poor nations.The researchers calculated that rising temperatures caused a loss of about 5.3 percent in labour productivity in outdoor workers since 2000.Over the same period, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwaves -- putting them at risk of heatstroke, heart failure or dehydration -- increased by about 125 million.The rising mercury also caused a near 10-percent rise since 1950 in the disease-spreading ""vectoral capacity"" of a mosquito bearing the potentially deadly dengue virus.""Climate change is expected to have an impact on crop production, with a one-degree-Celsius rise in temperatures associated with a six-percent decline in global wheat yields and a 10-percent decrease in rice grain yields,"" said a statement in The Lancet, warning of growing hunger.The world's nations have pledged to limit average global warming caused by humankind's emission of fossil fuel gases, to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-Industrial Revolution levels.We have already reached about 1 C.US President Donald Trump has pulled his country out of the pact, though the withdrawal can only become effective in about four years.On top of the risk to life, limb and property from heatwaves, floods and storms, as well as the spread of water-borne diseases and disease-bearing insects, climate change may also pose longer-term health dangers, the report said.""Indeed, emerging evidence is suggesting links between a rising incidence of chronic kidney disease, dehydration, and climate change,"" the authors wrote.Experts commenting on the report agreed more research is needed to clearly attribute health impacts to climate change.There was no doubt, however, of the link between temperature trends and human activities, nor about ""the urgency of addressing the issues raised by this report"", said Clare Goodess of the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit."

(Source: PTI) Narendra Modi wields a broom with NDMC workers to launch Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. (Source: PTI)The neurologist, Antonio Damasio, once wrote, A brain that cant feel, cant make up its mind. Examples abound where ostensibly rationally thinking human beings with perfect information and foresight choose collectively to defy the fundamental tenet of classical economics. They tend to succumb when the dessert cart trundles by, to the great consternation of economic theorists and clairvoyants. We all break our diets.My own experience with policy and its delivery allows me to cite a few more such scenarios where pure economic policy-making crumbled at the event horizon  the policy was of little use to communities it was designed to help. As an implementer, I found programmes requiring normative behavioural change distressingly difficult to deliver, and admittedly, success was moderate.Lets take the case of Swachh Bharat, a proverbial horse and water scenario. Building toilets and creating infrastructure has not proved to be enough to make people use them. Naming and shaming has met with limited success to change preferences here. In the absence of social disincentives with everyone indulging in the same behaviour, and the practice being a collective habit perfected over the years, something more than building toilets (mostly without water supply) needs to be done here.Another of many such examples is the win-win-win incentive whorl created by our agricultural policy owing to the MSP guarantee to a limited number of crops, mainly rice and wheat. Its a winning scenario for farmers growing crops underwritten by the MSP. Fertiliser subsidies encourage more use and productivity in the short term  a win-win for both farmers and suppliers. Government procurement further fortifies overflowing FCI godowns, adding to our confidence of being sufficient in grain, adding the third win. In this system of self perpetuating incentivisation, where is the scope to wean away farmers from cereal crops towards cash crops and ensure a better agro-climatic fit?So what is that new perspective? Lets understand through a few examples again. Singapore is so spick and span, they say, you could eat out off the road. Locals file at the Tokyo metro entry and exit in perfect straight lines like automatons without a prompt, every single day of their commute. In fact, Japan is so low on public misdemeanour, more force and resources are deployed for the community service bureau than the crime bureau in the National Police Force. People behaving well save these governments billions in enforcement costs. In another example of a government harnessing normative insight, the British government called in game theorists to help design auctions for 3-G mobile telecoms operating licences in 2000, and ended up raising a cool $35.4 billion, exploiting the competitive gaming behaviour of the bidders. In short, understanding strategy requires a perspicacious look into social norms and habits, and into human behaviour guiding such norms and habits. Policy needs to be informed thus.Guided by such principles, the British government now has a full-fledged Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) also called the Nudge Unit working with the Cabinet Office. The two mantras informing all policy are: If you want to encourage someone to do something, make it easy (here is a case for simplifying tax returns), and we cant do evidence-based policy without evidence (perhaps a case for more decentralised planning tailored to local needs). Their five-year old What Works Network to encourage the government to test new ideas is already available in some manner in an indigenous avatar of the PMOs website welcoming crowdsourcing of ideas for better insights and policy design. Another stellar example to emulate is the public connect network established by the Gujarat government through BISAG (the Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space-Applications and Geo-informatics), the brainchild of our prime minister. The institute has done great work in sustainable development and inclusive growth through communication, information and direct public connect.The US too has an SBST Team (Social and Behavioural Sciences Team) in the White House, which conducts randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of federal policy. It has helped veterans make choices for better pension plans. It has also helped people to pay off their educational loans and also helped the IRS to increase tax compliance using simple nudges instead of hard (dis) incentives.Policy design in India thus stands to gain by being behaviourally-informed especially in the realm of policy outcomes like clean India. Working in a normative space with communities, instead of an antiseptic economic sphere, shall ensure the achievement of desired policy outcomes in the long run while minimising costs to the exchequer. This calls for the inclusion of their choices and preferences in policy and using nudges, that is continuous subtle suggestions and subliminal prompts, so that behaviours that are beneficial are reinforced and those which are damaging are extinguished.Remember, in the long run, we are all humans.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo)YANGON: Myanmar's government began harvesting rice from farmland abandoned by Rohingya in northern Rakhine on Saturday, officials said, a move likely to raise concerns about the prospect of return for more than half a million refugees who have fled communal violence in the area.The border region has been emptied of most of its Muslim residents since late August, when Myanmar's military launched a crackdown on Rohingya rebels that the UN says likely amounts to ethnic cleansing.Hundreds of villages have been burned to the ground, with more than 600,000 Rohingya -- a stateless group in mainly Buddhist Myanmar -- fleeing across the border for sanctuary in Bangladesh.Under intense global pressure, Myanmar has agreed to repatriate ""scrutinised"" refugees who can prove their residence in Rakhine.But details of the plan remain thin, seeding concern about who will be allowed back, what they will return to and how they will live in a region where anti-Rohingya hatred remains sky-high.On Saturday, the government began harvesting 71,000 acres of rice paddy in Maungdaw -- the Rohingya-majority area hardest-hit by the violence -- according to state media and a local official.""We started harvesting today in Myo Thu Gyi village tract,"" Thein Wai, the head of Maungdaw's Agricultural Department, told AFP.""We are going to harvest some paddy fields of Bengalis who fled to Bangladesh,"" he said using a pejorative term for the Rohingya commonly used in Myanmar.""We do not know when those Bengalis who fled to other side will come back. That's why we have to harvest,"" he said, adding that he did not know what government would do with the paddies in the future.Workers were bused in from other parts of the country to assist with the harvest, according to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar.- 'Deeply disturbed' -Myanmar has denied charges of ethnic cleansing and defended its military campaign as a counter offensive targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police posts in late August, killing at least a dozen.But media, rights groups and the UN have documented consistent accounts from Rohingya refugees of atrocities at the hands of Myanmar security officers, who are accused of killing civilians, raping women and torching homes.On Friday, UN rights experts said they were ""deeply disturbed"" after speaking to refugees in Bangladesh.The accounts they heard ""point to a consistent, methodical pattern of actions resulting in gross human rights violations affecting hundreds of thousands of people,"" said Marzuki Darusman, who chairs the fact-finding mission.Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi -- who has no control over the powerful army -- recently created a committee to oversee resettlement in Rakhine, where tens of thousands of other minority groups were also internally displaced by the violence.The construction of homes for minorities such as the Mro has begun, according to state media, while Suu Kyi's government has enticed business tycoons to donate to the rebuilding effort.But fear abounds that the rehabilitation will sideline the Rohingya -- a group that has suffered under decades of state-backed discrimination.Myanmar refuses to recognise the Rohingya as a distinct minority, rendering the 1.1-million strong group stateless.The army has spread the view that they are foreign ""Bengalis"" from Bangladesh, despite many having lived in Myanmar for generations."

Hanif Malek Nachiben Bhisara was beaten up along with her husband who has lost vision in one eye. Hanif MalekAnaben Pawar, a 45-year-old tribal, whimpered in pain as she recounted the sequence of events of Friday night when she and four others  two men and two women  were beaten with burning logs of wood and made to walk on burning charcoal by an exorcist and villagers. For Anaben, who is now recuperating at her Kadmal village home in Gujarats Dang district after being discharged from the hospital, it was a night of horror. The torture led to the death of 50-year-old Paruben Pawar, and one of the men lost vision in one eye.The provocation, she said, was the outbreak of a viral fever, which the villagers blamed on the theft of an idol from the village temple five years ago.It was late in the night on Friday. I was sleeping inside my house when a group of villagers came to my house and told me that I have been summoned for a bhakti programme by a bhagat (an exorcist who is also called bhuva by tribals). I was accompanied by my husband (Manjirao Pawar). When we reached the spot, I saw exorcist Vanubhai Bhagat of neighbouring Ghana village. A wood fire was lit and rice was sprinkled as they began the ritual. Soon I was dragged to the spot and Bhagat started to beat me with a burning log. My husband tried to save me, but he was also beaten up by a group of villagers They alleged that I had stolen the idol of goddess from the temple, five years ago, which resulted in the outbreak of fever in the village, said Anaben, who has several internal injuries on her back.The four others  Paruben, her husband Janabhai Pawar, Rajyubhia Bhisara and his wife Nachiben Bhisara  were also beaten up by the exorcist and the villagers. Like Anaben, the remaining four are tribals and work as farm labourers.According to Anaben, the torture continued for over six hours.The exorcist and villagers forced us to confess that we were involved in stealing the idols from the temple. Finally, we were allowed to go to our homes with injuries, and were later taken to the hospital for treatment by our relatives, she said, adding this is first (exorcism) instance when a person has died due to torture.If there is something wrong, tribals approach exorcists who carry out certain rituals in the presence of villagers and call out names of women who are suspected to be into witchcraft. This is for the first time that men were also summoned and tortured by the villagers and the exorcist, she added.Following the death of Paruben, her son Nanabhai Pawar had lodged a complaint with the police, naming some of the villagers. Police on Saturday arrested five accused  Vanu Pawar, Dinesh Budhekar, Suresh Bhoye, Chhagan Jhamar, Jayram Gavit. The exorcist, Vanubhai Bhagat, however, is absconding.The tribal-dominated village, which is located in the dense forest of Mahal in Dangs, bordering Maharashtra, has a population of 2,000. Over 30 per cent tribals in the village are Christians. The village has two churches, and thesarpanch of the village, Vanitaben Chaudhary, is also a Christian.According to Vanitaben, she was not taken into confidence about the exorcism ritual.The physical harassment started in the night and continued till early in the morning. They had not taken permission of my wife who is sarpanch of the village, said Vanitabens husband Gulabbhai Chaudhary. Vanu Pawar and others wanted to become a hero and were threatening the poor tribals. I dont know for what reason they were doing such activities, he added. NachibenNachiben Bhisara, whose husband Rayjubhai Bhisara (51) has lost vision in his left eye, said that they had become victim of some conspiracy.Vanu Pawar is a powerful man. There is some internal war going on between the sarpanch of our village, Vanu Pawar, Suresh Bhoye and Jayram Gavit. We are poor and therefore we cannot raise our head against the trio as they are highly influential people and financially strong, she said.Following the incident, a team led by Sub Divisional Magistrate B M Bhabhor reached the village on Sunday and began creating awareness against using black magic.We have planned to start awareness drive in the villages to educate people and explain them that exorcists are not a solution to every problem. We have identified some NGOs in Surat and Vadodara who perform activities like street plays to make people aware and eradicate the beliefs in exorcists. We will soon start such activities here, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Dangs) B V Gohil said.According to sarpanchs husband, she too would be helping the district administration in such efforts. The incident has shocked the entire taluka and people are scared. We have handed application to police urging them that such type of practices should be stopped in the entire district Several villagers had now come up against such tradition and they told me that in future they will not participate in exorcism. Even people in the neighbouring villages have expressed sympathy towards the victims, said Gulabbhai Chaudhary.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"

Sandip Daundkar NICU ward of Thane District Civil Hospital. Sandip DaundkarJust as Nashik civil authorities were dealing with the public outcry over 55 infant deaths in August, 80 km away in Jawhar, a tribal area three hours drive away, Hira Dambale lost the battle to save her 28-day-old baby. Blind in one eye due to a childhood measles infection, Hira battled anaemia during her pregnancy and gave birth prematurely, at just 24 weeks, to a child who weighed only 490 grams.Doctors at the sub-district hospital in Jawhar tried in vain to save the baby that had been kept in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) for nearly a month. Hira has a seven-year-old boy who is moderately malnourished. She lost another baby two years ago and her third one could survive for less than a month. Hira required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. During my pregnancy, the doctors gave me tablets to increase my blood count but I did not take them. There was too much acidity, says this tribal woman whose staple meal is rice grown in a small patch near her hut at Talasri village.For 22-year-old Anita Budhar, who is from Mokhada taluka in Palghar district, it was her second delivery on September 2. The baby weighed only 700g and has been admitted to the SNCU at Jawhar hospital. Like Hira, she too had required blood transfusion due to her low haemoglobin count. At the government-run 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar, admits medical superintendent Dr Ramdas Marad, at least 30 new mothers undergo blood transfusions after deliveries every month.Low birth weight, one of the main reasons for a large number of infant deaths in Maharashtra and other states, is linked to factors like nutrition and anaemia. An anaemic pregnant woman is more likely to deliver a baby lighter than normal, and 49.3 per cent pregnant women across Maharashtra were anaemic according to the 2015-16 National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4). Among the non-pregnant women too, 48 per cent of them in the age group of 15-49 were anaemic.Jawhar and Mokhada, along with adjoining Vada and Vikramgad talukas in Palghar district, have reported several cases of children with malnutrition. According to a National Human Rights Commission report, at least 600 children died due to malnutrition in Palghar district last year. The 100-bed cottage hospital at Jawhar caters to 1.5 lakh people and gets referrals from tribal pockets of Mokhada, Vikramgad and others. There are at least 180-200 admissions of sick babies every month at the 12-bed SNCU. Most of the babies weigh between 800 grams and 1 kg. From April to August, a total of 748 sick babies were admitted at the Jawhar SNCU, of which 27 died. While malnutrition related deaths are high in these tribal pockets, the cottage hospital has set up a Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre where every month a minimum of 20 children are admitted, says Marad.At Nashik civil hospital, which was in the eye of a storm with 55 deaths in August this year, about 250 to 300 sick babies are admitted to the 28-bed SNCU every month. Nearly 25 per cent of the 700-odd women who give birth at the hospital every month suffer from anaemia.While majority of the women have mild or moderate anaemia that is treated with injections, those whose haemoglobin count less than 7 need blood transfusions and at least two out of ten such women require it every month, says Dr Suresh Jagdale, Civil Surgeon, Nashik district.At Thanes 336-bed district hospital, Civil Surgeon Dr B C Kempi Patil admitted that out of 738 admissions at the 16-bed SNCU, there were 47 deaths of neonates between April and August this year. These are extremely critical babies referred from other centres. However, the death rate is 6.37 per cent and we have been managing these babies. In fact, a team from Uttar Pradesh recently visited the hospital to take tips on how we were managing the babies, says Patil.Maharashtra registers about 20 lakh deliveries annually. Between April and August this year, a total of 22,692 babies were admitted and treated at the 36 SNCUs across the state. About 16.62 per cent of the babies that were admitted to these SNCUs weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.33 per cent weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g. In 2016-17, a total of 50,373 children were admitted and treated in the SNCUs. According to the state analysis, a total of 15.31 per cent babies at the time of admission had weighed less than 1,000g, while 29.45 per cent had weighed between 1,000 and 1,499g.The state health department will now introduce National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) to address anaemia that includes providing supervised biweekly iron folic acid supplementation for all under-5 children and weekly tablets for adolescents in the age group of 10-19 years. The challenge, public health experts say, is huge. Fauzdar Ram, former director of Indian Institute of Population Sciences, Mumbai, who is a co-author of the Million Death Study published in September in The Lancet, told The Indian Express that the total number of childbirths in India had declined only slightly from 28 million every year to 26 million between 2000 and 2015.Our challenge is now to meet the 2030 sustainable development goals (SDGs) for child and neonatal mortality. The child mortality rates have halved from 2.5 million child deaths in 2000 to 1.2 million child deaths in 2015. Neonatal deaths that were 50 per cent of all child deaths in 2000, however rose to 58 per cent in 2015. We will now have to address several challenges and will require an average annual decline from 2015 onwards of 4.1 per in child mortality and 5.3 per cent in neonatal mortality. The biggest target is to reduce neonatal mortality due to prematurity or low birth-weight deaths, especially in poorer states. These are strongly linked to factors like antenatal care, anaemia, education and nutrition, says Ram.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(AP Photo) Myanmars leader Aung San Suu Kyi arrives in Sittwe, Rakhine state, Myanmar, Thursday, Nov. 2, 2017. (AP Photo)Aung San Suu Kyi made her first visit as Myanmars leader Thursday to the conflict-torn region where more than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled state-led violence that has spiraled into Asias worst refugee crisis in decades. Her visit to Rakhine state comes as Suu Kyi is under intense international scrutiny for her response to the exodus, which the U.N. has called ethnic cleansing, and as her government said it is working on a plan to repatriate those who fled to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi arrived in the state capital, Sittwe, in the morning and headed to restive northern Rakhine where many Rohingya villages were located. During a 2015 election campaign, she visited southern Rakhine, where there hasnt been much conflict.The state counselor just arrived but she is heading to Maungdaw, northern Rakhine, with the state officials, said Tin Maung Swe, a deputy director of the Rakhine government, using Suu Kyis official title. Government spokesman Zaw Htay would not release Suu Kyis plans for the trip until later because of security concerns. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when security forces in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began what they called clearance operations in response to deadly attacks on police outposts by insurgents. The campaign has included the burning of Rohingya villages and alleged widespread rights violations.Fleeing Rohingya have described arson, rape and shootings by Myanmar soldiers and Buddhist mobs that left them no option but to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey through jungles and by sea to Bangladesh. The exodus has slowed at some points but has not stopped.On Thursday morning, at least 2,000 terrified and starving Rohingya huddled in rice paddy fields near one border crossing on the Naf river. They had waited for more than 24 hours for permission to enter Bangladesh and spent the night in the muddy fields.The global image of Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace laureate, has been damaged by the crisis and she has come under intense criticism to do more to end the violence and condemn those responsible. Several fellow peace prize winners have publicly condemned Suu Kyi for what they see as her apparent indifference to the plight of the Rohingya.Though Suu Kyi has been the de facto head of Myanmars civilian government since her party swept elections in 2015, the former political prisoner is limited in her control of the country by a constitution written by the military junta that ruled Myanmar for decades. The military has effective veto power over all legislation and controls key ministries including those overseeing security and defense.The military is in charge of operations in northern Rakhine, and ending them is not up to Suu Kyi.Even when Suu Kyi has spoken on the issue, she has drawn criticism. In a September speech, her first public comments after the current crisis began, she asked for patience from the international community and suggested the refugees were partly responsible, saying more than half of the Rohingya villages had not been destroyed by the violence.Suu Kyi faces a potential domestic backlash if she speaks on behalf of the Rohingya, who have been the target of anti-Muslim rhetoric. Many people agree with the official government stance that there is no such ethnicity as Rohingya and that those in the country have illegally migrated from Bangladesh.Though Rohingya first arrived generations ago, they were stripped of their citizenship in 1982, denying them almost all rights and rendering them stateless. They cannot travel freely, practice their religion, or work as teachers or doctors, and they have little access to medical care, food or education.Myanmars backers globally have also had to tread carefully, not wanting to undermine Suu Kyis weak civilian government at a time when the country is just emerging from decades of authoritarian rule. Still, counties such as the U.S. have warned Myanmar about potential repercussions if it doesnt address the crisis, including the risk of attracting international terrorists, scaring off investment, and ultimately stunting its transition to democracy.The government said Tuesday that it is ready to repatriate Rohingya who had fled, but blamed Bangladesh for slowing the process.We are ready to accept the refugees and to start a verification and scrutiny process, but we have not reached an agreement with the Bangladeshi authorities for repatriation, said Zaw Htay, the government spokesman.He said those who could prove they were residents of Myanmar would be allowed to return. Many Rohingya have no identity documents.Ali Hossain, a top government administrator in Bangladeshs Coxs Bazar district, said Wednesday that Bangladesh is doing more than enough to help the refugees, and placed the blame for delays in the repatriation process on Myanmar.Myanmar is talking about repatriation but more and more people are still being forced to come to Bangladesh, he said. There is a situation in Myanmar. We know that, the whole world knows that.Bangladesh is not playing any tricks here. We are doing our best, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational image) The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise in specialised fields. (Representational image)A group of more than 100 Indian IT professionals on H-1B visas today knocked on the doors of US lawmakers to get the country-specific quotas for permanent residency removed, saying the limitation resulted in massive green card backlogs for them. Every year, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) receives about 100,000 green card applications from highly-skilled Indian applicants.However, less than 10,000 Indians receive the green card, which is a step closer to citizenship. This number keeps on increasing every year.We are all are stuck in this 70 years backlog. Most of us came to this country about 10 years ago, said Houston-based Harshit Chatur, a key volunteer of the recently formed Skilled Immigrants In America.Currently working for a utility company in Houston, the Rice University graduate said he had filed his green card application in 2012. Because I was born in India and due to this per-country limit, I have to wait for 70 years, as per a lot of research, Chatur said.Established a few months ago by some Indian technology professionals who have been agonising waiting for their green card, Skilled Immigrants In America now claims to have more than 150,000 members and chapters in 25 states of the US.We are legally here, highly-paid, taxpaying and law-abiding. Were we born in some other country, we would have been (US) citizens by now. The amount of positive contributions that we make to this country, (we) just want the Congress to see it and hopefully that will solve this problem, Anirban Ghosh, the president of the group, told reporters outside the Capitol this morning.More than 100 of these Indian techies and professionals, and some of them with their dependent kids, drove down and flew to Washington to meet top American lawmakers and their aides. This is an awareness drive to make the lawmaker aware of our issues, they said, adding the long wait in some cases, could have devastating consequences for dependent kinds.We have a lot of kids who were born in India and the situation for them would be worse, Chatur said. For instance Preeti Konduri, 16, moved to the US as a six-year-old along with her father some 10 years ago. When I turn 21 years old, I will be in college but I cannot depend on my dads visa anymore. I will have to transfer to an F1 visa which makes me an international student here and I lose many opportunities, Preeti said, standing outside the US Capitol.Having lived most of her life in the US, Preeti said that she now faces an uncertain future because of the country-specific green card quota. Were basically asking that since the children have been here for decades now and grown up here, so they should be given some relief, she said, adding children like her are called H4 Dreamers.While were being educated there was no difference between countries. So, when we go for further opportunities this difference comes up and it stops you from pursuing your dreams and goals. Its actually like careers like medical youre not presented with the same opportunities as the students next to you from different countries and its just very stressful, Preeti said.When we are given jobs based on our skills and experience, why the green card application processing is done based on your country of birth, Chatur said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational) Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camps sex industry. (Representational)As Rohingya women struggle to access even the very basics such as food and water in Bangladeshs overcrowded camps, a flourishing sex trade offers cash in times of desperation. Four women entered the clean-swept mud hut, took off their black shawls and sat cross-legged on the floor. When asked if they sold sex, the women stirred uncomfortably and were silent. Later, after cups of tea, the question came up again. The women caught each others eyes. Slowly one of them walked across the room to shut the door, another blocked the window. Darkness fell in the small, humid hut and voices turned to whispers.If anyone finds out what we do, they will kill us, murmured 26-year-old Romida. More than 600,000 ethnic Rohingya, a Muslim minority in Myanmar, have fled attacks by the Myanmar army since late August, fleeing across to border to southern Bangladesh in the worlds fastest growing refugee crisis. In Kutupalong, the biggest camp, the sex industry is thriving. Many of the sex workers are longer term residents of the Bangladeshi camps, but the influx of tens of thousands more vulnerable women and girls is expected to fuel the trade.At least 500 Rohingya prostitutes live in Kutupalong, said Noor, who works as a fixer, but many have lived for years in the camp which was established in 1992. Recruiters now have their eyes set on the newcomers, she added. UN agencies say they have no figures on the numbers of sex workers in the camps to make public.Its hard to come by numbers and we dont collect data on how many sex workers are in the camps, Saba Zariv, an expert on gender-based violence at the U.N.s population agency UNFPA told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.RUMOURSA recent report from UNICEF, the U.N. childrens fund, UNICEF report said that in the chaotic, unorganised camps, children and youths could fall prey to traffickers and people looking to exploit and manipulate them. From tight-knit conservative Muslim communities, the Rohingya often turn a blind eye to prostitution. People pretend that it doesnt exist, said Noor. The girls meet their Bangladeshi clients outside the camps. They dont sleep with other Rohingya. Our communities are tight and rumours could spread easily. Each girl wants to appear pure.Many of the prostitutes are children who eat no more than one meal a day and dont attend school. They work secretively without even their parents knowing. Rena, 18, who has lived in the camp for the past decade was forced to marry an alcoholic two years ago. He mistreated me and beat me, she said. Her abusive husband ran left her when she gave birth to her first son. Feeding her child became impossible.Thats when I decided to become a sex worker. I was only 16, but it was out of desperation. I needed money. Fourteen-year-old Kamru, who also sells sex, arrived years ago in a previous wave of Rohingya refugees. She has never been able to attend school because her family is too poor. The camp is all I remember. I grew up here, but I was always hungry, said the teenager, who like all the women and girls did not want to reveal her full name.Sex workers share common traits: poverty, abusive family members and lack of funds make them vulnerable enough to be trafficked into the camps sex industry. If aid agencies cant manage to provide people with their basic needs, the risk of trafficking grows  if we cant establish a sustainable mechanism here and aid tires out, we could see trafficking levels rise, said Lisa Akero, gender protection specialist at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).SLIPPING INTO PROSTITUTIONRomida had been left hungry and malnourished and saw prostitution as the only way she could survive. I told myself Id do anything. I didnt have a choice. Her first client was a Bangladeshi friend who convinced her to have sex with him for 1,000 Taka ($12).He paid good money, she recalled. The going-rate is 200 ($2.50) and my fixer takes half of it. The business largely operates by phone calls, with pimps informing the girls where to go and who to see. On average, Romida has three male clients a week  and darent risk taking on more for fear of being found out. I sometimes travel as far as Coxs Bazar city, which is a two hour drive. Whenever I leave the camp, I have to make up excuses. I pretend to be visiting relatives or taking a shift at the market.The Rohingya women meet men of all backgrounds  from university students to local politicians. In a brief phone conversation, Ali, a 23-year-old Bangladeshi student told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he sleeps with prostitutes occasionally, but when he eventually marries he would expect his wife to be a virgin.Most clients dont use condoms, the women said. I take birth control injections, but I worry about HIV every day, said Romida. She has never been tested for sexually transmitted diseases.SAFE SPACESHalf an hours drive away from the muddy, chaotic camps, surrounded by green rice paddies, local charity Pulse has set up a safe house for refugees that can host up to 30 women. Due to open in the coming days, the dormitory-style apartment is newly refurbished and has a psychologist on site.The girls who come here might not want to talk about what is happening in their lives as they could be in danger, said the shelters manager Kurshida Aktar, adding that all vulnerable women are welcome: victims of rape, single mothers and sex workers.Were creating an opportunity for women to rebuild their lives, access basic needs, have an outlet to talk and receive job training, said Aktar. But the four Rohingya women who agreed to speak to the Thomson Reuters Foundation were largely unaware of such services. We dont ask about it for fear of being found out, said Kamru, the youngest of the girls.As she walks outside the house, she slips into her black burqa, covering all but her eyes. I have to take it off when Im with my Bangladeshi clients, she said. But in the camp its my way to stay anonymous.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

His image is depicted on coins, amulets, statues and pins, and his works on Thailands behalf are immortalized in art showing him visiting rural areas and working on development projects he supported. Millions of mourners have prostrated themselves before Bhumibols body, which has lain in state at a Bangkok palace for a year.The Associated Press asked Thais about their thoughts on Bhumibol and what mementos theyve kept to honor the monarch they hail as Father. Here are their responses:SOMBOON CHAISITTIPORN, 48, insurance agentSomboon keeps a heavy bronze statue of Bhumibol in his home. He spoke about the relationship between the king and his mother, Princess Srinagarinra, before she died in 1995.I, as one of fathers children, want to follow his footsteps by remembering the loyalty he had for his mother. His Majesty would eat with his mother every day. He would hug and kiss her, and pay her visits when she became sick. His loyalty makes me feel like I want to follow his path. From now on, we are almost at a time where he will be sent off to heaven. I am ready to volunteer for His Majestys event.

His Majesty has done more than us, hes gone through much more than us.The image that popped into my head was the picture of His Majesty sitting up against a car tire. I thought to myself, `He is the king, why did he have to sit like that? How did he endure so much for us? And why cant we be tough for him? And then, someone signaled that the king is coming. And then the sun, which was so hot, had a cloud from nowhere come over it.Then the grandma said, `You see, son? Angels walk the earth.

(Source: Reuters) Eighteen people from the hardest-hit province of Hoa Binh in the north were buried by a landslide, but only thirteen bodies have been found, Vietnams disaster agency said. (Source: Reuters)Vietnam braced for typhoon Khanun on Monday after destructive floods battered the countrys north and centre last week, killing 72 people, the disaster prevention agency said. Last weeks floods were the worst in years, the government and state-run Vietnam Television said, with thousands of homes submerged. Another 200 houses collapsed and several towns remain cut off by the floodwater. The floods also damaged more than 22,000 hectares (54,300 acres) of rice. Vietnam is the worlds third-largest exporter of rice and the second-biggest producer of coffee, although the floods have not affected the Southeast Asian nations coffee belt.Eighteen people from the hardest-hit province of Hoa Binh in the north were buried by a landslide, but only thirteen bodies have been found, Vietnams disaster agency said.The government has said it is fixing dykes, dams and roads damaged by last weeks flood and is preparing for typhoon Khanun, which is expected to cause heavy rain in northern and central Vietnam from Monday.It has also warned ships and boats to avoid the approaching typhoon.Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. A typhoon wreaked havoc across central provinces last month.Floods have also affected nine out of 77 provinces in Thailand, Vietnams neighbour to the west. Three people had been killed in flooding since last Tuesday, Thailands disaster agency said on Monday.The Thai capital, Bangkok, was hit by heavy rain at the weekend, with gridlocked traffic bringing parts of the city to a standstill. Bangkok has often been described as the Venice of the East because of its many waterways. However, the floods prompted criticism of Bangkoks city government, with some social media users accusing authorities of not managing water levels in canals properly.The city government defended itself, saying it was working closely with the irrigation department. Thailand suffered its worst flood in five decades in 2011, with hundreds of people killed, industrial estates engulfed and key industries crippled.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Late Wednesday, Ratner announced he would step away from work with Warner Bros. for an unspecified amount of time.The reverberations also reached back 32 years as Oscar-winner Dustin Hoffman came forward to apologize for allegedly sexually harassing a 17-year-old intern in 1985.Writer Anna Graham Hunter alleged in a Wednesday column in The Hollywood Reporter that the now 80-year-old actor groped her on the set of TV movie Death of a Salesman and talked about sex to me and in front of me.Hoffman issued a statement Wednesday, apologizing for anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.Munn also complained about onset behavior, alleging that while visiting the set of Ratners After the Sunset in 2004, he masturbated in front of her in his trailer. Munn described the incident, without naming Ratner, in a 2010 collection of essays.Ratners lawyer issued a statement Wednesday in which he said the director vehemently denies the outrageous derogatory allegations and is confident that his name will be cleared once the current media frenzy dies down and people can objectively evaluate the nature of these claims.Ratner directed the Rush Hour film series, Red Dragon, X-Men: The Last Stand and Tower Heist. He has a first-look deal with Warner Bros. and his RatPac and Dune Entertainment has an extensive co-financing deal with the studio that has encompassed much of Warner Bros.s output, including Wonder Woman, It and Justice League, It.We are aware of the allegations in the LA Times and are reviewing the situation, Warner Bros. said in a statement.By late Wednesday, Ratner said he would personally step away from all Warner Bros.-related activities.I dont want to have any possible negative impact to the studio until these personal issues are resolved, Ratner said.Playboy Enterprises has shelved any of its projects that involved Ratner, including working on a biopic of Hugh Hefner, which was to star Jared Leto. We are deeply troubled to learn about the accusations against Brett Ratner. We find this kind of behavior completely unacceptable, according to a statement.Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins, who presented Ratner an award at the Jewish National Fund dinner on Saturday, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday that she was disturbed by the accusations. She added that had never witnessed or been aware of any misconduct by Ratner.Ratner and Hoffman become the latest Hollywood figures to face allegations of misusing their power to harass actresses, a list that now includes producer Harvey Weinstein and writer-director James Toback. Harassment allegations have also been levied against actors Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Piven.The crisis has widened to other areas of entertainment and media, including country music. Kirt Webster, a major country music publicist who has represented high profile clients like Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, Kid Rock and Hank Williams Jr., had denied accusations that he sexually assaulted an aspiring country singer.A former singer named Austin Rice says Webster groped his genitals, kissed him, made him strip naked and sexually assaulted him in 2008.His firm, Webster Public Relations, on Wednesday changed its name to Westby Public Relations and is being run by senior vice president Jeremy Westby. A statement from the company said Webster is taking time away from the business to focus on the egregious and untrue allegations.Police in Beverly Hills on Tuesday announced they have launched criminal investigations over complaints received about Weinstein and Toback. Weinstein also is being investigated for sexual assault or rape by police in Los Angeles, New York and London.Weinstein has denied engaging in any non-consensual sexual contact. His representative, Sallie Hofmeister, had no comment on the Beverly Hills investigation. The department said late Tuesday that it was investigating Weinstein and Toback after receiving multiple complaints, although the department did not specify the nature of the complaints.Weinstein has been fired from the company he co-founded and is suing The Weinstein Co. in Delaware seeking access to his personnel file and his emails. The company noted in a legal filing Wednesday that Weinstein is contesting his firing in private arbitration. The company is also asking a judge to reject Weinsteins request to fast-track the case.Dozens of women, including actresses Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams, have alleged that Toback sexually harassed or assaulted them.Toback has denied the allegations. He does not have a representative to field inquiries about the criminal investigation.Repercussions have been swift after allegations against Weinstein surfaced. Weinstein was fired from the company he founded within days after initial reports of sexual harassment were published and Netflix suspended production on its final season of House of Cards on Tuesday amid allegations star Spacey made a sexual advance on actor Anthony Rapp in 1986 when he was 14.The decision to pause production Tuesday came before a second actor leveled allegations against Spacey.Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos wrote on his Facebook page that he encountered Spacey at the bar of Londons Old Vic Theatre, where Spacey was artistic director from 2004-15, and the actor tried to fondle him against his will.Cavazos declined an interview request. There was no reply to a request for comment from representatives for Spacey.In a statement Tuesday, the theater expressed deep dismay at the allegations and said inappropriate behavior by anyone working at The Old Vic is completely unacceptable.Also Tuesday, CBS said it is looking into accusations by actress and reality star Ariane Bellamar that Emmy-winning Entourage star Piven groped her on two occasions.On her Twitter account Monday, Bellamar alleged that one encounter took place in Pivens trailer on HBOs Entourage set and the other occurred at the Playboy Mansion.Piven, who stars in the new CBS series Wisdom of the Crowd, said in a statement that he unequivocally denies the appalling allegations being peddled about me.It did not happen. It takes a great deal of courage for victims to come forward with their histories, and my hope is that the allegations about me that didnt happen, do not detract from stories that should be heard, he said.HBO, which aired the 2004-11 series, said in a statement that it was unaware of Bellamars allegations until they were reported by media.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5a154e749855b76bf13ed1c1,"Donald Trump kicks issues to Congress, is erratic trading partner",http://indianexpress.com/article/world/donald-trump-kicks-issues-to-congress-is-erratic-trading-partner-4898095/,2017-10-19,"US President Donald Trump. (File) US President Donald Trump. (File)President Donald Trump is proving to be an erratic trading partner as he kicks thorny policy issues to Congress and then sends conflicting signals about what he really wants. His rapid backpedal on a short-term health care fix this week is the latest example to leave Republicans and Democrats alike scratching their heads.The president has had six positions on our bill, an exasperated Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Wednesday after Trump offered multiple reads on a bipartisan plan to keep health insurance markets in business, ultimately ending with a thumbs-down. Nine months into office, Trump has shown a preference for delegating to lawmakers on everything from health care to immigration to foreign policy. Sometimes he creates situations that demand a congressional solution. In other cases, he sets difficult-to-achieve broad policy goals and expects lawmakers to fill in the fine print.Along the way, hes proven to be an unpredictable force. He encouraged Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee to work with Murray on a bipartisan solution on insurer payments, only to announce after some wavering that he wouldnt support it. The results speak for themselves: Despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, Republicans have achieved no major legislative successes this year. Their efforts on health care have ended in failure, leaving tax overhaul legislation as their only hope for a major win. But despite a self-imposed year-end deadline, theyve made only modest progress on that issue.Some Republicans on Capitol Hill have grown resentful _ and theyre looking ahead to 2018 midterm elections with apprehension. But most shy from offering public criticism, arguing that the president is simply looking to Congress to do its job and pass legislation. If the work is piling up, they say, its because former President Barack Obama took executive steps that were actually in Congress domain, and now Trump needs congressional help to unwind them.They point to immigration, where Obama acted unilaterally to extend protections to immigrants who were brought to the country illegally as children, and the Iran nuclear deal, where Trumps decision not to certify Irans compliance kicks the future of US participation to Congress. Look, our job is our job and its our responsibility, its our job to get this done, said Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. Im not going to try to lay the blame at somebody else. Trump doesnt have any such hesitation to assign blame elsewhere.I have great relationships with actually many senators, but in particular with most Republican enators. But were not getting the job done, he said this week. And Im not going to blame myself, Ill be honest. They are not getting the job done. Trumps unpredictability makes it hard for lawmakers to keep up with his latest positions. I hadnt heard that. I thought yesterday he was liking it, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., remarked in surprise on Wednesday when asked about Trumps opposition to the insurer payments deal Alexander crafted with Murray. Indeed, Trump had spoken favorably about the deal around midday Tuesday, only to reverse course by the time evening rolled around.On immigration, Trump at different times in recent weeks has offered to work with Democrats to protect young immigrants for deportation, denied such a deal is in the offing and suggested he could step in and craft a fix of his own. Trumps allies argue he is just pushing lawmakers to enact the agenda they were elected on. A newcomer to legislative politics, Trump also brings a business and showmans perspective to negotiations, relishing drama and surprise.Critics say Trump is comfortable making Congress the fall guy. He sees Congresss public approval ratings lower than his. So he feels he has an advantage over Congress, said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. Whenever theres a policy issue thats thorny or undoable, he boots it to Congress to figure it out.Brinkley added: Its the opposite of a buck-stops-here approach with Harry Truman. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., whos announced plans to retire and recently has been critical of Trump, says the president takes a different approach than past leaders. The more standard route is for the administration to lay out, for instance on health care,  a series of bullet points at the minimum, or a full bill. Thats typically the way things would work. So, yeah, its a very different way of governing and I think its one of the reasons youve seen the results to be what they are.Democrats are more pointed. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Trump is making everyones job harder. This seems to be his M.O., Schumer said on the Senate floor. He throws red meat to his right-wing base, whether its on health care, immigration, Iran, disaster aid, and then he says to Congress, `You fix it up. Thats not the way to lead.

(Source: AP Photo) In this Oct. 26, 2017, photo, Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, center, participates in the funeral procession and royal cremation ceremony of late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in Bangkok, Thailand. (Source: AP Photo)Thailands military government has emerged from the year of official mourning for King Bhumibol Adulyadej with a firm grip on power and in no apparent rush to hold elections it has repeatedly delayed during the four years since its coup. The five days of solemn and choreographed spectacle for Bhumibols funeral last month was a mostly unblemished propaganda triumph for the junta that underlined its primacy and the sidelining of political parties.After a reign of seven decades, Bhumibols death in October last year at age 88 was anticipated with trepidation by many Thais who feared greater instability without a traditional unifying figure. In reality, Bhumibols power to sway events was more mythic than actual, particularly as his health faded in the last decade. Even so, the junta and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha have burnished their image and stocked up on public goodwill by presiding calmly over an anxious period, said Kevin Hewison, an emeritus professor of Asian studies at the University of North Carolina.There was talk of a succession crisis, violence and all sorts of things but none of it happened, said Hewison. All the political parties look disorganized and not prepared for an election, he said. The military has got the whip hand.Thailand, the top tourist destination in Southeast Asia and a long-standing US ally, has suffered more than a decade of upheaval, including two coups, as its conservative establishment struggled to stifle a grassroots political revolution fostered by the electoral success of billionaire businessman Thaksin Shinawatra. His leadership was marred by corruption and human rights abuses and he now lives abroad in exile, but the political earthquake he unleashed with policies aimed at improving the lot of the countrys poor rural majority continues to reverberate.Prayuths latest vague promise for elections is November 2018, but the juntas ban on political activities remains in place and major parts of the legal and administrative groundwork for elections, required by Thailands new constitution, are still not completed.The current military rulers are determined to avoid what they consider the mistakes made by the generals that ousted Thaksin in 2006 but didnt eradicate his political machine. Thaksins rural and working class Red Shirt supporters easily won every election held in the following decade, putting the military and other traditional arbiters of power in Thailand on the back foot. This time, the junta hopes to create a very muffled democracy that deprives the winning party or electoral coalition of a real ability to govern, said David Streckfuss, a scholar specializing in Thailand.The constitution put in place under the junta government is likely to prevent any political party from gaining a majority and whatever coalition emerges is likely to have a prime minister imposed from outside, said Chaturon Chaisaeng, a former deputy prime minister and leading figure in the Thaksin-allied Pheu Thai party that was ousted in a 2014 coup.They are rules that are very undemocratic. Extremely undemocratic, he said. The elections that will take place will not mean as much as elections do in other countries. The latest chapter in the decade-long struggle between Thailands ruling classes and grassroots democrats unfolded in September when former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Thaksin, fled the country to evade prison.Yingluck, ousted in the 2014 coup and derided by her many critics in Thailand as a bumbling proxy for her exiled brother, was accused of negligence in instituting a money-losing rice subsidy program and sentenced to five years in prison. A top minister in her government was sentenced to 42 years in prison and is appealing. Many influential Red Shirt activists and organizers have been cowed by government pressure.In a sign Prayuth feels under no pressure to cede power, he is already threatening to prolong the ban on political activities by referring to his dissatisfaction with a lack of calm and order in society. The red heart is barely beating at the moment, said Hewison.Prayuths government does crave international respectability but that impulse to quickly hold elections has lessened with the administration of President Donald Trump apparently unwilling to lean too heavily on its Thai ally at a time of growing Chinese influence in Southeast Asia. Critics of the junta also currently seem willing to accept the diluted democracy it may eventually get around to offering. Chaturon said the Pheu Thai party is likely to contest elections though it hasnt made a formal decision yet.Worawut Wichaidit, a spokesman for the anti-junta group United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, said having an election is better than even if the new government is hamstrung. This unelected government has been in power for almost four years now and we all see that the countrys economy is disastrous. The rich are extremely satiated and poverty is everywhere, he said.Streckfuss, who is based at Khon Kaen University in Thailands northeast, said an election next year would open the possibility for wider political debate than at present. However, changes to the juntas democracy-limiting constitution would be impossible without major upheaval, he said. The military has tamped down, talked down, stamped down the democratic politics of the past decade but the long-standing tensions between the haves and have-nots of Thailands economic development will not go away, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(File/Photo) Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over military, pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return. (File/Photo)Rohingya Muslims who return to Myanmar after fleeing to Bangladesh are unlikely to be able to reclaim their land, and may find their crops have been harvested and sold by the government, according to officials and plans seen by Reuters. Nearly 600,000 Rohingya have crossed the border since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a ferocious counteroffensive by the Myanmar army.The United Nations says killings, arson and rape carried out by troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist mobs since late August amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who has no control over the military, has pledged that anyone sheltering in Bangladesh who can prove they were Myanmar residents can return.Reuters has interviewed six Myanmar officials involved with repatriation and resettlement plans. While the plans are not yet finalised, their comments reflect the governments thinking on how Suu Kyis repatriation pledge will be implemented.Jamil Ahmed, who spoke to Reuters at a refugee camp in Bangladesh, is one of many Rohingya who hope to go back.Describing how he fled his home in northern Rakhine state in late August, Ahmed said one of the few things he grabbed was a stack of papers  land contracts and receipts  that might prove ownership of the fields and crops he was leaving behind. I didnt carry any ornaments or jewels, said the 35-year-old. Ive only got these documents. In Myanmar, you need to present documents to prove everything.The stack of papers, browning and torn at the edges, may not be enough, however, to regain the land in Kyauk Pan Du village, where he grew potatoes, chilli plants, almonds and rice. It depends on them. There is no land ownership for those who dont have citizenship, said Kyaw Lwin, agriculture minister in Rakhine state, when asked in an interview whether refugees who returned to Myanmar could reclaim land and crops.Despite his land holdings, Myanmar does not recognise Ahmed as a citizen. Nearly all the more than 1 million Rohingya who lived in Myanmar before the recent exodus are stateless, despite many tracing their families in the country for generations.Officials have made plans to harvest, and possibly sell, thousands of acres of crops left behind by the fleeing Rohingya, according to state government documents reviewed by Reuters.Myanmar also intends to settle most refugees who return to Rakhine state in new model villages, rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach criticised in the past by the United Nations as effectively creating permanent camps. The government has not asked for help from any international agencies, who are calling for any repatriation to be voluntary and to the refugees place of origin.OWNERLESS CROPSThe exodus of 589,000 Rohingya  and about 30,000 non-Muslims  from the conflict zone in northern Rakhine has left some 71,500 acres of planted rice paddy abandoned and in need of harvesting by January, according to plans drawn up by state officials.Tables in the documents, reviewed by Reuters, divide the land into paddy sown by national races  meaning Myanmar citizens  or Bengalis, a term widely used in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya, but which they reject as implying they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.Kyaw Lwin, the state minister, confirmed the plans, and said there was a total of 45,000 acres of ownerless Bengali land. Two dozen combine harvesters operated by officials from the agriculture ministry will begin cutting stalks this month in areas under military control. The machines will be able to harvest about 14,400 acres according to official calculations contained in the plans. It is unclear what will become of the remaining crop, but officials told Reuters they would try to harvest all the paddy, recruiting additional labour to harvest manually if necessary.An acre of paddy in Myanmar typically makes more than $300 at market, meaning the state will gain millions of dollars worth of rice. The harvested rice will be transported to government stores, where it would either be donated to those displaced by the conflict or sold, Rakhine state secretary Tin Maung Swe told Reuters by phone.The land was abandoned. There is no one to reap that, so the government ordered to harvest it, he said.Human Rights Watch (HRW) deputy Asia director Phil Robertson, said the government should at least guarantee that the rice would be used for humanitarian support and not for profit.You cant call a rice crop ownerless just because you used violence and arson to drive the owners out of the country, he said.MODEL VILLAGESMany refugees are fearful to return and are sceptical of Myanmars guarantees. Those who do decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centres, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters, before mostly being relocated to model villages.International donors, who have fed and cared for more than 120,000 mostly Rohingya internally displaced persons (IDPs) in supposedly temporary camps in Rakhine since violence in 2012, have told Myanmar that they will not support more camps, according to aid workers and diplomats.The establishment of new temporary camps or camp-like settlements carries many risks, including that the returnees and IDPs could end up being confined to these camps for a long time, said U.N. spokesman Stanislav Saling in an emailed response.Satellite imagery shows 288 villages, mostly Rohingya settlements, have been fully or partially razed by fires since Aug. 25, according to HRW. Refugees say the army and Buddhist mobs were responsible for most of the arson. The government says Rohingya militants and even residents themselves burned the homes for propaganda.The hamlets where Rohingya farmers lived were not systematic, and so should be rebuilt in smaller settlements of 1,000 households set out in straight rows to enable development, said Soe Aung, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief and Resettlement. In some villages there are three houses here, four houses over there. For example, theres no road for fire engines when fire burns the villages, Soe Aung said.IDENTITY CHECKSThose who decide to cross back into Myanmar will first be received at one of two centres, according to government plans reviewed by Reuters. At the centres, officials said, the returnees will fill out a 16-point form that will be cross-checked with local authorities records. Immigration officials have for years visited Rohingya households at least annually for checks, photographing family members.For refugees who lost all their documents, the government would compare their photos to those that immigration authorities have on file, said Myint Kyaing, the permanent secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population.Officials will accept as evidence national verification cards handed out in an ongoing government effort to register Rohingya that falls short of offering them citizenship. The card has been widely rejected by Rohingya community leaders, who say they treat life-long residents like new immigrants.We are not going to go back like this, said Mushtaq Ahmed, 57, a farmer from Myin Hlut village now living in the Tenkhali refugee camp in Bangladesh, where Jamil Ahmed is also staying.If I can go back to my house, and get my land back, only then I will go. We invested all our money into those paddy fields. They are killing so many of us with swords and bullets, and killing the rest of us like this.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Kennedy. (AP Photo)President Donald Trump is playing it coy on what people will see from long-secret JFK assassination-era files. Hes been caught between students of the killing who want every scrap of information out on that crucible of history and intelligence agencies that are said to be counseling restraint. How that plays out should be known Thursday, the day set in law 25 years ago for the disclosure of remaining hidden documents on Kennedys killing on November 22, 1963. Only the president can hold some back.Trump wasnt tipping his hand on the eve of the release. The long anticipated release of the (hash)JFKFiles will take place tomorrow, was all he said in a tweet. So interesting! Scholars and sleuths say the CIA is pushing Trump to keep some of the materials secret. The spy agency isnt denying that. Clearly there are documents, plural, files, plural, being appealed to him, said University of Virginia historian Larry Sabato, an authority on Kennedy. Of the pressure on Trump, Sabato said, Im told reliably that it continues and that it has intensified. The historian said documents generated in the 1990s that could contain the names of people who are still alive are of particular concern to those who want files held back.The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2017Whatever details are released, theyre not expected to answer the major _ and for many, still-lingering _ question of whether anyone other than Lee Harvey Oswald was involved in the assassination, including the government. The Warren Commission in 1964 reported that Oswald had been the lone gunman, and another congressional probe in 1979 found no evidence to support the theory that the CIA had been involved. But other interpretations, some more creative than others, have persisted. For example, Roger Stone, a close Trump ally, advanced the unsubstantiated and widely disdained theory that Lyndon Johnson, who became president upon Kennedys death, was involved in it. Stone is not sure key documents will see the light of day. He said that 440 documents related to the assassination, released by the National Archives in July, were so heavily redacted on the basis of `national security that they are useless. Stone said hes lobbied Trump personally to release all remaining materials and believes the CIA is pushing the president to keep some secret.In 1992, Congress passed the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, which directed the National Archives to collect all information related to the assassination and release it within 25 years, barring exceptions designated by the president. The deadline is Thursday. The gunshots that the Warren Commission said killed Kennedy almost immediately inspired theories about whether Oswald had been the lone gunman who, with extraordinary luck by any measure, had hit his target.As the nation mourned in disbelief, Oswald was shot and killed in police custody by Jack Ruby _ forcing Americans to consider whether their government was hiding what it knew of the assassination. The event remains in the nations living memory for a significant slice of the country. Forty-nine million Americans, or 15 percent of the country, are age 65 and over, according to the Census Bureau. They were around age 11 or older at the time.The Warren Commission did little to settle the matter. Theories abounded that Oswalds murder was a cover-up for a conspiracy or government ineptitude. The deadly aim of a lonely, alienated gunman seemed hard to fathom. A gnat simply does not kill a lion, is how Saul Pett of The Associated Press described what was fueling the search for answers. He wrote the introduction to the book published by the AP that reproduced the Warren Report.Trump has seen fit to peddle conspiracies when they suit him as part of a broader appeal to supporters who dont trust the government. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly quoted a tabloid story that claimed the father of GOP rival Ted Cruz had been photographed with Oswald before the shooting. Thats never been confirmed _ Trump later said he was only quoting what hed read. But the release of JFK files this week could provide new details.Trump also trafficked for years in the baseless theory that President Barack Obama was born outside the US. He also falsely accused Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of starting that rumor. The president also, without evidence, accused Obama of wiretapping his office in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign.Whatever Trump decides to release, historians expect to comb it for an array of details, particularly on six days Oswald spent in Mexico City just before the assassination. Oswald said he was visiting the Cuban and Soviet Union embassies there to get visas, but much about his time there remains unknown. They will also look for any mention _ or absence _ of Cruzs father.Of key interest are any new details about Oswald, including any government ineptitude or cover-up. The 1992 law allows the president to withhold details that could compromise the governments sources and methods _ but not embarrassments. In any release of this size, there always are embarrassing details, said Douglas Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Instead he has never worked so hard  and earned so little. Gunathileka, from the Sri Lankan village of Periyakulam, in the North Western Puttalam District, is among hundreds of thousands of rural Sri Lankans who have borne the brunt of the worst drought in four decades.He has not seen any substantial rains on his farm in at least a year and has lost two harvests, resulting in a loss of over 200,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($1,325)  and growing debts. He has now abandoned his two acres of rice paddy land and spends his time looking  mainly unsuccessfully  for other work in 40 degree Celsius heat.There is no work. Everyone, big or small, has lost out to the drought, he said.According to data released in September by the United Nations, there are hundreds of thousands of households like Gunathilekas facing serious food security issues in Sri Lanka.With rice production for 2017 expected to be the lowest in a decade, over 300,000 households (around 1.2 million people) are estimated to be food insecure, with many households limiting their food intake and in some cases eating just one meal a day, the United Nations update said.The worst affected areas are the North Western, North Central, Northern and South Eastern Provinces that rely heavily on agriculture. The U.N. Office in Colombo said that affected households were in some cases limiting their food intake, which was hampering peoples day-to-day lives.EATING THEIR SEEDGunathileka, who hails from the North Western Province, said his family was now eating some of the rice that he had put away to use as seed for the next growing season.For the next month or two we are okay with rice, but we have been limiting eating meat, eggs and vegetables we buy from outside. The other big problem I have is my childrens higher education. If we cant get a harvest at least by the end of the year both of them will have to work, he said.His daughter is taking a course in secretarial work while the son is getting ready to sit university entrance exams. The family now survives on about Rs 800 ($5) or less a day, and both Gunathileka and his wife earn cash doing whatever work they can find.The U.N report also said that household debt was rising due to the drought. A World Food Programme survey released in August said that debts of surveyed families had risen by 50 percent in the last year.Households reported that the amount of money owed in formal loans has not increased, indicating that families are turning to informal lenders for credit, the WFP survey said.Gunathileka said that he was thinking of using the deeds to his paddy rice land as collateral and seeking a small loan from local money lenders.The banks will not lend because I cant show any income. (But) if I dont get to pay back the money lenders, I lose my land, he said.RAIN AND AIDGovernment officials said they anticipated the island had weathered the worst of the drought, and rains expected in late October would bring more relief.Recent rains have dropped the overall number of people affected by drought from 2.2 million a month ago to 1.7 million now, said G.L. Senadeera, director general of the government Disaster Management Centre.He said the government planned to distribute relief food packs worth Rs 5000 ($34) to about 200,000 drought-hit families and provide compensation up to Rs 8500 ($56) per acre for harvest losses this year.The governments drought relief efforts, which began in August and were accelerated in September, officials say, are expected to cost about Rs 2.5 billion (about $16 million), according to the Treasury department.The World Food Programme said in its August report that of 81,000 families surveyed in the 10 worst-hit districts, only 22 percent had access to government relief by early August.For now, Gunathileka and his wife look up to the sky each time they step out looking for work.All we see are clear skies. All we want to see are dark clouds over the horizon, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) announced the ceasefire from September 10 in order, they said, to facilitate aid deliveries to Rakhine State, where their attacks on the security forces on August 25 triggered a ferocious government crackdown.The government offensive in the north of Rakhine State has sent some 520,000 Rohingya civilians fleeing to Bangladesh and has drawn international condemnation and UN accusations of ethnic cleansing. The government denies ethnic cleansing. It had rebuffed the insurgents ceasefire, saying it did not negotiate with terrorists. Myanmar says more than 500 people have been killed in the violence since late August, most of them insurgents.Even before the government offensive, the small, lightly armed ARSA had only appeared capable of hit-and-run raids on security posts and unable to mount any sort of sustained challenge to the army. Authorities had been on guard over recent days and tightened security in the state capital of Sittwe as the end of the ceasefire approached, a state government spokesman said.We had information that the ARSA could attack but there have been no reports, the spokesman, Min Aung, said early on Tuesday. The insurgents said on Saturday they were ready to respond to any peace move by the government, even though the ceasefire was ending at midnight on Monday.They also reiterated their demand for rights for the Rohingya, who have never been regarded as an indigenous minority in Myanmar and so have been denied citizenship under a law that links nationality to ethnicity. Instead, Rohingya are seen as illegal immigrants with freedoms restricted and rights denied, and are derided by ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, and much of the wider popular in Myanmar, which has seen a surge in Buddhist nationalism in recent years.Thousands more Rohingya villagers have arrived in Bangladesh this week in a new surge of refugees, now also driven by fears of starvation and telling of bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trekking towards the border.Very real threatVillagers in Rakhine said food was running out because rice in the fields was not ready for harvest and the state government had closed village markets and restricted the transport of food, apparently to cut supplies to the militants. While the Myanmar military has engaged in a campaign of violence, there is mounting evidence that Rohingya women, men and children are now also fleeing the very real threat of starvation, rights group Amnesty International said.The government has cited worry about food as one of he reasons people have been giving for leaving, but a senior state government official on Monday dismissed any suggestion of starvation. Myanmar leader and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced scathing international criticism for not doing more to stop the violence, although she has no power over the security forces under a military-drafted constitution.The United States and European Union have been considering targeted sanctions against Myanmar military leaders, diplomats and officials have told Reuters, although they are wary of action that could destabilise the countrys transition to democracy. EU foreign ministers will discuss Myanmar on Oct. 16, and they said in a draft joint statement the bloc will suspend invitations to the commander-in-chief of the Myanmar/Burma armed forces and other senior military officers.Such a move would be largely symbolic, but could be followed by further action. The military campaign against the insurgents is popular inside Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, where there is little sympathy for the Rohingya. Suu Kyis party, in the first attempt to improve relations between religions since the latest violence erupted, will hold inter-faith prayers on Tuesday at a stadium in the biggest city of Yangon, with the participation of Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus and Christians.This is for peace and stability, party spokesman Aung Shin told Reuters.

(Reuters) Exhausted Rohingya refugees arrive by a wooden boat from Myanmar to Shah Porir Dwip, in Teknaf, near Coxs Bazar in Bangladesh, October 1, 2017. (Reuters)For 28-year-old Rohingya Muslim shopkeeper Mohammed Rashid, the evening phone call from organisers of the fledgling insurgent movement came as a surprise. Be ready, was the message. A few hours later, after meeting in the darkness in an open field, he was one of 150 men who attacked a Myanmar Border Guard Police post armed with swords, homemade explosives and a few handguns. At the end of a short battle, half a dozen men he had grown up with in his village were dead. We had no training, no weapons, said Rashid, from the Buthidaung area of Myanmars Rakhine state, who had joined the group just two months earlier. Accounts from some of those, like Rashid, who took part in attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on dozens of police posts early on Aug. 25 paint a picture of a rag-tag band of hopeless, angry villagers, who were promised AK-47 rifles but ended up fighting with sticks and knives.Hundreds joined as recently as June, according to the accounts, and membership meant little more than a knife and messages from leaders on the popular mobile messaging app Whatsapp. Reuters interviewed half a dozen fighters and members of the group now sheltering in Bangladesh, as well as dozens of others among the more than half a million Rohingya refugees who have fled across the border to escape a Myanmar army counteroffensive that the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing. ARSA, which emerged in 2016, says in press releases and video messages from its leader, Ata Ullah, that it is fighting for the rights of the Rohingya, a stateless Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution in mainly Buddhist Myanmar.Myanmar says ARSA is a ruthless Islamist extremist movement that wants to create an Islamic republic in northern Rakhine. Despite the massive suffering inflicted on their communities in the weeks since the August attacks, most of the fighters now stuck in dirt-poor camps said they were determined to continue their fight and some refugees voiced support for the insurgency. Other refugees Reuters spoke to criticised the insurgents for bringing more misery upon them.Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyis spokesman, Zaw Htay, said ARSA had killed many Muslims who had cooperated with the authorities and so people have felt threatened and terrorised into supporting it. He added that Myanmars intelligence showed that religious scholars were prominent in recruiting followers. ARSA denies killing civilians, and did not respond to a request for comment this week. Analysts say the violence could galvanise ARSA members and supporters huddled in the refugee camps and among those Rohingya still in Myanmar, as people feel they have even less to lose.A militancy like this finds fertile ground because of the desperation of the community, said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst and former U.N. official. They are willing to take suicidal steps because they dont see any other choice. Transnational Islamist groups could also try to exploit the desperation in the camps to radicalise people, Horsey added. Al Qaeda last month called for support for the Rohingya.HOMEMADE WEAPONS AND WHATSAPPReuters could not independently verify the individual insurgents stories, but there were broad similarities in all of their accounts. One fighter, 35-year-old Kamal Hussain from a village in Rathedaung in Myanmars Rakhine state, said he joined ARSA when a religious teacher stood in his village square in June, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, and implored a crowd of hundreds to fight. He said we have no choice but to attack Myanmar because our brothers and sisters are being killed day by day. I think everyone joined that day, Hussain said, as he sat under a tarpaulin in a Bangladesh refugee camp. We should attack again and again. I would go back to fight if I had the chance. Unlike longer-serving fighters, most new joiners had little or no training or contact with the groups leaders, who communicated using Whatsapp and delivered rudimentary homemade explosives ahead of the assaults.A third fighter, his account supported by comments from two elders from his village interviewed separately, said he and about 60 men from Myin Hlut signed up three months ago. The 26-year-old, who asked not to be named because he feared arrest by Bangladeshi authorities, said he was among 200 men who attacked another police checkpost in the early hours of Aug. 25. We had only knives and sticks, no guns, he said. They promised us AK-47s but we got nothing. The explosives didnt work. We had two of them for the whole group, but when we threw them nothing happened. About 40 fighters were killed, he said, but added that he would do it again if called on. I still support ARSA, he said. If my leaders call me to go again and fight, I will go back.According to two village-level commanders, there were Whatsapp groups restricted to leaders and others to members. Bigger groups, administered from overseas, were used to build broader community support for ARSA and the Rohingya cause. On his phone, Shoket Ullah, an uncle of the 26-year-old fighter, scrolled through messages posted in the Whatsapp group ARSA.G1, administered through a Saudi phone number, where ARSA press releases, videos of alleged Myanmar military violence and messages of support for Rohingyas were shared. Another Whatsapp group on Ullahs phone, Rohingya Desh Arakan, is administered by someone using a number from Malaysia. Tens of thousands of Rohingya live in both Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.LOCAL BACKINGRohingya anger at Myanmar has long existed, but this is the first serious armed resistance in decades. In the crowded Bangladeshi camps, several refugees voice support for ARSA. I am disappointed and regret what happened but this was pre-planned by the Myanmar government, said Shafi Rahman, a 45-year-old Burmese teacher whose village was burned to the ground the day after the attacks. If ARSA didnt attack, they would have done this to us anyway. Several refugees said some people had begun to sell cattle, vegetables and rice to raise funds for ARSA.Not everyone was supportive, however. When Kamal Hussain, the fighter, argued that ARSA needed to keep fighting, his neighbours in the camp shouted him down. We have lost everything. Violence is not the answer, shouted one elderly man, as muddy water spilled into the tent he now calls home. It is not obvious how fighters would regroup and rebuild after so many have fled across the border or disappeared. Three of the fighters who spoke to Reuters said they had been surprised by the ferocity of the Myanmar militarys response, and within weeks commanders had told their men to put down their weapons and abandon their villages.Several said Whatsapp groups where regional and field commanders from ARSA, which before a rebranding this year called itself al-Yakin, or Faith Movement, would post updates had gone quiet. People who blame this on al-Yakin need to realise my people had to flee in 1978 and in the 1990s when there was no ARSA, said one of the two village-level commanders, who grew up in Bangladesh after his family fled an earlier outbreak of violence, but returned to Myanmar in the 1990s. We should continue to attack. Even women can join.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Around June 2018, we will announce an election date, he said. And around November, we will hold the elections.Thailands military seized power in 2014 and has postponed several deadlines for elections, citing national security concerns and the need to pass new election laws. The junta has said it needs to reform Thailands political system to root out money politics, but the reforms are widely seen as an attempt to prevent a comeback by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatras political machine.Thaksin, a populist with strong support in the countryside, was ousted by the military in an earlier 2006 coup but his allies won subsequent elections. His younger sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was prime minister when the military ousted the government in 2014, and recently fled Thailand to avoid a prison sentence for alleged negligence in overseeing a rice subsidy program.Prayuth said the junta will consider lifting a ban on political activities but not until after late October, when Thailand holds an elaborate five-day funeral for King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died nearly a year ago. He warned political parties against campaigning and said any breaches could result in the ban on political activities being prolonged. This month of October is a period of mourning for us so please let everything be well-ordered and peaceful for now, Prayuth said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Reuters) A boy is pulled to safety as Rohingya refugees scuffle while queuing for aid at Coxs Bazar, Bangladesh. (Reuters)How do you feed and shelter nearly half a million traumatised people who have made their way, over the course of just one month, to a spit of monsoon-soaked land where 300,000 refugees are already living in squalor? That is the challenge for aid workers scrambling to help the Rohingya Muslims now crowded into the Coxs Bazar region of southern Bangladesh after a spasm of violence in Myanmars Rakhine state sent them fleeing across the border.Nothing comparable, in terms of the number of people arriving in such a short space of time, has happened since 1994 in Rwanda, said Christopher Lom, Asia-Pacific spokesman for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).About 480,000 men, women and children have arrived in Coxs Bazar since the end of August, according to United Nations estimates. Most came with nothing more than the clothes they wore. Nearly 200 of the women have given birth since they arrived and another 20,000 are pregnant.Meeting the needs of such a vast number  indefinitely, because there is nowhere else for them to go  in one of the poorest regions of a poor country is a logistical nightmare for the Bangladesh government, U.N. agencies and aid organisations.There was a taste of what was to come in October and November last year, when a smaller outbreak of violence brought and influx of 80,000 Rohingya. That prompted improvements in infrastructure and coordination in Coxs Bazar, said the United Nations local chief coordinator, Robert Watkins. It was working extremely well, he said. And then we got this wave of humanity, and we were overwhelmed.A RECIPE FOR DISASTERU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said after a visit to Coxs Bazar this week that the most urgent needs were shelter, clean water and sanitation. Really the first order of business, the first challenge, is to get people out of the mud and the despair in which they are finding themselves into a place where organised relief can be provided, he told a news conference in Geneva. The combination of limited health facilities, poor sanitary and hygiene conditions and overcrowded sites  is a recipe for disaster in terms of possible epidemics.So far 475 tonnes of aid have arrived at Chittagong airport north of Coxs Bazar, much of it from Muslim-majority countries shocked by the killings and torching of villages in northwestern Rakhine, which UN officials have branded ethnic cleansing. While the initial response was chaotic, say aid experts, due to the sheer volume of people arriving, Bangladesh has since won some praise for improvements in organisation.At a September 14 meeting in the prime ministers office in Dhaka, the authorities made 22 decisions to remove logistical hurdles. According to a document reviewed by Reuters, these included building 14 storage warehouses, regulating aid distribution, protecting orphans, building roads and power infrastructure, and setting up shelters for more than 500,000 people.Mohammad Shah Kamal, Bangladeshs secretary of disaster management and relief and the main coordinator of the aid effort, said the armed forces were scanning shipments of aid and transporting them from airports and ports to Coxs Bazar, where local officials take charge of distribution.I think everyone has been surprised at the Bangladeshi government, said Karim Elguindi, a senior World Food Programme official in Coxs Bazar, noting that it was fast-tracking everything, had offered police support and helped with customs delays.But the Inter-Sector Coordination Group, which is leading the humanitarian response to the influx of Rohingya, said in a recent update that basic coordination was still lacking because staff and agencies had not been assigned to specific camps.SCRAMBLE FOR AIDBangladesh hopes to make room for new arrivals by building a 2,000-acre camp in the Ukhia area of Coxs Bazar. The U.N. says much of this area is not suitable for habitation because it lacks water, sewerage and roads, but many refugees are already settling there anyway.Complicating aid efforts are private civic and religious groups that throw food and clothes off the back of trucks, which experts say is no way to get relief to the neediest. Thousands of tarpaulin shelters that refugees have built in recent weeks stretching across dozens of small hills and rice paddies are only accessible by long walks across flimsy bamboo bridges.Families in one of the most remote parts of the sprawling Kutupalong refugee camp, a 40-minute walk from the nearest official distribution point, said they mostly rely on handouts from relatives to survive.Mushtaq Ahmed, 66, a religious teacher, sheltering from the rain under a tarpaulin, said he has resorted to begging to buy rice for his children and grandchildren. He has tried to throw himself into the scramble for aid thrown from trucks but comes away with nothing. There are too many people rushing, he said. I am too weak to get it.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: AP) North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, left and his exiled half brother Kim Jong Nam, right. (Source: AP)Two women accused of killing the half brother of North Koreas leader plead not guilty as trial begins in Malaysia. They were accused of poisoning the estranged half brother of North Koreas ruler arrived for the beginning of their trial Monday in Malaysias High Court, nearly eight months after the brazen airport assassination. Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are suspected of smearing Kim Jong Nams face with the banned VX nerve agent on Feb. 13 at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, killing him within about 20 minutes. The women say they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera show.The women are the only suspects in custody in a killing that South Koreas spy agency said was part of a five-year plot by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to kill a brother he reportedly never met. Police say several North Koreans suspected of involvement left the country on the day of the attack and others were allowed to leave later in a diplomatic deal with Pyongyang.The two women, who face the death penalty if convicted, will plead not guilty, their lawyers said. District Assistant Commissioner of Police Shafien Mamat confirmed that both suspects arrived at the court Monday morning.Prosecutors will then start to call their witnesses, with the first few likely to be medical experts to establish the cause of death, said Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Huongs lawyer. The trial is expected to last for about two months, after which the judge will decide if there is a strong case for the women to have to mount their defense, Teh said.Kim, who was 45 or 46, was the eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding, yet he reportedly fell out of favor in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He had been living abroad for years and at the time of his death was traveling on a North Korean diplomatic passport under the name Kim Chol.North Korea has a long history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime, though Kim was not thought to be seeking influence over his younger brother. He had, however, spoken out publicly against his familys dynastic control of the reclusive, nuclear-armed nation.Pyongyang has denied any role in the killing and has not even acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam. It has suggested the victim died of a heart attack and accused Malaysia of working with South Korean and other hostile forces in blaming Pyongyang.The trial will be closely watched by the Indonesian and Vietnamese governments, which have hired lawyers to defend the women.Aisyahs core defense will be that she didnt know she had poison on her hand when she smeared Kims face and was instead the victim of an elaborate trick, her lawyer Gooi Soon Seng said. The 25-year-old was at a pub in Kuala Lumpur in early January when she was recruited by a North Korean man to star in what he said were video prank shows, Gooi said.Over the course of several days, the North Korean, who went by the name James, had Aisyah go out to malls, hotels and airports and rub oil or pepper sauce on strangers, which he would film on his phone, the lawyer said.Aisyah was paid $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as an escort, Gooi said.In late January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia, where James introduced her to a man called Chang, who said he was the producer of video prank shows for the Chinese market, the lawyer said. Back in Malaysia, Chang asked Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days before Kim was attacked. At the airport on the day of Kims death, Chang pointed him out to Aisyah as the next target and put the poison on her hand, the lawyer said.Police say neither Chang nor James were who they say they were. Chang was actually Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who left Malaysia on the day of the killing, while James was Ri Ji U, one of another three North Koreans who hid inside their countrys embassy in Kuala Lumpur to avoid questioning.Those three were later allowed to fly home in exchange for nine Malaysians allowed to leave Pyongyang in a deal easing the countries diplomatic tensions. Gooi said James was key to Aisyahs defense and that his absence could weaken her case.Aisyah, who has a son, has wrote to her family and told them to pray for her so that the case will be over soon and I can go back home.The 29-year-old Vietnamese suspect Huong was caught on airport security surveillance camera wearing a white sweatshirt emblazoned with the big black letters LOL _ the acronym for laughing out loud. Little is known about her. Raised in a rice farm in northern Vietnam, her family said they had hardly heard from her since she left home a decade ago.She made postings on a Facebook page under the name Ruby Ruby, according to her niece, Dinh Thi Quyen.Photos on the page show Huong wearing a white shirt that says LOL, like the one seen during the attack. It shows her posing for selfies in January in Cambodia and in Kuala Lumpur a few days before the attack.Her last post was on the morning of Feb. 11, two days before the attack, from an area near the airport.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

For the half-year ended 30 September 2017, the company posted lower revenue from operations of Rs1,969.1 crore as compared to Rs2,015.5 crore for the corresponding quarter in FY17, it said.The half-yearly performance was affected due to a poor first quarter and the impact of introduction of goods and services tax (GST). The company reported a profit of Rs302.3 crore in first half of financial year 2017-18, said the release.We achieved a 6 per cent growth in Q2, FY18 compared to Q2, FY17. Sales figures for the corresponding quarter of last year included excise duty, which is now included in GST. Liquidation continued to be impacted because of erratic monsoons and uneven rainfall distribution. Looking ahead, we expect the difficult market conditions to persist. Therefore our outlook for Q3 remains modest, Bayer CropScience managing director Richard van der Merwe said.Elaborating on the highlights for first half of FY18, Merwe said, Bayer CropScience continued to introduce innovation to the Indian market in the form of new product launches. In crop protection, we launched two new insecticides: Sivanto prime for okra and Movento for chillies.The company has also launched a new fungicide, Emesto Prime for potatoes. In seeds, we launched three new rice hybrids: Arize AZ 8433 DT, Arize AZ 6453 and Arize AZ 6508. Arize 8433 DT is our hybrid rice seed with inbuilt protection against one of the worst pests in Indian rice fields, the brown plant hopper (BPH).

Photo: AFPGeneva: Indias hopes of securing a simple and effective permanent solution for public stockholding programs (PSH) for food security hang in the balance after Australia, Pakistan, the European Union, and the United States rallied around a Russian proposal that New Delhi first agree to onerous conditions for availing of the legal instrument.The permanent solution is a core demand of India and other members of the G33 farm coalition led by Indonesia for the World Trade Organizations eleventh ministerial conference in Buenos Aires beginning 10 December. Trade ministers had mandated WTO members to finalize the permanent solution for PSH at the conference.According to people familiar with the development, on 1 November, the chair for Doha agriculture negotiations ambassador Stephan Karau held a closed-door meeting with trade envoys of the European Union, Brazil, India, and deputy trade envoys of China and the US, Russia, Australia, Pakistan, Norway, and Singapore, among others, to discuss two issues: transparency and notification requirements; and safeguards for the proposed permanent solution.Russia presented a seven-page restricted draft ministerial decision of 13 December 2017 that listed the notification and transparency provisions as well as anti-circumvention/safeguard conditions. Among others, it suggests prior notification before implementing the PSH programme about the value of stocks to be acquired and the average value of production for the previous three years of the product concerned.It also wants India and other developing countries to agree to seven burdensome anti-circumvention/safeguard conditions. The conditions include (i) ensuring that stocks procured for PSH programs do not distort trade or adversely affect the food security of other members; (ii) the beneficiaries will be barred if they do not present a full complete notification within the established timeframe; (iii) India and other G33 members must ensure no direct export from the (PSH) stocks shall occur upon the release of products from the stocks nor any release of products from the stocks shall occur on the condition that they are exported; (iv) India and other users of the PSH programmes must ensure that there cannot be any increase of exports by an agreed percentage of products procured for PSH programme for food security;(v) applied tariffs for the products meant for PSH programs shall not exceed (X%) of the average applied tariffs in the period of 2013-17; (vi) India and other developing countries which are currently exporting rice and other agricultural products will not be able to use the permanent solution if their exports of rice or other products meant for PSH exceed 5% of global export share of the product; (vii) entities like the state trading corporation (STC) cannot engage in export of products procured under PSH programmes.India, however, challenged the Russian proposal on both transparency and safeguard conditions. Indias trade envoy J.S. Deepak said the transparency requirements demanded cannot be implemented by even major industrialized countries in the normal course. India presented concrete evidence of the transparency requirements that are normally suggested for implementing WTO agreements and the intrusive conditions demanded for the permanent solution, according to a personwho was present at the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity.Deepak said India will not accept any additional safeguard conditions beyond that stipulated in the Bali interim decision on a peace clause for PSH programmes, the person said.The Bali decision said any developing Member seeking coverage of programmes shall ensure that stocks procured under such programmes do not distort trade or adversely affect the food security of other Members.Representatives of China and Indonesia present at the meeting supported Indias tough stance that it is ready to negotiate on transparency and safeguards but will not go beyond the Bali interim decision, the person said.In sharp opposition, Australia said it cannot accept any Bali-minus outcome, suggesting that it fully supports the Russian proposal. The US suggested Bali is a good starting point but suggested that they would support the Russian demand for safeguard requirements except in one or two areas.Pakistan called for enhanced safeguards maintaining it was willing to look into reduced transparency and notification requirements, but only if safeguards are further strengthened. Singapore said the outcome on permanent solution must be in accordance with the Bali interim decision but it must not impose conditions on exports, according to another person present at the meeting.In all probability, several issues concerning the safeguards, particularly the commitment to ensure that stocks procured for PSH programs are not exported will go to the wire in or Buenos Aires and might require the highest political intervention, said an African trade official who asked not to be named.The chair has convened another meeting of eight important countries- the US, the EU, China, India, Brazil, Australia, Norway, Russia, and Indonesia on Tuesday to explore whether there can be further convergence on transparency and safeguards."
5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

(Right) Sukara Ramava leaving the fair price shop with a bag of rice procured using her card.Serish NanisettiOne year to the day of demonetisation announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ibrahimpur, a village about 125 km from Hyderabad, presents a success story created out of trial and error by the villagers.The first stop at the village is the fair price shop used by the villagers to access the Rs. 1 kilo rice given by the government. The shop owner, Venkat Raju, has three devices on the table. A fingerprint reader connected to a tablet-sized device with a bill printer. He also has a pin validator for making the online transactions. A grizzled old woman walks in with a bag, puts her thumb on the Aadhaar card reader and in no time, she steps out with a bag of rice.Deposit it, swipe it and take it. It has become very easy to do these transactions. Earlier, I had to get the ration book and money, now I just walk in and take the ration, says Sukara Ramava, who lives yards away from the fair price shop.The journey of the village to become the first cashless village in Telangana began in the immediate aftermath of demonetisation. While millions were rendered helpless, Ibrahimpur moved on to becoming a cashless village with a little push from savvy village folk led by the Sarpanchs son Kumbala Yella Reddy.We got these devices on December 5 and began cashless transactions. There are 312 ration cards and so far, there has not been a single failure. Once in a while, there is validation problem. Then we use the ATM pin to carry out the transaction, says Mr. Raju, the shop owner.We had trouble with the swipe machines as we had to pay rent to use them. We returned them and switched over to this, says Praveen, a kirana shop owner, pointing to a small nifty gizmo. The thumb-sized device is a fingerprint reader connected to a smart phone and is used for making transactions using the e-Vyapar app of Andhra Bank. You need an Aadhaar verified bank account and you can buy anything costing upwards of Rs. 1, says Praveen.The glitchy cellphone connectivity in the village has been overcome with a provision of free Wi-Fi coverage created by the State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL). Earlier, we had to push people to go cashless, but now it has become a habit. Many havent had cash with them in some time. Even daily-wage workers are getting paid online and they dont complain as they can buy anything without carrying cash with them, says Navin Reddy, a village elder.The pice de rsistance of the village is the Any Time Water machine. Villagers walk in, swipe their card and get 20 litres of RO filtered water. Earlier, we used to have a person manning this. Now, the operator comes twice a day. For Rs. 50, villagers get 40 litres of water per day for a month, says Jetti Bhasker, a villager."

Farmers were worried that only Rameswaram, where there was no cultivation activity and a few pockets of the district, have received rains.It is disgusting to wake up to see bright sunshine in the last three days when rain pounded several parts of the State, Maduraiveeran, a farmer in Pandiyur in Nainarkoil block says.The district witnessed 100% crop loss last year after the failure of north east monsoon and the farmers could not afford to suffer another consecutive loss, he says.Officials in the Agriculture department said farmers have completed direct sowing of paddy in 1.25 lakh hectares and pinned their hopes on the monsoon.The crops were 5 to 20 days old and so far, only parts of Kadaladi block, Mudukulathur, Kamuthi and Sathirakudi areas received some amount of rains, they said.Thiruvadanai block, considered the rice bowl of the district and majority of other areas have not received rain so far, they rued. The crops would wilt and wither if the district did not receive rain within ten days, they said.Attack of army worms in some areas in the absence of rains added to the woes of the farmers, they added.After the Meteorological department warned of heavy rains on Thursday, the district administration had asked the Block development officers, Revenue inspectors and Village administrative officers to stay overnight in their respective headquarters only to be disappointed.Zero cultivationHowever, heavy rain lashed only Rameswaram island on Thursday. As the coastal areas, where there was zero cultivation received good rains during most of the monsoon seasons, boosting the districts average rainfall figure, the district administration has written to the government to remove the rain gauge stations from the coastal areas, officials said.Collector S. Natarajan said that the district has so far received only 64.7 mm of rainfall during the northeast monsoon. Most of the rains were, however, in Rameswaram and other coastal areas, he said."

The share price later recovered some of its losses to end the day down 7.6%.The Princes office was not reachable for comment.With this (crackdown), the kingdom heralds a new era and policy of transparency, clarity and accountability, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan was quoted as saying by SPA. The decisive decisions will preserve the investment environment and boost trust in the rule of law.The kingdom's top council of clerics also lauded the anti-corruption efforts as important, essentially giving religious backing to the crackdown. An aviation source told AFP that security forces had grounded private jets at airports, possibly to prevent high-profile figures from leaving the country.The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history, said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, if true, would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community, Mr. Ulrichsen told AFP.The purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed business leaders to Riyadh for an investment summit."

Chaudhary.Responding to a question on the impact of GST on Indias rank next year, the Minister said when issues regarding streamlining of taxation are sorted out, together with the proper implementation of the incentive system as well as healthy competition among States to attract domestic and foreign investments, they will help the country break into the top 50, most likely next year.The World Bank report, which assessed reforms implemented in 190 countries from June 2, 2016 to June 1, 2017, did not take GST into account as it could be rolled out only from July 1 this year. India was ranked 100th this year, up from 130th last year.Paying taxesOn the parameter of paying taxes, in which Indias rank improved from 172 last year to 119 this year, the bank had said, India made paying taxes easier by making payment of EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) mandatory electronically and introducing a set of administrative measures easing compliance with corporate income tax. This reform applies to both Delhi and Mumbai.Earlier, speaking at an event on ease of doing business organised by the industry body Assocham, We need to think about providing incentives to the industry and we have been simplifying the procedures.

We requested them to at least give us time, we have to make the farmer aware not to use this pesticide. They have given us time till December 31, 2017.

In order to curtail this practice, we are going to arrange a special check-post at the port and seek warehouse-wise self-declarations from exporters, he said, while asking the officials of the civil supplies department to conduct inspection of warehouses.

The committee members checked the case sheet, X-ray reports, and the patients details, based on which they concluded that there was prima facie evidence of medical negligence in the surgery performed on S. Chalapati, a rice mill worker, on October 3.Mr. Intiyaz said the radiologist had given a report based on the X-ray, which showed the presence of the scissors in the abdomen of the patient. Following this, the doctors carried out surgery for the second time in the last week of October.Instead of mentioning it as scissors in the case sheet, the doctors used the term foreign body, saying that it had necessitated the second surgery. The description of the foreign body was given there.As the inquiry was conducted following an order from the A.P. Human Rights Commission (APHRC), the officials asked the doctors to submit their statements in writing to the committee by Friday. DMHO Ramadevi, hospital superintendent Radhakrishnam Raju, and DCHS Subba Rao were members on the committee.The Joint Collector, the DMHO, and the superintendent were giving separate reports on their findings, and the same would be sent to the HRC in two or three days. Meanwhile, the scissors left in the patients stomach was stated to be a curved forceps, and this surgical tool was used along with absorbent gauze and cotton to clean blood inside the body at the time of the surgery. District Collector R. Mutyala Raju personally conducted surprise checks, which led to the suspension of the doctors. But after a few weeks, the doctors managed to get appointed in the same positions."

In last ten days, nine farmers have ended their lives over crop loss. It is deja vu for states farming community.Two years ago, a spate of farmer suicides prompted the state government to announce a `1,000 crore drought package. The tragic suicides did not stop and the toll went past 130. Not one was officially attributed to farm sector distress by the state government.This kharif season, the first report of suicide came in a day after the Naveen Patnaik government announced one such package following an assessment that paddy crop over 3.17 lakh hectare were damaged by scanty rainfall in 15 districts. The announcement was a virtual repetition of 2015.Nothing seems to have changed in states farm sector though the government has a new worry this time around. While it was preparing to combat drought-perpetrated crop-loss, vast tracts of croplands in western Odisha were found to have been enveloped by a massive pest attack.But it took a suicide to jolt the government out of its slumber. A 52-year-old farmer Brunda Sahu from Bargarh district  considered Odishas rice bowl  consumed pesticides a day after setting his crops to fire. His desperate bid to save the remaining crops has now spread like wildfire with farmers from other districts following suit.The pest attacks started during September-end but it was ignored by the Government as yet another spell of annual infestation before snowballing into a full-fledged crisis by third week of October. By then, things were beyond control.Sahus extreme bid was not just about pest infestation, it has shown how disconnected the BJD government is with the farm sector. The government went in for drought damage assessment in October but had no inkling of the pest attack. It was only when the outrage grew after Sahus suicide that it sought a detailed report. As things stand today, a whopping 1.78 lakh hectare land in nine districts have been damaged by pest attack.Faced with a complete wipeout of their crops, farmers have been driven to the brink. Already reeling under devastation caused by drought, they have resorted to increased use of insecticides and pesticides on their own with no technical or financial support coming in from the administration. While input costs have mounted, plant protection measures have failed driving them to the brink.The crisis has also exposed how unprepared the agriculture-dependent state is to vagaries of climate change. Patterns of pest attacks are known to change with climate and this year, untimely showers, high levels of humidity and temperature fuelled the problem but farmers received no technical inputs from government to tackle the menace.There was no clear cut instruction sent by the Agriculture Department about what protocol the farmers must follow to tackle such unprecedented pest attack. Though reports of overuse of pesticides and their sub-standard quality have come to fore now, it is too late for the Department to act. In many districts, positions of Plant Protection Officers have been lying vacant for years. So, what help could the farmers have received than going on their own is anyones guess.As death and destruction stalk the farmlands, governments drought assistance is unlikely to be available before February. Besides, the aid of `6,800 per hectare is too little to compensate for the huge expenses farmers have incurred and comes too late because by then Rabi season would be long gone. The only option in sight for helpless farmers has been to salvage what is left by torching the fields so that they can go ahead with winter crops.According to the National Sample Survey (NSS), the average monthly income of an Odisha farmer is a little less than `5,000, way low than the national average of `6,426. Dwindling earnings and increased dependence on modern farming techniques, fertilisers and pesticides have exposed them to greater economic insecurity over the years.Yet the government is little bothered. Its reaction has been varied - from knee-jerk to downright insensitive. Agriculture minister Damodar Rout, a seasoned politician, first advised the farmers not to torch their crops terming it as Goddess Laxmi and a day later cautioned that such acts will not entitle them to any compensation due to the existing Relief Code.That the Relief Code needs an amendment is an understatement but what could one expect of the government which has not been able to ratify a Land Leasing Law which seeks to protect the interests of sharecroppers in times of farm crisis.Sharecroppers form a large chunk of actual cultivators and non-recognition of their rights prevent their access to financial assistance pushing them to the edge. Brunda Sahu was one example. Despite recurring farm sector crisis, the government has not been able to give a final shape to the law even after several meetings of the Inter-Ministerial Committee in last two years.In last 12 years, over 2,000 farmers have killed themselves in the state which points at serious signs of distress in the sector. But so far, the Naveen Patnaik government has remained in denial.Now is not the time. The CM must break his silence on the grave issue and show his government is actually with farmers, not just pay lip service.Siba MohantyDeputy Resident Editor, OdishaEmail: sibamohanty@newindianexpress.com"

The Marhaura factory is being set up and I think it's on track,"" Goyal said at a press conference.The minister's comments came a day after GE vice-chairman John Rice flew down to meet him and other stakeholders in a bid to ensure that the project was not derailed due to the railway ministry's change of heart. Efforts have also been initiated at the diplomatic level to ensure that the project is not impacted with the foreign ministry and the commerce and industry ministry also stepping in.The railways has signed a $2.5 billion contract with GE for 20 years for the project. Termination of the contract will send a negative signal to investors, both at home and overseas, as the Narendra Modi government had cleared the Marhaura facility for diesel locomotives and a similar project for electric ones with Alstom in Madhepura, also in Bihar. Both the projects were conceived by Lalu Prasad during his stint as railway minister but the UPA failed to clear them.Questions were raised about the diesel loco project after Goyal argued that the railways would accelerate electrification of tracks. The minister said he had a discussion with top GE executives a few days ago to explore how the objectives of reducing pollution, bringing down overall cost and honouring agreements with the global conglomerate could be met. Goyal said he discussed how the locomotives could be useful for the railways, considering its emphasis on electrification.""Can we explore opportunities that some of these (locos) could be exported? Can we look at opportunities where we can meet the objectives of reducing pollution, saving cost and make sure the contracts and agreements that are made by the railways continue to serve the people of India,"" he said.Minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha was more forthright. ""There will be no danger to GE (project),"" he said. He, however, was quick to add, ""It's no rocket science to convert a diesel locomotive into an electric one. If it can happen in Varanasi, then it can happen anywhere.""He said the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi had been making both electric and diesel locos.The Marhaura project, which was announced in 2006-07, was fast-tracked after the Modi government came to power and GE won the contract in 2015 to supply railways with 1,000 diesel locomotives."

This year, Vidyarambham or ezhuthiniruthu as it is popularly known in Kerala, falls on September 30. Temples and some of the educational institutions have already made arrangements for the Hindu tradition observed on the Vijaya Dasami day, where children are initiated into the characters of the syllabary.K Unnikrishnan, a Malayali settled in Chennai says that Vidyarambham is not confined to only Malayalis in the city. ""Over a period of time, irrespective of the place of origin, parents have been bringing their children for the ritual,"" he says.As part of the tradition, children below three years are given a head bath and made to wear new clothes. They are either taken to a nearby temple or an educational institution of repute, where the chief priest, well-known educationists or writers write Om on their tongue using a gold ring, while chanting the mantra, Om hari sri ganapataye namah, Avikhnamasthu, Sree Guruve Namah, Sree Saraswathi Sahayam, meaning Salutations to Hari (Lord Vishnu), Shree (the Goddess of prosperity), and Lord Ganapathy.Later, they are made to write the alphabets on rice spread on a decorated plate, using their fingers. It's believed that children initiated into learning on the auspicious day of Vijaya Dasami do well in studies and become prosperous.While many parents take their kids to temples dedicated to Goddess Saraswathi , in many parts of Kerala, irrespective of the community or religion, Vidyarambham is conducted even in churches. "" Kollur Mookambika temple is famous for Vidyarambham and scores of children assemble there for Vijaya Dasami. However, in Chennai, several temples, educational institutions and even media houses conduct the ceremony,"" says Satya Bhama, a resident of Egmore.She adds, ""Vidyarambham highlights the importance of education. Our ancestors considered education as a power and this festival symbolises the same."" Mahalingapuram temple in the city is abuzz with activities related to Vijaya Dasami. ""Nearly thousand children perform Vidyarambham in the temple and this year will be no different,"" says a source. He adds, ""Ten priests of the temple will be initiating kids into learning on Dasami. The programme will start at 7 am and is expected to continue till noon."" Though there is no registration fee or advance booking for Vidyarambham, parents are requested to bring a plate for the child to write the syllables.""We have about 450 plates with us. But we request parents to bring their own plates so that the waiting time can be reduced. We charge `30 per child and all other materials like rice, prasad, notebooks and pencils are given free to the kids,"" he says. The other temples that are known for Vidyarambham include the Ayyappan temples in Perambur, KK Nagar and Egmore. Similarly, on Anderson Road and Velachery, educational institutions have organized Vidyarambham.Manoj Kumar K, a resident of Chetpet, is excited that his daughter Kalyani will be participating in Vidyarambham on Saturday. He says, ""It's a joyous moment for all of us in the family. Though we initially thought of taking her to an institution, we have changed the plan now. We will be doing Vidyarambham at Mahalingapuram temple as it is considered more auspicious. Later, we plan to take a detour of the places where similar programmes are organised.""Unnikrishan says that many parents prefer temples this year as certain planetary movements are considered to clash with the Vijaya Dasami day. ""It is believed that if you perform auspicious rituals in temples, it can nullify the ill-effects of bad planetary alignments. Hence, many are opting to visit the temples, this time for Vidyarambham,"" he says."

They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

A special team of scientists led by Chief of Crop Protection Division Dr Mayabini Jena has been touring some of the worst affected districts - Bargarh, Ganjam and Gajapati to conduct a detailed study.The team will collect samples of the pest and also detailed information, including the varieties of paddy seeds used, time and method of cultivation, quality and condition of soil. They will also prepare a plan to curb the menace of the pest attack, said Director, NRRI, Cuttack, Dr Himansu Pathak. The team is likely to submit its reports for necessary investigation and research works, Pathak said. Preliminary investigation has ascertained that Brown Plant Hoppers are making reproducing rapidly due to favourable environment that evolved this year, he said adding environment with excess humidity and middle standard warmth facilitate BPH to multiply in numbers.The humidity level had continued to remain high in the atmosphere for more days and there was no substantial relief from the warmth because of incessant rain due to low pressure during the time while the paddy plants were at the flowering stage in the current season, Pathak ascertained adding that NRRI has already found a scientific method to save crops from pest attack. Besides, those farmers who have sown different varieties of paddy seeds having low resistance suffer total crop loss due to pest attack, he said and advised the farmers to opt for paddy seeds having high resistance power in order to keep their crops away from pests."

Naturally, everything was done to make the stay of UAE Supreme Council member and ruler of Sharjah, HH Sheikh Dr Sultan Bin Muhammed Al Qasimi , a comfortable one.There were a series of discussions and important announcements but by all accounts, the Sultan was pleased with the arrangements, especially the cuisine that was carefully put together by the chefs at the luxury hotel in Kovalam where he stayed.After savouring the hot and flaky Kerala porottas along with Travancore mutton perattu, the Sultan paid a compliment in Malayalam  kollaam. That's not the only Malayalam word he knows since he was taken care of by a Malayali nanny during his childhood. The Kerala connection doesn't end there; his children had a tutor in Anandi Ramachandran from Thiruvananthapuram.The special menu included Arabian, naadan and Malabar delicacies. ""He didn't have any meal preference, but conveyed his wish to savour all kinds of Kerala dishes during his stay. He loved katta thairu (thick curd), puthari rice with mango pulisserry and pine apple pulisserry and in payasams he loved mulayari, ilaneer and ada. We also made not-so-spicy fish curries using fresh water fish like poomeen, kanambu, and chemballi besides crab and squid,"" says Roy Satheeshan , executive chef. ""Arabic dishes including chicken mandi, roasted lamb and appetisers like baba ghanoush and moutabbal were also served."" Not to mention kahwa, the Arabian coffee.Perhaps no one has closer links to the royal family than Anandi Ramachandran, who had served as tutor for the four children of the Sheikh for chemistry and physics at the royal palace. Sitting at her residence in Nedumangadu, she remembers that her royal students did not have any airs about them and were obedient. When the sessions used to extend beyond two hours, she says, the kids would request her for a break. ""I was closer to the Sheikh's wife, Sheikha Jawaher Bint Mohammed Al Qasimi whom we call Shaykha. She would address me as Mrs Rama and always made me feel like a member of their family.""Anandi, who worked as a teacher in Sharjah, says that she was drafted in for this special role after she had retired from her service in Sharjah. Initially, she taught the Sheikh's eldest daughter Bedoor, who was a Class 11 student, and after she passed with flying colours, was put in charge of the other three children too. ""During school vacation, the royal family shifts to their palace in London, so I used to be flown there via a chartered aircraft.""She adds: ""The Sheikh and his wife had thanked me for helping the children in their studies. Sultan even gave me a signed book with wishes."""
5a157c409855b76bf13ee685,Marhaura loco factory project on track: Railway minister Piyush Goyal,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/marhaura-loco-factory-project-on-track-goyal/articleshow/60875599.cms,2017-09-29,"NEW DELHI: Railway minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that work on GE's $200 million diesel locomotive factory in Marhaura (Bihar) was ""on track"", rejecting reports that the government may terminate the contract with the US giant as the transporter seeks to speed up electrification of tracks.""Our government does not make any sudden changes in policy... we take considered decisions. The Marhaura factory is being set up and I think it's on track,"" Goyal said at a press conference.The minister's comments came a day after GE vice-chairman John Rice flew down to meet him and other stakeholders in a bid to ensure that the project was not derailed due to the railway ministry's change of heart. Efforts have also been initiated at the diplomatic level to ensure that the project is not impacted with the foreign ministry and the commerce and industry ministry also stepping in. The railways has signed a $2.5 billion contract with GE for 20 years for the project.Termination of the contract will send a negative signal to investors, both at home and overseas, as the Narendra Modi government had cleared the Marhaura facility for diesel locomotives and a similar project for electric ones with ABB in Madhepura, also in Bihar. Both the projects were conceived by Lalu Prasad during his stint as railway minister but the UPA failed to clear them. Questions were raised about the diesel loco project after Goyal argued that the railways would accelerate electrification of tracks. The minister said he had a discussion with top GE executives a few days ago to explore how the objectives of reducing pollution, bringing down overall cost and honouring agreements with the global conglomerate could be met. Goyal said he discussed how the locomotives could be useful for the railways, considering its emphasis on electrification.""Can we explore opportunities that some of these (locos) could be exported? Can we look at opportunities where we can meet the objectives of reducing pollution, saving cost and make sure the contracts and agreements that are made by the railways continue to serve the people of India,"" he said.Minister of state for railways Manoj Sinha was more forthright. ""There will be no danger to GE (project),"" he said. Sinha, however, was quick to add, ""It's no rocket science to convert a diesel locomotive into an electric one. If it can happen in Varanasi, then it can happen anywhere.""He said the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) in Varanasi had been making both electric and diesel locos.The Marhaura project, which was announced in 2006-07, was fast-tracked after the Modi government came to power and GE won the contract in 2015 to supply railways with 1,000 diesel locomotives.As per the agreement, GE was to set up a manufacturing facility in Bihar, and two maintenance sheds elsewhere in the country, to service the locomotives over 11 years."

As per his suicide note, Kamaldeep had allegedly taken his life after being harassed and intimated by certain officials in a case of alleged misappropriation of paddy during kharif season 2016-17 by Sardar Agro Industries in Sadatpur village in Malerkotla . The CM has also ordered an inquiry against Iqbal for interfering in the registration of a criminal case against the miller on reference of the PUNSUP district manager at Tarn Taran.He has also directed the DGP to look into the circumstances leading up to the suicide. A spokesperson at the chief minister's office said the CM also gave a go ahead for registration of a criminal case against the proprietor of Sardar Agro, who had already confessed to embezzling paddy worth nearly Rs. 2.5 crore.Amarinder also directed the secretary of the Mandi Board to immediately suspend licenses of arthias (commission agents) at Kairon, Khemkaran and Sabran Mandis of Tarn Taran district for conspiring with the proprietor to embezzle paddy lifted under the release order scheme.

Apart from the ordeal, people may have to put up with hardships at the terminus as it is not prepared to handle the massive footfall thanks to poor amenities.Filthy toilets, poor housekeeping and stale food greet passengers at the CMBT. The facility is maintained by the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). Munnar-bound passenger Ranjth said, ""The housekeeping services at the terminus are very poor. The biggest problem is the smelly toilets, while the floors are dirty,"" he said.During weekends, CMBT records an average footfall of two lakh passengers. However, it increases by one and half times during the festival season with long weekends like the Durga pooja holidays beginning Friday. Another passenger Anbu complained that the quality of food sold at the stalls in the terminus was not good and also costly. ""The cost of a packet of tamarind rice is Rs 60 and it tastes poor. Passengers have no choice as they are left with no other option within the premises of the terminus,"" he added.A visit to the place on Wednesday found water leaking from the ceiling near the bay for buses departing to southern districts. The terminus with a capacity to park 450 buses is likely to operate at least 3,000 buses, of which 1,000 are special ones, to different parts of the state from Thursday. The special buses have already started arriving at the terminus since Wednesday morning.When contacted, officials at CMBT said adequate basic amenities are available at the terminus. There are no issues with housekeeping, the sources added."
5a1588e29855b76bf13eea63,The quiet charms of Khichdi,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Citycitybangbang/the-quiet-charms-of-khichdi/,2017-11-06,"It now appears that there is no proposal to anoint Khichdi as the national dish of India, but regardless of whether khichdi deserves that title or not and glossing over the question of whether in a country like ours, any one dish can or should be classified as such, it certainly gives us an occasion to talk about something that has been a significant part of most of our lives.The sniffy comments about this simple dish made by assorted food snobs tell one part of the story. The experts on health and culinary tradition have other stories to tell. As someone who has grown up relishing khichdi, what follows is a very personal tribute to this humble dish.The simplest possible combination of the two major food groups, khichdi is food at its comforting best. A hot meal of khichdi shushes the senses, evens out temperamental stomachs, and satiates without leaving any residue behind; khichdi burps taste of nothing.My memories of khichdi are many. In our Gujarati household that lived outside the state most of the time, khichdi was most commonly our Sunday lunch. It was a meal that was looked forward to with quiet pleasure; it had a wholesome quality that made for hearty satisfaction.The consistency that was most preferred was wet without becoming runny, with grains just a little bit squished up. Ghee was poured in generous quantities; as children it was fun to make a mound of the khichdi dig a little hole in the centre and fill it up with ghee. Into this mixture went some spiced potatoes, a special jeera-clad onion salad, chaas, papad and some mango pickle. Together, this unfussy confluence of simple tastes came together week after week in a very precise way.The masterful simplicity of each ingredient in the meal bears reflection. Rice, dal with almost no spices, cooked without ceremony. Unlike the idea of khichdi as mish-mash (kya khichdi paka rahe ho?), an ungainly dumping together of disparate ingredients, the reality about it was the wordless harmony that existed between the two major food sects.Khichdi blended rice and dal together as if they belonged. Ghee, which makes the world feel plumper, adding a rich emulsion of pleasure to anything it is poured on, accentuated the bland fullness of the taste. Potatoes, that staple filler of blank spaces with several kinds of awesomeness, cooked with mustard seeds and left dry. Papad, the provider of crunchy service on demand, the attendant always ready to confer its crackle on a meal. Pickle, the little bite sized compression of a universe of very expressive flavours, seething naughtily in its own juices. Onion, the simple slice of a food that served as spice, an ingredient that turned any dish slightly sideways, a dash of knowing worldly wisdom added to things bland.In our house, with khichdi, and only with it, the onion was slathered in oil with jeera and salt sprinkled on it, and set off the potatoes particularly well. And to top it off, Chaas, gentle and kind, making ones stomach, and by extension the world, a calmer place.In some parts of the country, khichdi is looked down upon as the diet for those convalescing. This makes it the poor cousin of food, the stuff we make do with when our bodies are not quite ready for the real thing. I have never quite understood this view of khichdi, for it passes up on the pleasures of simplicity and confuses it with ordinariness.The idea that food must always perform, that it must necessarily transport us somewhere else, is a rigid view of its role in our lives. There is a time and place for that, indeed there must be for food is travel, and food is music, but food is also home.And the thing is, getting simple meals right is not easy. A cup of tea, scrambled eggs, nimbu-paani, coconut chutney- these everyday foods are very elusive when it comes to getting proportions just right. Khichdi is no exception, and getting the balance of the ingredients right was both very easy and extremely rare.With some people, notably mothers, getting khichdi right was effortless while in other cases, something always seemed a little off. With simple foods, it all comes down to proportion, timing, touch, restraint, love- there is no particular technique or skill involved, nothing dramatic by way of ingredients or presentation. The person cooking works with very little, and do so with instinct, as a habit. Perhaps, simple staple foods are nothing but an organic overflow of the person cooking.Khichdi derives its power from what it is not. It chooses to sidestep the flashy culinary razzle dazzle, choosing instead to let the taste come to the food, rather than the other way around. There might well be other ways of defending this noble food, perhaps from the perspective of health, perhaps even from the standpoint of culinary heritage, but personally, the truth that khichdi spoke had nothing to do with these. It held things together, it sat in the middle of everything, right at the centre with no interest in anything that lies at the edges. Khichdi is home, comfort without any reason, taste without any credentials.The stomach full with a hot meal sleeps easy. We regain an alignment with the world, things slip back into place, afternoon heat settles on us, and our eyes find it no longer useful to stay open. Slipping into khichdi-induced sleep on a hot summer Sunday, under a reluctant fan, the distant buzz of some insect, life takes on a timeless drone of inevitability. The complex, the layered and the textured can be great, but only the simple can be perfect."
5a158b959855b76bf13eeaf2,Open Up: Fifth North East Festival in Delhi highlights the need to reverse ghettoisation of Northeasterners,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/talkingturkey/open-up-fifth-north-east-festival-in-delhi-highlights-the-need-to-reverse-ghettoisation-of-northeasterners/,2017-11-06,"The past weekend saw the fifth edition of the North East Festival Connecting People, Celebrating Life being held in Delhi. The festival is a grand platform to showcase Northeast culture that brings together artistes from the Northeast states, Northeast cuisine and the Northeast diaspora in the national capital. It is three days of festivities where denizens of Delhi can deepen their understanding of the Northeast  a rich, diverse and beautiful part of the country inhabited by warm and simple people.And like previous editions, the North East Festival this time around too saw massive footfalls with musicians such as Zubeen Garg, Papon and Alobo Naga performing foot-tapping numbers. Also on display were the creative designs of Northeast fashion designers  a much anticipated segment of the festival each year. The myriad food stalls from every state of the Northeast  there was even a stall serving Burmese delicacies like mohinga (a rice noodle fish soup)  served up everything from the Manipuri eromba and Tipra mackerel to Naga pork barbeque and Khasi jadoh. Additionally, there were traditional dance performances from the Northeast states as a side topping.Taken together, the North East Festival is a huge celebration of Northeast culture and people, who have been treated in a step-motherly fashion by the Indian mainstream for far too long. The North East Festival is a brilliant attempt at rectifying this. And what sets it apart from similar government-run festivals is that here people of the Northeast can truly be their radiant selves and enjoy. Having said that, the question that needs to be asked is: Why do we get to experience Northeast culture only once a year through these festivals? Why cant Northeast culture become an ubiquitous part of mainstream Indian life?The problem with restricting Northeast culture to festivals is that it then takes on the quality of a museum artefact. People will come and enjoy these festivals. But it will only bring about an incremental change in the peoples perception about the Northeast. What is needed is continuous interaction between the Northeast community and local residents throughout the year. In this regard, I believe it will be immensely beneficial if Northeast cultural associations, groups and clubs in various cities gradually open up to non-Northeast people. This will help foster understanding about the Northeast peoples challenges and aspirations in the cities, their lifestyles, languages and worldviews.The easiest thing to do would be for Northeast sports groups to throw open their doors. This can then be followed by Northeast community parishes, cultural bodies (they can teach locals Northeast dance forms), and informal friendship groups where locals can meet Northeast friends through the medium of work, education and even social service. Such opening up and interactions will help dispel many of the myths and stereotypes associated with the Northeast. The people of the Northeast are some of the most talented and kind individuals. It would be a shame for them to get ghettoised and only come out during festivals."

The players of Mexico, the fourth team in the group, reached the city on Wednesday evening and will get to taste the city's famed sweetened yoghurt if the team manager gives the nod.""All the teams have strict dietary requirements and curbs on desserts. But mishti doi is one thing that the managers of three teams have taken fancy to. We are serving it in all three meals  breakfast, lunch and dinner  and the boys are loving it,"" said Neelabh Sahay, the executive chef at Novotel, where the teams are camping for the entire tournament.The yoghurt typical to Bengal has passed the stringent scrutiny of dieticians and managers off all three football teams that checked into the Fifa-designated hotel in Kolkata for the forthcoming Group F matches. The group matches will be played at Salt Lake stadium between October 8 and 14. Thereafter, the venue will also host a pre-quarter final, a quarter final, the playoff for the 3rd place and the all important final on October 28.The four teams have been housed on four different floors of the hotel but the players have all their meals on the first floor, where four banquet rooms have been reserved for each team. The two major meals of the day comprise approximately 600 gm meat, portions of carbohydrates, proteins and fruit juices. Each team has different dietary requirements that is catered by different sets of chefs. Only the England team has a travelling chef to supervise the meals being prepared in a different kitchen at the hotel.""Tenderloin forms an integral part of the diet of all the players. We have got chefs who specialise in their kind of cuisine. We served spaghetti bolognese, grilled bekti with minted green peas and strawberry milk shake for lunch on Wednesday,"" said Sahay.While all the players are gorging on misti doi, some have also begun experimenting with other Indian dishes. The Iraq players loved nan, tandoori roti and daal tadka. Sahay's team plans to offer them malai tikka kebab next. For team England, the chefs want to serve chicken curry, paneer curry and daal tadka. All teams managers are willing to let their boys try out Indian food provided there is nothing in it that makes them sweat. So hot spices, chillies and peppers are a strict no-no.The chefs have also been told to keep nuts and seeds out of the main course as many youngsters are allergic to them. ""Any dish that has nuts or seeds has to be kept on a separate table and labelled so that someone who is allergic does not eat it by mistake. So not all get to savor the nutrition bars that we serve with puffed rice and groundnuts,"" the master chef said.The team managers often double up as food minders, keeping a hawk eye on temptations that may lure their wards. The England team manager did not allow the players to bite into the football-shaped welcome cake. But the managers of team Chile and Iraq did. ""When the Chilean team came on Sunday and we offered them the cake, the boys cut it but were in two minds whether to eat it or not. When we asked their manager if they can be allowed to have a bite and the manager agreed, the players gave a loud cheer and the cake disappeared within minutes,"" recounted a front office staff.Even as the players brace up for the matches in what is being termed the group of death and stick to a strict schedule, the child within them surfaces whenever they spot chocolate. The eyes acquire a glint, the lips purse into a smile. A platter of Fifa-themed chocolates was a pleasant surprise that each player received when they checked into their rooms."

Bangladesh, therefore, has been forced to reduce import duty on rice from 28% to 2% in phases to tide over the crisis, which has been blamed largely on erratic rainfall.This, claim retail market operators in Kolkata, has fuelled export of rice from India  largely Bengal  which has, in turn, created a shortfall in the Bengal market.But the Bengal government has denied this demand-and-supply rationale behind the price rise and squarely blamed the middlemen and speculators. ""There is no deficit in our foodgrain stocks. A section of middlemen and speculators has jacked up retail prices by spreading all these rumours. We are keeping a close watch and will take strong action against such dishonest traders,"" Bengal agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta told TOI.Government statistics, wholesalers and rice mill owners support Dasgupta's contention. Bengal has produced 15.9 million tonnes of rice in 2016-17 and the domestic dem-and is 14.9 million tonnes, making for enough buffer to absorb any sudden spurt in export. ""A spike in exports alone cannot be blamed for this. A section of traders is using this as a ploy to increase retail prices,"" Arijit Saha, owner of a rice mill in Hooghly, said. ""Exports alone cannot create such a shortfall that will lead to a spike in the internal retail market,"" a Sealdah wholesale market insider said, adding: ""Some middlemen have spread these rumours and spiked the price.""Whatever the reason, several Kolkata households have already made small adjustments to their taste to keep the monthly expense bill same. Thakurpukur businessman Arghya Saha's family used to buy the Mini Kit variety till a week ago, when it used to cost Rs 32 a kg. But, with the price of this variety going up to Rs 38, they have started buying the Ratna variety, which now sells at Rs 34 a kg. ""This, too, has gone up. the regular price was Rs 28,"" Saha said. Other popular household varities have become more pricey as well; they include Swarna Madhu and Chhatrish Chaal.But it is not only the varities cooked at home that have become costlier. The Basmati sold loose, which is a key ingredient of Bengal's favourite biryani, is now pricier by Rs 5-7 a kg. ""Branded Basmati varieties, like Nafis, Wagha, Kohinoor and Adaab, have also become more expensive but that is because of GST. Branded Basmati, anyway, is used by only big restaurants,"" New Market retailer Naresh Bhai said.But this spike will not have an immediate impact on restaurant food prices. ""Restaurants will absorb the hike now,"" Hotel and Restaurants Association of Eastern India (HRAEI) president Sudesh Poddar said. ""We will wait for at least six months before going for a price revision though neighbourhood biryani joints may be forced to hike prices,"" he added."

While the blue bird made its appearance in WhatsApp wishes on Saturday, it has gone missing in wildlife-rich Bijnor.The neelkanth, which is another name of Shiva, is revered by Hindus. In northern India, theres a saying when people spot it: Neelkanth tum neele rahiyo, dudh bhaat ka bhoj kariyo, hamri baat Ram se kahiyo (Neelkanth, you stay blue, feast on rice and milk and convey our wishes to Ram). In southern states, where its density is 50 birds per square km, the Indian roller is the state bird of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana.A few years ago, sighting a neelkanth was common in Bijor. Until last year, bird-catchers used to capture and take them door-to-door on Dussehra day to make some money. However, local residents say they havent seen a bird even in captivity this year.Divisional forest officer M Semmaran told TOI, It is dwindling because farmers are using large amounts of pesticides in their fields. We are trying to create awareness about the need to save this bird.Ironically, the bird is considered a friend of the farmers as it feeds on insects and arachnids.Birdwatchers and wildlife experts say felling of old trees could also be a factor. Wildlife enthusiast Rajat Bhargava blames the disappearance of nesting sites. Indian rollers nest in old tall trees and choose a cavity in the trunk to lay their eggs. However, large-scale felling has resulted in the destruction of their natural habitat, forcing them to fly away.The Ganga Barrage in Bijnor is home to a large population of indigenous and migratory birds. Stretches of the Ganga, Peeli Dam, Harevli lake, Sherkot and Afzalgarh areas here are ideal habitats for migratory birds, which include the northern shoveller, pintail, gadwall, painted stork, woolly-necked stork, crane, teal, goose and shelduck."

They again went to Dharamshala for testing but the accused refused to carry it out, saying the presence of mobile towers nearby could cause a blast. Later, the accused tested a rod and told Rana that the device needed to be buried 6 feet to 7 feet underground to let the rod cool down. After that the company would repack it in their own kit, Rana was told and made to pay more money. In all, Rana gave Rs 1.22 crore, excluding the expenditure of hotel and other expenses of around Rs 15 lakh.One of the accused then told him that his uncle had died and he was going back to his village. Since then, he never came back and his mobile phone too wad found switched off. It was then Rana realised he had been duped."

The machine allows sowing of wheat in fields that still have rice stubble. The department had organised 2,540 awareness camps till mid-September to discourage farmers from burning stubble.According to Punjab agriculture director J S Bains and joint director Manmohan Kalia , the nodal officer to check stubble burning, Rs 15 crore had been released to provide farmers with subsidised agriculture equipment. Last year, the amount was Rs 20.23 crore.The agriculture department has decided to make a mobile phone app with the assistance of Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, to encourage the use of all equipment to their full capacity, and allow easy access to farmers not owning machinery, they said.The primary agriculture co-operative societies (PACS) would provide crop-residue management machinery free of cost to 20% of small and marginal farmers. Also, the state government has set up a 'Green Challenge Fund' of Rs 5 crore for promoting alternative uses of paddy straw. This award will be given to anyone who can come up with an economically viable solution for decomposing biomass.Farm machinery banks for residue management are being set up in the state, for which Rs 1.90 crore has been released. There are 28 such banks."

The decision to outsource the hospital canteens, particularly those that supply food to in-patients, has been taken in a bid to provide quality and nutritious food, said health minister Vishwajit Rane.Rane said that the government spends Rs 100 per head for providing food to patients, and therefore, it has been decided to ensure that how best this amount can be utilized to provide nutritious food to patients.The quality of food as well hygiene at GMC came under the scanner last month, after the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) shut down all four canteens within the hospital premises for various violations. One of the reasons for this move was the extremely unhygienic conditions at these canteens. The canteens remained closed for almost 15 days until all the deficiencies pointed out by the FDA team were corrected.The closure of the canteens had inconvenienced patients to a large extent owing to a lack of eateries in the vicinity of hospital.Although there are though a few kiosks operating outside the GMC premises selling tea and snacks, with some even serving rice plates, a GMC official said most of these are illegal, and do not meet the hospital requirements."

In neighbouring Haryana, millers have to pay 2% each as market fee and RDF fee and in Rajasthan there is only 1.6% market fee and no RDF.

""The glitzy Fifa event has done the place much good. Outdoor illumination is not only crucial in making a town safe and functional after dark, it also indicates celebration,"" he says.The neighborhood, especially Broad Street, the thoroughfare leading to the stadium, has suddenly transformed into a vivid landscape, ignited by lighting fixtures.

The delegation led by PBRMA president Bal Krishan Bali demanded rationalisation of tax structure at least in Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan if not in the entire country on the purchase of basmati.The delegation members told Jaitley that millers have to pay 3% as market fee and rural development fund (RDF) fee on purchase of basmati whereas it is 2% each in Haryana while in Rajasthan a market fee of 1.6% is levied.

Siti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam are suspected of smearing Kim Jong Nam 's face with the banned VX nerve agent on Feb 13 at a crowded airport terminal in Kuala Lumpur, killing him within about 20 minutes. The women say they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera show.The women are the only suspects in custody in a killing that South Korea's spy agency said was part of a five-year plot by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to kill a brother he reportedly never met. Police say several North Koreans suspected of involvement left the country on the day of the attack and others were allowed to leave later in a diplomatic deal with Pyongyang The two women, who face the death penalty if convicted, will plead not guilty at the start of the trial, their lawyers said.Prosecutors will then start to call their witnesses, with the first few likely to be medical experts to establish the cause of death, said Hisyam Teh Poh Teik, Huong's lawyer. The trial is expected to last for about two months, after which the judge will decide if there is a strong case for the women to have to mount their defense, Teh said.Kim, who was 45 or 46, was the eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding, yet he reportedly fell out of favor in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. He had been living abroad for years and at the time of his death was traveling on a North Korean diplomatic passport under the name ``Kim Chol.''North Korea has a long history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime, though Kim was not thought to be seeking influence over his younger brother. He had, however, spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic control of the reclusive, nuclear-armed nation.Pyongyang has denied any role in the killing and has not even acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam. It has suggested the victim died of a heart attack and accused Malaysia of working with South Korean and other ``hostile forces'' in blaming Pyongyang.The trial will be closely watched by the Indonesian and Vietnamese governments, which have hired lawyers to defend the women.Aisyah's core defense will be that she didn't know she had poison on her hand when she smeared Kim's face and was instead the victim of an elaborate trick, her lawyer Gooi Soon Seng said. The 25-year-old was at a pub in Kuala Lumpur in early January when she was recruited by a North Korean man to star in what he said were video prank shows, Gooi said.Over the course of several days, the North Korean, who went by the name James, had Aisyah go out to malls, hotels and airports and rub oil or pepper sauce on strangers, which he would film on his phone, the lawyer said.Aisyah was paid $100-$200 for each prank and hoped the income would allow her to stop working as an escort, Gooi said.In late January, Aisyah flew to Cambodia, where James introduced her to a man called Chang, who said he was the producer of video prank shows for the Chinese market, the lawyer said. Back in Malaysia, Chang asked Aisyah to do several more pranks at the Kuala Lumpur airport a few days before Kim was attacked. At the airport on the day of Kim's death, Chang pointed him out to Aisyah as the next target and put the poison on her hand, the lawyer said.Police say neither Chang nor James were who they say they were. Chang was actually Hong Song Hac, one of four North Korean suspects who left Malaysia on the day of the killing, while James was Ri Ji U, one of another three North Koreans who hid inside their country's embassy in Kuala Lumpur to avoid questioning.Those three were later allowed to fly home in exchange for nine Malaysians allowed to leave Pyongyang in a deal easing the countries' diplomatic tensions. Gooi said James was key to Aisyah's defense and that his absence could weaken her case.Aisyah, who has a son, has wrote to her family and told them to pray for her ``so that the case will be over soon and I can go back home.''The 29-year-old Vietnamese suspect Huong was caught on airport security surveillance camera wearing a white sweatshirt emblazoned with the big black letters ``LOL'' _ the acronym for laughing out loud. Little is known about her. Raised in a rice farm in northern Vietnam, her family said they had hardly heard from her since she left home a decade ago.She made postings on a Facebook page under the name Ruby Ruby, according to her niece, Dinh Thi Quyen.Photos on the page show Huong wearing a white shirt that says ``LOL,'' like the one seen during the attack. It shows her posing for selfies in January in Cambodia and in Kuala Lumpur a few days before the attack.Her last post was on the morning of Feb. 11, two days before the attack, from an area near the airport."

But in the morning on the auspicious day, KJ Yesudas chose to be with his new and old disciples at his music school and introduced them to the world of music through a musical vidyarambham Nothing was mentioned about his temple darshanam but it was an experience in itself to watch the ace singer initiate kids of different age groups to the world of music. They were not made to scribble the first letters on rice filled platters, as is the practice in vidyarambham, but instead the kids sat in rows in front of the maestro, who began with an 'Om' which reverberated when the children repeated the mantra. Yesudas then proceeded to chant the Gayathri mantra and made the children follow his intonations.It was a blissful experience for the parents as well. ""My daughter Vaiga, who is 12, began her music lessons today by repeating the basic swaras as rendered by Das sir. We are lucky to get a glimpse of the singer and listen to his celestial voice. He is a person of wisdom from whom the new generation must learn,"" says Vineetha Jayaraj, a bank employee from Jagathy.Yesudas explained the meaning of the Gayathri mantra in simple Malayalam and gave the children some dos and don'ts. ""We should not be selfish in life and should help others through our words and actions. Instead of looking for flaws in others, you should understand and correct your own mistakes. Your life's motto should be goodness. Never talk back to your mother if she corrects or scolds you. It is only to make your life better.

In north India, there's a saying when people spot it: ""Neelkanth tum neele rahiyo, dudh bhaat ka bhoj kariyo, hamri baat Ram se kahiyo (Neelkanth, you stay blue, feast on rice and milk and convey our wishes to Ram)."" In southern states, where its density is 50 birds per sq km, the Indian roller is the state bird of Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka and Telangana.A few years ago, sighting a neelkanth was common in Bijor. Until last year, bird-catchers used to capture and take them door-to-door on Dussehra day to make some money. However, local residents say they haven't seen a bird even in captivity this year. Divisional forest officer M Semmaran told TOI, ""It's dwindling because farmers use large amounts of pesticides in fields. We are trying to create awareness about the need to save the bird."" Ironically , the bird is considered a friend of farmers as it feeds on insects.Experts say felling of old trees could also be a factor.Wildlife enthusiast Rajat Bhargava blames the disappearance of nesting sites.""Indian rollers nest in old tall trees and choose a cavity in the trunk to lay their eggs.However, large-scale felling has resulted in the destruction of their natural habitat, forcing them to fly away.""The Ganga Barrage in Bijnor is home to a large population of indigenous and migratory birds. Stretches of the Ganga, Peeli Dam, Harevli lake, Sherkot and Afzalgarh areas here are ideal habitats for migratory birds like the northern shoveller, pintail, gadwall, painted stork, woolly-necked stork, crane, teal and shelduck."

Khamtis, also known as Tai Khamti, are Buddhist.""If we do not save the youths from drug abuse, the culture and identity of Khamti tribe will be lost in coming days. We gave a serious thought on the issue and come out with a plan to promote tourism in a big way. Once youths are engaged in income generation activities centred around tourism, we believe the druge abuse can be curbed significantly,"" Mein told TOI recently.The deputy chief minister said that Namsai and its adjoining districts have many things to offer to visitors from tourism point of view, and harnessing the potential will give a boost to the morale of the youths.""We have plans to set up cottages and basic amenities for tourists.

She would always have a set of new clothes bought from Fancy Market to mark the day.On Saturday, as Darjeeling, weary after a strike that lasted an unprecedented 104 days, woke up to Dashain , Rumba was clear that this time she would forego the red tika she was famous for and wear a black tilak instead. ""It's for the lives we lost during the recent agitation for Gorkhaland,"" she said. ""It's also a pledge that we will not back down and persist with our demand for a separate homeland for the Gorkhas of India.""For the Gorkhas, Dashain is a time when they pray, eat, drink and wear their best clothes with an urgency that no other festival sees. In the all-round revelry that follows, everyone does brisk business. Meat vanishes from bazaars by early afternoon. Eateries and booze shops are always crowded. Many spend their month's earnings in a day partying with friends and relatives, dancing to local folk tunes.It was different this year. Dashain was ""very political"", as Krishna Rai, a school teacher, put it. Large sections of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha 's leadership have been arrested. Its chief, Bimal Gurung , wanted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is in hiding.There is simmering resentment against the Mamata Banerjee government, first for trying to impose Bengali as a language in the Hills and then for what considerable sections of society view as human rights violations during the past few months.The daughter of a senior cop who retired some years ago after serving the Bengal government all his life said he has been slapped with sedition for speaking up against ""Kolkata's attempt at cultural colonisation of the Darjeeling Hills"". He is now trying to escape the same police force he worked for. ""On what grounds has he been charged with such a stringent section,"" she asked, requesting not to be named. ""We are seeking a separate state, not country."" Recently, a petition reached NHRC regarding Manika Thami, a porter in Darjeeling.Thami was picked up by cops on July 8 for carrying weapons that no one found in her person. She is still in detention along with her daughter.If there is anger and grief at the death of 11 people who lost their lives in the latest round of agitation for Gorkhaland and the perceived excesses of the Bengal police, there is also confusion among the general public. With Gurung out of sight, Banerjee picked a team to take charge of Gorkhaland Territorial Administration, the semi-autonomous body that the GJM chief was heading. Opinion regarding their intention as far as the cause of Gorkhaland is concerned is deeply debated.""The leadership is divided. But people are one,"" Rumba said. ""We will march on for Gorkhaland."""

Those old Icmic or Santosh steam cookers were slower, but also cooked khichdi well.But the most intriguing way to make khichdi was given in Vividh Vani, the classic Parsi cookbook published at the start of the last century. It is in Gujarati, but Bhicoo Manekshaw has given a version. The recipe was specifically meant for travellers in coastal areas. They had to wash rice and dal, mix in salt and turmeric and tie it all up in two wet handkerchiefs.This parcel was placed on burning twigs on the sand and more burning twigs placed on top. After 45 minutes the parcel was turned upside down and allowed to cook some more, and that was it. Mrs Manekshaw noted with some amusement that Vividh Vani candidly admits this khichdi wont taste great, but it will serve to nourish the travellers.Few people have high expectations for khichdi, which might be why some derision was expressed at the suggestion that the government might designate it Indias national dish. But even keeping in mind that the idea of a single national dish is hard to define and essentially rather pointless, it is hard to imagine a better candidate than khichdi. Versions of it are made in nearly every part of India (though places like the Northeast on one side and Kerala, on the other, arent really into the concept).Khichdi, as a general mixed grain and pulse dish, and even the actual name, features in early accounts of Indian food by travellers like Ibn Batuta. It is one dish that is as popular in North India as in South India, under varied names, like pongal and bisebelebath. Uniquely, it also exists in sweet versions, like Tamil Nadus chakkara pongal. Many communities put meat in their versions, Parsis have a khichdi made with Bombay Duck and Maharashtras Chandraseniya Kayasth Prabhus have a delicious version made with dried prawns.It is also a part of Indian festivals. Pongal actually gives its name to Tamil Nadus biggest festival while, from the other end of India, Kashmiri Pandits celebrate Khichdi Amavasya where on the appropriate night a dish of homemade khichdi is offered to Kubera, in the hope that the god of wealth will share his bounty. In Bengal khichuri is offered on Saraswati Puja and while it is only a coincidence, it seems propitious for the goddess of knowledge that a kind of khichdi made from rice and soybean nuggets is one of the main recipes made for mid-day meals in schools across India.While khichdi is most commonly made from rice, versions also use millets, wheat and Maharashtra has its much loved sabudana khichdi made with pleasantly chewy pearls of tapioca starch. Today, of course, there are many recipes for khichdi made with the new super grain quinoa, even though it never really seems to blend with the other ingredients in the ideal khichdi way. Rather better are oats, with several food companies promoting oats khichdi as a healthy Indian breakfast food.What binds all these desi versions of khichdi together is the use of dal. Around the world pulses are cooked with grains, in dishes like Spanish gallo pinto, Italian risi-e-bisi, Caribbean rice and beans or Arabic mujadara. But only in India did we start skinning and splitting pulses, which is what dal literally means (which also gives us Dalit, for those cruelly ground down by society).Splitting pulses makes them faster to cook and easier to digest and gives khichdi its characteristic glutinous texture. In all those other pulse and grain dishes the two components complement each other, but stay separate. In khichdi because the pulses are split, they break down faster and combine with the starch of the grain, both components melding to uniquely satisfying effect. The one problem can be a tendency to gluiness and this is where ghee comes in. A liberal application of ghee is the final touch, lubricating khichdi in the most delicious and essentially Indian way."
