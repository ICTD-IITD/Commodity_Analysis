He clicked it in June 2015 at the Ranthambore National Park , Rajasthan.Sachdev said, ""I was following a family of three sub-adults and a bold mother. I tracked them to a dense patch next to a water body. They didn't really seem to be in a mood to come out on that particular day, but nature does surprise you sometimes. About 20 minutes before the park gates closed, the family decided to make a grand entry. The drama unfolded right in front of our vehicle. I have an entire sequence of around ten images of this fight, but I connect the most with this particular one that I call 'the Goddess'. I hope my image can play a small part in spreading awareness about Tigers throughout the world.""""I call this picture 'The Goddess' because Goddess Durga is depicted riding a tiger. Also the hands of the two tigers in the picture are aligned in such a manner that they look like four hands of just one animal,"" added the IT professional from Baner.The award is named after nature photographer and conservationist Windland Smith Rice. Sachdev will get the award on November 16 in Washington DC. ""It's a matter of great pride for my photograph to be displayed at Smithsonian,"" he said."

The platform provided an opportunity for 220 farmers to exhibit their crops and millet-based products.Farmers from Kothavalasa, Lakkavarapukota and Vepada mandals displayed different varieties of finger millets, foxtail millets, bajra, little millets and barnyard millets along with assorted pulses and rice grown in their regions. The forum also offered an avenue for farmers to exchange good quality seeds and popularise cultural practices followed by the communities.Explaining the objective of the festival, secretary of Sabala K. Saraswathi said: The annual fest is a collaborative effort to bring back fading practice of eating healthy food made of indigenous seeds. Apart from millet promotion and consumption, the stage brought the local communities together to share their knowledge with one another in growing millets and preparing value-added products to enhance their livelihood.Those who were a part of the celebrations relished kheer , porridge, snacks, sweets and flavoured rice items made of assorted millets as lunch, served by local communities at the venue.

Now the 60-year-old woman struggles to make both ends meet at the Leprosy Colony at Ramannapeta, near Vettapalem in Prakasam district as she is unable to give biometric authentication insisted upon by the ration shop dealer after the digitilisation of the targeted public distribution system (PDS) to plug leakage.The case of 65-year-old Kotaiah (name changed) is also no different. After running from pillar to post, he secured the all important Aadhaar card after identification by the local revenue official. ''Still I am unable to draw the monthly ration even after seeding of Aadhaar card details. The reason is that I have no fingers for the fingerprint scanner to read, he laments at the Leprosy Colony at Rammannapeta, where about 150 people live with the dreaded disease. Even the iris scanners are of no use in their case as the disease has affected eyes too, they add. The problem for them started since the State government introduced biometric authentication linked to Aadhaar for the distribution of essential commodities in October 2015 on the pretext of ensuring transparency and putting an end to pilferage, they recall in a conversation with The Hindu .Patients with less deformity in the village are fortunate to get their quota of rice now. But they are unsure how long they will get essential commodities as they fear that the crippling disease may aggravate sooner or later. Most of the inmates in the colony are disowned by other family members and forced to look at some philanthropists to give a helping hand. The only solace for them is that they get the pension ranging from Rs. 1,000 to Rs. 1,500 sanctioned by the State government after identification by the Village Secretary. We will be happy if the government allows us to draw ration also after physical verification by revenue officials at the grassroots level, they plead.Though the SC order does not make Aadhaar mandatory to draw subsidised essential commodities, officials at the grassroots level still deny the poor of ration, observes a social activist K. Kalyan who arranges 10 kg rice each for such people much against odds.Equally vulnerable are nomadic tribal people and bull trainers who keep moving from one place to another for a living and camp at, among other places, on the outskirts of Ongole, Kandukur and Markapur."

One of their kith and kin had been singled out for a handsome break in GST, and there was great ferment in the ranks at this special consideration.The meeting will come to order! bellowed Naan, who had assumed command of Breaddom with help from his cousin Kulcha. Enriched by the oil boom, they had ousted the previous leader, plainspoken Roti, after the Green Revolution. We should protest Khakhra being given special treatment. At this rate, he might become the sole staple of India.Hear! Hear! chimed in Paratha, who was from Punjab. Dense or light, flattened or round, you duplicate the mothers rounded womb, and earths twice-yearly swelling.No one understood what Paratha meant. He never spoke in simple, direct language like other breads. He always went round and round, and his utterances had many layers of meaning one had to extract after buttering him up.Does anyone know why Khakhras GST was lowered from 12 per cent to 5 per cent and why we were left out? asked Naan.Bhatura, who seldom traveled without her spouse Channa, spoke up. Apparently, there is an election coming up in Gujarat and Amitbhai wanted Khakhras help, she said. Overweight and in her final days  her poor health showing in her greasy complexion  Bhatura always blurted out the truth, unlike her sly niece Poori.Nonsense! snorted Bhakri, who wasnt sure if she was from Gujarat or Maharashtra. By that token I should have gotten a GST break too.Well, we didnt make the cut because we are not long-lasting and cannot be vacuum packed. Besides, they said Khakhra is healthy because he is baked, sniffed Thepla and Dhebra, Khakhras oily cousins who were frequently mistaken for Tibetans or Nepalese because of their names.Well then, what about me? I can be vacuum packed and there is an election coming up in my state too, piped up Papad, who claimed he was from neighboring Rajasthan although his ancestors were said to be Sindhi. The clan had emigrated across the world, including to Southern India, where their cousins were called Appalams, and even to England, where they spoke in a British accent and were called Poppadoms.Well, strictly speaking, you are not a bread, declared Naan.Youre fried! yelled a steamed up Dhokla, Khakhras distant cousin.Youre fired! shouted Dhoklas sister Khandvi, rolling up her sleeve.Yeah. If you are a bread so am I, jeered Ffaffda, who had snuck into the meeting to spy on proceedings and report to Amitbhai, hoping he would be given a GST break too. Although he was a Gujarati, Ffaffda had added couple extra Fs to his name and pretended he was German to gain entry.We are simple breads, so no one cares for us, whined Chapatti, who was with her son Phulka. Everyone is buttering up to Naan because he is rich and fair-complexioned.Yeah. Tell me about it! snapped Roti, still bitter after his ouster from the throne of Breaddom. Roti believed Naan was an interloper who belonged to the Khubbuz Dynasty in the Middle-East, and had no business thriving in Bharatvarsh. There were also rumors that he had some Pita blood in him.For that matter, Roti also suspected Khakhra himself came from a Baloch ancestor named Kaak and his wife Sajji, but this was not a time to make such awkward disclosures.While all this was happening, the delegation from Southern India, led by Masala Dosa, had maintained a dignified silence. But Appam, who had been stewing quietly, could not contain herself anymore.This is zimbly unacceptabull, she said in thick Malayali accent. Why Gujju named kakra getting szbeshal dreatmend?Yes, why wonly cocra and not us? chimed Pesarattu, from Andhra, and his fat cousin Uthappam, from Tamil Nadu.Why? Why? Why? asked soft, light, and fluffly Idli, bouncing around excitedly. Idli, who wasnt sure which Southern state he was from, had a mind like a devils workshop. He believed he was a Brahmin, and therefore deserved special treatment. I am fair toofairer than Khakhra or Naan! he trilled.Well, as they explained we are not long-lasting and cant be vacuum packed. We are also from the Rice Gotra, not the favored Wheat Gotra, sighed Masala Dosa. Besides, there is no election in our states.Of course there is we too have an election coming up in 2018, snapped Kori Roti, who was from Coastal Karnataka, and was hoping that hed get the same treatment as Khakhra since he was also healthy, long-lasting, and could be vacuum-packed. Several members of the Karnataka delegation, including Neer Dosa, Jowar Roti, and Thalipeetu were also camping in Delhi to lobby over GST issues.Sweet! whispered Puran Poli and Holige, cousins from Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively, who felt they too deserved a GST break. Although they were not really healthy and were more perishable than Khakhra, they hoped Amitbhai would consider their sweet nature, particularly since Karnataka could go to the polls in 2018 and Maharashtra in 2019.From inside the oven across the kitchen table, Pizza surveyed the scene as he lip-read the conversation, (feeling like HAL in 2001 Space Odyssey). Bulked up with cheese, chicken and other toppings, he considered himself the Father of All Breads now. As far as he was concerned, desi breads and their sides were passe. Damn fools! he thought to himself as he flexed his muscles and did a few more push-ups. They can scrap over GST while I conquer Indiaits witless elites are sold on me."
5a1732df9855b76bf13efdd7,Why I will not be celebrating Diwali this year: something broke when I heard of the attack on Junaid,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/why-i-will-not-be-celebrating-diwali-this-year-something-broke-when-i-heard-of-the-attack-on-junaid/,2017-10-03,"As a child, the two most important events in my calendar were my birthday and Diwali.Weeks before Diwali my mother would go to the Blind School fair and buy candles. My sister and i would both get new clothes for each of our birthdays and for Diwali. I recall how we hovered over our mother as she mapped out the cloth on a newspaper, cut and stitched it on her Singer machine.For us, what mattered most on Diwali was not the crackers and the evening lights, but the mornings. One would have to wake up at 4am, and have an oil bath. My mother would arrange our new clothes with a lamp, rice and a coin on a silver tray. We would scramble to find textbooks to place on the tray for the Saraswati puja.By dawn, however, we would all be bathed and ready. Then, as on all Sundays (also the weekly hair wash day), we would breakfast on dosas with MS Subalakshmis Bhaja Govindam and Vishnu Sahsranam playing in the background.A round of visits followed. Since neither of my parents are originally from Delhi, there were few family members around. But my fathers uncle, K Swaminathan, lived in Naoroji Nagar, from where he edited the collected works of Mahatma Gandhi.He and his wife, Vishala Patti, were the first stop, and we always got a banana each as we left. And then there were visits to various Tamil colleagues of my fathers, whose sons and daughters were much older, or at any rate, always much better read than us. Completely intimidated, we would come home with relief to our Diwali lunch, which was usually pooran poli and srikhand or masale bhat  the only indication that we were actually half Marathi.In the evening, my mother would do a simple Lakshmi puja and make little feet of rice flour which showed Lakshmi heading straight into our house. Like most girls of our time we disliked noisy bombs, held phuljadis with care, and exclaimed at all the anars and chakras blossoming around us. But most of all we loved the snakes which coiled out of a little black pill.As i grew older and was left to my own devices, pre-dawn awakenings gave way to holiday sleep-ins. With no children to teach ritual to, i lapsed completely. My mothers dainty Lakshmi feet have become in my clumsy hands manifestations of a yeti arrival. Its been decades since i ignited crackers. But my husband and i still like lighting our house, and Diwali is still a special day in my calendar, despite the noise, despite the spiking air pollution  a day of visiting parents and eating too much.This year, when i heard of the attack on Junaid in a suburban train, something broke. Here were young boys, on their way back from shopping for new clothes for Eid. What they were doing was what every child in this country does, look forward with excitement to an upcoming festival.How can i be happy at Diwali, when Junaids family  and that of many others who have suffered the corrosive hate of a communal attack  have not been able to celebrate their Eid? When some people take pleasure in the death of a Gauri Lankesh, how does one have the heart to celebrate anything at all? The small black snakes of my childhood have become Kaliyas, but there is no Krishna in sight to subdue them.I dont know which prescient educator prescribed these texts, but the two stories that have stayed with me from school are Premchands Idgah and Tagores Kabuliwalah. For years, i could not narrate these stories to others without crying. In both, there are characters whose festivals (Eid and a daughters wedding) were made happier through the happiness of others. If our sense of our selves expands when we share our happiness, it also expands when we share the sadness of others.For me it is more important to be human than merely to be Hindu. This year, my house will be dark on Diwali, but at least my heart will be lighter."

But how much do they earn? Representatives of RMPs and PMPs associations say they charge a maximum of `50 in urban localities. The fee comes down to `20 to `30 in villages or agency areas. In further remote parts, fee is not even paid in currency. A vibrant barter system thrives in certain villages where farmers trade their produce for a health checkup.In some villages, people give rice, wheat or pulses in return for the services of RMPs and PMPs, says S Venkat Reddy, founder and State president of TS RMPs, PMPs, Community Practitioners Union. Say a farmer who is unable to sell his crop needs medical attention. He gives around 50 kg of rice to the practitioner and in return gets consultations for his entire family for a year.The Telangana government in June 2015 had issued an order permitting the Community Para Medic Training programme to be conducted for RMPs and PMPs to improve their skills in administering medicines prescribed by qualified medical practitioners. The order listed out services they can provide which includes acting as first responders and administer first aid to patients.However, the move has not gone down well with junior doctors, who staged a protest across the state for an hour on Monday. They demanded services of unqualified RMPs and PMPs not to be legalised.The Junior Doctors Association members alleged some of these practitioners were not qualified to offer medical services. If they are allowed to prescribe scheduled drugs, it could lead to health complications among people, they added. The protests were organised at Osmania Medical College, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Adilabad. The association submitted a representation to special chief secretary (Health, Medical and Family Welfare) Rajeshwar Tiwari, requesting him to cancel the order."
5a1732f09855b76bf13efde1,On a slippery slope: Exclusive focus on demonetisation hides NDA’s broader economic mismanagement,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/on-a-slippery-slope-exclusive-focus-on-demonetisation-hides-ndas-broader-economic-mismanagement/,2017-10-02,"Demonetisation will live in infamy as one of the worst economic initiatives in post-Independence India. However, focussing almost exclusively on demonetisation detracts attention from a series of missteps by the government that hurt the economy well before November 8, 2016.In the first quarter of 2017-18, the economy grew by 5.7% after growing by only 6.1% in the previous quarter. Job losses, farm distress, anaemic credit offtake, weak private investment and industrial activity, uneven export performance, food price inflation, and other indicators show an economy in trouble. Demonetisation can partially explain this malaise. However, it cannot explain slowing growth prior to demonetisation. In fact, the growth rate has declined for six straight quarters.I believe policy missteps helped slow the economy down well before demonetisation. The government has been far more concerned with managing public finances and public perception than with making tough and smart choices to help the broader economy grow. While fiscal prudence is commendable, it cannot be the single biggest focus of a government.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Arun Jaitley, the stewards of Indias economy, appear obsessed with taxes and the fiscal deficit. At times, the government has gone to absurd lengths to manage its own finances at the expense of consumers and the private sector. Worse, the government has failed to act in other vital areas impacting the economy.Banking is widely considered an economys lifeblood. In 2014, when the Modi government took over, non-performing assets (NPAs) were beginning to choke banks. Gross NPAs as a share of total advances stood at 4.1%. But, instead of proactively dealing with NPAs, the government spent its considerable political capital on an ill-conceived plan to roll back the land acquisition law that BJP helped pass in 2013.NPAs now stand at about 10% of total advances. This has contributed to a slowdown in lending. In 2016-17, overall bank credit grew at about 7% with credit to industry contracting by 1.6%.Aggressive action in 2014 could have mitigated the NPA problem. A new and popular PM with a gift of oratory could have explained the necessity of prioritising the NPA problem. Instead, the governments pussyfooting has created a huge problem that continues to weigh the economy down. Even the Rs 70,000 crore under the Indradhanush scheme for bank recapitalisation was considered far from sufficient by the governments own Economic Survey.Banking sector problems are mirrored in weak private investment, which started to shrink in 2015-16 and contracted by more than 7% in 2016-17. The government stepped in with public investment but the Economic Survey considers it insufficient to arrest a fall in overall investment. The government has been marketing Make in India even as manufacturing capacity utilisation hovers around a mere 71%.While the government takes credit for attracting FDI, we should remember that it accounts for only about 2% of GDP. If Indias private sector is not investing at home, is it reasonable to expect foreigners to invest in a big way in India? The incoherent response to the twin balance sheet problem (banks and corporates) is a serious error of omission.Policies for rural India have also contributed to the slowdown. When PM Modi formed the government, drought warnings had already been issued. This was a time for the government to step up assistance in rural areas through minimum support prices (MSPs) and the safety net of MGNREGA. Instead, the government blindly followed right wing dogma to restrict MSPs. Modi used a speech in Parliament to run down MGNREGA.In the three years between 2014 and 2016, two of which were drought affected, the government increased MSPs of rice by a mere 3.9% per year, 6 percentage points below the rate in the last three years of the UPA. In FY15, MGNREGA generated the least number of person days and household employment since the start of the scheme. By restricting support, the government contributed to rural distress. This ended up adversely affecting the broader private sector as well. The government missed the forest for the trees.Management of fuel prices is another example of the Modi government prioritising fiscal over economic management. After crude prices dropped precipitously, the government decontrolled diesel prices in October 2014 (UPA decontrolled petrol prices). However, as crude prices kept falling, the government started levying excise duties to mop up extra revenue instead of passing on the benefits to consumers.According to the Economic Survey, the increase in petrol tax was 150% between June 2014 and November 2016. Having more money with consumers could have had a positive impact on household and business finances, which could have resulted in higher economic output. The inept rollout of a seriously flawed GST is making matters worse. Cheering a bad tax in the middle of an economic slowdown makes the government look arrogant and unmindful of principles of economics.Perhaps due to a deficit of experience and a surplus of arrogance, the government has frittered away a huge mandate. The obsession for managing public finances and public perception must end. Modi and Jaitley must learn from their mistakes, consult widely, and help reverse the Indian economys downward trajectory. Otherwise, demonetisation wont be the last big blunder they commit."

She had pleaded innocent and accused the military government of political persecution.Nine judges voted unanimously to find Yingluck guilty in verdict reading that took four hours, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.The court said Yingluck knew that members of her administration had falsified government-to-government rice deals but did nothing to stop it.""The accused knew that the government-to-government rice contract was unlawful but did not prevent it...,"" the Supreme Court said.""Which is a manner of seeking unlawful gains.

Around 40% of this land area is for millets thanks to TNs mission to promote sustainable dry land agriculture.While sorghum is favoured in the western belt, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Dindigul and Virudhunagar are growing corn. Ragi is popular in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri and kuthiraivali (barnyard millet) is taking root in Madurai, Sivaganga and Theni.The increase in acreage comes after the initial failure of rainfall in June and July. There is a demand for millets as it requires less water and fertilizers and yet fetches a good price. Better awareness among farmers, who would otherwise keep the land barren for want of water, distribution of certified seeds and better post-harvest technologies have become impetus for growing alternative crops.For instance, in Namakkals Elachipalayam block, A Sumathi, a farmer, halved her four acre plot to grow minor millets this year, after successful ventures of her neighbours. The growing demand for millet-based food products in health-conscious urban markets has also increased the momentum for the sector. Today, 14 millet-based restaurants are making waves in Coimbatore. Millet cultivation has been taken up in areas like Arupukkottai, Srivilliputhur and Kovilpatti, traditionally known for paddy. In Ramanathapuram and Madurai, we have got requests for seeds of millets and pulses to cover 1,000 hectares, said K Ramasamy, vice-chancellor of TN Agriculture University.Cultivation of major crops like corn, ragi and sorghum has seen a dramatic rise. Other millets such as thinai, varagu, samai and kudiraivali are slowly picking up. After years of paddy and wheat, there are a number of farmer groups collectively working on millet cultivation. Thanks to growing awareness about its nutritional value, machines for dehulling millets (removal of husk) are gaining popularity, said M Palanisamy of Rainfed Farming Development Programme, Dhan Foundation, which is associated with TNAU and McGill University, Canada.The green revolution had made people dependent on rice and wheat. But now we need crops that are nutritional, but do not require much water and is climate-change resistant. Millets suits the bill as it grows in rough terrain found in most parts of the state, said Vikram Sankaranarayanan of SanLak Agro Industries.Cultivation of pulses too shot up this season with 2.3 lakh hectares being brought under dry land farming. Red, black and green gram have become the most sought-after pulses. The high cultivation of pulses is also due to launch of dry land agriculture mission with 200 clusters formed this year. Each cluster consists of dry lands aggregating to an area of 1,000 hectares. To help these areas, 291 water harvesting structures including ponds and check dams have been built, besides financial assistance. Around 400 more clusters will be identified soon, said a senior government official."
5a17368a9855b76bf13eff67,The live morning show,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/no-strings-attached/the-live-morning-show/,2017-10-04,"I would see her everyday seated on a small wooden stool, in the balcony outside her kitchen calmly watching the action on the road as the day unfolded. A serious wrinkled face over seventy, I would catch her sight for a fleeting moment as my bus passed her house while heading towards my workplace. She was one of the many people, things I had become habitual of spotting on my way and instinctively I would look out for her as soon as my bus took the road leading to Banashankari II Stage where she stayed.Once when I failed to find her on the usual stool, I felt a void which numerous thought attempted to fill up; maybe she got up late today, perhaps I was late or she might be busy in the kitchen. When for another few days, my eyes caught the sight of just an empty stool, I felt worried; maybe she was down with some illness or was out of town. My mind got foggy with similar thoughts that were eventually cleared away when after a week or so I found her perched on the stool. I was relieved to see her back again and felt the strength of the bond and concern I had nurtured for her, for no apparent reason.I felt, she reminded me of the woman whom I used to see every morning when I was a student and travelled by the university bus. That lady, white haired and slightly plump, often wore pale coloured clothes and routinely sat in the balcony, devotedly reading the holy Quran in Doharaji Colony. I would remind myself to see her whenever the bus took a turn in the direction of her house and secretly praised the devoted woman for maintaining an unwavering schedule despite her old age or at times severity of weather in winter.The humdrum of life may make each day the same but there are certain things that I look forward to with renewed eagerness that form a mosaic of interesting visuals in my mind with indefinite appeal. Almost daily I see a short swarthy man sporting a ray ban (even when there is no sun), ripping a packet of some savoury item to feed pigeons, crows and maynas at a footpath. After he empties the pack, he brings his hands together in Namaste and faces the sun offering a silent prayer, some gratitude while the birds all around him peacefully enjoy the morning treat. At times I see an earthen lamp carefully positioned in the heap of construction sand which is his business. There are days when he just sits on a rickety wooden chair reading the vernacular newspaper with aviator still in place.The scenes around places of worship are intriguing and project myriad faces of faith and devotion, adding vibrancy to each morning as people start their day soliciting the divine mercy. A quick prayer, a fervent genuflection, is what that gives a lasting sense of satisfaction. People in cars or on foot slow down for a while when they pass a temple to offer a prayer and then move on; some students during exam days take a minute to say a silent prayer and proceed to school, hoping for a better performance. I regularly see a middle aged man plucking mogra flowers from a plant in his compound perhaps to put on the deities. I keep a lookout for women who step out with a bowl of rice flour to make well practised patterns at their doorsteps with artistic ease and I am sure the ritual brings certain kind of gratification as they do it without fail.The mornings would be rather dull if there were no office goers, school and college students. Standing at the designated stops, the students in subdued hued uniforms, sleepy eyed and yawning, wait unenthusiastically for the yellow bus to take them to a place they find little enticing. Some mothers intelligently use the waiting period to feed a few morsels to the young ones who show little interest in breakfast. While the world wakes up early, a few still afford to enjoy the luxury of lazy mornings; I see in some houses, the newspaper still lying at the gate or tucked at the door handle."

(Passang Yolmo) Siliguri, Oct. 4: Bengal food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick today promised to resume the supply of grains to the hills from tomorrow, a move being perceived as an attempt to prove that the government is standing by the people after over 100 days of hardship because of the strike. Mullick, who held a meeting with ration dealers from the hills in the presence of cabinet colleagues Gautam Deb and Rabindranath Ghosh in Siliguri, said: ""We will send 100 truckloads of foodgrain to the hills on Thursday. The grains will be distributed through ration shops from Friday."" There are 690 ration shops in the hills and around 9 lakh beneficiaries. In total, the requirement of foodgrain in the hills is around 9,500 metric tonnes and each beneficiary receives 11 kilos of grains - rice and wheat together - a month. During the statehood agitation, the supply of foodgrain to the hills had suffered because truck drivers had refused to ferry commodities fearing attacks on them. Statehood supporters had, however, accused the government of holding back supplies of essentials to press the agitators to withdraw the strike. ""But now that normality has been restored in the hills, we have decided to resume the public distribution system,"" Mullick said. Sources said the minister's assurance was aimed at boosting the confidence of the hill people in the government. ""The idea is to prove that the state is sincerely standing by the common people. Earlier, it had passed a message that it wants the GTA to function and that there should be peace and normality in the hills. Now, a prompt supply of foodgrain can help both the state and Trinamul nullify the allegations levelled by the Bimal Gurung camp that the state has a vindictive attitude towards the hill population,"" said an observer."

The CRRI sent a team of scientists to the affected areas to study the situation and issued necessary instructions to the State Government to control the pest.The State Government has not informed the Ministry about the pest attack so far. We have taken action as per media reports, Singh said.The Union Agriculture Minister further said the Ministry has provided necessary Central assistance to the State Government for supply of agricultural inputs, including pesticides. Though the centre has provided ` 53.78 crore for distribution of agricultural inputs and pesticides under the National Food Security Programme, the State Government has so far utilised `1.98 crore, Pradhan said.Describing the present crisis in the State as man-made, Pradhan squarely blamed the ruling BJD for the situation. Instead of announcing packages for the farmers, the State Government should take immediate measures to control pest attack and instill a sense of confidence among the farmers, he added.According to official sources, a whopping 1.78 lakh hectare of paddy farm in nine districts in Western Odisha have been damaged by massive pest attack and nine farmers have ended their lives over crop loss due to pest attack in the last 10 days."

Eighteen hours into the event, Alibaba said the gross value of sales processed by its online payment system Alipay was nearly $21 billion  roughly equivalent to the annual economic output of Honduras or Afghanistan.The figure was well past the $17.8 billion logged over the full 24 hours last year, which itself marked a 32% year-on-year increase.By comparison, American shoppers spent more than $5 billion last year shopping online on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, according to Adobe, which tracks such data. Total online retail sales in India during 2016 were estimated to be worth about $16 billion.Singles Day began as a protest of sorts against Valentines Day, propelled by college students in the 1990s. The events date, written numerically as 11/11, was associated with unattached singles, known as bare sticks in China.Starting at midnight, online retailer JD.coms distribution centers shipped out diamonds, Chilean frozen salmon, tires, diapers, beer, shoes, handbags, and appliances in trucks.One offer, from Chongqing-based online alcohol brand Jiang Xiao Bai, allowed 33 customers to make a single payment of 11,111 yuan ($1,673) for a lifetime supply of grain liquor known as baijiu.Alibaba chairman Jack Ma and actor Nicole Kidman at the companys Singles Day global shopping festival in Shanghai on November 10, 2017.

Celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Pharrell Williams and Maria Sharapova helped count down the moments before the 60,000 participating global brands released their Singles Day deals to shoppers.The yearly display of rising Chinese consumer spending power has become crucial for manufacturers and retailers across the country, accounting for a significant share of annual orders for many businesses.Five minutes after midnight, Alipay was processing 256,000 payment transactions per second, doubling last years high-water mark, Alibaba said.More than 90% of Alipay orders were placed via mobile, the majority on Alibabas main e-commerce platform Taobao.com. More than half of Chinas 1.3 billion people use smartphones, which have become central to daily life, used for messaging, shopping, news and entertainment, ordering taxis and meals, and serving as digital wallets for a range of point-of-sale purchases.Transaction volumes were pumped up by many Chinese delaying purchases of mundane items like rice and toilet paper to take advantage of cut-rate prices. E-commerces huge growth in China has put New York-listed Alibaba neck-and-neck with Amazon as the worlds most valuable e-commerce company, while also making its rival, Nasdaq-listed JD.com, a Fortune 500 company.Alibaba is investing heavily in creating an entire user ecosystem encompassing cloud computing, artificial intelligence, automated stores using face-recognition, and is pushing into overseas markets under much-travelled boss Jack Ma, one of Chinas richest men.But environmentalists accuse Alibaba and other e-tailers of fuelling a culture of excessive consumption and mountains of waste.Greenpeace said Singles Day deliveries last year created 130,000 tonnes of packaging waste  less than 10% of which is recycled. It said e-commerce is actually more carbon-intensive than brick-and-mortar shopping, calling Singles Day a disaster for the environment.People select watches on an electronic screen at a T-Mall exhibition during the Singles Day shopping festival in Shanghai on November 11, 2017. (AFP)But the growth of Chinese e-commerce has proved a boon to hundreds of once-backward interior towns and villages, now dubbed Taobao villages after re-orienting their local economies toward manufacturing for online buyers.Analysts say Alibaba will take Singles Day global as Chinese e-commerce growth rates are expected to slow in years ahead. It already has a substantial stake in Lazada, an online retailer in Southeast Asia  a hot e-commerce battleground  and recently launched an electronic trading hub in Malaysia, its first outside China.Alibaba said hundreds of millions of Southeast Asian consumers will be able to access Taobao this Singles Day.This is just the start. We will see tens of billions of dollars injected abroad (by Alibaba), said Li Chengdong, a Beijing-based independent e-commerce analyst. It could end up dominating e-commerce in developing countries."

The Varanasi centre would help increase farmers income by enhancing and supporting rice productivity, reducing cost of production, value addition, diversification and enhancement of farmers skills.As for his visit to the MPFI, he said that it would demonstrate Indias support for its activities in distributing free prosthesis Jaipur Foot among the needy amputees.Since its establishment in 1989, MPFI has fitted nearly 15,000 amputees in the Philippines with Jaipur Foot making them capable of living a new life, he said, adding that the Indian government was making a modest contribution to the foundation to support its noble humanitarian activities.I am confident that my visit to Manila will give a new boost to Indias bilateral relations with the Philippines and also further strengthen the politico-security, economic and socio-cultural pillars of our engagement with Asean, the Prime Minister added."

Sensing they were not doing well, neighbours managed to call an ambulance and took them to Dumri block health centre, where they were initially treated.But when their condition did not improve even on Sunday morning, they were rushed to Gumla Sadar hospital.""Chandrika and Anshu were brought dead around 11.15am. Two of her children were admitted. We cleaned their intestines and removed the food. Ashok and Sugam were administered medicines to control food-poisoning. After that we referred them to RIMS,"" said Dr S.N.

Geetha, 25, told the police that her brothers and sisters-in-law had kept her captive for months and subjected her to horrific tortures.Geetha, when she was being rescued, had been found with her arms tied behind her back with a chain and padlock.''They kept me chained. They gave me chilli powder with rice once in two days. They gave me torn clothes and never let me out of the house,'' Geetha said. She alleged that her family did not even allow her to use the toilet.It is not yet clear for how long she had been kept locked up. The family had moved into the neighborhood in Jagtiyal, 200 km from Hyderabad, just a few days ago.The young woman claims she is a graduate and had been working as a teacher when she was made captive. The 25-year-old was quite coherent as she told her story and identified her brothers, but refused to acknowledge her mother.The family alleges that Geetha is mentally unstable. Ramesh, one of her brothers, said if she was left free, she would run out of the house and create a nuisance.

Every day, people have to wait in queues for the cheap and hygienic food but many a times, they return hungry and angry.There are 12 kitchens serving 134 canteens in Bengaluru. The rest 64 are expected to open by this month. The BBMPs target is to have 27 kitchens and 198 canteens in the city with each assembly constituency having one kitchen and 4-9 canteens.The menu changes every day and it is the same price for the three meals: `5 for breakfast, and `10 each for lunch and dinner. Long queues for a plate of Idlyi or Rava Khichdi and Puliyogare or Kharabhath during the morning hours and Pulao or Rice and Sambar or Bisi Bele Bhath and Curd Rice during lunch and dinner.In most of these Canteens, within one hour of the arrival of food from centralised kitchens, the food is over. Express found some canteens maintaining their premises clean while some were unhygienic.The crowd at most Indira Canteens comprised mostly of the working class and construction workers. Their major complaint was shortage of food, small helpings and the quality.Food for `10 is good for poor but the taste isnt up to mark, said Suresh, a cabbie who eats regularly at the Millers Road, Kaverappa Layout canteen.The canteens are supposed to serve 300gm of rice, 150gm of sambar and 100gm of curd rice (or any other second dish). But how much they serve varies from one canteen to another.Rakesh, a courier boy, who had pulao and curd rice at Jayanagar East, 2nd Block, Mavalli canteen said, The quality of food is good and the place is clean. But I wish they could provide more quantity. Sometimes, I feel so hungry that I have to go to a food joint again.The canteen at Moore Road, Pulakeshinagar is clean. People said the food was good and they had no complaints.In contrast to these areas, one can see only a few people at the Rajajinagar Canteen near Orion Mall. At 12.30pm, the supervisor said 200-300 plates are usually served. There was a big rush in the initial days but now all that has has faded, so we see only those people who need the food at this cost, he added."

It did not reveal the cause of the crash.The purge comes less than two weeks after Prince Mohammed welcomed thousands of global business leaders to Riyadh for an investment summit, showcasing his reform drive that has shaken up the kingdom.""The breadth and scale of the arrests appears to be unprecedented in modern Saudi history,"" said Kristian Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.""The reported detention of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal... would send shock waves through the domestic and international business community,"" Ulrichsen told AFP.- Meteoric rise -The crackdown follows a wave of arrests of influential clerics and activists in September as the 32-year-old prince, often known as MBS, consolidates his hold on power.Analysts said many of those detained were resistant to Prince Mohammed's aggressive foreign policy that includes the boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar as well as some of his bold policy reforms, including privatising state assets and cutting subsidies.The latest purge saw Prince Miteb bin Abdullah sacked as the head of the National Guard, an elite internal security force. His removal consolidates the crown prince's control of the kingdom's security institutions.To analysts, Prince Mohammed's meteoric rise has seemed almost Shakespearean in its aggression and calculation. In June, he edged out a 58-year-old cousin, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, to become heir to the throne.Already viewed as the de facto ruler controlling all the major levers of government, from defence to the economy, the prince is widely seen to be stamping out traces of internal dissent before a formal transfer of power from his 81-year-old father King Salman.At the same time, he has projected himself as a liberal reformer in the ultra-conservative kingdom with a series of bold moves including the decision allowing women to drive from next June."

Photo: Hemant Mishra/MintNew Delhi: Indias basmati rice exports may drop to a three-year low this year as the European Union (EU) tightens a fungicide rule and local prices strengthen.Exports may decline as much as 5% to 3.79 million metric tons in the year that began on 1 April from a year earlier, said Vijay Setia, president of All India Rice Exporters Association. That would be the lowest since 2014-15, according to the associations data.We will try to export polished rice to the European Union to avoid the new fungicide norms, Setia said in a phone interview. Exporters are possibly not yet fully prepared to meet the new stringent norms, he said.According to the European Unions rule, the residue level of Tricyclazole fungicide in basmati rice should not exceed 0.01 parts per million from 1 January 2018, compared with 1 part per million currently, Setia said. About 80% of Indias basmati rice shipments include unpolished grains. The rest is sold after polishing, which significantly lowers fungicide residues.Rice companies are expected to focus on the domestic market after a surge in local prices following lower stockpiles and concerns that a drop in the crop area would lead to lower output, Setia said. Basmati paddy output may fall 8% from a year earlier to 5.65 million tons in 2017-18, a decline for a third straight year and the lowest since at least 2009, according to the association.Farmers across the country have reduced planting 7.7% to 1.55 million hectares (3.8 million acres) from a year earlier to grow other agricultural crops, according to the association.Local prices of some aromatic varieties used in dishes such as biryani and pilaf have surged 50% to around Rs30 per kilogram from a year earlier. The price rally may boost earnings of millers such as KRBL Ltd and LT Foods Ltd, which have already seen their share prices doubling this year.Basmati rice exports totaled 2.12 million tons in the six month through 30 September, compared with 2.06 million tons a year earlier. Total rice exports climbed to 6.07 million tons from 5.43 million tons, according to the associations data. Bloomberg"
5a52302a9855b770e0375248,Stubble burning blamed for Delhi pollution: Why farmers carry out the exercise,http://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/why-do-farmers-burn-paddy-stubble/story-cN5uXCkzIr8Cs9K1R9TtVK.html,2017-11-09,"The plain farming chore of burning after-harvest paddy stalks as farmers prepared their fields in Punjab and Haryana for the wheat crop never headlined so much as in the past month.The swirling smoke from the fire is blamed for the thick haze that has shrouded New Delhi, where the conditions were exacerbated by fog, dust, vehicle exhaust fumes and no high wind to blow the toxic air away.The air quality in Chandigarh too has become very poor with the air quality index (AQI) hovering in the 301-400 range, against the acceptable limit of 100.Farmers switching to mechanical harvesters, introduced in the early 1980s, could be the genesis of the problem. The machine cuts, threshes and cleans rice from ripe paddy in a matter of hours, saving days of menial labour.Over the years, more farmers bought these machines and those who didnt have one could get a harvester on rent for a nominal Rs 1,300, or hereabouts, for an acre.The downside is that harvesters skim from the top and leave 80% of the paddy plant  six to eight inches long  on the field. Except for the Basmati variety, the straw is useless.Unlike wheat stalks that are used as animal fodder, the paddy straw has high silica content that animals cant digest. And Basmati with its low silica content is grown only in 450,000 acres.Since farmers need to sow wheat within a fortnight of harvesting paddy, they burn the straw, or paraali, to save time, labour and money.About 3 million acres are cultivated for paddy in Punjab and 20 million tonnes of stubble are generated every year, said Jasbir Singh Bains, the states director of agriculture.The spike in stubble burning is blamed on the PUSA variety of rice, which is harvested late.Authorities took drastic measures to check the smoke from the countrys food bowl such as fining farmers  up to Rs 5,000  who were found setting fields afire. Punjab government data show 2,338 farmers were fined so far and Rs 65.92 lakh collected in fines.According to the Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, instances of paddy stubble burning were less this year compared to the past.Manjeet Singh Makkar, who heads the farm machinery and power engineering department at Punjab Agricultural University, suggested three solutions.His first suggestion is the straw chopper-cum-spreader. This machine chops the stubble and mixes it in the soil either with the help of water or a rotavator, a tool that has a steel shaft and blades and can be fitted to a tractor.The second suggestion is a straw management system and a happy seeder. The first can be fitted to a combine harvester. It cuts the straw into small pieces and scatters it evenly. Next, a happy seeder mounted on a tractor can be used to sow wheat and put the cut straw over the area as mulch, which improves soil fertility. The two machines cost Rs 1.25 lakh each.The third solution is a baler, which bales the straw. These can be used in power plants or cardboard factories.Punjab agriculture director Bains said the state sought a central grant of Rs 900 crore for a crop residue management project this May. The state proposes to offer farmers 40% subsidy on balers, rakes, rotavators and happy seeders. The Centre released 48.5 crore.These machines require an investment of more than Rs 2 lakh, but small and medium farmers dont have the money. Most are reeling from debts. The cheapest machine, a cutter-shredder, costs Rs 45,000 or more. Use of farm labour is the most expensive at Rs 6,000 an acre.Given a choice between a box of matchsticks and machinery worth Rs 2 lakh, what will you choose? asked Billa Singh, a farmer in Phagwara.But Navtej Singh Bains, the director of research at Punjab Agricultural University, believes new machinery is the only way out.If every village procures one or two happy seeders, the problem will be solved. Farmers are now renting these machines for Rs 1,300 an acre. The cost is bound to fall if more farmers buy the seeders, he said."
5a5231349855b770e03752cb,Not the same old Kochi anymore,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/not-the-same-old-kochi-anymore/articleshow/61361332.cms,2017-11-01,"I remember a time when we could see the Kochi kaayal, if we stood in front of St Teresa's school. All the tall apartments that now block the view weren't there and also non-existent were the many rows of shops. The stretch of road from High Court, leading through Menaka, Maharajas and beyond had the beautiful backwaters as the right side view. One by one, concrete structures shut it out, while Kochi soared to heights, establishing itself as a metro.I was born in the early sixties, and have seen this magnificent city in transition over the decades. Putting myself on nostalgia mode takes me back to a time when time itself wasn't in a hurry. In Tripunithura, where I grew up, we learnt the wheels of time turning through the tolls of the Manimaalika bell, which was struck every half an hour. Watches and clocks weren't common and most people checked time through the movement of the sun. Our elders used to tell us, 'Nizhal chaanju, ini poi kulikku... (The shadows have changed sides, it's nearly evening. Go take a bath). As watches became a fixture on our hands in the following decades and the city grew manifold, Kochi's time and tides also started rushing past us.However, a day always started quite late, compared with today - thanks to the dim light despite having electricity connection. Power cuts were extremely common and the contact with a KSEB lineman was a matter of pride for a Kochiite, in the fifties and sixties.Cooking started only by 7 am so that there is enough of light in the kitchen. By around 10 am, families had their breakfast  rice and curry! Most families had around 14 to 15 members, so it was not practical to make dosa or idli. Curries were made of vegetables from our own land. Moreover, Kochiites stayed away from wheat. Many had this notion that it would increase your body temperature and make you sick, and also that having wheat was beneath one's dignity! However, we slowly started getting used to that grain in the sixties, as rice became scarce due to war. We gradually started liking it!One of the most vivid memories from the fifties was how Kochiites dressed. In the sixties and seventies in Kochi, girls till the age of 13 wore crop top blouses that ended right above the navel, with an ankle length skirt. After they hit puberty, they would graduate to half saris. Even then, I remember my uncles, who studied in Maharajas College being a little trendy, wearing pants  I guess the elder cousins of the bell bottoms which followed them. It's in the seventies, at the send-off function of Class 10 that I saw girls trying out pants and salwars for the first time. Slowly, more of cosmopolitan attires began to trickle in.Kochi was more used to the community living in the fifties, sixties and seventies, because of the joint family system. I remember walking to school with all neighbourhood kids. It's that warmth that I sorely miss the most, from the past.Most families in Kochi had their own wells and ponds. After playing in the spacious courtyards, kids would always head to the ponds and spend a lot of time there.Over time, most of these ponds got filled out with gravel for construction purposes and the like - I feel a lot of Kochi's water scarcity and contamination problem stems from that. Also, water transport, which we depended a lot on in the fifties and sixties, declined over time.Talking about the beautiful waters, I remember flying out to Mumbai from the beautiful, old Vathuruthy airport of Kochi - it was a place where you got to see trains, sea, ships and airplanes together. This not to discount that tough that was pretty, it's the new airport that is definitely more convenient.Being a hub of trade, Kochi was quite well-off in the era gone by. Then again, I remember seeing fewer tourists and more of vibrant, lungi-clad traders in the Fort Kochi - Mattancherry area in the seventies. It's even later that the city embraced rapid commercialisation.Kochi had a vibrant entertainment culture too, even in the fifties, with people coming from all over to watch movies in its theatres - mostly English and Malayalam. It's over time that Hindi and other language movies started releasing here. But at homes, the favourite pastime was conversations - I remember our grandparents telling us scary stories, while the power was off. Similarly popular were the temple festivals.I feel that except for the joint family system fading away, all changes Kochi went through have many positive sides to it. Moreover, when a city develops, we can't have the gains without some losses, isn't it?Gandhiji termed Kochi a city of adventurers. When he came here in 1925, he said, ""The waters around here have seen the epitome of adventure."" Yes, this place has got that spirit borrowed from people who came here, risked their lives and even sacrificed half the crew of their ship. That spirit of adventure has been handed down the generations and you can still see it here, everywhere, and we are game to take all sorts of risks, adapt to changes and tough times, and move ahead.Kochi has been enjoying a good growth rate since 1956, though there have been umpteen changes over the years regarding what served us the bread and butter. While it was the Cochin port that provided jobs till about 15 years ago, with containerisation and automation, it has ceased to be so. I also remember a time when education was high but employment opportunities were low. So, many had to leave the State and it started off with leaving for the North Indian States, till the seventies. After that started the Gulf boom. Now, fishing is our economic mainstay and we are now the fisheries capital of the country.Kochi's culture was very much linked to movies and theatres, right from the fifties. I remember that in Star Talkies, which was built much earlier, only English movies were played in the fifties in sixties, including world renowned ones like Sound of Music. In God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy has written about coming to watch a movie in Mahalakshmi theatre of Kochi - all the way from Aimanam in Kottayam! In the earlier times, the theatre scene was also active here but it is with the arrival of films that it faded out.But everything was not hunky dory. There was a period from around the mid-sixties to eighties, when Kochi had to go through severe shortage of food, just like the rest of the country. It's that phase that paved the way towards my life as a social worker. I was a class 11 student. Government used to supply rice to the authorities, but on condition that it should be cooked and then supplied as kanji. A shed was set up near the village office of Fort Kochi, where I also helped with the same. There was no curry to accompany the kanji. So, we used to go around the neighbourhood homes and ask for coconut. Then, we used to scrape them and mix it with the kanji and people would even take it away in tin cans... I don't think the present generation here can even believe such a time existed in Kochi.Dishes like chapathi also entered our menu around this time. We had shunned it believing that wheat would make us sick. But the famine was so severe that there was no other way. There was even a year in which we imported around one crore tonnes of wheat, because of the poverty! Needless to say, Kochi has been a fighter and has evolved stronger, each time. -----"

The party's national president,will flag off the event in Bengaluru in which around three lakh bike riders will criss-cross the state with BJP's campaign message., the party's declared CM candidate, spoke exclusively to TOI ahead of the yatra he will be leading.I will cover three assembly constituencies per day where the failures of the Siddaramaiah government and the achievements of the Modi government and of the BJP regime from 2008 to 2013 will be highlighted. The Anna Bhagya Yojana, which Siddaramaiah is harping about, is in fact the Centre's scheme where rice is given at subsidised rates. Siddaramaiah had taken an oath on the banks of river Krishna that he will spend Rs 10,000 crore per year on the project. But only Rs 13,000 crore has been spent in the past four-and-a-half years.BJP will resolve the Mahadayi issue at the earliest. It's a matter of 10 to 15 days and (Amit) Shah is expected to make an announcement on this on November 2. There is going to be an out-of-tribunal settlement between Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra. We are going to convince Goa CM Manohar Parrikar on this.Let me make it clear that Karnataka is the only state where the BJP leadership announced a CM candidate a year ahead of polls. They didn't do it in UP, Gujarat or Himachal Pradesh (BJP announced Prem Kumar Dhumal as CM candidate in Himachal on Tuesday).Why should I give up Shikaripura which has stood by me all these years? This constituency has given me everything in politics... I will convince the BJP leadership to field me from Shikaripura though I am confident of winning from any constituency in the state.He will not contest this time.I can say 95% of the sitting MLAs will be re-nominated. Before issuing tickets, two to three surveys will be done and one such round is over now. Tickets will be given only to hose whom the local people want. The candidates whom he constituents prefer can also be from Congress and JD(S) as there is going to be an influx from these parties December onwards. Under the 150-seat mission, candidates for 125 seats have been identified already. To begin with, independent MLAs C P Yogeshwara, who resigned as associate Congress member, and P Rajeev will be joining the party on November 2.I am 100% confident and our main target will be CM Siddaramaiah's constituency. We want to defeat him just as he ensured the defeat of KPCC president G Parameshwara...He cheated his own party president.BJP will abide by whatever stand Veerashaiva Sangha's national president Shamnur Shivashankarappa takes. His stand is that Lingayat and Veerashaiva are one and the same. Congress tried to create confusion by dragging the Tumakuru Siddaganga Mutt's Swamiji into the issue, but he clarified that both are one. Siddaramaiah will not get support on the Lingayat issue as he thought he would. BJP's Ahinda agenda is inclusive of minorities. But winnability will be the criteria for giving tickets.

The move will be implemented in 13 districts of the region.On Monday, food and civil supplies minister U T Khader said beneficiaries will get 2kg of wheat along with 5kg of rice. Citing little or no demand for the foodgrain, the government had discontinued its supply over the past six months and was providing only seven kg of rice under the scheme.""Now, there are reports from deputy commissioners of North Karnataka districts saying BPL families have been demanding wheat. As a result, we have written to the Centre to provide us with wheat instead of the additional rice we had sought,"" said Khader.He said the department is still estimating the amount of wheat which will be required for BPL families. Before the supply was stopped earlier this year, the government was distributing five lakh quintals of wheat every month. At present, the food and civil supplies department is supplying 2.6 lakh metric tonnes of rice to 1.08 crore families.Inquiry orderedKhader said an inquiry has been ordered under the Karnataka Essential Commodities Act into allegations of over 30,000 quintals of wheat being hoarded in 207 government godowns. With the foodgrain having a shelf life of not more than three or four months, the godown stock should have been disposed of. ""However, the godowns continue to store wheat for over seven months. The foodgrain may not be fit for consumption now,"" he said.Khader declared that Aadhaar is not mandatory for receiving benefits under the Anna Bhagya scheme. Speaking to media, he said the department has received complaints in this regard, and officials have been instructed not to turn away beneficiaries for non-submission of Aadhaar. ""Ration shops cannot deny foodgrains to beneficiaries,"" he said.The department has also made arrangements to roll out a bar-coded SMS service from November 1 for all beneficiaries to receive their quota details and show them at PDS shops to get their monthly ration."

So was the distribution of sweet rice (pongal) and free food.No untoward incidents were reported thanks to the Madras high court Madurai bench order turning down the organisers' request to allow hired vehicles to the memorial. Police had been on their toes apprehending trouble if the court allowed hired vehicles.Thousands of people from across the state as well as from other states including Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal arrived on about 2,000 vehicles and government buses arranged by the Tamil Nadu state transport corporation to the Thevar memorial.

In a closed economy burdened by harsh UN sanctions, North Koreans often subsist on rice topped with "" injogogi "" or man-made meat, a Reuters report has revealed.In spite of a Public Distribution System (PDS) which guarantees ration coupons to 70 per cent of the population, over 61 per cent North Koreans still depend on informal, private markets as their most important source of food. Official channels like PDS accounted for just 23.5 per cent of people's food intake, a 2015 survey of defectors said.These private markets have a robust street food culture, which have become staples of North Korean diet. From injogogi, a fake meat made from pressing and rolling soy bean oil residue, to speed cakes - cornmeal sweets which don't require baking, these foods have a high protein and fibre content to help muscle growth and keep hunger at bay.A photo illustration shows 'Injogogi' at a North Korean food store run by a defector in Seoul South Korea (Reuters photo)It is no surprise then that the average North Korean is undernourished. A study conducted in 2009 showed that pre-school children in the North were up to 13 cm shorter and up to 7 kg lighter than their South Korean counterparts.According to UN food agency the World Food Programme (WFP), North Korea has received $42 million in food aid, a significant chunk of the $76 million ""nutritional support"" fund raised by member states.The agency also points out that North Koreans have a ""monotonous diet - mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste - lacking in essential fats and protein.""North Korean defector Hong Eun-hye demonstrates how North Korean people make rice cakes with corn powder. (Reuters photo)Some defectors said that despite global sanctions, food supply has improved under the regime of Kim Jong Un , who eased the restrictions on private trade after coming to power in 2011.Wealtheir defectors have attested that they ate meat on a frequent basis. Pork is common, but some also talked of eating dog meat, rabbit, and badger. On the other hand, their less well-off counterparts consumed privately grown vegetables and corn, a cheaper alternative to rice.In sharp contrast, the moneyed middle-class enjoys delicacies like pepperoni pizzas and spaghetti vongole at the many state-owned restaurants in the capital, which also cater to tourists.Influential people in Pyongyang have a versatile diet, thanks to bribes of goat meat, dog meat and deer meat, claimed a defector whose father was a high-ranking public official.(With inputs from Reuters)"

The regional outfit, he said, will defeat the BJP on its own.We will have no alliance and defeat them (the BJP) on our own, the Chief Minister said in a tete-te-tete with Prabhu Chawla, Editorial Director of The New Indian Express at the concluding session of the Odisha Literary Festival 2017.To emphasise BJDs stand of maintaining equidistance from the Congress and BJP, Naveen said the regional outfit will have no alliance either direct or indirect with any political party.When his attention was drawn to BJPs 120+ mission in Odisha for the 2019 polls, Naveen said development work of the State Government will give the BJD adequate number to form next government. We will get a comfortable majority, he said, but refused to guess the number of seats his party will win.Asked about some senior partymen advocating an alliance with Congress to defeat the BJP, Naveen said, No political party is a school room. Some leaders speak in a diverse tone. But my party will remain equidistant from Congress and BJP.Replying to a question on what will be slogan of the BJD for 2019 polls, the Chief Minister said, It remains the same. We will continue to work hard for people of Odisha.The Chief Minister strongly disapproved the derogatory remarks allegedly made by a senior minister against a BJP woman leader. Stating that such behaviour is totally uncalled for, Naveen admitted that he had a talk with the Minister over the matter. Even I dont take anyones name in my speeches, he said.Asked about the reasons behind the BJDs four consecutive wins, Naveen attributed the success to the anti-poverty programmes, pro-farmer policy in the last 10 years which has doubled their income, a strong food security net with different welfare programmes including 25 kg rice per month at `1 per kg, construction of one million pucca houses for the poor and many other welfare schemes taken up during the last 17 years.He also said it was his administrations efficiency which could see successful hosting of the Asian Athletics Championships 2017 in a short notice of 90 days when other States declined. One million people were rescued in a matter of hours when cyclone Phylin struck Odisha in 2013, he said and added the United Nations also praised the cyclone measures put in by the State Government.OLF concludesBhubaneswar: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday underscored the need to think about ways to harness the immense potential of literature through technology, in its various forms as an expression of art, a source of knowledge and an instrument of entertainment. Delivering the keynote address at the concluding session of the Odisha Literary Festival 2017 here organised by The New Indian Express, Naveen said literature is a part of our identity and reflective of our heritage and culture.

I am thrilled to know that thousands of people of the district have been eking out their livelihoods by doing plumbing works throughout the country and abroad. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship will soon establish an international-level plumbing training institute in the district to churn out skilled plumbers, he said.People of the State are fed up with the inefficient BJD Government. The voters will teach them a lesson in 2019. The BJD Government has been hoodwinking gullible people of the State by falsely claiming that the State Government provides rice at `1 per kg to the poor from its own fund. The Centre provides `29 per kg while the State Government contributes only `2, Pradhan said.Expressing dissatisfaction over being ignored by party president and Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and local BJD leaders, Jena had recently resigned from the party.

On Thursday, Narayanasamy and ministers R Kamalakannan, A Namassivayam and M O H F Shahjahan went to Pavanar Nagar and Phoomiyapettai, where they inspected the government quarters area.The residents there complained that free rice, sugar and kerosene were not being supplied to them through the ration shop in the locality. The Chief Minister assured them that rice would soon be distributed and that the territorial government could not distribute kerosene since the Centre had refused to give the fuel considering its bad effect on the environment.However, the residents said they were facing difficulties during power failures and kerosene could come handy for use in lamps. For that, however, at least one litre of kerosene was required per month.Narayanasamy then assured them that necessary measures would be taken after consulting with the Civil Supplies Department.Apprising the visiting top brass of their grievances, the residents further said many of the houses in the locality were built around three decades ago and around 800 households depended on public toilets as they did not have a separate toilet in their houses.They went on to add that due to lack of maintenance, drainage systems were blocked and rainwater got mixed with sewage water and stagnated on the roads. This could become a breeding ground for mosquitoes that spread several diseases, including dengue.Due to inundation, venomous snakes and insects were also finding their way into houses, they added.

Subsequently, district administrations were said to have individually floated tenders for another 200 units. The details of the purchase could not be accessed by Express. Again, in 2016, the directorate purchased 260 more steam boilers from a private company at a rate of Rs 4.6 lakh.As per the government order accessed by Express, the boilers had a capacity of 250 litres. The other add-ons were two 20-kg capacity rice cookers, a milk cooker, single burner and three burner ovens and a baking unit among others. Express used these specifications to find the market price from leading companies in the segment.When Express sought quotations for a steam boiler of the said specifications from Coimbatore and Chennai-based manufacturers and suppliers, a leading firm in Coimbatore, who claimed to have supplied the product to some of the Adi Dravidar welfare hostels in Coimbatore, offered the same boiler for Rs 1.99 lakh, plus an 18 per cent GST, in a written quotation. Another Chennai-based engineering firm quoted a price of Rs 3.05 lakh for the same product in a written quotation, adding that it was negotiable up to Rs 20,000 per unit. Interestingly, when the government made these purchases, the tax rate was only 14 per cent.When Express met Adi Dravidar Welfare Director S Siva Shanmugaraja in person and sought clarifications (the reporter was asked to hand over her mobile phones and any recording devices at the entrance), he denied any irregularity in the tender process. Explaining the 2016 purchase of 260 steam boilers, he said only one of the seven firms that took part in the tender fulfilled the tender conditions.We had written to the government stating that only one private concern was eligible and they had finalised the contract only after the government gave its go ahead, he said, adding that the Tender Transparency Act has been strictly followed.Express couldnt reach the company officials for comments.Shanmugaraja said it was unlikely that the company made extraordinary profit claiming that it incurred heavy cost in transporting the equipment and installing them. He said almost all of the 160 government tribal residential schools, for which also the boilers were purchased, were on a hilly terrain. He said they had negotiated with the company to bring down the rate from initially quoted `5 lakh. In some cases, they said they even had to physically transport the boilers since it was inaccessible for vehicles and such labour costs were not factored in initially, he said.However, the company had applied for an extra 40 per cent on the rates of labour, rates of work, head loads as per the Conveyance of Materials by Road on Hills of the PWDs standard schedule of rates for installation of steam boilers in hostels that were on hilly terrain.Even with the grossly overpriced boilers in the hostels, wardens said they were of little help.Our hostel has less than 50 students. There is no need for steam boilers since they come with maintenance issues. For instance, if the water supply is high in alkaline content, it corrodes the inside of the pipes and we have to get it fixed constantly, said warden of a hostel run by the Adi Dravidar Welfare Directorate. A steam boiler with the said capacity of 250 litres would ideally cater to around 100 to 120 students, said manufacturers whom Express contacted.Another warden said the boiler was installed in March, but has been in use only for the last three months as it was not clear at that time as to how to operate it."

Sowing this season is still going on, when it should have ended a month ago.Each farmer is sowing as and when he gets money; some are sowing even today. If it rains heavily, these late-sown crops will not be able to survive, explained farmer Vijayakumar. The farmers of Kannankottai have their fingers crossed this year. Having cash in hand is more important now and here more than elsewhere. Around 800 acres of its patta farmland has been marked for acquisition for the Thervoy Kandigai-Kannankottai reservoir project. Farmers who stand to lose their land are not eligible for bank loans, not even for drought relief payments. Cash in hand is what they have to play with.Its been a bitter year for Kannankottai. A lesson has been learnt and it is not what the dreamers of digital India might want to hear. Our cash is better off locked away in our own homes. What if something like this happens again, said P S Madhan Kumar, a farmer.Housewife Sangammas lesson, having lost her jewels to floods and droughts, is that she better resume tucking away the tens in kitchen containers. Hadnt they saved her from the deluge of demonetization?"

But its implementation hasnt been perfect and activists say it has increased the strain on an already troubled systemCOIMBATORE: People have been furious over images of actor Kajal Agarwal, slippers and even the national flag on smart ration cards instead of their pictures, but what should concern them more is the priority that the Public Distribution System has given to the people, without taking a census as the Government had ordered.Earlier this year, there had been a huge outcry among people after the State Government framed the Tamil Nadu Food Security Rules, which divides people purchasing ration products under two categories  Priority Households (PHH) and Non Priority Households (NPHH). The classification was supposed to be done based only on clauses prescribed by the government. According to the GO, people who are Below Poverty Line (BPL), differently abled, families headed by a window or single women, people in vulnerable households and those who enjoy the beneficiary schemes under Old Age Pension are eligible for the PHH category.Households with at least one member as Income Tax payer, households classified as large farmers, and those with any one of these  Air Conditioner, four-wheeler, three rooms with pucca walls and pucca roof  will be considered as the NPHH. Unfortunately, the State government had not undertaken a thorough census to classify the PHH and NPHH categories and as a result, even those eligible under the PHH category are being identified as NPHH. After finding the NPHH mark in most of the peoples smart cards, Law Foundation co-ordinator C Saravanan filed an RTI seeking the details of the people identified under the PHH and NPHH in the Karavazhi Madampoor village of Thottipalayam in Coimbatore.The result was shocking. Most of the elderly people who are beneficiaries of Old Age Pension scheme have been categorised under NPHH and they are not even aware what it means. Later, when we enquired about this at the local ration shop, they too were not aware of it and they pointed fingers towards the higher officials, Saravanan says. After running from pillar to post, Saravanan has lost hope that the category could be changed at the district level E-centre or in the District Supply Office (DSO) as the officials do not have the option to change the identity of a family from NPHH to PHH or vice versa.Lack of claritySources in the DSO say that even they wonder how the government had classified the people under these categories without taking a census or asking for data from ground-level workers. Top officials in the DSO say they have sought the help of State government to resolve the issue. We have a severe manpower crisis. Even if the government asks us to take census, we do not have many ground-level workers, an official says.According to the TN Food Security Rules, households classified as NPHH will not be eligible to get ration products in the State. It has also been learnt that only 50.5% of the people could be covered under the PDS scheme when the Food Security Rules are implemented. However, State Minister R Kamaraj had earlier said that the supply of ration products would not be stopped and rules are being framed just to comply with the National Food Security Rules.Though these food safety rules will not be implemented now, people have started to get their smart cards marked as PHH and NPHH, even though the categorisation was not made as per rules. In the near future, if the government follows the TN Food Security Rules, it would go by the data printed in the smart ration cards. Annually, the State government allocates more than `5000 crore to purchase food grains and sell it at the subsidized rate. The government is already paying `2,393 crore towards the free rice scheme and if the NFSA is implemented, it has to pay `2,730 crore more annually.Poorly staffed shopsAn All India Democratic Women Associations fact-finding team that went around ration shops across the State, said that there was also severe man-power shortage in ration shops. In certain shops, the person who issues bills is also deployed to supply the products. With only one person in a shop, it is highly impossible to do all the work.In certain shops, labourers are hired for daily wages, and the person entrusted with running the shop has to shell out the expenses from his own pocket, says A Radhika, co-ordinator of the fact-finding team. She also says people are forced to stay away from work for a whole day to get the ration products. If only one person works in a shop, he cannot deliver the products soon. So, the person who buys ration loses his one days wages as they stay in queue, she said.According to norms set by the State Government, ration shops in the corporation limit can have two employees, while those in the rural areas, including municipalities, town panchayats and village panchayats, are allowed just one. Even in the corporation limit, though the sanctioned strength is two, in a majority of the shops, only one person is allocated and they have to do all the work, V Rajendran, State co-ordinator of Tamil Nadu Ration Shop Employees Union, says.Seeing redRajendran also says the ration shops do not even get the food products regularly. As far as dhal is considered, we are not getting the regular dhal. We are getting a new kind of masdhur dhal, which is red in colour. People are not willing to opt for this red-coloured dhal. More interestingly, there was a time the State government campaigned against the use of red dhal and now the same government is providing it in ration shops.Similarly, wheat has become extinct in ration shops, even though there is a big demand for it among the people, Rajendran says. He also says that kerosene that is usually supplied in quantities of 5 and 10 litres, is now available in just two and three litres. When asked about it, Principal Secretary Kumar Jayant said that the department would rectify categorisation mistakes they had committed them in their administration files.Mistakes in smart cards cannot be considered as official ones. We will check with the data that we have with us. The identity classification was a long process and it must be correct in the administration database, he said. About the shortage of items supplied to ration shops, he said that they would rectify it whenever there is a problem. As far as dhal is considered, the idea behind the supply of dhal is to give protein-rich food. So, when the same protein is available in red-colour dhal, why is there an issue, he asks."

While the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit is likely to focus more on trade and investment related issues, leaders at the East Asia Summit are expected to deliberate on matters relating to maritime security, terrorism, non-proliferation and migration.ASEAN is central to Indias Act East policy. Therefore our Prime Ministers participation in the ASEAN-India summit and the East Asia Summit provides a very important opportunity to reiterate our commitment to our partnership, Secretary East in the external affairs ministry Preeti Saran told reporters.She said the prime minister will also participate in the ASEAN business and investment summit as well as a meeting of leaders of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP, comprising 10-member ASEAN bloc and six other countries  India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, is engaged in negotiations for a free trade pact.

The field fires are on in day and night in the state, causing huge pollution not only in state but New Delhi.In Punjab, Super SMS could be attached to only around 1000 Combine-harvesters against the recommended 7500 combine harvesters (which comes to nearly 13 percent of the required number) and these SMS fitted Combine could harvest paddy on 40, 000 hectares (0ne lakh acres) across the state in this season where over 24 lakh hectares area was under paddy crop and as a result only 1.6 percent of the total paddy harvesting could be done with Super SMS fitted Combine-harvesters.The Punjab government had even given Rs. 50,000 subsidy for fitting Super SMS with harvesters during this harvesting season which starts in September end and almost has ended now.Super SMS would be attached in the rear of the combine harvester and it will cut the stubble into small pieces and spread evenly in the field after which farmers can sow wheat without setting the stubble on fire. The cost of a super SMS is Rs. 1.25 to 1.50 lakhs which would be attached to already available combines. The cost of a combine is around Rs. 18 lakhs, which will go up Rs. 19 to 19.50 lakh with this fitment.Earlier in January this year, the Captain Amarinder Singh-led government had passed an order that Super SMS fitment was compulsory with all the Combine harvesters in the state, but after farmers opposition for the same in the National Green Tribunal (NGT), the government withdrew the order and then got issued an advisory from PPCB to all the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of the states in July this year (around two months before harvesting) that they should ensure to get fitted SMS with all the combine-Harveters in their respective districts.Authorities said though it is just a baby step to check the menace, farmers, who were against it, have started adopting it. There are around 12,000 combine-harvesters in Punjab out of which Super SMS can be fitted only with 7500 combines as remaining are not fit for the attachment due to one or other reasons. And even if Super SMS is fitted with 7500 Combine harvesters, even that it is more than sufficient to harvest paddy and wheat in Punjab, said Joint Director cum Nodal Officer Punjab Engineer Manmohan Kalia for stubble management, adding that Super SMS can manage majority straw at the time of harvesting only and in this way, the field fires can be avoided on the large chunk of land.The attachment of Super SMS with Combines started few months back and this year around 1000 combines were covered, he said, adding that remaining will be covered before next season.Though given the figure, the area harvested through Super SMS fitted Combines is quite less but still department feels that with such small steps it has been able to change the mind set of the farmers towards the machine which was totally rejected by them in the beginning, said Director Agriculture Dr. JS Bains.Punjab has seen over 40,000 field fires till date during paddy harvesting and still the fires are going on to clear the stubble. There was total around 29.25 lakh hectares under rice cultivation in Punjab this year including over 4.50 lakh hectares under Basmati rice (Fine quality rice) and remaining under parmal rice (paddy). Basmati rice is harvested mostly manually and its stubble is used as fodder for cattle. The main problem is paddy stubble which is not much popular as fodder and around 75 percent of total 197 lakh tonnes paddy stubble is burnt in the fields only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It is as much about eating as it is about fasting. Sehri (a pre-dawn meal) and iftar (an evening meal to break the fast) are the two meals every day during this holy month when Muslim families across India relish delicacies, some of which are especially made during Ramzan.The idea of the sehri meal is to eat food that is high in protein, is easily digestible and does not leave you thirsty for the rest of the day. Khajla (a kind of pancake) and pheni (a vermicelli dish) are integral to this meal in North India. Bakeries in Muslim localities make special breads during Ramzan, to be eaten with milk for sehri. Big bowls containing salan (non-veg curry) with pieces of chapatti mixed in it are part of the pre-dawn meal of Muslim families in Delhi and Lucknow.The iftar meal is the one to which believers look forward; preparing which women in the families spend their afternoons. Except dates which find a mention in Islamic history (it is believed that prophet Mohammad used to break his fast with dates) and are common in iftar meals across the world, rest of the delicacies eaten for sehri and iftar are influenced by a given region or states history, culture and cuisine (read the accompanying stories).Fruits and smoothies such as Baebri Boel (a popular drink in Kashmir) are consumed primarily for their nutritional value while snacks such asunnakaya (Kerala), haleem (Hyderabad) and bhajiya (Kolkata) reflect the Indian fondness for all things spicy.HYDERABAD: HALEEMHaleem is much in demand in Hyderabad in the month of Ramzan. (HT Photo.)The one festival that Hyderabadis across faiths wait for is Ramzan. This is the only time when they get an opportunity to relish their favourite local food item  Haleem.Haleem, made of meat, wheat, dry fruits and spices, is now incredibly popular because Hyderabad haleem, was given the Geographical Indication certification in August 2010.After fasting throughout the day, Muslim families look forward to having haleem for dinner.Hyderabadi haleem is made of meat  preferably that of goat or sheep and pounded wheat (not exactly atta) The two are then cooked together in pure ghee.The meat and wheat mixture along with spices are cooked in a bhatti (a cauldron made of iron and inserted in a kiln made of brick and mud) on a low flame, with cooks stirring the mixture continuously using wooden paddles or sticks for 10-12 hours.It is garnished with fried onion, coriander and slices of lemon. Occasionally, boiled eggs are also served with haleem.It is believed that haleem originated in Iran, but became popular in Hyderabad during the reign of the Asaf Jahis or Nizams in the 18th century. Since then, it has gained prominence in the Deccan.According to Ifteqar, a steward at a popular Irani restaurant at Mehdipatnam, haleem is not only tasty, but also highly nutritious. It has carbohydrates in the form of wheat, proteins in the form of meat besides spices, which are good sources of minerals and vitamins. At the same time, it is very soft on the stomach because of prolonged cooking, he said. For vegetarians, there is vegetarian Haleem. The ingredients and recipe remain the same minus meat.

(HT Photo.)Visit any corner of Kerala during the holy month of Ramzan and you will be struck by the mouth-watering aroma of spices, ghee and coconut oil that wafts through the air. Unnakaya  a sweet dish made of banana and grated coconut  is a part of Keralas iftar platter. Some prefer having the rich sweet as a dessert after the main course, which usually comprises biryani, a dish of rice and slow-cooked meat.Banana, the main ingredient in this delicacy, is a good source of vitamin C and potassium. It helps the body fight infectious agents; controls heart rate and blood pressure; and coconut is high in dietary fibre and improves digestion. Unnakaya is more popular in northern Kerala than other parts of the state.Depending on the availability of time and ingredients, some people prepare fresh Unnakaya minutes before sunset, the time at which Muslims break their fast. Those who cannot, especially office-goers, are often buy it from eateries.Recipe:Steam the banana in a pressure cooker with the peel. Remove the peel after steaming.Heat a pan. Add a little sugar to water and boil it. Add grated coconut and stir. Add cardamom, raisin and stir. Set aside.Grate the steamed banana. Once it becomes a paste, shape the paste into small balls.

Convicted for the dowry death of his wife, he has spent 18 years of his life in jail, 13 of which at Sampoornanand Shivir, an open-air prison in Uttarakhands Sitarganj.Set amid lush green fields, the jail was established in 1960 over an area of 5,965 acres.Sampoornanand, then chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh of which Uttarakhand was a part, promoted the concept.Balbir attributes the transformation in him to the unfettered life in the shivir, which is among the 28 unique open jails of India.General jails are cramped, there is no individual space and inmates there are mostly depressed. Here we are already part of the mainstream, he said.But all is not well at this unique jail. Its area has now shrunk to just 640 acres as a vast swath of its agricultural land was given away to the Sate Infrastructure and Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of inmates, referred to as shivir wasis, too dwindled from 500 in 2000 to 44 in 2017. We have urged the inspector general of jails to shift 50 prisoners from other jail to this camp so that the number of inmates is increased and we can have more hands for agricultural work, superintendent of the shivir TD Joshi said.The area of the jail has now shrunk to just 640 acres. (HT Photo)Giving some respite to those who are striving to protect the unique concept, the Uttarakhand high court, Nainital, recently ordered that not an inch of the land belonging to the shivir should be given to any agency for any work other than building of hospital or school.But inmates are not fully assured. Besides, there are many problems that still persist.There is no doctor on the campus. The 15- day home leave to inmates was withdrawn by the government five years ago.Inmates at the shivir live in huts on the fields and guard the crops at night. Sugarcane, wheat and rice are grown over around 200 acres of land by them.The inmates are categorised as pucca and kachcha shivir wasis. The pucca shivir wasis live in the fields as they are trustworthy. They can, however, move only within the fields of the jail and not beyond the open boundary. They are allowed to keep with them their families for a week in a month and are provided daily quota of rations. They have to cook their own food. The kachcha shivir wasis are considered less trustworthy and are kept in unlocked barracks."

All of them are Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, and they are all preparing for assembly elections next year that will set the tone for the national elections in 2019.Each chief minister has faced significant challenges during their term: Farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh, fractious party politics in Rajasthan, and anti-incumbency and the threat of Maoist rebels in Chhattisgarh. Charges of corruption have been directed at the governments in all three states.Rumours abound that some of these leaders could be included in the next reshuffle of the council of ministers, much as Manohar Parrikar was in 2014.The BJP has been in power in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh since 2003. It wrested Rajasthan from the Congress in 2013.All three chief ministers  Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan), Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh), and Raman Singh (Chhattisgarh)  have been on statewide tours to get a feedback session. They believe their welfare schemes, the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and a weak opposition will help them win them another election.With a little over a year left before their states to go to the polls, the political fates of each of the three chief ministers hang in the balance.Madhya PradeshShivraj Singh Chouhan is facing the worst crisis of his tenure. Madhya Pradesh has a rural population of over 70%, and many farmers voted for the BJP in the last three elections. The performance of the states agricultural sector was, until recently, a source of pride, but this bout of unrest could prove a major liability. On Saturday, Chouhan fasted while hearing grievances.Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. (Mujeeb Faruqui/HT file Photo)It is not the first time he has been embroiled in a scandal. He was severely criticised for resisting the idea of an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the so-called Vyapam scam, which concerns reports of bribery and suspicious deaths in Madhya Pradesh related to the administering of medical entrance examinations. The inquiry is ongoing.Chouhan, also known as Mama for his many welfare schemes, is an effective populist. He is fond of political yatras, the latest one being a five-month-long effort, from last December until this past May, to support the cleaning of Narmada river.Mama is expanding his governments safety net. On April 7, he started Deendayal Kitchens, a programme to offer meals for Rs 5 across the state. He plans, by the end of the year, to provide some 50 lakh homeless people with land for building a house. His government is funding the higher studies of any student who scores above an 85% in Class 12 exams.But Shivrajs biggest strength is the absence of a strong opposition. The state government doesnt need to worry about anti-incumbency, said Girija Shankar, a political analyst based in Bhopal, as there is zero opposition in Madhya Pradesh.RajasthanThe BJPs success here depends on two factors: Divisions within the opposition and Prime Minister Modis popularity. The BJP won 163 of 200 assembly seats in 2013 and all 25 Lok Sabha seats in 2014. The increasing vote percentage shows peoples faith in BJP and its policies, said state BJP chief Ashok Parnami. People have voted BJP above caste, religion and region.Rajasthan BJP spokesperson Ashok Lahoti said the BJP has expanded its reach to rural areas. Earlier people used to say the BJP is urban area based party, he said, but first time in state history, 75% of panchayat election results were in our favour.Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. (Himanshu Vyas/HT File)In recent decades, however, the Rajasthan ruling party has often been voted out, and Raje is dealing with rebellion from her own colleagues.BJP leaders say that there is no mechanism for addressing the grievances of party workers and that there has been nepotism in appointments to political posts. A senior party MLA, Ghanshyam Tiwari, floated another organisation, Deen Dayal Vahini, which he described as an attempt to promote clean politics.In 2015, Raje weathered a controversy over her close ties to Lalit Modi, the businessman who was expelled from the BCCI for making threats, failing to disclose conflicts of interests, and rigging bids. She received a shot in the arm this April from a by-election in Dholpur, a seat previously held by the BSP that the BJP won after Raje camped there for more than two weeks.As in Madhya Pradesh, the Rajasthan state unit hopes it will be helped by feuding within the opposition, in this case between factions led by state Congress president Sachin Pilot and former chief minister Ashok Gehlot.ChhattisgarhRaman Singh has won the last three elections by a whisker. The difference between the vote shares of the Congress and the BJP was 2.5% in 2003, 1.7% in 2008 and 0.7% in 2013. The gap in number of seats won by the two parties declined from 13 to 12 seats to 10 seats.Anti-incumbency has seemed to make an impact in Chhattisgarh, but Singh has managed to pull off a victory every election. Some suspect a deal with Ajit Jogi, a former Congress chief minister, to defeat the grand old party.Jogi is out of the Congress and has floated his own outfit. Jogi has clout among satnami and tribal population, said a BJP leader. He will split the anti-incumbency votes to BJPs advantage.Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh. (Mohd Zakir/HT file)Another worry for Singh is the persistence of Maoists in the state. In April, 25 members of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed in an ambush in the southern district of Sukma.Singh is known as Chaur Wale Baba (a saint offering rice) for his governments public distribution programme, which sends free rice to far-flung areas.In 2015, Congress charged that as much as 1.5 lakh crore of funds for the scheme had been mishandled, but in the past Singh has found success announcing, every harvest season before polls, a bonus above the minimum support price for paddy. Next years election likely will be no different.Singh is currently on a statewide tour. It is helping us understand issues and realise our shortcomings more than a year before the poll, said a source close to him. Last week, Singh said as many as half his legislators will be declared ineffective and replaced in the election by new faces. In 2013, Singh successfully fought anti-incumbency in the same way."

The entire forest which was segmented according to its resources, used to be leased out to contract for harvesting hone, medicinal herbs and wood among others for an annual revenue of Rs 30 crore.Everyone was dependent on the forest. Contractors for their money, administration for the revenue and locals for their day to day needs, said Mohammad Zagir, a local environmentalist.Very few people cropped paddy in their fields, they used to buy rice and wheat from the money earned from selling wild fruits or their salary from the forest contractor they used to work for, he said.All that changed after June 2014.The forest guards stopped villagers from entering inside the forest. We were going into the forest to collect grass for our cattle when the guards stopped, said Dinesh Verma 38, a farmer of Pipariya village, who was arrested for trespassing, something uncommon for villagers.Since then, conservator of forests VK Singh said 109 villagers have been arrested (mostly in the first year) for trespassing and it was important to deter them from entering the forest.There has been no poaching between 2014 and 2017. A burgeoning big cat population  up from 28 to 54  also meant that tigers have started moving out of the core areas.Despite the danger of lethal attacks, many of the villagers sneak into the reserve to collect forest produce for sale. And they are now up in arms against the national animal.Because of the shape of the reserve, the animal passes through human habitation while moving from one part of the forest to other. This has led to several attacks, Singh said, adding that three deaths reported early this year happened between two sections of the forest having high human habitation in between.The reserves 670km boundary is interspersed with farms mostly in the regions of high tiger kill and is fragmented by three national highways, two state highways, 47 district roads and over 20 smaller roads. In many places, the buffer between farms and reserve is as thin as 10 metres and poor farmers like Nankhi Devi, who was allegedly killed by a tiger on July 1, cannot afford a fence for their minuscule land holdings.Neither can the forest department.The cost (Rs 26 crore for 670km) is almost 80 times of our annual revenue. We do get some funds from the government but it is not enough. We do not have enough money for it, divisional forest officer of the reserve Kailash Prakash said.The locals find forest department suggestions like not entering the forest and making loud noises while working in fields weird.They tell us to visit our farms in groups, not go near the forest, make loud noises while working and this and that...why dont they control their animals. If they cant do it we will make arrangements for these tigers. We know how to protect ourselves, said Pankaj Kumar, 22, whose father was killed by a tiger while working in his farm on June 20.Experts say unless the green corridor connecting Pilibhit reserve with Surai national park of Uttarakhand and Kishanpur wildlife sanctuary of Uttar Pradesh is improved for easy passage of excess tigers, the conflict will continue."

Melt-in-the-mouth khaman dhoklas, raspatra and gota fritters, mushy rice khichdi, saucy kadhi, a bitter gourd and onion sabji called bharela karela-dungri, and flatbreads such as bhakri, rotla and roti, besides the deep-fried puri.These will be accompanied by curries such as sev-tomato, mixed-vegetable undhiyu, a garlicky potato dish called lasaniya bateta, and an assortment of dals, yoghurt raita and srikhand. Wash it all down with cool masala butter milk.For dessert, ghee-roasted gram flour sweet mohanthal, halwa and juicy jalebi are on the menu.The restaurant staff have ticked their checklist already for the meal. They will have two government-appointed chefs from both countries to supervise whats cooking.Located in the citys old eastern suburbs, Agashiye overlooks the Sidi Saiyyed mosque, famous for its intricate jali or stone lattice work.Modi will be taking his guests for an evening walk to the iconic landmark before dinner.Prime minister Abe will stay at the five-star Hyatt during his two-day visit, while Modi will be in Raj Bhavan.Lunch on Thursday will be a vegetarian fare too. The two leaders will have bilateral talks at Mahatma Mandir, a convention centre designed around Gandhian philosophy.Chief minister Vijay Rupani will host a banquet for the two prime ministers later at night.Japan is known for its seafood and meat but it has an age-old relationship with vegetarianism.

5a5314609855b770e037d151,China's Waging a Water War on India,http://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/china-is-waging-a-water-war-on-india/story-6jqgabEffcatPFzJ6fQ6eJ.html,2017-08-22,"Tibet, a treasure-trove of natural resources, including water and precious metals, is a great strategic asset for China in its pursuit of an often improvident style of economic growth. The sprawling Tibetan plateau also arms Beijing with water leverage over downstream countries because it is the starting point for most of Asias great rivers, many of which are being heavily dammed just before they cross into neighbouring nations.China is sharpening its leverage with co-riparian India. Water indeed has emerged as a new divide in Sino-Indian relations, as Beijing quietly and opaquely builds dams, barrages and other structures on rivers flowing to India. It spurned then Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs 2013 proposal that the two countries enter into a water treaty or establish an intergovernmental institution to define mutual rights and responsibilities on shared rivers. The flash floods that ravaged Himachal Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh between 2000 and 2005 were linked to the unannounced releases from rain-swollen Chinese dams and barrages.At a time when the Doklam face-off has entered its third month and the risk of a Chinese military attack on India is growing, there is more troubling news: Beijing is fashioning water into a political weapon by denying India flood-related hydrological data since May, even as major flooding has hit the region from Assam to Uttar Pradesh. Data on upstream river flows is essential for flood forecasting and warning in order to save lives and reduce material losses. Chinas data denial crimps flash flood modelling in India.By embarking on a dangerous game of water poker, Beijing has demonstrated how the denial of hydrological data in the critically important monsoon season amounts to the use of water as a political tool against a downstream country. Indeed, even while supplying data in past years, Chinas lack of transparency raised questions. After all, like rice traded on the world market, hydrological data comes in different grades and qualities  from good, reliable data to inferior data and broken data.Chinas latest action actually violates two bilateral MOUs of 2013 and a 2014 accord, which obligate it to transfer hydrological data to India from three upstream monitoring stations in Tibet every year from May 15 to October 15. No data has been transferred thus far this year, although India, in keeping with the MOUs, paid for the data in advance. While China sells hydrological data to downriver countries, India provides such data free to both its downstream neighbours  Pakistan and Bangladesh.China has long displayed contempt for international law. No bilateral accord seems to have binding force for it once its immediate purpose has passed, as Beijing recently highlighted by trashing the 1984 Sino-British treaty that paved the way for Hong Kongs handover in 1997. China said that pact had lost practical meaning because 20 years had passed since Hong Kongs return. Yet it selectively invokes a 19th-century, colonial-era accord to justify its Doklam intrusion, while ignoring its own violations  cited by Bhutan and India  of more recent bilateral agreements not to disturb the territorial status quo.India should not be downplaying Chinas breach of commitment to supply hydrological data from May 15. Yet, for two months, the ministry of external affairs hid Chinas contravention, which began much before the Doklam standoff. When the ministry of external affairs (MEA) finally admitted Chinas breach of obligation, it simultaneously sought to shield Beijing by saying there could be a technical reason for non-transfer of data (just as MEA sought to obscure Chinas August 15 twin raids in the Pangong Lake area by gratuitously telling the Financial Times that no commonly delineated boundary exists there). How can a technical hitch explain data withholding from three separate stations for over two months? Had China been in Indias place, it would have promptly raised a hue and cry about the commitment violation and linked it to the downstream floods and deaths.More fundamentally, the Doklam standoff, the Chinese hydro-engineering projects to re-engineer cross-border river flows, the denial of hydrological data, and Chinas claims to vast tracts of Indian land are all a reminder that Tibet is at the heart of the India-China divide. The 1951 fall of Tibet represented the most far-reaching geopolitical development in modern Indias history, with the impact exacerbated by subsequent Indian blunders. India must subtly reopen Tibet as an outstanding issue, including by using historically more accurate expressions like Indo-Tibetan border (not India-China border) and emphasising that its previously stated positions were linked to Tibet securing real autonomy.Brahma Chellaney is a geostrategist and authorThe views expressed are personal"
5a53148c9855b770e037d169,The Evacuation of Tezpur: A Family Recounts the Story of Its Flight during the Indo-China War of 1962,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-evacuation-of-tezpur-a-family-recounts-the-story-of-its-flight-during-the-indo-china-war-of-1962/story-mnBG9scHj4WXrSpMmCIPVJ.html,2017-08-20,"Most of us look at personal experience and the history contained in books as separate things. It is only with time and effort that one sees how the threads of individual lives go on to weave a larger picture. In November 1962, with the Indian army in retreat from the Kameng sector of what is now Arunachal Pradesh (then North East Frontier Agency, or NEFA), panic spread through the small town of Tezpur in Assam  the nearest sizeable settlement, on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. We take so much of our past for granted, and it was only recently while talking to an aunt about the evacuation of people from Tezpur across the Brahmaputra that the full scale of the event became clear to me. A few details I had picked up over the years, after I had returned to the North East in 2011. Earlier, I just knew that something called the Chinese aggression had happened.It was hard to imagine the chaos that would have descended upon that small town, the thousands of people in bullock carts and vehicles crowding the steamer ghat to flee to the other side of the river. The tea planters, several British among them, and the senior administrative figures like the DC and the SP had flown out from the small airport at Salonibari on the outskirts of Tezpur, and no one was left in charge.When The Lamas CameMy aunt, who is now 77, and one of five surviving sisters from a total of six sisters and a brother, as usual started her story with a diversion, with an incident from 1959: It was after my first child was born that the Tibetans had come down to Missamari. The DC asked our uncle to make temporary shelters from bamboo and straw for them. So we went from Tezpur with our uncle in his jeep to see them, me and our elder sister who was back home from medical college in Dibrugarh. People had started calling the place Lama Camp by then, because of all the Tibetans who had fled with the Dalai Lama from Tibet. I remember they would pour atta and water into a bamboo sunga or tube and churn that to have as food. That and their prayer beads; it was all the women did. We had seen the Dalai Lama in Tezpur. He still looks the same I think.An episode from almost 60 years ago: Missamari was an army camp with an old runway to the north-west of Tezpur; during the Second World War it was one of the air bases in Bengal and Assam from where American-built Douglas DC-3s and C-47s had flown to Kunming in Chinas Yunnan province to supply Chiang Kai Sheks nationalist troops. Lama Camp was since absorbed into the growing army base. Above Missamari had been thick forests, and above them rose the forested Eastern Himalayas of the Kameng region.Not far from Missamari at the foothills was a road camp known as Foothills (where later khachars or mules were trained for carrying supplies and equipment up in the mountains). The Dalai Lama had carried on to Tezpur, from where he addressed the press. Then he went by train to Dehradun and onwards to Mussoorie, which was where Jawaharlal Nehru met him.The occupants of Lama Camp followed him in stages to Himachal Pradesh.Mules carry ammunition over a mountain pass during the war between China and India. (The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images)After my second childs anno proxon (the ceremony where the child is fed solid rice for the first time) in my mothers place in Ketekibari on 17 or 18 November in 1962, my aunt continued, we had gone to Sootea near Tezpur. Coming back the next evening, we saw army officers and tea garden managers leaving in cars and trucks.That night none of the men in the village including Baba (my aunts father, and my grandfather) slept at night. We could hear the explosions all the way from Missamari, where the armys ammunition stocks were being blown up.The next day people were going here and there. Word had spread that the Chinese were coming. My sisters (including my mother) came back early from school, saying that everyone had left. Our mother was complaining no one had cooked. We put up some rice and dal on the kitchen fire. One of our brothers-in-law who was a nazir in the DC office then turned up in a jeep with his parents, telling us to come along to the steamer ghat. In the confusion our mother left her money behind, but I was carrying my husbands money with me. My younger sisters put some rice and dal in a milk jug to carry with us. We went to the steamer ghat. Just as we reached the jeeps tyre got punctured.An episode from almost 60 years ago: Missamari was an army camp with an old runway to the north-west of Tezpur; during the Second World War it was one of the air bases in Bengal and Assam from where American-built Douglas DC-3s and C-47s had flown to Kunming in Chinas Yunnan province to supply Chiang Kai Sheks nationalist troops.It was chaos at the ghat. One army man, a Nepali, was with his child who was crying. The mother was in hospital the man said. A British woman wearing brown trousers had a child who had fever and was crying; she brought water from the river and gave it to him. There were hundreds of people all around. A lady went into labour and gave birth there on the sand. We managed to cross over to the other side of the Brahmaputra, and then went to Samaguri in a bus arranged by our brother-in-law. I remember my sons milk bottle fell and broke when we reached the place, a house belonging to someone we knew that had been emptied for us. My brother, and my husband who was in Dhekiajuli, arrived, and then left after a day or two. Baba stayed behind in Tezpur. Later he told us how they had provided drinking water to the jawans who were retreating on foot. We bought things from a nearby market, cooked, ate, slept on beds made on the floor in the empty house. There were our brother-in-laws parents, our mother, my two sisters, my children and my eldest sisters daughter, who was worried about the kitten she had left behind in Ketekibari. After a few days we went back to Tezpur. (This would have happened after the ceasefire).What Was Left BehindMy mother was in class 7 then; they had just started wearing the mekhela sador that the older girls in the government school were allowed to wear, and she says that she folded up her school uniform and took it along just in case. My father, who was roughly the same age as my mother, was then in Dhubri in lower Assam where my grandfather, who was in the police, was posted. My grandfathers elder brothers family came down from Tezpur then to stay with them. He himself was busy on duty, part of the effort to stop vehicles and buses from crossing over the interstate border into Bengal; then the roads were sealed.My aunt continued, Later we came to know that the DC had gone to see off his wife and young son at the airport near Tezpur, and when the son cried he got into the plane as well. The SP also left. Several young men, including our brother, got together to form a defence force and collected sticks and guns, to try and do what they could if the Chinese reached Tezpur. The electricity supply office and other places were supposed to have been blown up, but in the end there was no one to carry out the orders. The State Banks coins were all dumped in thelake beside the bank (the manager had already burnt the paper currency), and we heard some people dove in at night to pick up the coins. The staff in the jail and the mental hospital left, so the inmates were given some money and let off, and the ones from the latter roamed around the deserted town.The Ones Who Got AwayI thought I had heard somewhere that the inmates of the mental hospital had wandered about shouting China zindabad, because they thought the Chinese had set them free. Maybe a foreign reporter was responsible for this story. When I asked my eldest aunt (who had been in medical college when she visited Lama Camp) about this though she said nothing of the sort had happened. During those events in 1962 she was in Edinburgh studying medicine, and had seen what my other aunt had described in black-and-white newspaper photos (even recognising a cousin with his parents getting onto a steamer).Refugees in Tezpur during the India-China war of 1962. (Getty Images)The staff at the mental hospital had all left, my eldest aunt, now 81 and still a practising doctor in Tezpur, told me. I remember there was this huge man who carried all 57 keys with him. So the more normal ones, those kept confined by their families following property disputes or marriage problems, were given the keys and money and told to look after the more serious inmates. The doctor who was in charge later got awarded for organising that. The jail staff had also left, and the prisoners must have been turned loose.The doctor who was in charge of the mental hospital later settled in Shillong, and sometimes came to meet my father. He had served in World War II in the medical corps, and had later studied at McGill University in Canada. His wife, who had been a nurse in the medical corps, was a Khasi; they had no children, and lived in a neat little Assam-type cottage with his clinic beside the house. There were plants and orchids all around, and in the spotlessly clean sitting room (a polished bamboo mat on the wooden floor) which the wife opened only on special occasions, were several dried and varnished gourds  I think it was a hobby of his. The doctor had been posted in the Garo Hills region. I remember he told my parents about going down to a river where they would catch prawns by the kilo, and he would later eat about a kilo of prawns by himself. I suppose even at that young age I had intimations of a vanishing world, of a disappearing wilderness.Lost In TimeA few weeks after my aunt had told me about the steamer crossing, I happened to be looking up Missamari on the internet, and came across two old photos of the Tibetans at Lama Camp in a review of a book of photographs on the exiles. In grainy black-and-white, one showed men in traditional clothes walking down a track, a few holding on to the reins of their horses, some huts and the jungle close by; the other showed a crowd of men around a wide track, many in vests and open shirts, sitting (on what seemed like piles of firewood) and standing in orderly fashion, a line of the bamboo-and-thatch shelters visible behind them, and nearby the silhouette of the hills of Arunachal (or NEFA as it was known then).The larger history involving small places like Tezpur is something that has to be sought out  the material isnt always out there somewhere, and can frequently disappear with the passing away of people.This would have been the beginning of the Tibetan diaspora, the first people who followed the Dalai Lama out of Tibet after the Chinese took over. Two things struck me then: the first was the whimsy of history, for if the Chinese had decided to come down till Tezpur in 1962 and stay on, my mother might have ended up an exile as well, separated from her place of birth by the wide Brahmaputra, just like the Tibetans in those two photos were to be separated from their home by the high Himalayas; the second was that the larger history involving small places like Tezpur, where I was born in 1975, and Shillong, where I had gone to school, was something that had to be sought out  the material wasnt always out there somewhere, and could frequently disappear with the passing away of people.Ankush Saikia is based in Shillong, and is the author of the Detective Arjun Arora series. The above piece is part of a book hes working on, on the north bank region of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh above the Brahmaputra.."

Photo: HTKolkata: Rosogolla, the syrup-soaked spongy ball that has served as a gastronomic identity marker for the Bengali community for almost 150 years, just got recognition for its uniqueness.The Union ministry of commerce and industry on Tuesday recognised Banglar Rosogolla, the iconic sweet, as deserving of protection under geographical indication (GI), ignoring competing claims about its origin from neighbouring Odisha.Earlier this year, two exotic varieties of rice produced in small quantitiesTulaipanji and Govindabhogalso received similar protection under GI as unique products of West Bengal, but this went largely unnoticed. But the success with the ubiquitous rosogolla, at least 20 million pieces of which are produced every day, was sweet news, said chief minister Mamata Banerjee. It triggered celebrations in Kolkata.The recognition does not necessarily end the debate on the origins of the coveted sweet. Whereas a confectioner from Kolkata, Nabin Chandra Das, is known to be the inventor of rosogolla, people of Odisha have claimed that a variant of the sweet was offered to the deity at Puris Jagannath temple from much earlier.The GI recognition was widely seen as a victory over Odishas claim, but what the intellectual property authorities have recognised is the uniqueness of Banglar Rosogolla for its melt-in-the-mouth smoothness, spongy texture and the lightness of the sugar syrup in which it is dipped.Smooth and delicate feel in the mouth are the basic characteristics of Banglar Rosogolla, the state had said in its petition seeking GI protection. Hardness of Banglar Rosogolla is experimentally proven to be much lower than samples collected from other states, and the sugar concentration of the syrup is maintained at 30-40%, making it lighter than variants from other states.Though the states application for GI protection of Banglar Rosogolla was based on various physical and chemical parameters of the sweet, which are claimed to be consistent, sweetmeat makers actually go by their instinct, said Sumit Sundar Ghosh, director, Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar Pvt. Ltd, a fabled confectioner established in 1907.I am not sure the uniqueness can be maintained if people stopped to rely on their intuition and started to measure the ingredients or if production were to be mechanised, he added. At the same time, his firm was one of the early birds to start its own dairy farm to maintain product consistency. The quality of milk is paramount, determined by the fodder and the process of collection, he said.Back in 1994, the sweet maker from north Kolkata started to invest in its dairy farm. It now sprawls 100 acres, and produces 2,000-2,500 litres of milk a day, said Nitai Chandra Ghosh, Sumit Sundar Ghoshs father and a fifth generation confectioner. The farm has its own refrigerated trucks to carry the milk to Kolkata from Durgapur, 180 km away.Our rosogollas are made entirely out of the milk that we produce, he said. We still buy small quantities of milk but only to produce other sweets, which, for instance, need milk with higher fat content.Curding of milk to derive cottage cheese, or chhanathe main ingredient of rosogollastarted in eastern India under the influence of the Europeans, said Mani Shankar Mukherji, an author and historian. In 1868, confectioner Das invented the rosogolla in its current form capping several years of experiment after being thrown out of his ancestral business of sugar refining, said a scion of the family, Dhiman Das, also a director of K.C. Das Pvt. Ltd.Nabin Chandra Das built his business on the strength of the rosogolla, whose popularity spread beyond the neighbourhood of his store in north Kolkata from the 1870s. K.C. Das helped spread the sweet outside Kolkata by creating a long-life variant sold in cans from 1930. Now there are 16 K.C. Das stores in Bengaluru, compared with only five in Kolkata, said Dhiman Das."

The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to an average reading of 308, even as the city government extended the ban on the entry of trucks till further orders.Officials said light rain is expected on Wednesday, which might intensify the fog but could clear the smog.Delhi has been experiencing dense smog for about a week, forcing the authorities to enforce emergency measures in the National Capital Region.Here are the highlights:9.37pm: Gadkari says electric transportation could ease the situation in Delhi a bit like Nagpur which has 200 electric taxis that are going to swell to 1,000 next month.9.35pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urges farmers to produce ethanol and biofuel from stubble instead of burning them. These can fuel vehicles including motorbikes on flex engines that will be launched shortly. A tonne of rice straw can produce 430 litres of ethanol, he says.9.33pm: 50% pollution from automobiles in Delhi will be removed after these projects as vehicles from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will not be required to enter Delhi, says Gadkari.9.30pm: Eastern Peripheral Expressway that will be completed by January and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and other projects worth Rs 40,000 crore to decongest Delhi will contribute significantly in curbing pollution, says Gadkari.9.27pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari says he has written to environment minister Harsh Vardhan to look into Delhis pollution problem and get it studied by experts including international consultants.9.25pm: If vehicles are stopped or converted into electricity, still there is no guarantee that the pollution will stop completely. Climatic changes are also behind it and there is need of a holistic approach, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.22pm: Delhi pollution is not related to only automobile pollution. It is not such a case that the problem of pollution will be solved if odd even is introduced, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.20pm: Union minister Nitin Gadkari says the odd-even car rationing scheme or a ban on automobiles are no solutions to Delhis pollution problem.9.15pm: This year when the people are suffering badly and an accumulated fund of Rs 775 crore lies at its disposal, the Kejriwal government has not found it worth spending on improving the environment, says Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari.9.12pm: The AAP government collected Rs 775 crore as environmental cess in the last three years, says Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari.9.10pm: The BJPs Delhi unit accuses the AAP government of failing to act on environment protection despite having ample resources, asks it to share details of spending of the environmental cess.9.08pm: Delhi government notification asks Delhi Traffic Police and the Municipal Corporations of Delhi to prohibit the entry of heavy and medium goods vehicles, except those carrying essential commodities, in the national capital.9.06pm: Delhi government says the ban on the entry of trucks in the national capital has been extended till further orders due to the fluctuating levels of air pollution.9.04pm: We are not relaxing anything as of now. The CPCB task force will meet tomorrow (November 15) and the day after (November 16) and suggest future course of action as drizzle is expected, says CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar.9.02pm: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar says Delhis air quality may further improve on Wednesday as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away.9.00pm: Delhi HC says stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana alone cannot be blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital.8.58pm: Delhi HC tells AAP government: Entire city is unable to breathe. Look at your concern in the areas of education and health facility. We want the same for public transport.8.56pm: All the authorities have opined that the major cause for air pollution was vehicles. So the Delhi government should make an effort on war-footing to bring in more buses. Public life has to be protected as Delhi is unable to breathe, says Delhi HC.8.54pm: Delhi HC says if the Delhi governments odd-even scheme is to benefit the people, there is a need for a better public transport facility.8.52pm: Delhi High Court says there is a grave urgency for more buses in the city and the AAP government needs to address it on a war-footing.8.50pm: The IMD has forecast that weather conditions in Delhi NCR are likely to become more favourable for dispersal of pollutants over the next 2-3 days. Hence, air quality is expected to improve further, says environment minister Harsh Vardhan.8.48pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan appreciates the discipline shown by the public. He says the improvement in the air quality was achieved largely due to efforts of various government agencies and voluntary participation by the public.8.45pm: Environment minister Harsh Vardhan says all government agencies need to maintain the highest level of alertness and continue their efforts to check pollution.8.42pm: Union environment ministry asks all state pollution control boards to intensify action against violators, especially in the industrial and construction sectors, to curb air pollution in Delhi-NCR.8.40pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel appeals to farmers not to burn crop residue. For this, the government is providing them equipment on subsidy basis. The fertility of land is also decreasing because of the burning of crop residues as this would cause loss to farmers in the coming days, he says.8.35pm: Action taken against 369 farmers in Fatehabad, against 79 in Hisar, 54 in Jind, 138 in Kaithal, 357 in Karnal, 184 in Kurukshetra, 6 in Panchkula, 40 in Panipat and 301 in Sirsa, says minister Vipul Goel.8.30pm: Haryana minister Vipul Goel says even in Delhi, crop residues were being burnt by farmers, but the Delhi government has not taken any action.8.25pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel says action is being taken against farmers indulging in stubble burning, and at the same time, they are also being sensitised not to burn the stubble.8.22pm: In view of the National Green Tribunal orders, the Haryana government is quite serious in dealing with the issue of pollution, says minister Vipul Goel.8.20pm: In Haryana, cases have been registered against 244 farmers and fines of up to Rs 18.65 lakh have been recovered from 695 farmers, says minister Goel.8.18pm: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board acted against 1,586 farmers across the state to curb air pollution due to stubble burning, the states environment minister Vipul Goel says in Chandigarh.8.15pm: Haryana environment minister Vipul Goel hits out at Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, saying he has not taken any such steps but was doing politics in the name of smog and pollution in the capital.8.08pm: Since the winds are coming from Punjab and Haryana with good speed, the pollutant there would first settle due to rains, so the winds entering Delhi would be pure and then speed would disperse the smog here, says Charan Singh of IMD.8.06pm: Charan Singh, chief weather forecast officer at IMD, says there are fair chances of drizzling tonight (Tuesday) or early morning on Wednesday, November 15 in parts of Haryana and Punjab.8.03pm: The major reason for the emergency situation in Delhi was stubble burning. The winds coming from Punjab were carrying pollutants and then there was moisture coming from the east. Both winds collided at low height in Delhi causing smog. We do not see improvement, says Usman Naseem.8.00pm: Delhi is out of emergency but not out of danger. In the coming days by November 16 and 17, the conditions are expected to get better. Unfortunately we are happy even though the air quality is very poor. In many countries there is an emergency-like condition at this air quality which we are cherishing as improvement, says Usman Naseem, researcher at Centre for Science and Environment and member of the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA).7.31pm: Ban on entry of trucks in Delhi, except those carrying essential goods, extended till further orders due to pollution levels: Delhi govt official.7.25pm: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ANI: I fail to understand why the Delhi chief minister is trying to force his hand, knowing well that any such discussion would be meaningless and futile.7.15pm: According to latest AQI data, Haryanas Vikas Sadan Gurugram is at 262, Sector16A Faridabad at 240, both fall in Very Unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.7.07pm: The latest AQI data for Delhis Punjabi Bagh is at 262, Dwarka at 244, ITO at 244,Anand Vihar at 287; all fall in Very unhealthy category in Air Quality Index.5.55pm: Delhi government requests NGT to direct neighbouring states to also implement odd-even scheme.5.52pm: Delhi government requests NGT to exempt two-wheelers and women drivers for one year or till 2,000 additional buses are engaged.5.50pm: Delhi government files fresh review petition before NGT in connection with odd-even policy: ANI4.50pm: The Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi improves to an average reading of 308, according to CPCB data. However, even at this level, the air quality remains very poor.4.49pm: If electric bus system is introduced in Delhi, it will reduce pollution. Soon, bio-ethanol-based bikes are going to be launched which use fuel generated from sugarcane husk. This will not only lead to reduction in pollution levels but also help our farmers who are growing sugarcane, says Gadkari.4.48pm: Union government looking at introducing electric taxis and buses, bio-ethanol, methanol and other technologies to reduce pollution, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.4.46pm: The government is working on use of alternative and clean fuels, in place of diesel and petrol, as another way of reducing vehicular pollution, says Gadkari.4.45pm: Road transport ministry has formulated a Rs 40,000 crore scheme to ease traffic congestion in Delhi which would also bring down pollution levels as vehicles wont be stuck in traffic burning extra fuel, says Gadkari.4.42pm: Bypass roads, and upgrading of NH-24 into a 14-lane national highway will reduce vehicular pollution in Delhi by 50%, says Gadkari.4.40pm: Gadkari says once the easterly and westerly bypass roads become operational, vehicles destined for other places near Delhi wont have to enter the city. This would bring huge relief to the people of Delhi from vehicular pollution, he says.4.35pm: Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari says that to tackle the rising pollution levels in Delhi, traffic not destined for the capital should be diverted to cut congestion on the city roads.3.50pm: The smog and pollutant levels will drop in Delhi because of the wind speed generated by the gathering weather system in Jammu and Kashmir, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.48pm: The balancing of the weather system in the coming days in Jammu and Kashmir will definitely help in decreasing the pollution levels in Delhi and adjoining areas as the system is moving westwards from the state, says Sonam Lotus, director of the Met department in Srinagar.3.45pm: Rain and snowfall forecast in Jammu and Kashmir will help reduce the smog and pollution levels in Delhi and its adjoining areas, the regional Met office in Srinagar says.3.40pm: Aam Aadmi Party says Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal has been following up with Punjab and Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue. Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue, AAP posts on Twitter.Delhi CM has been following up with Punjab & Haryana CMs regarding the smog issue.Collective efforts are needed to resolve this grave issue. pic.twitter.com/iF5OK3pWOq  AAP (@AamAadmiParty) 14 November 20173.35pm: BJP Kisan Morcha president Virendra Singh says the party is running a campaign to encourage farmers not to burn paddy stubble as it not only caused air pollution but also reduced nutrients in the fields.1.20pm: Industries involved in essential commodities have been exempted to carry on their activity.We also direct industries whose emissions are limited in parameters be allowed to operate subject to verification, says NGT.1.10pm: NGT to Delhi govt: Dont gift infected lungs to children. They have to wear masks to school. What constitutes a health emergency according to you? Measures should be applied automatically by govt after dangerous levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 persist for more than 48 hours.12.50pm: Delhi govt withdraws its petition for modifications. NGT suggested Delhi govt take care of the logical explanations for odd-even exemptions when they approach NGT again12.40pm: NGT to Delhi government: When reports have stated that two-wheelers are more polluting than four-wheelers, why do you intend to give arbitrary exemptions? Is this a joke? What does one stand to gain from this?12.30pm: Why dont you take positive steps? Why should we exempt anybody? If they (two-wheelers) are not polluting, we will allow them: NGT tells Delhi government .12.20pm: NGT asks Delhi Govt as to why it cant run ladies only buses to solve the problem of transport during odd-even scheme.12.10pm: If you show us you sprinkled water in a proper way and pollution doesnt come down, we will withdraw that order (of sprinkling): NGT tells Delhi government12pm: Kejriwal asks Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to join the meeting with Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday..@capt_amarinder Sir, I am coming to Chandigarh on Wed to meet Haryana CM.

5a531c399855b770e037d61d,"Now that the smog has not cleared, what can be done about it?",https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/voices/now-that-the-smog-has-not-cleared-what-can-be-done-about-it/,2017-11-13,"What Faiz Ahmad Faiz said on the eve of independence Ye daagh daagh ujala, ye shab-gazeeda seher// Wo intezaar tha jiska ye wo seher tau nahi may as well be said about the North Indian cities in winters. Over the past few days, PM2.5 levels in Delhi breached 700-800 micrograms per cubic metre  a level which is hazardous by both WHO and Indian government standards. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in these cities was highest in the world, even clocking maximum level that can be recorded on the scale, i.e. 999. In fact, the smog in Delhi and majority of North Indian cities has reached a level where doctors have suggested evacuation, CMs have ordered shutting of schools, construction has been halted, power plants have been momentarily shut, diesel-generators are banned, cloud seeding is seriously considered, among other such coping but knee-jerk reactions.The primary reason behind this Great North Indian Smog is burning of straw from rice paddy crops by farmers before they begin wheat plantation in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. This year the situation worsened on the back of unfavourable weather conditions which have trapped the smog over Delhi and the rest of North India. Measures such as odd-even policy on cars, ban on burning of leaves and garbage and others mentioned above, have had only limited positive impact. As the political bickering begins over this issue, it is time for us to find long-term, low-cost and scalable solutions.It is tempting to draw parallels between Beijings and New Delhis air pollution issue. Both are capitals of the worlds biggest countries that jointly resisted the wests stringent CO2 emission cuts, exemplify shift of economic vibrancy to Asia and are among the worlds largest cities. However, there are fundamental differences between pollution in these two cities. Beijings pollution is fueled by vehicular and factory pollution whereas Indias pollution is mainly driven by stubble burning. Other small factors contributing to pollution in India include emissions from vehicles, industry and construction. Therefore, the solutions that worked in China to an extent cannot be replicated on the ground in India.Instead, India should learn from Singapores handling of its annual haze concern. The Singapore haze problem is an outcome of palm oil plantation burning in Indonesia, mainly in the Sumatra region.Another interesting similarity is how little Singapore can do on its own to prevent this annual curse. Singapore and Indonesia are both part of the ASEAN  Association of South East Nations  a regional association long hailed as the successful model for (sub)-regional cooperation based on minimum common values. Given the conflicts in South-East Asia when ASEAN was conceptualized, one common value jointly agreed upon was non-interference in the domestic affairs of the other ASEAN countries. This value has long been attributed to be the success of ASEAN; but the same ties Singapores hands in bringing Indonesia to table for taking concrete actions.Likewise, in India, the States are answerable to their local constituencies and have limited say in influencing/limiting farmer burning straw of rice fields in other states. In this regard, more solutions should be derived from Singapore than from Chinas example.First, Singapore tried to identify, shame and even penalize private firms burning forests in Indonesia. In the same vein, the Indian government in collaboration with states can identify the key sub-regions within states that are primarily responsible for such mass-scale burning. The local administration and region should be named and shamed to highlight their apathy towards their fellow countrymen. This identification can be done by hot spot mapping and tracking massive land-clearing activities.Second, the states and center need to come together to discuss this issue in detail and create binding solutions. NITI Aayog  in all its effort to foster cooperative federalism  is uniquely placed to convene all the concerned stakeholders and initiate evidence-backed discussion. One of the solutions of such a collaboration effort could be to use a challenge method to solicit scalable, cost-effective and innovative solutions to clear farms. The source of such optimism is the successful use of technology to mitigate smog issue in other parts of the world  Hong Kong, Philippines, Mexico and also in China.Third, the states and center can mandate installing screens at major public places and ask television and newspapers to display/publish the air quality index. Singapore being a city state has managed to do the same by managing the dedicated website: www.haze.gov.sg/.This is expected to yield three benefits. First, every state has a set of go-to measures in response to increase in pollution levels. Such information will prevent any catastrophic delay in their response.Second, such a display of information will continue to keep the public and civil society informed and any adverse movement in the index will lead to public pressure on the administration and legislators to get their acts together. Third, in states mainly responsible for crop burning, Delhi and other states should publish information linking how the farm activity in such states is impacting air pollution in their home states. They should also publish the AQI of cities in other developing countries which are still sub-50/100 level. This is bound to increase the empathy, accountability and fellowship in farmer community to limit their farm burning efforts.Fourth, unlike in Singapore, in India the states and central governments can explore the option of buying the crop residue from the farmers and using it as a fuel for Waste-to-Energy (incinerators) plants. These plants have massive fuel requirements and feeding such residue could create a possible win-win situation for all.Fifth, states should use softer elements of nukkad natak, graffiti art, wall paintings, messages on packaging of key agriculture inputs of seeds and fertilizers, radio and television messaging before winter cropping season begins and block-level target of crop residue procurement to limit stubble burning.The above measures will be able to create long-term and sustainable solutions to mitigate this annual smog concern. I would like to end this piece by highlighting two caveats. First, all major cities in the world, at some point of time have faced similar deteriorating air quality concerns and they largely overcame the issue with continued economic growth, technological development and policy perseverance. Second, the measures on controlling vehicular, industrial and construction driven pollution should be continued with as much determination as the overall pollution level cant be ignored. With these measures, Delhi will one day come close to Faizs vision of the future."

Photo: ReutersSeoul: After a summer filled with flaming rockets and an earth-shaking nuclear blast, North Koreas state media is portraying Kim Jong Un as a leader who has temporarily traded weapons for workshops.The new portrayal appears designed to build domestic support by delivering on promises to develop the economy alongside the nuclear programme and to reassure citizens amid tightening international sanctions.State media photos released on Wednesday showed Kim examining equipment at a tractor factory, test driving one of the vehicles and laughing with workers, the latest in a stream of photos in the past two months depicting a smiling Kim visiting farms and factories that make shoes, cosmetics, trucks.Between 21 June and 20 September, Kim did not conduct a single public activity related to the economy, instead focusing almost exclusively on appearances at events including missile tests or tours of weapons factories, according to data collected by South Koreas ministry of unification.The resumption of public, economic-related activities has coincided with a lull in missile testing. North Korea has not fired a rocket or tested a nuclear weapon since it launched a ballistic missile over Japan on 15 September.The break in testing matches lulls at similar times in past years and North Korea is almost certainly continuing its push for more capable nuclear weapons, South Korean officials say. But the renewed focus on economic development could be a bid to unify North Koreans and strengthen support for the leadership, said Baik Tae-hyun, a spokesman for South Koreas unification ministry.While North Korea still shows the will to continue developing its nuclear and missile programme, their focus on the economy is also helping the North Korean people come together, Baik said.North Korea may be starting to feel the pinch of sanctions, tightened after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September, and its leadership could be under pressure to limit their impact, said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul.Kim Jong Un has been simply doing what he does best - encouraging his people to achieve rapid economic growth and boost production, Nam said. Taking care of the economy and his people are the top priorities.Vicious sanctionsSince taking the reins of the reclusive regime after the death of his father at the end of 2011, Kim has embraced a goal of simultaneously pursing economic development and advanced nuclear weapons. New UN Security Council sanctions in August and September banned imports of coal, textiles and seafood, while restricting oil shipments to the North.North Korean officials have said in state media the sanctions were causing a colossal amount of damage to ordinary North Koreans, while leaders have shown defiance, arguing that self-reliance can overcome international pressure.The main key to foiling the extremely vicious sanctions and pressure of the US imperialists and their vassal forces and turning misfortune into a blessing is just self-reliance and the sci-tech strength, Kim said in an 7 October speech to leaders of his ruling Workers Party of Korea, according to state media.Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a researcher with the Foreign Policy Research Institute who tracks North Koreas economy, said there was a push to expand manufacturing and decrease reliance on imports of a wide range of goods.North Korea was also looking to expand exports of products not covered by sanctions, such as tractors, Silberstein added. While analysts say there is anecdotal evidence the sanctions are beginning to the Norths economy, it is not clear to what degree.Prices of petrol and diesel have spiked, but the cost of foods likes corn and rice have remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website.

(Source: PTI) GST: Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley along with MoS for Finance Shiv Pratap Shukla and Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia (L) at the 23rd GST Council Meeting on Friday. (Source: PTI)Even as the government cut down tax rates on 200 items at the 23rd GST Council Meeting on Friday, many have called the move an election ploy to influence voter sentiment ahead of the December 9 Gujarat elections. Critics have said it made little sense for a commodity like cement to be subjected to 28 per cent tax. Sources said the government might now focus on recasting the lower tax slabs of 12 per cent and 5 per cent.On Friday, the GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, shifted as many as 178 items of daily use from the top tax bracket of 28 per cent to 18 per cent in a move to shore up public spending and revive investor sentiment.A uniform 5 per cent tax was prescribed for all restaurants, both air-conditioned and non-AC, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. Currently, 12 per cent GST is levied in non-AC restaurants and 18 per cent in air-conditioned ones.These measures are expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 20,000 crore, government officials said. Items for which the GST rate has been cut from 28 per cent to 18 per cent include chocolates, chewing gums, detergents, shampoos, hair creams, henna powder/paste, deodorants, fans, pumps, lamps, sanitaryware, marble, granite, glass, wires, cables, electrical boards/panels, furniture, fire extinguishers, rubber tubes and all musical instruments and their parts.

The income tax authorities, or so the stories said, would use satellites to locate and raid those hoarding new notes. The stories claimed the notes could be tracked even if they were buried 120 metres below the earth. Zee News in Hindi and a Kannada channel zealously put out imaginary stories. One of the anchors was bouncing up and down in delight like the pontiff of the Pejawar math. The woman presenter who seconds him went to the extent of proclaiming the note featured a picture of the Mars mission to indicate how satellites would keep an eye on the currency.The stories spread like wildfire. Last week, when I boarded a train to Hubballi, all my fellow passengers were talking about the chip. Taken aback at their naivete, I said, Its all a lie. Theres no such chip in the note. Two middle-aged men, sceptical about me, said the news had appeared on TV. Not everything that appears on TV is true, I said. They countered me: they had heard such notes were already in circulation in the US. Who told you? There are no such notes anywhere in the world, I said. What is the use of demonetisation then? one of them asked. Give it some thought, I said. A young man on a top berth butted in: You know what use it is? Big industrialists have borrowed money and are not paying back their loans. The banks have no money. That's why they are out to make people deposit their money. And people are taking their old notes to the banks, afraid they will turn out worthless otherwise.You mean this wont solve the black money problem? one of the men said. It will take care of fake currency for a while. But its extent isnt big. Within months, they will start making counterfeits of the new notes. The corrupt keep their wealth in jewellery and property, not cash. Only a small amount gets demonetised. In any case, we will never get, as Modi had promised, Rs 15 lakh in each of our bank accounts, I said.Oh, we thought Modi was on to something big. Looks like he has just put his hands into our pockets, a man said, sighing.The State Bank of India has just written off loans it had advanced to 63 companies. Know how much they owed? A whopping Rs 7,016 crore. This includes the Rs 1,201 crore owed by liquor baron Vijay Mallya. It isnt difficult to guess on whose side Modi is: the affluent who borrowed for their fancies and whose loans he has waived or the millions of hard-working people standing in long bank queues to deposit money they have earned.Modi has not been able to bring black money stashed away abroad. He hasnt even been able to name the secret account holders. His election promise of Rs 15 lakh in each citizens account remains a pipe dream. Even if we put up with such scams, how can we look on as he snatches away the livelihoods of the poor and the middle class?An elderly man waiting to take out money for his daily expenses has died. And how did a BJP vice-president respond to it? Big deal. People die even in ration shop queues.When it dawned on Modi that a majority was frustrated with his insane actions, he didnt say, Please bear with me. I will fix the problem in a few days. Instead, he said, Im doing all this for the nation. People who have ruled us for 70 years are conspiring against me. No one in his party told him, But sir, when did these people, struggling to withdraw their own money, ever rule in these 70 years? How can they conspire against you?The middle class and people in the media, who had hailed demonetisation as Modis masterstroke, now see the machinations behind it. They are aware the new note holds no magic. It cant banish black money, and Modis eccentricities are causing them misery.Modi continues to say we must put up with all this in the interest of the nation, but the problem wont go away anytime soon. Common people will have to scrape and scrounge for cash at least for four months. Business has been affected badly. With no customers, fisherfolk and traders in West Bengal are in the doldrums. In Punjab, farmers have no cash to buy seeds. If they dont sow now, the prices of rice and wheat will go up soon. No money in hand, nothing to eat either is the fate of millions. All this thanks to Modi.The BJP is feeling the heat of the peoples anger. Party president Amit Shah has instructed MPs to put up flex boards praising Modis surgical strike against black money. They usually follow his instructions to the letter, but this time they arent paying him any heed. Except for an MP in Gujarat, no one has put up laudatory flex hoardings.Even people in Gujarat have turned against Modi. Assembly elections are coming up. Expecting praise, party workers holding pamphlets went towards citizens standing in a bank queue. They received blows instead!Allies such as the Akali Dal in Punjab and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra are also turning their back on the BJP. Quite a few BJP leaders are openly criticising Modis actions in the presence of the media, though they are unwilling to speak on record. Even Modi is coming to know of the attrition he has generated. That is why he comes across as so fidgety on his tours.About 25 people have died across the country because of demonetisation. In Uttar Pradesh, a couple with old notes was turned away from a hospital and their daughter died as a consequence. A woman in Gujarat with old notes couldnt feed her two children; she hanged herself.In Kanpur, a young man had been trying for months to sell his property. On November 8, he finally received Rs 70 lakh in advance. When he heard of demonetisation the next morning, he suffered a heart attack and died. A woman in Telangana, who had sold her land for her husbands medical treatment and her daughters wedding, was told the cash was worthless. She committed suicide. In Udupi, a man standing in a long queue, waiting for his bank to open, died of a heart attack.Not one of these was a thug. Not one of them was an Adani, Ambani, Tata or Birla. They were honest middle-class people, farmers, homemakers, all earning their livelihood from honest toil. They ended up as victims of Modis grandiose war against black money. He is responsible for their deaths.In fact, Modi has launched no surgical strike against black money. What he has done is push helpless people to death. What better can we expect from Modis Tughlaq dispensation?[Excerpted from The Way I See It: A Gauri Lankesh Reader, edited by Chandan Gowda, and published by DC Books and Navayana, Delhi.Chandan Gowda says, The book brings together select political and cultural writings of the courageous activist-journalist.

Authorities said although it was just a baby step to check the menace but some farmers, who were initially not keen on the system, have started moving towards adopting it.THE MUCH-TOUTED farm appliance, Super Straw Management System (SSMS), has proved to be of little use in tackling the menace of paddy stubble burning despite the Punjab government promoting it majorly and also providing subsidy of Rs 50,000 on it. The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had even issued an advisory pertaining to its use.The system is being promoted by Punjab government to urge farmers manage stubble at the time of harvesting itself instead of burning it. In Punjab, SSMS could be attached to only around 1,000 combine harvesters against the recommended 7,500 (Which comes to nearly 13 per cent of the required number) and those fitted could harvest paddy on 40,000 hectares (one lakh acres) across the state this season. Over 24 lakh hectares area was under paddy crop and as a result, only 1.6 per cent of the total paddy harvesting could be done with SSMS-fitted combine harvesters.SSMS is attached at the rear of the combine harvester and it will cut the stubble into small pieces and spread evenly in the field after which farmers can sow wheat without setting the stubble on fire. The cost of a super SMS is Rs 1.25-1.50 lakh, which would be attached to already available combines. The cost of a combine is around Rs 18 lakh which will go up Rs. 19-19.50 lakh with this fitment.In January this year, the Punjab government had passed an order that fitting SSMS was compulsory with all combine harvesters in Punjab but after farmers opposition for the same in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) government withdrew the order and then got issued an advisory from PPCB to all the Deputy Commissioners (DCs) of the states in July this year (around two months before harvesting) that they should ensure to get fitted SMS with all the combine-Harveters in their respective districts. Authorities said although it was just a baby step to check the menace but some farmers, who were initially not keen on the system, have started moving towards adopting it.There are around 12,000 combine harvesters in Punjab, of which SSMS can be fitted only with 7,500 combines as the remaining are not fit for the same due to various reasons. And even if SSMS is attached to 7,500 combine harvesters, it would be more than sufficient to harvest paddy and wheat in Punjab, said joint director-and-nodal officer for stubble management, Punjab agriculture, Manmohan Kalia. He added, The attachment process began a few months ago and this year around 1,000 combines were covered. The remaining will be covered before next season.Though given the figure, the area harvested through Super SMS fitted combines is quite less but still department feels that with such small steps it has been able to change the mind set of the farmers towards the machine which was totally rejected by them in the beginning, said Director (Punjab agriculture) Dr J S Bains.Punjab has seen over 40,000 field fires till date during the paddy harvesting season this year. There was total around 29.25 lakh hectares under rice cultivation in Punjab this year, including over 4.50 lakh hectares under basmati rice and the remaining under parmal rice (Paddy). Basmati rice is harvested mostly manually and its stubble is used as fodder for cattle. As paddy stubble is not that popular for use as fodder, nearly 75 per cent of the total 197 lakh tonnes paddy stubble is burnt in fields.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They are either sending them back by saying there is no stock or are supplying 2-3 kg less than the designated quota.In a sting operation, Lancha Mukta Karnataka Nirmana Vedike, an NGO, found that fair price shops are under-providing rice though the beneficiaries are linked to biometric and Aadhaar-linked systems. The distributors are particularly targeting gullible and uneducated people, the NGO said. It has filed a complaint with the authorities concerned.On a tip-off, members of the NGO visited two shops in JP Nagar and on Bannerghatta Road.""At the shop in JP Nagar, we used a hidden camera with the help of a BPL card holder. At fair price shops, a BPL cardholder's details are computerised and after the biometric entry, a slip is generated that gives details such as the number of members in the family and the quantity of rice or foodgrains. Each BPL cardholder is eligible to get 7 kg. At this shop, the slip would accurately mention the quantity of rice or foodgrains that is being supplied. Things get murky at the next step. A person at the next window would tear the slip and under-provide rice and foodgrains. When we weighed them, it turned out that the shop was giving 2-3 kg less rice than the individual quota,"" V R Marathe, the president of the NGO, said.The NGO has submitted the video to the Food and Civil Supplies Department and filed a complaint. It also claimed that the shop owner had ""admitted"" to the wrongdoing on camera. ""He even told us that the licence of two other shops in the same locality was cancelled over similar irregularities,"" Marathe said.The Bannerghatta Road shop, the NGO said, was generating slips but not supplying rice. It would send back people by saying the stock had run out. It would not supply the rice until the end of the month but would enter it in the records. ""Official statistics show that 1.09 crore BPL families are eligible for Anna Bhagya. The deserving people are not getting rice at these shops. We hope the department will take stern action against such shops,"" Marathe said.DH's efforts to reach officials for comment did not fructify."

The commission will help in finding ways and implement them for doubling farmers income by 2022.With an objective to double farmers income by 2022, Uttar Pradesh government has constituted a commission  Krishak Samriddhi Aayog  to be headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.The orders related to the formation of the commission were issued on November 10, with Yogi as Chairman and Agriculture Minister Surya Pratap Shahi as Vice Chairman, a senior official said here.Other members of the commission include Ramesh Chandra, a member of Niti Aayog, UP Chief Secretary, Agriculture Production Commissioner (APC), Dr US Singh of International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) of Philippines, Prof Sushil Kumar of IIM-Lucknow and nine farmers from the state who have been successful in farming particular crops, the order said.The commission will help in finding ways and implement them for doubling farmers income by 2022, in sync with Prime Minister Narendra Modis announcements in various rallies across the country. It will be focussing on various points, including assessing strengths and weaknesses in agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and sericulture, and will also give suggestions in drafting of policies for sustainable and equal agriculture development.The commission will also look into ways for procuring more farmers produce, and suggest for strengthening the system for storage and marketing of crops, the order said. It will also analyse factors responsible for decline in income in the sector, and study cooperative, contract, collective and corporate farming to accordingly suggest for efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the agriculture.Nine eminent farmers from Barabanki, Varanasi, Lakhimpur, Muzaffar Nagar, Mahoba, Deoria, Muzaffarnagar and Banda having expertise in the production of different crops such as banana, tomato, sugarcane etc have also been made members of the commission. Besides, Mahindra and Mahindra and ITC have been included as corporate members of the newly-formed commission.The main objective of the commission is to find ways and means to ensure that farmers income increase and is doubled by 2022, Agriculture Production Commissioner Raj Pratap Singh said.The commission will also look into possibilities of tie-ups with big food chains to have a direct link with farmers for buying their produce from their field to save their transportation cost and increase their profit margins. The commission will start functioning by this month-end and would come out with its suggestions by January 2018.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: Twitter/@PMOIndia) Modi said he saw a detailed exhibition on rice varieties and the impressive work done by IRRI with women farming cooperatives. (Source: Twitter/@PMOIndia)Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday contributed two Indian rice seed varieties to the gene bank of the international rice research centre in the Philippines which he said is working towards mitigating global poverty and hunger by improving the cultivation of the key grain.The prime minister visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in Los Banos, an urban locality situated at a distance of around 65 kms from Manila  the capital of the Philippines  and interacted with a large number of Indian scientists working there.A number of scientists at the IRRI briefed the prime minister on flood-tolerant rice varieties which they said can withstand 14-18 days of submergence and can provide 1-3 tonnes more yield per hectare in flood affected areas.A rice field laboratory named after Prime Minister Modi was also inaugurated by him at the institute.He unveiled a plaque marking the inauguration of the Shri Narendra Modi Resilient Rice Field Laboratory.A contribution from India to IRRIpresented two Indian rice seed varieties to the IRRI gene bank, the prime minister tweeted.The prime minister also undertook a symbolic groundbreaking for a new plot for submergence tolerant rice varieties.Modi said he saw a detailed exhibition on rice varieties and the impressive work done by IRRI with women farming cooperatives.My visit to IRRI was a great learning experience. Saw the exceptional work IRRI is doing towards mitigating poverty and hunger by improving rice cultivation. Their work benefits many farmers and consumers, particularly in Asia and Africa, he said.The Indian government is also setting up a regional centre of the IRRI in Varanasi, the Prime Ministers constituency, to develop high-yielding rice varieties.The IRRI, which has offices in 17 countries, is known for its work in developing rice varieties that contributed to the Green Revolution in 1960s.The Varanasi Centre would help increase farmers income by enhancing and supporting rice productivity, reducing cost of production, value addition, diversification and enhancement of farmers skills, the Prime Ministers Office tweeted.Spokesperson in the external affairs ministry Raveesh Kumar said the IRRI has successfully collaborated with Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) to introduce drought-tolerant, flood-tolerant and salt-tolerant varieties of rice in India.Interacted with Indian scientists, students, researchers working at IRRI. Indias ICAR and IRRI have been cooperating for four decades. India is also involved in helping IRRI in strategic planning, helping decide key goals and working to overcome hunger as well as poverty, Modi said.Kumar said the IRRI and its partners have provided assistance to 2,00,000 women farmers in Odisha which included providing capacity building programmes, and improved agriculture technology.The IRRI centre in Varanasi will help in utilising the rich biodiversity of India to develop special rice varieties.Modi arrived at Los Banos on Sunday on a three-day visit to attend the ASEAN-India and the East Asia summits.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File/Photo) A delegation of the state BJP also met the union minister here and urged him to take necessary steps to mitigate the plight of farmers. (File/Photo)Instead of trading charges, the Centre and the Odisha government should come together and mitigate the plight of Odisha farmers who are facing a grave crisis due to drought and pest attack on crops, Union Minister of State for Agriculture, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said on Sunday. Farmers in Odisha are hit by a serious crisis. Drought conditions prevail in 14 districts. The areas, known as the rice bowl of the state, are hit by drought-like situation and pest menace, said Shekhawat, who is on a two-day visit to the state to review the problems facing the farmers.Describing farmers as annadata (food providers), he said this is not the time to indulge in blame game and find fault with each other. It is necessary to hold the hand of the distressed farmers in order to give succour to them, he said.The minister, who held a preliminary review meeting with state government officials here on crop loss caused by drought and pest attacks, said his visit is aimed at understanding the problems faced by the farmers and find solutions.The Centre would also find ways and means of extending assistance and cooperation to the state government to enable it to deal with the farmers woes, said Shekhawat, who is accompanied by a central team comprising experts.Stating that he would visit the affected areas including Bargarh till Monday, the minister said he would also meet affected farmers and family members of those who have committed suicide.The Director General of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is scheduled to visit Ganjam district, where paddy crops have been severely hit due to pest attack, he said.Replying to charges levelled by a section of the BJD leaders that his visit is an interference on state affairs, the minister said it is the duty of the Centre to address the farmers issues and the visit of the central team is aimed at reviewing the situation and working together with the state to end peasants miseries.During the meeting between the central team and state officials today, the state government urged the union minister to take steps for modifying guidelines and hike compensation by 50 per cent to affected farmers.As the affected farmers are now getting compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare in rain-fed areas, the union minister was requested to raise the amount by at least 50 per cent, Special Relief Commissioner Bishnupada Sethi told reporters.Since the state is following Centres guidelines, these can be changed by them, he said adding, even if the state wants to revive lift irrigation (LI) points to provide irrigation facilities to the farmers, it is not possible because there are no provisions for such mitigation in State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).The state has written to the Centre to give powers to repair and revive LI points during drought, Sethi said.Agriculture Secretary Saurabh Garg said the central team was apprised about the situation in areas affected by pest attacks and steps taken to deal with the problem.We also told them about the the package announced by the Chief Minister for the affected farmers, he said.Central help was sought in undertaking measures for pest surveillance, setting up of insecticide laboratory and having deeper bore wells and tube wells to include more areas under irrigation for a permanent solution to the issue, said Garg.A delegation of the state BJP also met the union minister here and urged him to take necessary steps to mitigate the plight of farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a53419a9855b770e037e700,From plate to plough: Farm to distant shores,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-farm-to-distant-shores-commerce-and-industry-suresh-prabhu-agri-export-government-policy-4924023/,2017-11-06,"In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05. In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05.The new Commerce and Industry Minister, Suresh Prabhu, has expressed his resolve to expand exports. He has said that increase in agri-exports will not only increase the countrys export basket, but also augment farmers incomes and ameliorate farm distress. His objective is laudable and achievable, provided there is a paradigm shift in policy-making from being obsessively consumer-oriented to according greater priority to farmers interests. But before elaborating on this, let us compare the trends in agri-trade, both exports and imports, in the period when the UPA was in office (2004-05 to 2013-14) with that of the three-years of the current regime (2013-14 to 2016-17). A close look at these trends and their drivers can help Prabhu and his team identify agri-commodities that can help boost the agri-trade surplus.In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05. Agri-trade increased from $14 billion to $59.2 billion between 2004-05 and 2016-17 (Figure 1). As a share of the agri-GDP, the contribution of this trade increased from 11.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 16.7 per cent in 2016-17 after peaking at 19.6 percent in 2012-13, reflecting the increasing integration of Indian agriculture with global markets.It is interesting to observe that during UPAs tenure in office, agri-trade surplus surged seven fold, from $3.6 billion in 2004-05 to $25.4 billion in 2013-14. But then fell dramatically by two-thirds after the NDA assumed office, touching $8.2 billion by 2016-17 (Figure 1). The tumbling agri-trade surplus was the result of falling exports and rising imports. Agri-exports, after peaking at $42.9 billion in 2013-14 fell to $33.7 billion in 2016-17, while imports kept rising  from $17.5 billion in 2013-14 to $25.5 billion by 2016-17. Agri-exports suffered primarily due to the significant fall in exports of cereals (especially wheat and maize), cotton, oilseeds and, to some extent, bovine meat (Figure 2). This, in turn, was largely due to a steep fall in global prices and restrictive export policies. Global prices of wheat, maize, soybean, and cotton, for example, fell by 47, 39, 25 and 18 per cent, respectively, during 2013-2016. The FAO food price index fell from 209.8 in 2013 to 161.5 in 2016. Export policies for pulses, oilseeds/edible oils and several vegetables were restrictive. Nevertheless, exports of fish-seafood, and fruits-nuts-vegetables (mainly guavas/mangoes, grapes, cashew nuts, onions) have been growing steadily. They touched $5.8 and $3 billion, respectively, in 2016-17 (Figure 2).Agricultural imports have been rising since 2004-05. Edible oils ($11.3 billion), pulses ($4.3 billion), and fruits, nuts, vegetables ($3.1 billion) accounted for $18.7 billion of the total agri-imports of $25.4 billion in 2016-17 (Figure 3).What do these trends mean for policy? First, if India has to promote agri-exports, the countrys policymakers must build global value-chains for some important agri-commodities in which the country has a comparative advantage. Estimates show that India is export competitive in almost 70 per cent of agricultural commodities, non-tradable (that is our prices are between import parity and export parity prices) in about 10-15 per cent commodities, and import competitive in the remaining 15-20 per cent commodities. On the exports front, India is relatively competitive in cereals, especially rice and wheat and maize, and, at times, oilseeds, especially groundnuts and oil meals. The country can also be competitive in groundnut and mustard oil, provided there is an open and stable export policy. India has also been the worlds second largest exporter of cotton.The country has a great potential to export fish and seafood, bovine meat, and fruits, nuts and vegetables. These are the commodities to focus on in order to stimulate agri-exports. This would require infrastructure and institutional support  connecting export houses directly to farmer producer organisations (FPOs), sidestepping the APMC-regulated mandis, removing stocking limits and trading restrictions.Stimulating such exports would also require structural reforms in agriculture. When global prices dip suddenly by 25-30 per cent  for example, between 2013-16  domestic exporters face problems. Export-oriented value-chains may need support in such times. A special package to support value-chains through infrastructural investments (in assaying, grading, packaging and storing facilities), which will also create jobs in rural areas, or assistance in adhering to sanitary and phytosanitary standards would make them more resilient to future price shocks.Second, India needs to adopt an open, stable and reliable export policy. Abrupt export bans, high minimum export prices to restrict exports, or other quantitative restrictions on pulses, edible oils  even on vegetables and cereals at times  must give way to a policy that does not put any fetters on exports.Third, on the imports front, India loses out most in the edible oils sector, especially palm and soybean oil. Palm oil is used to adulterate several other oils for the domestic market. Similarly, among pulses, primarily yellow pea is used as an adulterant in besan (chickpea flour). The import policy must, therefore, be designed such that the landed price of palm oil and yellow pea never goes much below the domestic prices of their nearest rivals, say, soybean oil and chickpea, respectively.Last, liberalisation of factor markets, especially land-lease markets, would also help in building more efficient and reliable export value-chains. Over-regulated land-lease markets have kept landholdings small and forced informal tenancies to flourish rendering them incapable of mobilising large-scale capital. Long land-lease arrangements can facilitate private investments in building export-oriented global value-chains, generating rural non-farm employment and enhancing farmers incomes.It is time for the commerce and industry minister to steer a farm-to-foreign strategy, improve agri-trade surpluses by promoting agri-exports, and most importantly create more jobs and bring prosperity to rural areas.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Sources claimed, calls were made from Chandni, a suburban area located near the international border.The traders have sought security from the police. Police, on the other hand, are finding it difficult to trace the callers as the calls have been made from Nepal.Anoop Agarwal, rice miller of Manpur, received a call on his cellphone on November 10. The caller asked his whereabouts and threatened to kill him. Agarwal has lodged a complaint with the police. Deepak Verma, president of traders union also received a similar call from a Nepalese number on Monday evening. The caller said that he was paid Rs 20 lakh to kill him. Verma immediately informed the other traders and sought action from the police. Few days ago Bk Tiwari from Hempur of Kashipur had received similar call from the same number, but didnt report to police.A delegation of Kumaon Garhwal Chamber of Commerce and Industries has met additional superintendent of police (ASP) Jagdish Chandra, to press their demand for strict action against the caller who had threatened the rice miller Agarwal.According to sources, calls have been made from Chandni, a suburban of Nepal closed to Khatima of US Nagar. Ironically, caller has made only four outgoing calls by the this Nepalese sim and no incoming call has been received.We have handed the case over to special operation group(SOG) to trace the caller.

5a5342fc9855b770e037e796,A bovine population bomb,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/641613/a-bovine-population-bomb.html,2017-11-07,"DH new Service, Bengaluru Nov 8 2017, 0:46 ISTThe ban on cattle slaughter has come, honouring the sentiments of millions of Indians. The ban seals the only measure that checked the bovine population and has triggered an explosive growth in the number of animals. The increase in the population of economically unviable cattle is a sure threat to the dairy economy but also detrimental to forestry, grasslands and also our urban facilities. What we urgently need alongside is an ecologically sound response, but that is precisely what no one in the government is looking at just now.Some seven crore Indian farming families have an average of two cows each. An Indian cow, viable economically to its owner, yields on an average six litres of milk per day, for about 300 days a year. If she yields less, her owner normally sells her off to buy a cow which is more productive. This normally happens to old cows after six lactations (in the course of 10 years). But no-one other than the meat trader is willing to buy these older cows. In this sense, beef is largely a by-product of India's vast dairy industry.The 19th Livestock Census said India now has 190.9 million cattle (cows and bulls), down from the 18th census, which reported 199.1 million cattle. The growth rate over 2007-12 has been a negative 4.1%, according to the 2016-17 annual report of the Department of Animal Husbandry, Dairying & Fisheries. Annually, cattle procreate some 80 million calves, of which about 55 million (27.5 crore male and female each) mature for mating. About a tenth of the male calves are inducted into farming, replacing older ones that are put on sale, as are the remaining 90% of the young ones. Here again, meat traders are the only possible buyers.The growth of the dairy economy demands an addition of 1.5 million cows every year. Over 25 to 27.5 million heifers are added to the cattle population each year, giving farmers a generous option to choose the better ones and discard over 20 million low-yielding cows. Out of the 190 million Indian cattle, annually about 50 million males and females come to market in this manner. They fetch about Rs 5,000 per animal, or a sum of Rs 25,000 crore annually, which farmers utilised as seed money to buy good yielding young cows. Losing this avenue and scale of income is staggering, especially as it falls on marginal farmers.Dairy is an economic activity, and to sustain economic value it requires induced growth. The population of cattle was controlled by a diligent arrangement of economic culling called butchery. Now that we have removed this control mechanism, the cattle population explosion has already begun.With the cattle reproducing over 80 million calves annually, even when the mortality rate among the new-born is 30%, the cattle population growth rate is going to be close to 27% a year. At that rate, cattle population will double in less than five years.In the absence of beef in the market, the meat-eating community turns to mutton. It is likely that the demand for goat meat will increase by 20-30% and will boost the present 200.27 million sheep/goat population. It can swell by about 60 million in a couple of years.The Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute, Jhansi, notes that India suffers a 35.6% shortage of green fodder. With the cattle population explosion, the shortage of fodder is likely to double in two years.It is estimated that a herd of 25 cattle requires one acre of cultivated land or one hectare grazing land. An addition of 50 million cattle annually means an additional requirement of about 20 lakh hectares of fodder land, which we don't have. India is thus likely to jeopardise, because of the ban on cow slaughter, well over 50,000 square kilometres of forest cover in the next five to seven years. This is alarming as it amounts to 6.25% of the total 7.942 lakh sq km forest and tree cover in India, according to the India State Forest Report, 2015.Looming exodusAcute shortage of fodder coupled with thankless toiling over uneconomic cows is likely to force farmers to un-rein these cattle, which in turn is likely to unleash an army of 80 million abandoned cattle. With the forest repelling their entry, their eventual exodus into India's 4,000 cities and towns, which is not unexpected, would make the cities choke for many reasons. Daily death of over 1 lakh cattle and over 3 lakh tonnes of dung on the streets would be another issue for local administrations, causing immense health concerns, moral compunction besides.India's dairy value (4.7% of GDP) is more than the GDP value of rice and wheat put together. This suggests the indispensability of the commercial dairy process in our economy, which relies on aggressive procreation. In such a condition, a sound mechanism is imperative to keep dairy population under control. As of now, we have removed the fuse of the population bomb, without a corresponding plan to face it in any manner.As the sale of cattle is a prerogative of dairy farmers and not traders, butchers or milk consumers, it is essential we review the notification in consultation with the farmers rationally and take a fresh decision before it turns into an ecological catastrophe.The secret of Bharat's long, uninterrupted civilisation is that it has always adopted dialectic (complementary) ways of living amidst apparent incongruity within its fold of ethno-lingual communities. A viable solution to the present problem is quite feasible if we appreciate the precept of nature under which life is ever co-determined by the pairs of (binary) opposites, even when they appear to be poles apart. What this means is that what is acceptable and unacceptable in terms of our traditions is not cast in stone.(The writer is Dean, Gandhi Research Foundation, Jalgaon)(The Billion Press)"

Her family says she had not eaten for five days. The state government is investigating whether the family was denied their monthly quota of cheaper food-grain because Shakina, who was paralysed, could not be present at the ration shop for her fingerprint authentication for Aadhaar.Shakina's husband Mohd Ishaq says they begged the ration shop owner for grains when she was paralysed.The Yogi Adityanath government says its initial inquiries suggest Shakina died of an illness, not starvation.The family alleges that it had been denied ration under the Public Distribution System for November, because Shakina - marked as the head of the family in the ration card - was too unwell to be even taken to the shop in a rickshaw, as she was every month.""My wife died because of hunger. She was very ill. We used to take her there in a rickshaw. This time she was very ill. We begged the Kotedar (ration shop owner), but he said he would not give anything without the biometrics,"" said Mohd Ishaq, Shakina's husband.The ration shop owner insisted that Shakina come for her biometric identification using a fingerprint machine at the ration shop, says the family.The family is entitled to 35 kg of subsidised wheat, rice and sugar each month under the central government-sponsored Antyodaya scheme for the poorest.Seema Tripathi, the official in charge of foodgrain supply in Bareilly, said there is no order to deny food if anyone can't be present to authenticate their biometric data.""We found out through the newspapers. She had an Antyodaya card. We are trying to find out the exact cause of the death. There is no provision of the government that people will be denied rations because of an Aadhaar card. We have alternative systems in place. If the person in whose name the Antyodaya card is cannot go, then there is a provision for other relatives to be given ration,"" Ms Tripathi said. Sources in the local administration also question the starvation allegation because they say Shakina had about Rs 4,000 in her bank account. However, they have no answer to the question of why the ration shop insisted on Aadhaar biometrics to provide their share of food.In September, an 11-year-old girl died crying for ""bhaat, bhaat (rice)"" at her village in Jharkhand, allegedly because her family had been denied ration for not linking it with an Aadhaar ID. The state government ordered that no one should be denied food benefits for want of Aadhaar-linking."

Purushottam Sharma, the general Secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Kissan Mahasabha, said that the commission agents exploit the farmers. We have been demanding that the government should directly buy produce from the farmers, which would reduce corruption. There were talks that the farmers would dry their produce at the mandis and sell them directly, but the government is promoting commission agents for benefitting the rice millers and commission agents, he alleged.Farmers also alleged that many rice mill owners themselves function as commission agents.The special investigative team (SIT), which probed the rice scam, had pointed out that the kacha arhatis bought rice from the farmers at rates below the minimum support price (MSP)  the minimum rate of a crop fixed by the government  and sold it to the government at the MSP, due to which the farmers were deprived of their actual dues. Besides, the rice millers had allegedly bought low quality rice from other states and supplied it to the government.This year, only 28,000 metric tonne (MT) rice has been procured by the government in the Kumaon region against the set target of 74,000 MT.Farmers alleged that the commission agents have already purchased the rice at low prices and stocked it. They would sell the purchased rice to the government at the MSP, thus making a killing, they alleged.Lalit Mohan Rayal, the regional food controller of Kumaon, said that on November 13, some paras of the previous commission agent policy have been included in the new policy, which means the system will stay.He said there are different ways for paddy procurement, which includes involvement of the marketing division, Uttarakhand cooperative federation and cooperative societies. Besides, the commission agents also play a big role in the procurement. These persons are registered with the mandi and sales tax department. They purchase grains from farmers in mandi yard, sell it to the government and get 1% commission, he said.Rayal said the number of commission agents is more because there are less numbers of government weighing centres. He said a close watch would be kept on the rice procurement by the commission agents so that they do not indulge in malpractises and buy grains from farmers at lower rates than MSP."

Photo: MintVisakhapatnam: A mechanical engineer from Andhra Pradesh raised the issue of farmer deaths caused due to automation choosing more harmful chemical ratios while spraying pesticides, at an interaction between state chief minister Chandrababu Naidu and progressive farmers at the Agtech summit held in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.In response, Naidu said his government would look into the matter and consider forming a policy.In the usage of low-volume and ultra-low volume sprays (of pesticides), the automisation ratio (which is the proportion of water mixed with chemicals), is not regulated and is automated. It changes the surface chemistry of the active particles (chemicals) automatically. If proper safety is not taken, it will have a lot of bad effects on humans and the entire surrounding ecosystem (due to a higher presence of chemicals), explained Rajkumar Bollem, an operations manager for a private company.Bollem, who belongs to the Prakasam district and works in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, claimed that 39 farmers in Maharashtra had recently died due to this problem. That was the official number, but unofficially, it was about 200. There also needs to be a policy regulating drones that spray pesticides, he told Mint on the sidelines of the event.Taking note, Naidu said there was a need for regulating automated sprays and also drone usage. He added that his government would also look into the other matters presented to him by farmers during the interaction.We will even give more preference to farmers than industries. More youth should become agri(cultural) entrepreneurs and not just entrepreneurs, he said, addressing farmers at the interaction. Naidu also said his government would provide all the resources required by the agriculture sector without any restraint.J.B. Appa Rao, a former employee of Andhra Pradesh Grameen Bank who took to farming post retirement, said one of the major challenges in the agriculture sector is getting back equal or more returns than the money invested in farming. Untimely rains only add to the problem, he added.This year I have opted for a new variety of sugar-free rice that was introduced last year. Earlier we used to go for traditional varieties of farming, Rao said.P. Rameshwar Rao, a sugarcane farmer, presented a pen-drive and file comprising photos of his farm to the state government, to showcase his farm practices.

His vital signs are stabilizing although he continues to remain unconscious and relying on a breathing machine. After consecutive surgeries to repair internal organ damage and other injuries, no further surgeries are planned as of yet, said Shin Mi-jeong, an official at the Ajou University Medical Center near Seoul.The soldier was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his dramatic escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers.He is believed to be an army staff sergeant in his mid-20s who was stationed in the Joint Security Area in the United Nations truce village of Panmunjom, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker of South Koreas ruling party, briefed by the National Intelligence Service.A South Korean soldier talks with a surgeon at a hospital where a North Korean soldier who defected to the South after being shot and wounded by the North Korean military is hospitalised, in Suwon. (Reuters Photo)North Korea has not commented on the defection.While the contents of the soldiers stomach dont necessarily reflect the population as a whole, his status as a soldier  with an elite assignment - would indicate he would at least be as well nourished as an average North Korean.He was shot in his buttocks, armpit, back shoulder and knee among other wounds, according to the hospital where the soldier is being treated.The best fertiliserParasitic worms were also once common in South Korea 40 to 50 years ago, Lee noted during his briefing, but have all but disappeared as economic conditions greatly improved.Other doctors have also described removing various types of worms and parasites from North Korean defectors.Their continued prevalence north of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas could be in part tied to the use of human excrement, often called night soil.Read | North Korean soldier critical: From MiG pilot to officials, defectors who escapedChemical fertiliser was supplied by the state until the 1970s, but from the early 1980s, production started to decrease, said Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert who defected to South Korea in 1995. By the 1990s, the state could not supply it anymore, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead.In 2014, supreme leader Kim Jong Un personally urged farmers to use human faeces, along with animal waste and organic compost, to fertilise their fields.A lack of livestock, however, made it difficult to find animal waste, said Lee, the agriculture expert.Even harder to overcome, he said, is the view of night soil as the best fertiliser in North Korea, despite the risk of worms and parasites.Vegetables grown in it are considered more delicious than others, Lee said.Limited dietsThe medical briefing described the wounded soldier as being 170 cm (5 feet 5 inches) and 60 kg (132 pounds) with his stomach containing corn. Its a staple grain that more North Koreans may be relying on in the wake of what the United Nations has called the worst drought since 2001.Imported corn, which is less preferred but cheaper to obtain than rice, has tended to increase in years when North Koreans are more worried about their seasonal harvests.Between January and September this year, China exported nearly 49,000 tonnes of corn to North Korea, compared to only 3,125 tonnes in all of 2016, according to data released by Beijing.Despite the drought and international sanctions over Pyongyangs nuclear programme, the cost of corn and rice has remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website.North Korean soldiers patrol behind a border fence near the North Korean town of Sinuiju. (Reuters File Photo)Since the 1990s, when government rations failed to prevent a famine hitting the country, North Koreans have gradually turned to markets and other private means to feed themselves.The World Food Programme says a quarter of North Korean children 6-59 months old, who attend nurseries that the organisation assists, suffer from chronic malnutrition.On average North Koreans are less nourished than their southern neighbours. The WFP says around one in four children have grown less tall than their South Korean counterparts. A study from 2009 said pre-school children in the North were up to 13 cm (5 inches) shorter and up to 7 kg (15 pounds) lighter than those brought up in the South.The main issue in DPRK is a monotonous diet  mainly rice/maize, kimchi and bean paste  lacking in essential fats and protein, the WFP told Reuters in a statement last month."

PRESPL was to set up eight more plants in the next four years, but that never happened.1ST PLANT WAS SUCCESS BUT GAVE NO PROFITSLt Col Monish Ahuja (retd), PRESPL director, who is also chairman of the CII committee on biomass, says the 12-MW plant was a huge success.Besides the two chief ministers of Punjab and Haryana, even the Pakistan Punjab CM visited it to gain an insight into this farm-friendly technology.Due to the silica content in the rice straw, nobody was using 100% paddy straw, but we overcame this snag with some technical interventions, says Ahuja.But the plant, he rues, never reaped profits for the company. The electricity tariff we get is a mere Rs 6.20 per unit, we cant be financially viable unless we get Rs 8 per unit, says Ahuja.The previous Akali-BJP government also made many promises about generating power from biomass when it tied up with Viaton Energy Private Ltd to set up a 10-MW power plant at Khokar Khurd village in Mansa in 2013.Bikram Singh Majithia, the then minister for non-conventional energy, had promised to set up 29 more biomass power plants with a generation capability of 300 MW.All praise for such plants for the green energy generated by these, Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu, who was chief executive officer of Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA) till 2013, says most of the existing plants, including those near Muktsar and Lambi, are doing well.The initial plan, he says, was to set up 100 such plants to mop up the entire paddy straw. But there were some challenges. The paddy straw has high silica content, which builds up in the boilers. Thats why these plants use paddy straw with cotton residue or eucalyptus branches in the ratio of 80:20.OPERATIONAL PROBLEMSTej Pal Singh, general manager of the Viaton plant near Mansa since 2014, says there are many other operational problems. Its an unorganised sector. We have to go from farm to farm to collect the straw during the season. Then it is stored and used through the year, says Singh. The fuel value of the stored straw, he says, decreases with time. The plant also cant function when it rains.7 BIOMASS PLANTS GENERATING 62.5 MWPunjab is home to seven private biomass power plants at Muktsar, Abohar, Malout, Garhshankar, Rajpura, Nakodar and Mansa, which together generate 62.5 MW.MP Singh, joint director of Punjab Energy Development Agency (PEDA), says they invited bids for more such plants last year and had received an enthusiastic response for 12 projects with a capacity of 150 MW, but these are still hanging fire as the companies hadnt been able to sign power purchase agreements with the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).BLURB Punjabs MoU with Chennai-based company to set up 400 biomass power plants to tackle paddy straw may be good news, but experts are not so excited over the initiativeNEW TECHNOLOGY TO PUNJABS RESCUE?RK Verma, chief executive officer of Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, who inked the MoU with Neway Engineers MSW Private Limited, said they are banking on a new technology to overcome the stubble crisis. Verma said the three-year-old Chennai-based company had successfully set up a municipal solid waste management plant in Chennai, and was confident of replicating the same model in Punjab. |It is a patented waste-to-energy technology, and they will be able to convert the paddy straw into a coal-like product, which they claim is in great demand by a large number of industries, including the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), said Verma.He said the company was also confident of mobilising the capital required to set up 400 plants across the state in the next 10 months. Allaying concerns about partnering with a newbie, he said, The MoU is just the beginning of a journey, its not a commitment. We have not promised any funds. We hope the new technology will be able to help us deal with the problem of paddy straw next year.Verma also hoped that given the enormity of the issue, all the stakeholders will work efficiently and quickly to set the project in motion."

Escaped from North Korea in May 2017.- - -When Kim Jong Un became the leader of North Korea almost six years ago, many North Koreans thought that their lives were going to improve. He offered the hope of generational change in the world's longest-running communist dynasty. After all, he was so young. A millennial. Someone with experience of the outside world.But the ""Great Successor,"" as he is called by the regime, has turned out to be every bit as brutal as his father and grandfather before him. Even as he has allowed greater economic freedom, he has tried to seal the country off more than ever, stepping up security along the border with China and stepping up the punishments for those who dare to try to cross it. And at home, freedom of speech, and of thought, is still a mirage.In six months of interviews in South Korea and Thailand, The Washington Post talked with more than 25 North Koreans from different walks of life who lived in Kim Jong Un's North Korea and managed to escape from it. In barbecue restaurants, cramped apartments and hotel rooms, these refugees provided the fullest account to date of daily life inside North Korea and how it has changed, and how it hasn't, since Kim took over from his father, Kim Jong Il, at the end of 2011. Many are from the northern parts of the country that border China - the part of North Korea where life is toughest, and where knowledge about the outside world just across the river is most widespread - and are from the relatively small segment of the population that is prepared to take the risks involved in trying to escape.Some parts of their stories cannot be independently verified because of the secretive nature of the regime, and their names have been withheld to protect their family members still in North Korea. They were introduced to The Post by groups that help North Korean escapees, including No Chain for North Korea, Woorion and Liberty in North Korea.But in talking about their personal experiences, including torture and the culture of surveillance, they recounted the hardships of daily life under Kim Jong Un's regime. They paint a picture of a once-communist state that has all but broken down, its state-directed economy at a standstill. Today, North Koreans are making their own way, earning money in an entrepreneurial and often illegal fashion. There are only a few problems in North Korea these days that money can't solve.As life inside North Korea is changing, so too are people's reasons for escaping.Increasingly, North Koreans are not fleeing their totalitarian state because they are hungry, as they did during the 15 or so years following the outbreak of a devastating famine in the mid-1990s. Now, they are leaving because they are disillusioned.Market activity is exploding, andwith that comes a flow of information, whether as chitchat from traders who cross into China or as soap operas loaded on USB sticks. And this leads many North Koreans to dream in a way they hadn't before.Some are leaving North Korea because they want their children to get a better education. Some are leaving because their dreams of success and riches in the North Korean system are being thwarted. And some are leaving because they want to be able to speak their minds.- - -A new Kim at the helmKorean Central News Agency - Dec. 19, 2011 - ""Standing at the forefront of the Korean revolution is Kim Jong Un, great successor to the revolutionary cause of Juche [self-reliance ideology] and outstanding leader of our party, army and people.""- - -The meat delivery guy, now 23, from Undok. Escaped in 2014:""Kim Jong Un came to power the same year I graduated from high school, and I had very high hopes for him. I heard that he'd studied abroad in Switzerland. I thought he was going to be very different from his father.""- - -The young mother, now 29, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2014:""I could see how young he was, and I hoped that maybe things were going to get better. We were given some rations through our neighborhood association - we even got meat and fish - at the time he took over.""- - -The preschooler, now 7, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2014:""I remember how fat he was. He had a very fat face like a pig.""- - -As the regime started preparing for Kim's succession, it put out a song that everyone in the country was made to learn, called ""Footsteps."" The idea was that Kim was following in the footsteps of his father and would lead the country into a glorious future.- - -The money man, now 43, from Hyesan. Escaped in 2015:""We heard the song 'Footsteps' and we were told to memorize it so [we] knew that he was going to be the leader after Kim Jong Il. We were told how great he was, that he could ride a horse when he was 5 years old and shoot a gun when he was 3. Of course we didn't believe these things, but if you laughed or said anything, you'd be killed.""- - -The university student, now 37, from Sariwon. Escaped in 2013:""I was in my second year at the university when this person was introduced to us as our new leader. I thought it was a joke. Among my closest friends, we were calling him a piece of s---. Everyone thinks this, but you can only say it to your closest friends or to your parents if you know that they agree.""- - -The drug dealer, now 46, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2014:""I created some kind of fantasy in my mind about Kim Jong Un. Because he was so young, I thought he was going to open North Korea's doors, but after he took power and I lived three years under him, life became harder.""- - -Money talksIn theory, North Korea is a bastion of socialism, a country where the state provides everything, including housing, health care, education and jobs. In reality, the state economy barely operates anymore. People work in factories and fields, but there is little for them to do, and they are paid almost nothing. A vibrant private economy has sprung up out of necessity, one where people find ways to make money on their own, whether through selling homemade tofu or dealing drugs, through smuggling small DVD players with screens called ""notels"" over the border or extracting bribes.- - -The university student:""North Korea technically has a centrally planned economy, but now people's lives revolve around the market. No one expects the government to provide things anymore. Everyone has to find their own way to survive.""- - -The hairdresser, now 23, from Hyesan. Escaped in 2016:""I had to drop out of teachers college when I was 19 because my father became ill so I needed to work. I started doing people's hair at my house. All the women wanted perms. I charged 30 [Chinese] yuan for a regular perm or 50 yuan for a perm with better products. But it was still hard to make money. [Thirty yuan is about $4.50.]""- - -""The farmer, now 46, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2014.""We lived in the city center, but we rented some land in the foothills of the mountains and grew corn there. During planting and harvest season, we would wake up at 4 a.m. and walk three hours to reach the farmland. We'd take a little break for lunch or a snack, then work until 8 p.m. before walking home again. Doing the weeding was the hardest because we had to get rid of them by hand. And we'd buy beans from the market and make tofu that we'd sell from our house. Our profit was less than 5,000 won [60 cents at the black market rate] a day. But because the bean price fluctuates, sometimes we were left with nothing at all.- - -North Koreans first learned how to be entrepreneurs during the famine, when they had to make money to survive. While men had to continue to show up for work in dormant factories, women would turn corn into noodles and keep a little for themselves but sell the rest so they could buy more corn for the following day. Homeless children would steal manhole covers to sell as scrap metal. Markets began to appear and took hold. North Koreans used to joke you could buy everything there except cats' horns.These days, you can probably buy cats' horns, too.- - -The bean trader, now 23, from Hyesan. Escaped in 2014:""I had an aunt in Pyongyang who sold beans in the market there. I would buy what she needed from various farmers and get it to her. I'd pay people to pack up the beans into sacks, pay porters to take them to the station, get them onto the train. You have to smooth the way with money. My uncle is in the military, so his position provided protection for my aunt's business. Of course, my aunt was the main earner in the house. It's the women who can really make money in North Korea.""- - -Tens of thousands of North Koreans now work outside the country, in lumber yards and garment factories and on construction sites, in China, Russia and other countries, earning foreign currency. Generally, two-thirds of their pay goes to the regime, and they're allowed to keep the rest.- - -The construction worker, now 40, from Pyongyang. Escaped in 2015:""I wanted to earn money for my family and buy a house, so I paid $100 to bribe my way into an overseas construction job. I was sent to St. Petersburg. We lived at the construction site and would work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., or sometimes until midnight in the summer, then we'd go back to our dormitory to eat. We worked seven days a week, but we could finish early on Sundays - 7 p.m. - and that was nice. My whole purpose for being there was to make lots of money and go home proud of my achievement. I still remember the first time I got paid. It was 1,000 rubles. When I finished work at 10 p.m., I went to the store and saw that a bottle of beer was 27 rubles. I thought, wow I'm rich.""- - -As the economy and the rules that govern it change, there are more and more gray areas that can be exploited. That means that illegal trade and activity have blossomed, too.- - -The drug dealer:""I did so many things that I wasn't supposed to do. I worked as a broker transferring money and connecting people in North Korea with people in South Korea through phone calls. I arranged reunions for them in China. I smuggled antiques out of North Korea and sold them in China. I sold ginseng and pheasants to China. And I dealt ice [methamphetamines]. Officially, I was a factory worker, but I bribed my way out of having to go to work. If you don't operate this way in North Korea, you have nothing.""- - -The doctor, now 42, from Hyesan. Escaped in 2014:""The salary for doctors was about 3,500 won a month. That was less than it cost to buy one kilogram of rice. So of course, being a doctor was not my main job. My main job was smuggling at night. I would send herbal medicine from North Korea into China, and with the money, I would import home appliances back into North Korea. Rice cookers, notels, LCD monitors, that kind of thing.""- - -From the biggest cities to the smallest villages, there is now some kind of market building where people can sell their wares and keep their profits. Some are state-run, some are state-sanctioned, some are ad hoc. The markets have been retroactively legalized by the regime.Money is now needed for nearly everything - even for the parts of communist life that the Kim regime crows about providing, like housing and schooling. Bribery and corruption have become endemic, undermining the regime by loosening controls and creating incentives that may not always be in line with Kim's priorities.- - -The farmer:""Technically, you don't have to pay to go to school, but the teachers tell you that you have to submit a certain amount of beans or rabbit skins that can be sold. If you don't submit, you get told off continuously, and that's why students stop going to school. The kids are hurt just because the parents can't afford it.""- - -The young mother:""I used to pay the teachers at my daughter's school so they would look after her better than others. I would give them 120,000 won at a time - that's enough to buy 25 kilograms of rice - twice a year. If you don't pay the teachers, they won't make any effort.""- - -The fisherman, now 45, from Ryongchon. Escaped in 2017:""I lived through all three Kims, but our life was not getting any better for any of us. We all have to pay for Kim Jong Un's projects, like Ryomyong Street [a residential development in Pyongyang]. We had to contribute 15,000 North Korean won per household [more than four months' salary] to the government for that street.""- - -The drug dealer:""My main business was selling ice. I think that 70 or 80 percent of the adults in Hoeryong city were using ice. My customers were just ordinary people. Police officers, security agents, party members, teachers, doctors. Ice made a really good gift for birthday parties or for high school graduation presents. It makes you feel good and helps you release stress, and it really helps relations between men and women. My 76-year-old mother was using it because she had low blood pressure, and it worked well. Lots of police officers and security agents would come to my house to smoke, and of course I didn't charge them - they were my protection. They would come by during their lunch break, stop by my house. The head of the secret police in my area was almost living at my house.""- - -The ability to make money, sometimes lots of money, through means both legal and illegal has led to visible inequality in a country that has long touted itself as an egalitarian socialist paradise. This could be a potential source of disruption. Bean traders and drug dealers and everyone in between have the prospect of making a decent living. Those working only in official jobs, whether they be on a state-owned ostrich farm or in a government ministry in Pyongyang, earn only a few dollars a month and get little in the way of rations to supplement their meager salaries.- - -The rich kid, now 20, from Chongjin. Escaped in 2014:""Skating rinks opened in 2013, and rollerblading became a really big thing. Rich kids had their own rollerblades. We'd carry them slung over our shoulders as we walked to the rink - it was a status symbol, a sign that you have money. I bought my rollerblades at the market. They were pink, and it cost 200 Chinese yuan. That's the same price as 30 kilograms of rice. It's unthinkable for poor kids.""- - -The construction worker:""There were long periods where we didn't get paid. I once went for six months without getting any salary at all. We lived in a shipping container at the construction site. We were given rice and cabbage and one egg per person per day, and we had an electric coil in our container that we could cook on. We needed some protein because our work was so hard, so we started buying pigskin at the market because it was cheap. Washing was like a special occasion. But if you went to the bathhouse, you would miss out on work. Once I didn't bathe for two months. We didn't think anything of it. It was just the way we lived.""- - -The rich kid:""Cellphones are a big thing. To be able to afford a smartphone, you had to come from a rich family. Of course, there were some poor kids at my school, but I didn't hang out with them. I had an Arirang smartphone that cost $400. When boys came up to talk to me, I'd check out their phone. If they had one of those old-style phones with buttons, I wasn't interested.:- - -The markets are the distribution point not just for goods, but also for information. Chatter, rumors, illicit foreign media.- - -The farmer:""Women make their living in the market, and while they're sitting there at the stalls, they talk. So the market is a great place to learn about the outside world.""- - -The phone connector, now 49, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2013:""I watched lots of [smuggled] movies and soap operas on USB sticks from the market. I would plug them into my TV. Vendors who are selling ordinary things like batteries or rice or whatever, they hide the USBs inside under the counter. When you go into the market you say to the vendors: Do you have anything delicious today? That's the code. USBs are also good because they are so easy to hide, and you can just break them if you get caught.""- - -The fisherman:""In the past, if you watched Chinese movies on USBs you were okay. You got put in a labor camp only if you were caught with South Korean or American movies. But now, under Kim Jong Un, you get sent to a labor camp if you're caught watching Chinese movies, too. The police and the security services and government officials live better these days. The more people they catch, the more money they earn.""- - -The teenage prisoner, now 22, from Hyesan. Escaped in 2013:""I loved the way that women were being cherished. North Korea is a very male-oriented society, men never bother about taking care of women. And I liked to look at their fancy cars and houses.""- - -The accordion player, now 25, from Hamhung. Escaped in 2015:""My mom worked in the market selling home appliances, so she had a way to get DVDs. I watched Chinese, Indian and Russian movies, and lots of South Korean soap operas. I thought that if I got to South Korea, I could do anything I wanted.""- - -It is impossible to overstate the pervasiveness of the personality cult surrounding the Kims in North Korea. Founding President Kim Il Sung, his son Kim Jong Il and his grandson, the current leader, Kim Jong Un form a kind of holy trinity in North Korea. There is no criticizing them or questioning the system - at least not without risking your freedom and the freedom of your entire family. Your life itself could be at stake.- - -The preschooler:""I learned songs about the general and about the Kim family and how great Kim Il Sung was.""- - -The elementary schoolgirl, now 7, from Ryongchon. Escaped in 2017:""We got gifts on Kim Jong Un's birthday: candy and cookies and gum and puffed rice. I was so grateful to him for giving me all these sweets. We would stand up in class and say, 'Thank you, General Kim Jong Un.' ""- - -The university student:""We had ideological education for 90 minutes every day. There was revolutionary history, lessons about Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un. Of course, they taught us about why we needed nuclear weapons, and they would tell us that we needed to make sacrifices in our daily lives so they could build these weapons and protect our country, keep the nation safe. I was so sick and tired of hearing about all this revolutionary history, I was so sick of calling everyone 'comrade.' I didn't care about any of that stuff.""- - -The young mother:""Everybody knew that Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un were both liars, that everything is their fault, but it's impossible to voice any opposition because we are under such tight surveillance. If someone is drunk and says Kim Jong Un is a son of a bitch, you'll never see them again.""- - -The doctor:""It's like a religion. From birth, you learn about the Kim family, learn that they are gods, that you must be absolutely obedient to the Kim family. The elites are treated nicely, and because of that they make sure that the system stays stable. But for everyone else, it's a reign of terror. The Kim family uses terror to keep people scared, and that makes it impossible to stage any kind of social gathering, let alone an uprising.""- - -The construction worker:""We had education sessions when we would go back to the main building and into a big room where there were portraits of the leaders. Everyone had to bow and buy bunches of flowers to lay in front of the portraits. There would be a speech by the boss, who was a party member. We would hear about how Kim Jong Un had done this and this and that [he] was working so hard for the party and for the nation and for the people. I believed it up until the Kim Jong Un era, but this exaggeration was just too much. It just didn't make sense.""- - -The money man:""Every month there was special instruction about Kim Jong Un. It came down from Pyongyang to the neighborhood associations. We were told that Kim Jong Un wanted to know everything so that he could take proper care of everyone, help everyone. Nobody believed this because if Kim Jong Un knew we had no electricity and were eating corn rice [imitation rice made from ground corn], why wasn't he doing anything about it?""- - -The bean trader:""There was this story going around that Kim Il Sung had asked Kim Jong Un to get him an apple. Kim Jong Un asked for a shovel because he wanted to bring the whole tree. It was the kind of joke that the secret police would create. Instead of just doing top-down teaching, they would also create stories like this [about devotion to the regime] because they thought that their propaganda would circulate better as rumors and would seem more convincing.""- - -North Korea operates as a vast surveillance state, with a menacing state security department called the Bowibu as its backbone. Its agents are everywhere and operate with impunity.The regime also operates a kind of neighborhood watch system. Every district in every town or city is broken up into neighborhood groups of 30 or 40 households, each with a leader who is responsible for coordinating grass-roots surveillance and encouraging people to snitch.- - -The young mother:""People in each neighborhood association are always checking up on each other. If one family seems to be living better than everyone else, then all the neighbors try to find out how they are making their money. Everybody is sensitive because if someone seems to be living well, then people get jealous of that house. Nobody has to be asked to bring that wealthy family down and make sure that this wealthy family loses their money. When you see a family lose their house, that feels good. That's why it's important not to show off how wealthy you are.""- - -The farmer:""Of course I thought about the outside world, but if you say, ""I want to go to China or South Korea,"" then it can be reported by an informant to the security services. You can think it, but you can't say it. You never know who is going to snitch on you. We often heard and saw how Chinese people had money because Chinese people used to come to North Korea to sell things, so we thought it would be nice to live there.""- - -The rich kid:""There were youth leaders who would patrol around, looking for things that we weren't supposed to be doing. If you were wearing jeans or skinny pants, or if you had a manicure or your hair was too long, you would get in trouble. They would sometimes check your phone to see if you had any South Korean songs. I got busted for this, but I got out of it by buying them a box of 20 bottles of beer.""- - -For those who ran afoul of the regime in ways that money could not solve, the punishment could be harsh.Those accused of economic crimes - which could involve any kind of private enterprise - are sent to prisons and often made to do hard labor, such as building roads by hand. But those accused of being traitors to the nation, a broad category that includes questioning the Kim family or its system, end up in political prison camps where they have to work in mines and receive almost no food. It is not unusual for three generations of a ""traitor's"" family to end up in these concentration camps under North Korea's guilt-by-association system.- - -The teenage prisoner:""When I was 16, I was staying at my grandma's house and there was a banging on the door late at night. Two secret police officers took me to the police station and asked me: 'Where are your parents?' I told them I didn't know. It turned out that they had gone missing and I suspected that my mom's business associates, when they realized this, planted a whole lot of stuff on her, said that she was the mastermind behind this big smuggling operation. The police yelled at me: 'You're just like your mother. You probably have fantasies about China, too.' They slapped my face about five times.""- - -The phone connector:""The first time I went to prison, I had been caught helping people make phone calls to their relatives in South Korea. I was sentenced to four months' hard labor, building a road on the side of a mountain that they said we needed in case there was a war. The men did the digging and the women had to carry rocks and soil.""- - -Escapees from North Korea's gruesome political prisons have recounted brutal treatment over the years, including medieval torture with shackles and fire and being forced to undergo abortions by the crudest methods. Human rights activists say that this appears to have lessened slightly under Kim. But severe beatings and certain kinds of torture - including being forced to remain in stress positions for crippling lengths of time - are commonplace throughout North Korea's detention systems, as are public executions.- - -The teenage prisoner:""I was interrogated again by the secret police, and they wanted to know about my mother's business. They were slapping me around the face again. They always go for the face. I was beaten severely that time. They pushed me so hard against the wall that I had blood coming from my head. I still get a headache sometimes. While I was there they made me sit with my legs crossed and my arms resting on my knees and my head always down. If you move at all or if you try to stretch your legs out, they will yell at you and hit you. I had to stay like that for hours on end.""- - -The money man:""In 2015, a money transfer went bad - the woman I'd given the money to got caught and she ratted on me - and I was put in detention. I spent two months there. I wasn't treated like a human being - they beat me, they made me sit in stress positions where I couldn't lift my head. Two times they slapped my face and kicked me during interrogation, but I was not beaten up badly. Maybe because I was not a nobody, maybe they feared that I knew someone who could get back at them. ""- - -Starvation is often part of the punishment, even for children. The 16-year-old lost 13 pounds in prison, weighing only 88 pounds when she emerged.- - -The teenage prisoner:""We got up at 6 a.m. every day and went to bed at 11 p.m., and in between we would be working the whole time, shoveling cement or lugging sacks, except for lunch. Lunch was usually steamed corn. I was too scared to eat. I cried a lot. I didn't want to live.""- - -The phone connector:""Even though we were working so hard in prison camp, all we got to eat was a tiny bit of corn rice and a small potato. By the time I got out, I was so malnourished I could hardly walk.""- - -It is this web of prisons and concentration camps, coupled with the threat of execution, that stops people from speaking up. There is no organized dissent in North Korea, no political opposition.- - -The drug dealer:""If you make problems, then your whole family gets punished. That's why people don't want to make any trouble. If I get punished for my wrongdoing, that's one thing. But it's my whole family that would be put at risk if I did something. North Koreans have seen that Kim Jong Un killed his own uncle, so we understand how merciless he can be. That's why you can't have an uprising in North Korea.""- - -The university student:""The secret to North Korea's survival is the reign of terror. Why do you think North Korea has public executions? Why do you think they block all communications? Why do you think North Koreans leave, knowing that they will never see their families again? It shows how bad things are. All our rights as people have been stripped away.""- - -The phone connector:""If you speak out against the system, you will immediately be arrested. And if you do something wrong, then three generations of your family will be punished. In 2009, I heard there was a going to be some kind of coup launched in Chongjin and that all of the people involved were executed. When you hear about cases like this, of course you're scared. So instead of trying to do something to change the system, it's better just to leave.""- - -Some people do leave, but not that many. It's incredibly risky and logistically difficult to get around the border guards and the barbed wire. Unknown thousands cross into China each year. Some remain in China, almost always young women who get sold to poor Chinese men in the countryside who can't get a wife any other way. Some get caught and sent back - to certain imprisonment.- - -The repatriated wife, now 50, from Nampo. Escaped for the last time in 2016:""I had lived in China for 20 years, but someone must have reported me. I was sent back to North Korea, and I spent two and a half years in a prison camp. [After she had left once more for China], I knew I couldn't be repatriated again. I thought that it would be the end of my life.""- - -But each year, a thousand or so North Koreans make it to South Korea. In the 20-odd years since the famine, only 30,000 North Koreans have made it to the southern side of the peninsula.During the late 1990s and the early 2000s, almost all the North Koreans who fled were escaping out of hunger or economic need. But the explosion of markets has improved life for many. Today, more people are leaving North Korea because they are disillusioned with the system, not because they can't feed their families.- - -The accordion player:""I was ambitious. I wanted to be a party member and enjoy all the opportunities that come with that. My dream was to make lots of money and be a high-ranking government official. Family background means so much in North Korea, but I had family in China and I realized that this would stop me from being able to follow my dreams. I left because I didn't have the freedom to do what I wanted to do.""- - -The bean trader:""I wanted to progress in life, I wanted to go to university, but because my mother had defected to China, it looked like I wouldn't be able to go any further. It looked like I would be stuck in North Korea where I was. I could have moved, lived, no problem, but I felt like I didn't have any future in North Korea. That's why I decided to leave.""- - -The meat delivery guy:""We were told in school that we could be anybody. But after graduation, I realized that this wasn't true and that I was being punished for somebody else's wrongdoing. I realized I wouldn't be able to survive here. So for two years I looked for a way out. When I thought about escaping, it gave me a psychological boost.""- - -The doctor:""I hoped to work abroad as a doctor in the Middle East or Africa. But to work overseas you have to pass security screening to make sure you're ideologically sound and aren't going to defect. That's a problem that money can't solve and that's where I got blocked. I was very angry, very annoyed. I cursed our society. I am a very capable person, and I was a party member, but even I couldn't make it.""- - -The construction worker:""I worked for three and a half years, but I made only $2,000 during that time. We were allowed to work overseas for five years maximum, and I was hoping to save $10,000 and return home proud. I realized it wasn't going to happen, so I started looking for a chance to escape.""- - -The university student:""I was so disgusted with the system. I didn't have freedom to speak my mind, or to travel anywhere I wanted, or even to wear what I wanted. It was like living in a prison. We were monitored all the time by our neighborhood leader, by the normal police, by the secret police. If you ask me what was the worst thing about North Korea, I'd say: Being born there""- - -The bride:After graduating from high school, she worked in the cornfields for two years but just sat at home after that. So when she heard that her friend had been sold to a Chinese man as a wife, she asked to be introduced to the broker so that she could be sold, too. At least she'd be able to earn money in China. She has just arrived in South Korea.- - -The meat delivery guy:Because his mother was a ""traitor"" who had defected to South Korea, he was blocked from going to college or joining the military. Instead, he was put to work doing manual labor with criminals and low-lifes, for almost no salary. He made money by delivering meat from his father's butchery to local restaurants. He is now a university student in South Korea.- - -The young mother, now 29, from Hoeryong. Escaped in 2014:She came from a good family background, but her father was violent. She married young, to a truck driver, and they lived comfortably in North Korea. But her aunts lived in the South, and they told her she should bring their sister, her mother, to them. So she defected with her husband and their two daughters, a 4-year-old and a 1-month-old. She is now an office worker in South Korea.- - -The preschooler:She doesn't remember much of her life in North Korea, just her friends from preschool and a few songs that they used to sing. She is now in elementary school in South Korea.- - -The money man:He had been a border guard but bribed his way out. He then started working as a money transfer broker, moving cash from families in China or South Korea to relatives in North Korea, all for a hefty fee. But one day a deal went bad when a customer in North Korea was caught with a large amount of Chinese currency and turned him in. He now works at a factory in South Korea.- - -The university student:He came from an ordinary family but had big dreams. He kept thinking about escaping to China and becoming successful, doing a job that he found rewarding. One day his parents told him he should chase his dreams. So he did. He is now a reporter in South Korea.- - -The drug dealer:After bribing his way out of his factory job during the famine, he got involved in all sorts of illegal activities, from smuggling antiques to selling ice, a methamphetamine, in both China and North Korea. He is now a construction worker in South Korea.- - -The hairdresser:She had been at teachers college but had to quit when she was 19 to earn money for the family after her father became sick. She started doing hair at her house, but then got an opportunity to work at a restaurant in China and earn much more. So off she went, with a broker. But she discovered there was no restaurant. Instead, she was sold to a Chinese man for $12,000. She has just arrived in South Korea.- - -The farmer:After her husband defected, she had to make ends meet. She made tofu from scratch, grew corn in a plot of land several hours' walk from her home and raised pigs in her yard. It was hard to make ends meet, but it became even harder when she hurt her back and struggled to work. She still has a bad back and cannot work in South Korea.- - -The bean trader:He came from a privileged family and lived well, until his grandfather got in trouble with the regime and his mother defected. So he worked as a trader, sourcing beans and sending them to his aunt, who would sell them at the markets in Pyongyang. He is now a university student in South Korea.- - -The construction worker:He worked and bribed his way into a construction job in Russia, a potentially lucrative posting. But despite working long hours, he often went months without being paid. Watching South Korean television opened his eyes to the lies of North Korea. He now works in South Korea.- - -The doctor:He worked at a hospital in Hyesan and was a member of the Workers' Party. He dreamed of being sent to the Middle East or Africa, where he could make much more money. But he was blocked from leaving.

The progressive farmer from Bishanpur Chana village near Patiala, whos bagged several awards for organic farming, has not been burning paddy stubble since the last season.Once I realised what it is doing to the air we breathe, and the soil on which we grow our crops, I stopped burning the stubble, says Raj, who owns 20 acres.He is among the handful of farmers in Patiala district who improvised the tools they owned to sow wheat without burning the paddy stubble.Enterprising farmersI watered 10 acres extensively and then hired a rotavator, which mixed the straw with soil, before sowing wheat. On the remaining 10 acres, I used a zero drill that I already owned to sow wheat, says Raj, telling you how he did not buy any of the machines that Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) officials have been espousing.Most farmers say the incidence of burning would also peter off if the government bans slow-growing varieties such as PUSA 144, and promotes fast-growing breeds.They are expensive, besides I wanted to do something that other farmers could also follow, says Raj, who claims 80% of farmers in the state own the zero drill, while 50% have the rotavator.Gurbans Singh Punia, 70, a retired excise and taxation officer, whose family grows rice on 70 acres at Bibipur village, also refrained from burning the stubble this year. Punia says giving match stick the short shrift wasnt much of a struggle on the 40 acres on which hes sown the quick-growing PR 126 and PR 1509 varieties of rice.I harvested my crop in the last week of September and had over a month to prepare for wheat sowing. Punia watered the fields for a month till the straw decomposed, and then ploughed it with a harrow. Like Raj, Punia takes pride in the fact that he didnt buy any new equipment.But he had some trouble on the 20 acres on which he had sown the late-growing PR 1121 variety of basmati. I had no time to water and wait for the straw to disintegrate. On 10 acres, I used a normal cutter and then gave it to a factory, which made straw bales out of it. On the rest, I used a mulcher.Then, Punia sourced a happy seeder (a machine that helps sow wheat in the standing rice stubble) from the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials, who arranged it from the Mandauli village cooperative society.PPCB executive engineer Surinder Singh Matharu says the board receives over half-a-dozen calls from farmers every day, seeking tools to avoid stubble burning.I use my influence to source them from cooperative societies. I have also tied up with the 12-MW biomass plant at Baghaura village in Mahilpur tehsil of Hoshiarpur, which consumes 400 tonnes of paddy bales a day, says Matharu, who gets a high every time he sees a paddy field untouched by fire.A village says noThe district agriculture department, meanwhile, concentrated its resources in the Kalar Majri village in Nabha, adopted by the state to implement the National Green Tribunal (NGT) guidelines. This year, not a single farmer in the village burnt their fields. They provided us with happy seeders, mulchers and balers, explains Bir Dalwinder Singh, who owns 40 acres in this village.Singh says he stopped burning the stubble three years ago after learning about its harmful effects on the soil. In the last two years, he used a happy seeder provided by PAU to sow wheat. This year, he bought it.Solution from the groundPunia says the state government should equip village-level societies with implements to counter stubble burning instead of giving individual subsidies. They can give youngsters these implements at interest-free loans, and the other villagers can use their services, he said.Most farmers say the incidence of burning would also peter off if the government bans slow-growing varieties such as PUSA 144, and promotes fast-growing breeds, which ripen at the end of September and give farmers a window of over a month to prepare their fields for wheat. Agreeing with them, Devinder Sharma, an agriculture analyst, says: Thats what I call getting to the root of the problem."
5a5350a29855b770e037edb5,"'We're Praying', Say Officials, Confirm No Work On Pollution This Year",https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/were-praying-say-officials-confirm-no-work-on-pollution-this-year-1776896,2017-11-17," Thomson Reuters 2017As pollution level climbed to 12 times above the recommended limit this week in Delhi and adjoining cities, government officials said they knew what was needed to control the smoky haze, but nothing would be done, at least this year.A major source of the smog at this time of year across northern India, including Delhi, is farmers burning the stubble of the previous crop to prepare for new plantings in November.An estimated Rs 3,900 crore is needed to provide farmers with alternatives, but the BJP in the Centre, Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi and Congress in nearby Punjab are squabbling over who will pay, said three federal government officials who have been briefed on the situation.""Nothing more is likely to happen this year,"" said one of them. ""We're now praying. Only God can save us.""The official said he had bought pollution masks for his family and installed air purifiers at his home in Delhi, now the most polluted city in the world, according to the Brookings Institute. The city is home to more than 20 million people.A spokesman of the federal environment ministry declined comment on federal and state governments bickering over funds to tackle the problem of stubble burning.Chief Ministers of Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, after exchanging barbs on Twitter for days, agreed on Wednesday on measures to control the smog - in 2018.As a thick blanket of haze settled over parts of northern India, including Delhi, over the past few days, the official response to what has become an annual phenomenon has been marked by paralysis and lack of ownership, interviews with government officials show.It's not just the crop burning - a combination of industrial smog, vehicle exhaust and dust envelop the region every year as winter approaches and wind speeds drop.It's been particularly bad this year with levels of PM-2.5, tiny particulate matter that reaches deep into the lungs, climbing to over 600 last week, according to a US Embassy measure.The upper limit for healthy air is 50, the government has said.Respiratory diseases killed about 10 people a day in the year to March 2017 in the national capital region, according to the health ministry. The World Bank estimates pollution cost the country as much as 7.7 percent of the GDP in 2013.In 2015, PM Modi launched the first national air quality index in Delhi and promised to take steps to clean the air.Authorities temporarily banned diesel-run power generators, construction, burning of garbage and plying of trucks with non-essential goods, but construction and truck movements were allowed to resume on Thursday as pollution levels dropped.In recent days, authorities also began to use fire engines to spray water over parts of the capital hoping it would help settle the dust. But the steps have largely proved ineffective.""We've tried our best to tackle the situation, but as policymakers we've failed to address the main problem of stubble burning,"" the government official said.It's not a new problem - it happens each year after mid-October when farmers start harvesting summer crops in Punjab and Haryana.With rising labour costs and a short window to plant the next crop, most farmers burn the stubble and straw in their fields to clear them for the next planting.Since October, more than 40,000 fire incidents have been recorded in Punjab, as farmers disposed of nearly 20 million tonnes of rice waste, environment groups said.But the stubble issue has become more acute in recent years because mechanised harvesters leave more of a residue than crops plucked by hand. Such harvesters are increasingly popular in the wealthy northern states, where farmer lobbies are also politically powerful.""The situation has worsened this year because of the slow wind speed,"" which means the pollutants hang in the air for longer, said D Shah, a scientist at the state-run Central Pollution Control Board of India.NITI Aayog, the federal government's economic planning think-tank, has estimated farmers would need handouts worth about Rs 3,250 crores a year to switch to alternative ways of disposing farm stubble, said an official who was involved in the preparation of the report.Another Rs 650 crore is needed to reward local bodies for adopting best practices and funding awareness campaigns, the official said.Punjab alone would require about Rs 1,950 crores annually from the state government to encourage farmers to adopt alternative ways, said Roshan Sunkaria, a senior state government official.Environmental groups say nothing is happening on the ground to ease the situation and the only hope was that the crop burning would soon end and wind speeds would pick up. ""Politicians are playing with public health by blaming each other,"" said Usman Nasim, a scientist at private think-tank Centre for Science and Environment.(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

(AFP) Seoul, South Korea: , critically injured during a desperate defection, highlight nutrition and hygiene problems that experts say have plagued the isolated country for decades.At a briefing on Wednesday, lead surgeon Lee Cook-jong displayed photos showing dozens of flesh-coloured parasites - including one 27 cm (10.6 in) long - removed from the wounded soldier's digestive tract during a series of surgeries to save his life.""In my over 20 year-long career as a surgeon, I have only seen something like this in a textbook,"" Lee said.The parasites, along with kernels of corn in his stomach, may confirm what many experts and previous defectors have described about the food and hygiene situation for many North Koreans.""Although we do not have solid figures showing health conditions of North Korea, medical experts assume that parasite infection problems and serious health issues have been prevalent in the country,"" said Choi Min-Ho, a professor at Seoul National University College of Medicine who specialises in parasites.The soldier's condition was ""not surprising at all considering the north's hygiene and parasite problems,"" he said.The soldier was flown by helicopter to hospital on Monday after his dramatic escape to South Korea in a hail of bullets fired by North Korean soldiers.He is believed to be an army staff sergeant in his mid-20s who was stationed in the Joint Security Area in the United Nations truce village of Panmunjom, according to Kim Byung-kee, a lawmaker of South Korea's ruling party, briefed by the National Intelligence Service.North Korea has not commented on the defection.While the contents of the soldier's stomach don't necessarily reflect the population as a whole, his status as a soldier - with an elite assignment - would indicate he would at least be as well nourished as an average North Korean.He was shot in his buttocks, armpit, back shoulder and knee among other wounds, according to the hospital where the soldier is being treated.'THE BEST FERTILISER'Parasitic worms were also once common in South Korea 40 to 50 years ago, Lee noted during his briefing, but have all but disappeared as economic conditions greatly improved.Other doctors have also described removing various types of worms and parasites from North Korean defectors.Their continued prevalence north of the heavily fortified border that divides the two Koreas could be in part tied to the use of human excrement, often called ""night soil.""""Chemical fertiliser was supplied by the state until the 1970s, but from the early 1980s, production started to decrease,"" said Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert who defected to South Korea in 1995. ""By the 1990s, the state could not supply it anymore, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead.""In 2014, supreme leader Kim Jong Un personally urged farmers to use human faeces, along with animal waste and organic compost, to fertilise their fields.A lack of livestock, however, made it difficult to find animal waste, said Lee, the agriculture expert.Even harder to overcome, he said, is the view of night soil as the ""best fertiliser in North Korea,"" despite the risk of worms and parasites.""Vegetables grown in it are considered more delicious than others,"" Lee said.LIMITED DIETSThe medical briefing described the wounded soldier as being 170 cm (5 feet 5 inches) and 60 kg (132 pounds) with his stomach containing corn. It's a staple grain that more North Koreans may be relying on in the wake of what the United Nations has called the worst drought since 2001.Imported corn, which is less preferred but cheaper to obtain than rice, has tended to increase in years when North Koreans are more worried about their seasonal harvests.The North Korean staple diet consists of rice cakes with corn powder. (Reuters)Despite the drought and international sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme, the cost of corn and rice has remained relatively stable, according to a Reuters analysis of market data collected by the defector-run Daily NK website.Since the 1990s, when government rations failed to prevent a famine hitting the country, North Koreans have gradually turned to markets and other private means to feed themselves.The World Food Programme says a quarter of North Korean children 6-59 months old, who attend nurseries that the organisation assists, suffer from chronic malnutrition.On average North Koreans are less nourished than their southern neighbours. The WFP says around one in four children have grown less tall than their South Korean counterparts.

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

5a53850b9855b770e038032c,A mix of local flavours and tradition: How an Indian Christmas is celebrated,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/an-indian-christmas/story-K0tV83DZD1FRzvcMM8XPbP.html,2017-12-25,"Come December, and there is a mood of celebration in the air. Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

Photo: Indranil Bhoumik/MintNew Delhi: The central government, in consultation with states, proposes to launch a new price support scheme for farmers to prevent distress sales at prices below the minimum support price (MSP).Under the proposed market assurance scheme, states will be free to procure all crops from farmers for which MSPs are announced, except rice and wheat, which are already being procured by the centre for the public distribution system.Under the new scheme, the centre will compensate states for any losses capped at 30% of the procurement cost. It will be the states responsibility to dispose of the procured crops.The proposed scheme will ensure an assured price for the farmer, mitigating the price risks faced by farmers after harvest. Together with a prolonged spell of inadequate rains and two years of drought it has contributed towards rural distress.If successful, it will also politically benefit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), though it could place fiscal pressures on the Union government; in the just-concluded assembly election in Gujarat, one reason contributing to the BJPs less than usual performance was farmer angst triggered by rural distress.The system, as it exists now, under which only rice, wheat and small quantities of pulses and oilseeds are procured by the centre, leaves much to be desired, according to a copy of the proposal reviewed by Mint. The new scheme proposes to strengthen the procurement mechanism to ensure that farmers do not suffer from marketing inefficiencies, as commonly reflected in the prices ruling lower than notified MSP for many commodities, it said.States will take ownership of the scheme, including which crop to procure and in what quantities, when wholesale prices drop below MSPs. State governments will be free to use the procured crops for targeted nutrition-support programmes such as mid-day meals for schoolchildren, or sell them in the open market.We have written to states to elicit their opinion on the scheme, and if they are interested we will launch the scheme, said a senior official at the agriculture ministry who declined to be named. According to this official, the letter to states was sent more than a month ago.The proposed scheme comes against the backdrop of a record harvest of cereals and pulses in 2016-17, which led to wholesale prices plunging below MSPs. The price crash has led to protests by farmer groups across the country since June, with demands for remunerative crop prices and loan waivers. While states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab and Karnataka have announced farm loan waivers that are at different stages of implementation, states like Madhya Pradesh have launched their own price support schemes for farmers growing pulses and oilseeds.Experts welcomed the move, but cautioned that it was at best a stopgap measure and that the eventual solution was to bring in greater competition in agricultural markets by dismantling existing cartels.While any intervention and attention to agriculture marketing is welcome, we must await full details of the scheme to make any specific comments, said Pravesh Sharma, farm expert and a visiting fellow at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. However, it can be generally observed that government does not seem to risk spending political capital to directly take on poorly functioning agriculture markets, where lack of competition, cartelization and opaque price discovery are the root causes of price distortions.Spending public money may be necessary in some instances, but the larger goal of reforming agricultural markets should not be lost sight of, he added."

But the miller supplied only 19,409 quintals of rice and its proprietor Dillip Agrawal locked up the mill and absconded. Similarly, Pintu Rice Mill at Malidihi, Laxmi Rice, Starched Rice Mill and Maruti Food Products had also not supplied required custom milled rice to the Government. The department had filed FIRs against these millers at the police stations concerned and later Vigilance department lodged a case against Maruti Food for its large-scale irregularities in supplying rice.While the district civil supply office had estimated around `27.92 lakh due pending against the Maruti Food Products, a special audit conducted by the department found a loss of `47.09 lakh loss. Later, it was also found that a bank guarantee of `1.1 crore submitted by Bajrangbali Rice Mill appeared to be fake. Sources also confirmed that `8.2 crore has been misappropriated by Bajrangbali Rice Mill.

Poor farmers are reportedly selling paddy at `1,000 to `1,200 per quintal at open markets against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of `1,550 per quintal for FAQ (Fair Average Quality) paddy. Sources said distress sale of paddy has been a common phenomena in Bonai sub-division comprising Bonai, Lahunipara, Gurundia and Koira blocks.Bonai Krushak Sangh (BKS) president and former member of District Level Paddy Procurement Committee Dambrudhar Kishan said a sizeable amount of poor farmers having little land holding or landless had cultivated paddy as sharecroppers. In absence of land records and also not certified by landowners, they are not entitled to sell paddy at the mandis. He pointed out that Chhabil Kishan of Bahrmannadi village harvested good amount of paddy from six acres taken on sharecropping basis, but he is not eligible for MSP.Farmers Tahsil Patra and Indra Pardhan of Sarsara village said they need immediate cash to pay labourers and other debtors. Incidentally, some large farmers are also selling some portion of their stocks for `1,000-`1,200 to meet labour related expenditure. Agriculture officials also admitted about the distress sale of paddy at village weekly markets, including Lahunipara, Khuntgaon, Gamlei, Phuljor and Kurda. They said paddy production in the kharif season has been good with return of 18-25 quintals per acre of high-yield varieties like Swarna, Naveen and Pratiksha.Market sources said amid abundant availability of paddy stocks, middlemen and rural traders are on the prowl. Kishan said in the sub-division, a sizable number of farmers having large land holdings do not originally cultivate and give their land for sharecropping, but they have registered themselves for paddy procurement. It was observed that unscrupulous middlemen procure paddy stocks from beleaguered farmers at throwaway prices.Then, the stocks are sold at MSP at the procurement centres using the well-knit racket of middlemen, procurement officials and registered farmers. He said the small and marginal farmers resort to cultivation with borrowings from money lenders and once the crops are ready, they sell their stocks to rural traders and agents of rice mills at lower prices.Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik avoided to comment on the issue."

Trichoderma is an effective biological mean for plant disease management, especially the soil born. It is a free-living fungus which is common in soil and root ecosystems.Besides, farmers will be advised to adopt crop rotation with non-paddy crops wherever feasible. Use of neem cake, mahua cake, neem oil as well as neem-based pesticides will be popularised among farmers to reduce the pest incidence.This apart, paddy line transplanting/sowing and System of Rice Intensification (SRI) will be popularised through agricultural field functionaries. These practices will ensure least incidence of pest and disease in paddy crop.Moreover, farmers will be advised to purchase recommended pesticides from registered dealers in consultation with the agricultural functionaries.As per reports, standing paddy crop over 43,037.83 hectares (ha) of land was affected due to BPH pest during kharif season this year in the district. Of the total 43,037.83 ha, crop loss between 33 per cent and 50 per cent was recorded over 29,977.92 ha. Crop loss above 50 per cent was recorded over 7207.22 ha due to pest attack.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das said crop loss was reported due to heavy infestation of BPH pest in paddy crop during kharif season. A special drive will be undertaken to create awareness among farmers for control of BPH in irrigated areas where rabi paddy are to be grown. He further said stubbles should not be burnt but left in the soil to decompose so that the left out egg and larva of the pest are destroyed. Dealers will be trained on technical use of pesticide and fertiliser, Das added."

He said this while laying the foundation stones for two LNG pipelines of 600 km at Haripur in Sukinda area of the district.If Naveen Babu takes one step, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will go three steps ahead. We are ever ready for development of Odisha, keeping politics at bay, said Pradhan. The pipelines included Dhamara-Angul 36 inch main line and Bhubaneswar- Cuttack- Paradeep 12 inch spur line. The Union Minister attributed the project under Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga as a new years gift to the people of Odisha from the Prime Minister.Pradhan advised the State Government not to spent district mineral fund (DMF) in State Government sponsored Ahar Yojana or `1 kg rice scheme for cheap popularity.After the Supreme Court held that the affected people are the real stake holders of the DMF fund, the Prime Minister made a mechanism that the DMF will be spent only in the respective district. Pradhan further said Tata Steel should come forward to set up an automobile industry in the State so that many downline and ancillary industries could be set up. We dont have any objection if Tata Group makes profit out of its business in Odisha. But, the company should not forget that it is required to spend a portion of its profit towards CSR activities in the State, he said.The Union Minister said the pipeline project of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) would provide employment to 2,000 youths of the locality directly and 10,000 indirectly. The GAIL has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with four ancillary companies which will impart skill development training to the local youths who will repair, restore and maintain the pipelines.Stating that `5000 crore will be invested for the pipeline project, he said `2000 crore of the fund is estimated to be invested in development of human resources. In first phase, `1700 crore will be invested in Compressed Gas Distribution (CGD) 100-km pipeline in Cuttack-Bhubaneswar. The project is expected to create huge employment opportunity for the local youths and boost Odishas economy, he added.Initially, natural gas will reach Bhubaneswar in special containers called cascades which will be transported on road from Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh. Later, natural gas will be supplied through 2655 km long Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra natural gas pipeline, popularly known as the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga. Sukinda MLA and BJD leader Pritiranjan Ghadei and a host of officials attended the function."

This was informed by Civil Supply Officer (CSO) Umasankar Pati at the District level Procuring Committee (DLPC) meeting held in DRDA Conference Hall here,Over 1.6 lakh farmers applied online, of which, around 53,000 have been registered. The mandis will remain open from morning to evening while farmers will get their dues within a week in their respective bank accounts. District officials have been directed to complete the procurement process by March, he said.The district administration has decided to procure 13.20 lakh quintals of paddy. While millers have to purchase nearly nine lakh quintals, the rest will be bought by cooperative societies. The millers, who have not yet met their last years rice target, will not be allowed to purchase paddy, Pati said.Sources said some millers have not deposited their rice quota which amounts to over 50,000 quintals. They have been directed to deposit the rice before November 30 or face action, the CSO said.Collector Gyanaranjan Das, who presided over the meeting, said the district administration will take necessary steps to protect the interest of farmers."

As scheduled, the procurement process was kicked off in the district on Friday and the inaugural day ended up haphazardly.Blame it on whimsical action of the Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) who kept all the Paddy Procurement Centres (PPCs) guessing about their targets till the end and at about 11.10 pm on Thursday sent emails instructing them to start procurement from Friday morning. Sources said less than 20 of 116 PPCs could run on Friday and procured about 5,000 quintals.Reliable sources at the PPCs said SAS (Society Authority Slip) is issued to a PPC authorising it to buy paddy with prescribed target and also informs to which rice mill it is tagged. Similarly, an authorised rice mill is given MAS (Miller Authority Slip) prescribing the rice mill about the quantity of paddy it would purchase from the respective PPCs it is tagged.The sources said SASs were received through emails late Thursday night and from Friday early morning, block to sub-division level officers pressurised Managing Directors of LAMPSs (Large Area Multi-Purpose Cooperative Societies) over phone to start procurement anyhow. It would take four to five days to streamline the process.Bonai Krishak Sangh president Dambarudhar Kishan complained that paddy procurement gets delayed by a month in the district and scant regard is paid to the exploitation of the distressed small and marginal farmers who are selling paddy for Rs 900 to Rs 1,200 at village weekly markets. He said procurement schedule was finalised on November 21 and wondered what led the CSO office to send SASs at the dead of the night on Thursday. He said it is a deliberate action of the unscrupulous officials to create a mess and allow time to middlemen to benefit.A couple of Managing Directors of LAMPSs confided to this correspondent that each LAMPS has two to three PPCs which are deliberately given very low purchase targets in the first phase. The target is enhanced in next phase. Sundargarh CSO A Barik could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.In the first phase, the district targets to procure 88,000 tonnes of rice (equivalent to 1.30 lakh tonnes of paddy) through 14 rice mills."

It is a short duration (about 100 days) variant with medium slender grain and good quality.The NILs are the first in the world and those have 10 different resistance genes inserted into the susceptible variety IR24 by conventional breeding.As extensive use of pesticides proved to be more harmful for environment and made the insects pesticide resistance, Jena said his team started working on host-plant resistance as an effective and environment-friendly approach to reducing insect damage and increasing rice yield.We have developed the NILs with different high potential resistance genes for protection against BPH. I am helping the Central Rice Research Institute (CRRI) at Cuttack to use this in Odisha. Some very good resistant lines are now in the pipeline. I have also cloned a new resistance gene for BPH and I am sure my work will help to solve the problem in future, he told The Express in an e-mail conversation.Though earlier agro scientists had discovered 30 genes linked to the plants resistance to the BPH insects, those were not properly identified. Jena has successfully isolated the actual genes and pinpointed their location in the rice chromosome. His team has studied how these genes interact with the insects and understood the vector protein and receptor protein interaction.He said these can be tested in the fields against BPH population in Odisha and looked for the lines showing resistance to the insects. The agronomic characteristics such as yield potential of the lines in those areas also can be tested, Jena said and suggested that part of his work can be taken up by CRRI and the lines put to tests in the institute if they have those insects collected this season.Since the BPH infestations have intensified in many areas as the insects developed resistance to widely used pesticides to overcome genetic resistance in plants, the researchers at IRRI are combining different resistance genes that have been identified through gene cloning. Instead of producing one kind of receptor protein, the plant with cloned gene can produce three types of receptor proteins to fight off the vector protein.We are making a package of resistance genes and developing BPH resistant IRRI breeding lines using IR24 variety. These genes can be transferred into other lines of Odisha for cultivation in the affected areas. If the State Government seeks any support, we are ready to extend help from IRRI. We can also provide seeds to look for solutions to the current problem, Jena added."

Be it due to the influence of local climate or availability of spices, herbs and vegetables, the variations in the style of cooking and tastes are inevitable. Coming to Odisha, the platter changes with each district.Interestingly, each of the 30 districts in this coastal State boasts of its unique and much-sought-after recipe, for sure! For instance, if Cuttack takes pride in its Aludum dahi bara, Baripada promises to offer the best mudhi (puffed rice) in the world. Similarly, the crisp ball made of puffed rice and jaggery, popularly known as muan, is quintessential to Ganjams list of delicacies.Not just that, muan holds a special significance in the Odia month of Pausa. In the Odia households, muan is a must-have for the season. Its auspicious to prepare muan between Dhanu Sankranti and Makar Sankranti.Unlike previous days, the season for muan has been extended. However, it is available in lots during December and January, said Udayanath Sahu, who had been preparing and selling muan for some decades now. Though much is unknown about its origin, historians believe this dessert was prepared in Ganajm district for ritualistic offering to the deity on Dhanu Sankranti.The age-old sweet has gone through a bit of change in the modern times. Local vendors said they now use sugar instead of jaggery for making muan. Moreover, ghee has replaced oil in its preparation. Some sweet shops add a little twist to the traditional sweet for the sake of innovation.They try making it more delicious and attractive by adding coconut chunks, cherries and cashew nuts.Besides local consumption, muan is exported to various places across the country. During peak season, at least one tonne muan is prepared across the district in a day. Sweet sellers in the district said price of muan had increased along with its variety. While the price of an ordinary muan with groundnut is between `180 and `200, the muan prepared with desi ghee, cherry and cashewnut costs up to `380, said Budha, a sweet trader here.The price of sugar as well as of ghee has increased. Besides, cost of cashewnuts, another major ingredient of this special seasonal sweet, has also gone up. However, we are still trying to produce better quality muan by compromising with our profit margins, said Samarendra Dash, another seller."

If the basic figure of Agriculture department is to be believed, there are about 2.19 lakh farming families and only about 32,000 are registered. In kharif season, the district is expected to get about 6 lakh tonnes of paddy and after deduction of 30 per cent for consumption of farming families, there would be about 4.2 lakh tonnes of surplus paddy up for sale.Sources said given the past experience, even if the district administration manages to enhance procurement to 2 lakh tonnes against about 1.61 lakh tonnes last year at MSP, the remaining 2.2 lakh tonnes would be sold privately much below the MSP.Bonai Krushak Sangh president Dambrudhar Kishan said in Bonai sub-division, about 60 per cent farmers having land holding give their farm lands to poor landless farmers for cultivation. The landless farmers work as share-croppers and are practically denied MSP as farmers owning land never officially recognise them as share-croppers.Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) said an initial target to procure 88,000 tonnes rice from the 32,000 registered farmers has been set and all payments would be made directly to their bank accounts within seven days as per rule.

You will either have to starve or seek alms. Does that sound bizarre? Well, that's exactly how life is for the marginal farmers or agricultural labourers in the rainfed areas of Western Odisha. For them, abject poverty is a constant reality. Despite numerous government welfare schemes being rolled out, many of them are deprived of their benefits. Moreover, a sense of dignity holds them back from seeking benefits under the BPL schemes. The small and marginal farmers are mostly illiterate. They consider poverty as something below their dignity. If they are offered some facility, either they happily accept it or in most cases silently suffer without cribbing. On rare occasions, they make an effort to seek their BPL rights.In such a scenario, they have turned to alternative means to survive in the face of struggle. And, what are these means? You can figure out these survival strategies on a road trip to these pockets.As vehicles race past, the travellers often come across paddy stalks scattered on the roads. While its sight gets erased from memory of the passerby, the paddy stalks portray the poor rural economy, comprising small and marginal farmers, who struggle for each grain of rice. Unable to afford machines or tractors, these farmers rely on vehicles to thresh the ripened paddy, scattered on the road. This crop assures them not only of immediate food, but also ensures food security for months to come.It is no secret that many genuinely economically backward farmers have been denied enrolment under BPL category, the tag that provides food security. Most of the farmers of Balanda village, a rainfed pocket located along Bijepur-Gaiselet road, are small and marginal ones. A woman farmer like Surubali Dansena of this village either migrate with their families to other villages in search of livelihood or depend on small land holdings they own to cultivate paddy. Deprived of irrigation, they till their lands during the first shower. During the next few showers, they sow low-yielding paddy for a shorter duration. This poor quality traditional paddy seeds are locally known as Khardi Buna. For them, winter is the best period for harvesting crop. The period between July and October is the worst phase as they pump in all their resources into paddy cultivation and wait with a bated breath, praying for a good yield. As soon as the paddy on first patch of land turns ripe, they harvest it and scatter it on the road for threshing.Forget tractors, they don't even have the time to wait for bullocks to run over the crop and thresh it. With dwindling rice stock in their homes, they cannot afford to waste time. Such is the urgency that they can't let the paddy go through the complete process to get grains that are actually fit for human consumption. The stunted and broken grains, processed out of low-quality paddy, is good enough to satisfy their hunger. Soon after threshing by moving vehicles is complete, they collect and pound the grains at home using traditional pounder called Dhenki.They avoid borrowing rice from bigger farmers or the land owners. Not just that, for one bag of borrowed paddy, they are often asked to return half a bag extra to the lender, making things worse for them.Although, the scene is changing ever since introduction of BPL, its implementation is yet to be completed and it becomes evident in backward areas of drought-prone pockets in Western Odisha, including Balanda village."

Later, the procured crop was distributed among at least 93 millers as per the custom milling process.According to the Government norms, the millers should have delivered about 15 lakh quintal of rice to rice-receiving centres by September 2017. However, due to the alleged mismanagement of the officials of the Food and Civil Supply Department, enough space was not available to store the procured crop, the sources said. Only 47 rice millers had apparently met the target, delivering 11 lakh quintal rice within the stipulated time.Earlier, the members of millers association had met State Civil Supply and Consumer Welfare Secretary in Bhubaneswar, apprising him of the space problem of the Civil Supply Corporation. They had urged the Secretary to extend the deadline for paddy delivery and provide storage facilities as required. The Secretary had allowed the millers to deliver the rice by December 10, following which the millers geared up to deliver the pending rice stocks and about 3.50 lakh quintal stock was cleared by December 8.Even as the millers were about to deliver the targeted amount, the fresh direction of the Corporation to stop rice delivery has irked the millers who claimed that at least 50,000 quintal of rice stock is pending.The Civil Supply Corporation has been harassing the millers by stopping delivery of the pending rice. The Corporation has not provided godowns to keep the rice stock of millers. The millers are being punished for no fault of theirs, Koraput District Millers secretary, Gopal Panda, said.Meanwhile, the millers demanded that the Corporation should immediately take the pending rice stocks from them.Contacted, District Civil Supply Officer BC Dash said the administration had been communicating with the State Civil Supply Corporation to sort out the problem at the earliest. There will be proper procurement of paddy from farmers as well as rice from the millers in a couple of days, he added."

The issue was recently discussed at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Secretary AP Padhi. The WFP has submitted a proposal to the State Government for piloting a project on fortification of rice distributed under PDS.It has been decided that a pilot project will be initiated in Deogarh district for distribution of fortified rice under PDS along with supplementary nutrition programmes under Mid-Day Meal (MDM), Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) and other welfare schemes on cost sharing basis with WFP, sources in the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department said.The decision was taken on the basis of the results and positive impacts of rice fortification implemented in MDM scheme in Gajapati district. The rice fortification has found high acceptance among students of Gajapati, the sources said.In early 2013, WFP did a baseline study among school children aged 6 to 14 years in the district and found that 19 per cent of the sampled children were stunted (low height for age) and 14.5 per cent were wasted (low weight for height). The survey also showed that 73 per cent boys and 74 per cent girls from primary school were affected by anaemia.Sources in the School and Mass Education Department said the fortified rice needs special care while cooking to ensure that the micronutrients are not washed away. The self-help groups (SHGs) responsible for the MDM programme in schools were trained to avoid excess washing of the rice. The WFP will train school staff and SHGs involved in the preparation of the meal on how to properly cook the fortified rice for maximum nutritional impact.It has been further decided to include representatives of the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) in the advisory body of the project. The Health and Family Welfare Department has been asked to create robust platform for impact assessment for the rice fortification project in Deogarh district."

Bargarh district, considered the rice bowl of the State, hogged the limelight in 2015 when more than 30 farmers committed suicide over crop loss and indifference of the State Government towards farmers. The district hogged the limelight again this year because of the Bijepur by-election which was necessitated following the death of sitting Congress MLA Subal Sahu.With the outcome of the by-poll all set to be a trendsetter for the 2019 general elections, the political parties have been jostling for space to prove their supremacy.The BJD set the ball rolling by announcing a series of development projects for Bijepur. The BJD also managed to nominate Ritarani Sahu, widow of Subal Sahu, as its party candidate for the by-election hoping to encash on the sympathy factor. The BJP, which is yet to nominate its candidate for the by-election, got an opportunity to come down heavily on the BJD after the death of farmer Brunda Sahu on November 1. Union Minister of State for Agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and a delegation of the BJP Kisan Morcha visited the farm-affected pockets in the district to gain sympathy of farmers or kulta community, who have substantial votes.The death of Brunda and five other farmers pushed the Bijepur bypoll issue to the backburner and brought the farmers issue to centre-stage. The farmers had hoped that the Centre would declare some special package for them, which seems unlikely. Aware of the ground realities, the BJP launched Satyagraha for farmers and tried to corner the BJD Government.The Congress, not to be left behind, also staged a dharna in front of the District Collectorate. OPCC chief Prasad Harichandan visited the district and levelled allegations against both the BJD and the BJP. With many among the farmers educated enough to understand the underlying agenda of the politics being played over death of the farmers, it will be tough for the political parties to take the voters for granted."

Though farmers have already harvested their crops and administration had earlier decided to start procurement from November 6, the mandis are yet to be made operational, they alleged.President of the forum Sudhir Paricha said further delay in opening the mandis will allow unscrupulous traders to procure the paddy from the rural areas and farmers will be forced to make distress sale. Similarly, the administration is yet to implement the P-Pass system for online registration farmers, he said and threatened to intensify the agitation.Sources said during the district-level paddy purchase committee meeting, the administration had decided to open 158 mandis across Balangir to procure paddy from November 6. It was decided to procure from 750 to 1,000 quintals of paddy per day per centre. However, the strike by PACS officials over pay fixation has delayed the procurement plan.Civil Supply Officer (CSO) in-charge B S Kar said the agitation launched by PACS employees was called off on Wednesday and paddy procurement will begin in the district soon.Farmers block NHBhawanipatna: Hundreds of farmers of Kalahandi, led by district president of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) Debendra Pattjoshi, staged a road blockade on National Highway (NH)-26 at Motor Chowk on Wednesday protesting the paddy procurement policy of the State Government.The agitators alleged that PACS officials are allowing only fair average quality (FAQ) paddy for procurement at the purchase centres and farmers, who have suffered crop damage due to the recent untimely rain, are being harassed. Similarly, rice millers engaged at the centresare deducting 5 to 10 kg from the paddy bags of farmers on the plea of quality testing. Instead of FAQ norms, the PACS officials should purchase paddy as per the Under Relaxed Specifications (URS) of the procurement policy, they said.As farmers of the district have suffered heavy loss due to pest attack and unseasonal rains, they demanded that the State Government should provide bonus for them.Sources said due to strike, vehicular traffic on the NH was paralysed for more than four hours disrupting communication between Kalahandi and Nabarangpur/Koraput. Later, Dharmagarh SDPO Y Vijaya rushed to the spot and pacified the agitators.When contacted, District Civil Supply Officer Sibaprasad Dora said as per the decision of the Government, PACS officials have been asked to purchase FAQ paddy from farmers."

How green is the green here, in faraway Tamil Nadu, for the migrant labourers?On the occasion of International Migrants Day, to commemorate the Universal Declaration of Migrants Rights that was adopted and proclaimed by the General Assembly of United Nations in 2000, a few migrant workers in the construction, hotel and spinning mill industries in Madurai district shared their experiences with Express.Nithesh (23), who is a cook in a hotel, said, I belong to a remote village in West Bengal and have been working here for the past three years. Nearly 100 people from our village came here looking for work. We are all illiterate and could not find jobs in our home States.How did they land up here in Madurai? We can cook Chinese items that seem to be in great demand in the hotels in Madurai. There are agents who brought us here. In fact, in every village, there are agents who offer us work outside our home base. They promise to get us jobs that will get us Rs 15,000 a month. Of course, the salary would vary, depending on the work. The agent will receive the salary and deduct 50 per cent as his commission. The arrangement may vary from agent to agent. Basically, there is no connection between the hotel employer and us, said Nithesh.About the working conditions, Nitesh said, From morning till the hotel is closed, we need to remain standing. Every day, I go to home with severe leg pain. I get a maximum of Rs 10,000 as monthly salary. I send Rs 8000 to my parents every month. I use the remaining amount for my expenses in the temple city.Accommodation is usually provided by the employer, continued Nithesh. Those working in the same hotel usually stay in one house together. We are given one months leave every year and we go to our native place. Those who work as cleaners and servers get very poor salaries, around Rs 3,000 a month. We dont get other benefits like Provident Fund, bonus and insurance. Though we have problems of language, discrimination, and poor working conditions, we take the job since it is helping our families get three meals a day.Lakshmi (18), a spinning mill worker in Madurai district, said, I come from a small village in Bihar. I am the first of five daughters. My father was an agriculture daily wage labourer. I dont have mother. About a year back, my father met with an accident and could not continue working. I took over earning for the family. I could not find any decent job in our village as I am uneducated. Nearly 80 girls in the 15 to 23 age group came here to work.I came with them. For the past eight months, I have been working here. The company has given us accommodation within the premises. They provide ration rice and some grocery, but they are not of good quality. There is no specific working time. We have to report to work whenever the supervisor calls us. Every month, we get Rs 3,000 as salary. We send Rs 2,000 home. We do not know the exact salary that we get and whether and how much the agents take.Sharma (35), a construction worker, had a similar tale to share. About 1000 workers from Uttar Pradesh came here with our families. We used to stay in a hut near the construction site. There were just no basic facilities. We do all sorts of work. If the employer paid the local labourer Rs 500 a day, we would get only Rs 400. Out of this around Rs 150 would go as commission to the agent, he narrated.Speaking to Express, K L Kumar, President, Madurai District Hotels Association, said, The agents supply labourers from the other states. They are in charge of everything. Nearly 10,000 migrant workers are employed in various positions in Madurai district hotels. We ask for their identity proof and share their details with the local police.We do not pay any commission to the agent. We hand over the salaries to the agents. Workers give a share to them. Depending on the nature of the work we pay the workers.But there are some other issues. Some mischief making, taking small amounts of cash from the cash counter and so on. If it happens, we approach the agent who arranges for a replacement. The agent takes care even when a worker goes on leave and we need a temporary replacement, explained Kumar."

But the State government in August issued an order reducing scholarship amount it was offering to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes students pursuing professional studies such as engineering and medicine.The reduction was substantial for certain sections. Many students from poor families say they will now be forced to drop out of college. For instance, the annual scholarship for engineering students in private colleges management quota has been reduced from Rs 85,000 to Rs 50,000.Like Binjuda, around 1.5 lakh students hailing from socially backward Dalit communities in the State have been affected by the move. I know that they may never be able to get the money in time to pay the fees. When I first told my mother over phone that I needed the money soon, she broke down, she said. It was only a few months after the admissions that we were told scholarships will be slashed and we would have to pay Rs 35,000 from our pocket. Had I known about this earlier, I would not have even thought of studying engineering, she said.She and around 50 students from various colleges across the State gathered at Chennai Press Club, through the Ambedkar Kalvi Centenary Movement, a federation of SC/ST engineering students, to urge the government to repeal the decision.For someone like Binduja, daughter of a small farmer, 1029 marks in her Class 12 exams was not all it took to be to join engineering. We had gone months on just ration rice that was sometimes, almost inedible. Both my parents are daily-wage earners, she said.With the semester exams just weeks away, many said they had no choice but to discontinue their education if they are not provided a full scholarship. Even for placement training in my college, I was asked to pay Rs 3,000. It took my mom a month to ask everyone she knew to scrape together the money. Where do we go for 10 times that amount? she asked.Said K Babu, the first not only in his family, but also his village in Villupuram to study engineering: Im not sure I would be able to finish the course. I would not have dared to come to study here in Chennai had I known before joining that the scholarship would be reduced. M Dharmaraj, a BE final year student from Tiruchy, said, If this doesnt change, we will march to the Secretariat to meet the CM."

Though ISM doesnt produce extra yield, being able to cut down crop loss due to bacterial blight results in additional yields, said Dr Ramesh Sonti chief scientist, CCMB.The ISM rice has been developed by CCMB and Indian Institute of Rice Research over several years of research, while testing was conducted by National Institute of Nutrition. It found ISM to have one of lowest GI of 50.99, thus having the potential to revolutionise the organic food market as well. Foods with GI value below 55 are considered highly suitable for consumption by a diabetic patient as they release glucose in the bloodstream slowly, thereby reducing the ill effects of diabetes.Thus ISM, in addition to possessing desirable attributes like high yield, fine-grain type bacterial blight resistance, premium market price, also has the unique advantage of low GI, enhancing its market potential, said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director CCMB.CCBM and IIRR picked up a donor variety of samba masuri from Punjab that was low in quality and taste and was not easy to cook but was extremely resistant. Traditional breeding method of this variety with other variety of the rice was done and with the help of advanced biotechnology tools, the ISM was developed."

The number of UP labourers has increased this year.Farmers feel that the governments MNREGS is creating labour shortage in villages and the modern agricultural methods are not giving expected results particularly for paddy.In Bodhan Assembly constituency, many villages in Navipet and Renjal mandals are hiring labourers from UP every year in these two seasons  June-July and November-December for paddy plantation.Farmers send their requirement to labour supply contractors after depositing money in their accounts and they send labourers to the respective villages. They are provided with accommodation basic needs in the village.Each team consists of 25 members and in each village, more than four to five teams are sent.Paddy plantation machine is not useful and thats why they are depending on labourers, Renjal mandal LK Farm farmer Kadiyala Venugopal said.He said that the labourers work for more than 12 hours in paddy plantation. Team of 12 members cover three to four acres per day, he said. The local labourers are unable to do the work as their physical structure cannot withstand the work required for paddy plantation, he added. Another farmer K Sai Reddy said that demand for labourers per day is increasing in every village and even small farmers are seeking them for cultivating paddy. A labour contractor Diwakar Vishwas from Lakhanpur district in UP said that more than 15 teams are working in different villages in Navipet and Renjal mandals.

But how sustainable and eco-friendly is the development?The bifurcation of the lakes along the stretch by the road has revealed tangible ecological consequences but the burgeoning of residential complexes along the road might have far more disastrous effects, it is pointed out.The Putheri canal, outlet of the lake, runs parallel to the link road until it reaches the Keelkattalai lake further down the stretch. This canal might soon disappear with most of the lands it runs through coming under real estate.Every monsoon, this canal is a life saver for residents of Chromepet by preventing the Putheri lake from flooding the area. But, if residential complexes block its path, the area will be inundated.Twenty years ago this was a fertile agricultural land and rice was cultivated, says Muthu, an old-timer. The decrease in fertility due to effluents from a nearby factory and increase in land prices had prompted farmers to sell the land to what Muthu calls political functionaries who in turn benefitted from further spike in land prices and sold them to real estate developers.Today, three real estate developers are at various stages of construction along this stretch. One of them is a massive 40-acre residential complex with more 3000 apartments by Prestige Group which will have the Putheri canal running through its backyard.Locals fear that the canal flow will be hindered and people living outside the upscale complex will bear the brunt of inundation as water will flow back downstream.The once agricultural land along the Pallavaram Link Road has many small ponds and a canal passing through. Real estate developers will invariably change the topography of the landscape to reap maximum benefits. People outside these posh complexes will face the consequences, said David Manohar, an activist with Arappor Iyakkam.When Express contacted an official from Prestige group he said that site plans have not been finalised.We will only know what Pelican Drive will look like in January, he said. When asked about the possibility of a compound wall which might stop the flow of water in the canal, he refused to comment.Chennai learnt the importance of interlinking channels which help drain water only after the floods of 2015. Disregarding environment and unplanned constructions will have disastrous effects in the long run, said Karen Coelho, Assistant professor at MadrasTown planning officer of Pallavaram Municipality, G Sivakumar, refused to comment on the issue.Water has memory. We cant change its path said Muthu. The government officials and the construction companies know this but they dont care. Theyll happily sip coffee at home while my home gets flooded, he said as he stubbed his beedi."

All of them were living in a room on the same premises.Three days ago, Bala Raju suffered seizures. He called his in-laws to visit his house and take care of children so that he and his wife could visit a doctor. At around 3 am Friday, another labourer working in the poultry farm, called Bala Raju on phone to wake him up to feed the birds.As there was no response from the latter, he came to Bala Rajus quarters and was shocked to find Bala Raju and his family members lying unconscious and frothing. He then informed the same to their employer Nagabhushanam, who in turn alerted the Rajapet police. Bhongir DCP E Ramchandra Reddy along with the clues team rushed to spot and inspected the crime scene but did not find any suicide note from the spot.

He said it was during Indiras regime that India had begun its journey towards becoming a super power. She ensured welfare of poor, empowerment of weaker sections, industrial growth, food security, and also dealt with the countrys enemies with an iron hand, Uttam added.India is counted among worlds major economies today primarily because of the policies introduced and implemented by Indira Gandhi. The list of her achievements is too long, and her contribution in making India a powerful nation can never be forgotten, the TPCC chief said.

Many northern districts such as Palakkad, Wayanad and Kasaragod had rainfall deficit ranging from 50- 60 per cent. Palakkad fared poorly in the rain chart with a deficit of around 60 per cent. While Wayanad received only half the expected rainfall, Kasaragod too registered a rain deficit of nearly 45 per cent.Teressama, of Vizhinjam, has been sitting on the shorein front of the St Marys Church at Vizhinjam inThiruvananthapuram for days waiting for the returnof her relatives who went missing in the sea |Kaviyoor SanthoshHowever, the overall rainfall deficit in the state has come down to seven per cent. This was mainly on account of the heavy showers in the southern districts such as Pathanamthitta, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram owing to Cyclone Ockhi. Pathanamthitta recorded 50 per cent excess rainfall when compared to the normal.  The weak easterly winds and absence of low-pressure area around the Chennai coast are the main reasons why northern Kerala received poor rainfall, said S Sudevan, Director, Meteorological Centre, Thiruvananthapuram. Cyclone Ockhi, though, made up for the deficit in the southern districts, he added.Fallout on farmingAccording to the experts, the poor northeast monsoon showers in districts like Wayanad will impact cash crops such as coffee and cardamom. It will also have an adverse impact on puncha cultivation of rice in districts such as Palakkad. Already, the mango plantations in Muhtalamada in Palakkad have felt the impact. For cash crops, summer showers in the months ahead will be pretty crucial, said B Ajith Kumar, Head of the Department of Agricultural Meteorology, Kerala Agricultural University(KAU). We may be poised for a situation akin to 2015 when we saw a bountiful southwest monsoon but a poor northeast monsoon, especially in northern Kerala.

With a stock of 5 lakh kg in devaswom godowns here and average need of 50,000 kg of jaggery a day, the production capacity of the plant could be maintained to achieve the demand-supply ratio, Sabarimala devaswom executive officer V N Chandrasekharan said. Though the average transportation of jaggery stands in the range of 30,000 to 35,000 kg a day, the devaswom godowns could meet the shortfall."

He would receive anyone with a smile, just like a blooming flower, said CPI leader and former minister Mullakkara Ratnakaran, a current MLA. His affable nature would disarm a visitor. He could receive any voice with a compassionate heart, even if it was coming from the bottom of society. According to the leader representing Chadayamangalam, the constituency which Chandrasekharan Nair represented during 1977-82, the latter had an extraordinary quality to control the bureaucratic system with his soft manners.Chandrasekharan Nair was the one who found Kerala had a potential to be marketed as a global tourist destination. At the same time, he was the first to prove a government could make a successful intervention in the market, said Mullakkara. Even when he kept a pleasant attitude, he had no qualms about firm decisions. Thus was born Maveli - the myth turned into a shop - for the public from a state government.Any shop needs a name. If it was a private party, it was easier. But that is not the case with a government. Hence, he selected Maveli because the only day when those from the lowest strata could ensure a proper meal was on Thiruvonam, the day the mythical Maveli visited the state, Mullakkara recalled. CPI leader and chairman of the Kerala State Housing Board P Prasad, however, has a clear memory of an occasion when Chandrasekharan Nair burst out at him. AISF decided to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 1996 at Thrissur when I was its state president.Almost all the front line national leaders of CPI were attending the function and we all wanted the presence of Chandrasekharan Nair. However, he declined when someone conveyed this to him. So the mantle fell on me as we shared a very warm relationship. Along with V S Sunilkumar, who was the state secretary, I met him. However, he blasted me, said Prasad.He was surprised to see a different face of the leader, who was the Minister for Food and Civil Supplies then. The Onam days are close, Chandrasekharan Nair told the student leaders. I am searching from where to get essential commodities, such as rice and chilly, for the public at a lower price. I cant afford any delay in that. Hence, I cant make it to the public meeting, he continued.This showed his disposition and diligent nature as an administrator who weighed work over words, said Prasad."

However, with the changing times, this habit has disappeared along with the traditional wicker tray on which the rice is spread.Now, most families prefer the cleaned, polished, ready-to-cook brands of rice. However, it comes at a cost and people are ready to pay. Most of the buyers opt for onions or shallots in packets. They do not have the patience for picking them up from a lot. The packet obviously comes at a higher price, said a shop owner."

Serving the pilgrims is a privilege given by Lord Ayyappa for the last three decades, he said. I will continue to serve the devotees at Karimala as long as my health condition permits.On reaching Pampa, the food and other raw materials will be transported to Karimala by hiring head load workers. The water needed for the preparation of the food is made available from a pond located about 60 ft below by installing two pumps.In addition to free food, the ABASS camp offers medicated water to the pilgrims. As the Forest Department has put restrictions on pilgrims at Karimala after 5 pm due to the threat of wild animals on the route between Karimala and Valiyanavattom, the camp attracts hundreds of pilgrims in the evening.The absence of toilets and water is the main issue faced by the pilgrims at Karimala. With the increased flow in the coming days and Makaravilakku season, the authorities should find a solution to the lack of basic facilities at Karimala."

It said Kim was reportedly a key figure in North Koreas efforts to switch its missile programme from liquid to solid fuel, while Ri was reported to be a key official in its intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) development.Treasury is targeting leaders of North Koreas ballistic missile programs, as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate (North Korea) and achieve a fully denuclearised Korean Peninsula, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.Chronology on North Korea's missile and nuclear developments, with corresponding UN reactions. (AFP)The largely symbolic steps block any property or interests the two might have within US jurisdiction and prohibit any dealings by US citizens with them.The move followed new United Nations sanctions announced last Friday in response to North Koreas November 29 test of an ICBM that Pyongyang said put all of the US mainland within range of its nuclear weapons. Those sanctions sought to further limit North Koreas access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad.North Korea declared the UN steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade.The standoff between the United States and North Korea has raised fears of a new conflict on the Korean peninsula, which has remained in a technical state of war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.Washington has said that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea. It says it prefers a diplomatic solution, but that North Korea has given no indication it is willing to discuss denuclearisation.Kremlin offerOn Tuesday, the Kremlin, which has long called for the two sides to hold negotiations, said it was ready to act as a mediator if the United States and North Korea were willing for it to play such a role.Russias readiness to clear the way for de-escalation is obvious, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Asked to comment on the offer, a spokesman for the US State Department, Justin Higgins, said the United States has the ability to communicate with North Korea through a variety of diplomatic channels, and added:We want the North Korean regime to understand that there is a different path that it can choose, however it is up to North Korea to change course and return to credible negotiations.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who made a similar offer on Monday, told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Tuesday that Washingtons aggressive rhetoric and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tensions and was unacceptable, Russias foreign ministry said.It said Lavrov underscored the need for the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions.Another State Department spokesman, Michael Cavey, said Washington remained open to talks, but the onus was on North Korea to take sincere and meaningful actions toward denuclearization and refrain from further provocations.He said North Korea had made clear through its words and actions it is not interested in dialogue at this stage.South Koreas Unification Ministry forecast on Tuesday that North Korea would look to open negotiations with the United States next year while continuing to seek recognition as a de facto nuclear power.Washington has stressed the need for all countries, especially Russia, and China - North Koreas main trading partner - to fully implement sanctions, including by cutting off oil supplies.According to Chinese customs data, China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going above and beyond UN sanctions imposed earlier this year.Beijing also imported no North Korean iron ore, coal or lead in November, the second full month of those trade sanctions, the data showed.Beijing has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, a year to the country via an aging pipeline.North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia.Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.Chinese exports of corn to North Korea in November also slumped, down 82% from a year earlier to 100 tonnes, the lowest since January. Exports of rice plunged 64% to 672 tonnes, the lowest since March.China has expressed concern about the humanitarian effects of sanctions, and has repeatedly called for constructive efforts to ease tensions."

We need drastic steps to tackle it,http://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/arsenic-poisoning-is-spreading-we-need-drastic-steps-to-tackle-it/story-j9UyOujE9izHfaTWvVy9fP.html,2017-12-27,"In a reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, the Union ministry of water resources said 239 million people across 153 districts in 21 states drink water that contains high levels of arsenic.Thats around a fifth of the countrys population, and by any standards, thats an appalling statistic.The actual number could be higher. India pegs arsenic concentrations above 50 parts per billion as harmful; in the US, it is 10 parts per billion. Arsenic is one of the 10 chemicals classified as a public health concern by the World Health Organization; it slowly poisons the body, potentially causing skin lesions, damage to the peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal ailments, diabetes, renal (kidney) failure, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. At least half the people who were known to be at risk of arsenic contamination live in the Ganga-Brahmaputra basins of Bangladesh and India (across the states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Manipur and Chhattisgarh).Groundwater contamination, Indias hidden crisisThe number of habitations affected by arsenic in India has increased from 3,728 in 2012-13 to 7,535 in 2015-16. This is because of the overuse of groundwater for irrigation and drinking. Arsenic previously occurred in a harmless insoluble conjugate with iron called arsenopyrite. Overuse has split this compound, contaminating groundwater with a soluble ionic form of arsenic. Over-exploitation of groundwater started in India in the 1970s when millions of tube wells were installed in the Ganga delta to prevent diarrhoea from surface water sources such as tanks, ponds and open wells. Today, India has over 30 million groundwater extraction points.Groundwater is also used for irrigation. This means arsenic poisoning affects not just the people of the area but also those who consume the produce of the affected region. In food, rice has the highest sensitivity to arsenic followed by vegetables. In most arsenic-affected states rice is the staple.Despite the crisis, groundwater contamination , either by arsenic or other pollutants such as fluorides, does not get the attention it deserves, especially when compared to surface water contamination because the latter is visible. Moreover, there is no law yet to check groundwater withdrawal.This severe environmental-health crisis has to be contained quickly before it can expand. Along with periodic testing of water in affected areas and individualised testing of each hand pump or tubewell (marking it as safe/unsafe), it is important to encourage people to opt for low-cost, local solutions such as rainwater harvesting that can ensure clean drinking water. States such as Bihar have set up filtration units but the maintenance of filters has always been a problem.This needs to be addressed. Additionally, governments have to curb the use of groundwater and keep a strict control on agricultural and industrial effluents that pollute aquifers that recharge groundwater."

She told me there was scope for the business to really take off, and I took her word for it, and moved here, said Cho, whose restaurant, MyungGa located in South Point mall, has been serving authentic South Korean food for the last six years.Apart from delicacies, like rice cakes and dried seaweed rolls, Cho has adapted her menu to serve spicy food that may add to the appeal for Indians who arrive at her restaurant to give the food a try. The latter, she says, constitute 20% of the clientele for the outlet. The journey, however, has been far from easy, with hurdles ranging from administrative issues to continuous changing laws, the owner said.The rules and regulations governing the setting up of a restaurant themselves are so complicated and tedious, that even getting the license for my outlet took a lot of patience, Cho said.The dietary prohibitions also keep changing, which means we continuously have to adapt our menu. The beef ban, for example, limited our options a lot.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon. (Sanjeev Verma/HT Photo)We moved here seven years ago. I opened this store to pass my time. We mainly have a Korean clientele, but a lot of Indians come here.Chos restaurant, however, isnt the only option for residents of the city looking for authentic food from the Asia Pacific region. In the same building where MyungGa stands, authentic Japanese food is offered at Manami, a restaurant headed by a Japan resident Tomiyama Ryji, who has two other branches in the National Capital Region (NCR) itself, in Manesar and in New Delhi.The close proximity of the outlets serves as a metaphor as many residents of these two neighbours in the Pacific sea have, miles away from home, found themselves at each others doorsteps once again.According to the data available at the Foreigners Registration Office (FRO) in Gurgaon, there are more than 8,000 Japanese people, and 3,000 South Koreans currently living in the city. The two communities have become so prominent that they now have magazines in their languages, to help new arrivals settle in and make older residents aware of the latest developments and options in terms of luxuries, cuisine, and entertainment.Most South Korean and Japanese people, reside in the gated condominiums on the Golf Course Road, Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road, and the new sectors. One of the main reasons for their presence in the city is the fact that Gurgaon district houses several multinational companies native to the two countries such as Hyundai, Samsung, Honda, Mitsubishi, LG, Toyota, and Suzuki.Korean family Jin Ho Park and In A Lee with their sons, Joo Won and Joo Hwan in Gurgaon.

Prior to this, the family had been in Chennai for two years.We had never been to India before we moved here and were slightly apprehensive about certain things, especially safety. However, we have found it is a relatively easy place to live in, and people are by and large friendly, said Saengkaew, whose social circle in Gurgaon is a reflection of the extent to which the expat population has integrated with the locals.I have many Indian friends here, who have introduced me to the local culture and cuisine.

The couple also has two sons, a 16-year-old Joo-Won and 12-year-old Joo-Hwan Park.Prior to their arrival, the family said they had to spent a fortnight eating primarily curries for their meals, in the hope of accustomizing themselves to the cuisine of the country. Settling in, however, they say, was much easier than they expected.While Jin-Ho said that Indians are easy to work with as a result of their hard work and non-egoistical natures, his wife boasts of a social circle that includes many local residents.I have a lot of friends here. I have been exposed to a lot of aspects of life here, which I may not have known otherwise. I go for dance classes and yoga classes with them, and have even learned how to make chapattis, said Lee, adding that she is also fascinated by big Indian gatherings.

The day after Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were pulled last year, Alli, the Kaanikkaran (tribal leader) of Kuttampuzha, handed out a big note at the ration shop and received his groceries as usual. Its never been different, not before, not after, not now.Kuttampuzha has 1,000 people scattered over Kunjippara, Variyam, Thalavachapra and Thera tribal colonies. There are two grocers, one tea shop and the ration shop. Its not a place of big savings. The men earn their living from labour and the women depend on MNREGS work and bamboo weaving.Barter is the bedrock of this economy. The people make bamboo mats and rubber sheets from materials gathered from the forest and deposit them at the two groceries where theres an account book. The grocer adjusts the vilagers earnings against the essential they buy.So mention of demonetisation sucks up no bad memories here; the changes made to the ration system by LDF govt do. Earlier, each family would receive 35 kg of rice from the ration shop but thats been cut down to 27 kg. To fill the gap, the govt threw in 7 kg of wheat, a grain thats not staple here. The 1 kg of sugar that used to be given has been scrapped. In sum, the tribals have to buy rice at a higher price from the grocers."

The Kochi CBI Court had sent him to CBI custody for seven days. He was produced back at the court the other day and was granted bail by the court. He has been arraigned as the fourth accused in the case, a CBI officer said.The investigating agency received key information on the graft during the interrogation of a truck driver, who was assigned allegedly by the FCI officers to transport a load of foodgrain from the Tikkodi FCI warehouse to the godown of RS Rice at Vidyanagar, Kasargod.We had conducted a raid at the godown of the rice company and found several sacks of FCI foodgrain. The PDS rice is repacked in 50-kg bags and is sold at the market at a very high price. The illegal diversion of FCI rice to the private company has been taken place for the last couple of years, the officer said.The CBI took up the probe after reports about the diversion of foodgrain from FCI godowns appeared in the media. According to CBI, On May 22, as many as 14 loads of foodgrain were sent from the FCI godown at Thikkodi to the Meenangadi FSD. However, one load did not reach the FSD. When reports about this appeared in the media, the officers forged the documents and claimed the truck could not reach the depot due to a technical snag.The agency found around 2,339 bags of foodgrain were diverted into the black market by the FCI officers at the Meenangadi depot during the past few months. The FCI has incurred a loss of around `38. 79 lakh due to the malpractice involving the officers and agents, the CBI officer said."

Their behaviour with him is sharply at variance with the obsequiousness of other senior aides, most of whom bow and hold their hands over their mouths when speaking to the young leader.Ri is one of the most prominent aides, and likely represents the Workers Party on the missile program, experts say.Born in 1948, Ri was partly educated in Russia and promoted when Kim Jong Un started to rise through the ranks in the late 2000s.Ri has visited China once and Russia twice. He met China's defence minister in 2008 as the air force commander and accompanied Kim Jong Il on a visit to a Russian fighter jet factory in 2011, according to state media.Kim Jong Sik is a prominent rocket scientist who rose after playing a role in North Korea's first successful launch of a rocket in 2012.He started his career as a civilian aeronautics technician, but now wears the uniform of a military general at the Munitions Industry Department, according to experts and the South Korean government.Many other details, including his age, are not known.On Tuesday, the Kremlin, which has long called for the United States and North Korea to negotiate, said it was ready to act as a mediator if the two sides were willing for it to play such a role.""Russia's readiness to clear the way for de-escalation is obvious,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.Asked to comment on the offer, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, Justin Higgins, said the United States ""has the ability to communicate with North Korea through a variety of diplomatic channels"", and added:""We want the North Korean regime to understand that there is a different path that it can choose, however it is up to North Korea to change course and return to credible negotiations.""Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who made a similar offer on Monday, told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Tuesday that ""Washington's aggressive rhetoric"" and beefing up of its military presence in the region had heightened tension and was unacceptable, his ministry said.Lavrov underscored the need for ""the fastest move to the negotiating process from the language of sanctions"", it said.Another U.S. State Department spokesman, Michael Cavey, said Washington remained open to talks, but the onus was on North Korea ""to take sincere and meaningful actions toward denuclearization and refrain from further provocations.""South Korea's Unification Ministry forecast on Tuesday that North Korea would look to open negotiations with the United States next year while continuing to seek recognition as a de facto nuclear power.The United States has stressed the need for all countries, especially Russia, and China - North Korea's main trading partner - to fully implement sanctions, including by cutting off oil supplies.According to Chinese customs data, China exported no oil products to North Korea in November, apparently going above and beyond U.N. sanctions imposed earlier in the year.China also imported no North Korean iron ore, coal or lead in November, the second full month of those trade sanctions, the data showed.China has not disclosed its crude exports to North Korea for several years, but industry sources say it still supplies about 520,000 tonnes, or 3.8 million barrels, a year to the country via an aging pipeline.North Korea also sources some of its oil from Russia.Trade between North Korea and China has slowed through the year, particularly after China banned coal purchases in February.

Many have been taken in by neighbors or extended families, authorities say, but face dangers such as child traffickers, diseases and malnourishment.By early December, the brothers had learned the physical landscape of the sprawling camp - which fishmonger sells the best dried fish, which adults should be avoided, which empty stretch of dirt is best for kicking a ball.But their grief is harder to navigate.""Everyone has parents but us,"" Shamsul often says out loud, part in pain, part in wonder.- - -On that August morning, soldiers came to their village toting automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rocket-launchers and sprayed the air with gunfire, according to witness accounts.The villagers scattered, some fleeing into the jungle for safety. Jafar said he took refuge on a small hill overlooking his house and watched as soldiers beat his mother, Monira, and three of his siblings, Somuda, 15, Khurshid, 7, and Shalida, 3 months. They pushed them into the house, barricaded the door and set the structure on fire. His family was burned alive inside, Jafar said.Villagers who escaped Tula Toli, a small community of rice farmers also known as Min Gyi, said local boys and men, including the boys' father, were summarily executed on a riverbank. An October report from Amnesty International said the violence at Tula Toli ""appears to be one of the worst atrocities of the Army's ethnic cleansing campaign.""Myanmar's military leaders and its civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have consistently denied that security forces in the Buddhist-majority country have targeted the Rohingya.In Tula Toli, escape for Jafar meant crossing a fast-moving river. He had been separated from Shamsul when the soldiers came, but he spotted the little boy, who cannot swim, riding in an old dinghy with others. He dove in. The current was strong, but the sight of the back of his brother's head made him swim harder.""Shamsul, Shamsul!""Jafar swam with all his strength, calling out to his brother.""I was afraid I would lose him,"" Jafar said. Several others drowned while attempting to cross.Jafar made it out of the river and onto the bank, where he embraced Shamsul. A fellow villager who saw the two boys during the chaos said he could not believe they lived.""They are only alive thanks to Allah,"" said Ali Mia, a local leader. ""God saved them.""The boys then followed a stream of people, including some of their neighbors, on a two-day journey on foot to the Bangladeshi border - without food, through burning villages, hearing distant gunfire. Jafar tried to comfort his younger brother. ""I kept asking him not to cry,"" he said.At the river crossing on the border, a grizzled smuggler refused to take them unless they each paid about $120, the boys said. A neighbor finally agreed to put up the money, and they followed the others to the refugee camp on the Bangladesh side.Word of Shamsul and Jafar's plight reached Kamal Hossein and his lost-and-found booth, a small kiosk that offers hope for separated families. In September, Hossein, also a refugee from Burma, spent his month's salary to rent a microphone to call out names of lost children, reuniting more than 700 children with relatives and garnering support from the United Nations refugee agency.After about two weeks, Mohammed Junaid heard of the announcement about his nephews and rushed to the camp to be reunited with them - learning then that his brother was dead.He and his wife, Jorina, began caring for the boys along with their own six children, ages 1 to 12, in their small bamboo-and-tarpaulin tent, with bags of rice and piles of kindling stacked in the corners and a mud oven to cook meals.""They are my brother's sons,"" Junaid said. ""I have to look after them. There is no other way.""- - -For the boys, being reunited with extended family has provided some refuge. But it has not staved off the hunger, or grief.Morning comes early at Thaingkhali, part of a group of camps that has grown to be one of the most densely populated refugee settlements in the world, with more than 800,000 residents. The first call to prayer echoes just after 5:30 a.m., the moon a silver disc still hanging in the sky. It's so cold that Shamsul's lips turn blue, and he shivers in the dawn light, wearing only a thin jacket.Most days, the boys trudge from their shelter home down the mud steps that have been cut into the hill, and then up again to the small mosque for morning prayers, and perhaps a few Koran lessons at the madrassa.It had been days since either of the boys had seen the inside of one of the cheerful learning centers set up by UNICEF - just yards away from their tent. Their uncle thinks the madrassa lessons are enough. The brothers roam with no supervision, dust from the dirt pathways caking their bare feet. In the afternoons, the warm sun makes them lazy and they lie around the tent.Daily soccer games are their only joy. They find flat ground, set up lumps of dirt as goal posts and kick the $2 soccer ball they pooled their coins to buy. Both Shamsul and Jafar smile, chasing the bouncing ball.Jafar said he misses his school in Tula Toli, which had its own soccer field, not far from the river where he and his brothers used to fish. He's hungry a lot of the time now. The 10-member family gets an allotment of rice, lentils and vegetable oil from the U.N. World Food Program every two weeks, and the uncle's work as a day laborer allows them to buy a few vegetables or dried fish.Back home, Jafar said, ""we had peanuts, green chilies, eggplants. We had everything growing in our own lands. We had so many vegetables to eat, and fresh fish.""Jafar brightens describing the flat river fish, as long as your hand to your elbow, that his mother used to fry with chili and turmeric on top.He said, he often doesn't feel like playing. His aunt and uncle say he and his brother are often depressed. Jorina, the aunt, said she struggles to find the words to console the two.- - -The boys face an uncertain future. In the evenings, the fading light casts long shadows from the palm tree leaves, and the air darkens with smoke from thousands of campfires. Men gather in the lanes and around the chai stalls to talk about the latest development - an agreement between Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh that would allow them to return home, if they can prove their residency. Many say that the idea of returning home is unrealistic now, with villages still burning and refugees trickling into Banglade"

Almost every girl here owns a hockey stick and dreams to don the national jersey  or to, on the strength of the game, get a job that means an end to abject poverty and hopelessness.Since 1990, 55 girls from Hesal and its adjoining hamlets have been selected for national teams in different age groups. Nikki Pradhan, a Hesal girl, became the first Olympian from Jharkhand when she played for India in Rio 2016. She was part of the team that beat China in the Asia Cup this November.Located in Khunti district, 50km south of Ranchi, the village has produced five international woman players. Many more are waiting in the wings.Hesals sights and sounds belie the hockey hub it is: green fields and trees, muddy roads, thatched huts and old people warming themselves in the winter sun. Theres nothing to suggest this village of around 60 families is anything but a typical slice of rural India.That is, till you encounter the girls.More than a dozen teenage girls dash for an uneven playground at the lone government school in the area, 2km from the village, before the afternoon sun begins to wilt in the horizon. Most of them carry tattered sports kits and almost all are barefoot.The girls come from poor families, which are dependent on the governments subsidised rice sold at Re 1 a kg. Their parents, mostly subsistence farmers, cannot provide adequate nutritious food, let alone buy them hockey sticks and shoes.The girls go through a gruelling schedule from dawn to dusk. After attending school from 7am to 2pm, they hit the ground on an empty stomach as there is no provision of a mid-day meal, or free lunch, for students of Class 8 and above.We eat rice for breakfast. After school hours, we play hockey for two to three hours because if we go home for food we would miss training, which we dont want to, said Rita Kumari, a Class 9 student.Hockey enthusiasts from Hesal village on their way to play a village-level hockey match in Khunti in Jharkhand. (Diwakar Prasad/ HT Photo)The girls do not complain. They work as farmhands to fund their passion. And their love of the sport (and the hope that it can mean a better tomorrow) keeps them going.Mere pitaji kisan hai aur unke paas itne paise nahi hai ki stick kharid sake (my father is a farmer and he cannot afford to buy me a stick), 13-year-old Mangri Saru said, sweat dripping from her forehead after a workout.So, I worked in a field and bought a wooden stick at Rs 400. Olympian Nikki Pradhan and her sisters did the same to earn and buy hockey sticks.My eldest daughter, Shashi Pradhan, was the first from the family to play hockey. When she demanded a hockey stick, I discouraged her from playing the game. I couldnt say that I couldnt afford to buy a stick. Poor girl worked as a labourer and bought a stick from the money she earned, said father Soma Pradhan.Hockey enthusiasts from Hesal village on their way to play a village-level hockey match in Khunti in Jharkhand. (Diwakar Prasad/ HT Photo)It was schoolteacher Dasrath Mahto, who, back in 1989, started the hockey craze in the village by coaching a few girls. He continued the process for more than two decades till hockey became a traditional game in the village.When I joined the school, girls playing hockey was not acceptable in the area. I convinced parents and motivated the girls. Now it is in the blood of the people, he said.From 1990 to his retirement in 2016, the school produced 72 national and international woman hockey players. But after Mahto, the school has yet to get a sports teacher.The role models for todays girls are those who came before, many of whom have since landed jobs as coaches and managers with the government and private sports institutions.Hockey coach Jasmani Tiru, who played in national competitions in the 1990s, said the success of rural girls in national and international meets created job opportunities for them. They got hired by the government and this propelled the sports popularity in the region.According to Tiru, six girls from Hesal and nearby villages are with the railways and other government departments and companies.Still, theres little recognition by the state. I wrote to the government for a day-boarding centre for girls in the area but my request fell on deaf ears, complained Dasrath Mahto.According to Khunti coach Suresh Mahto, the town could have been a springboard for the rural talent, but the initiative has been lost. The towns astroturf was not watered for seven years and its damaged now.Not all is lost though. The state plans a sign a deal with Tata Steel for coaching players of the Khunti area, Jharkhand sports director Ranendra Kumar said.The Tata Trust is imparting training to budding hockey players of villages. We are planning to set up a day-boarding centre for girls in Murhu block and a separate astroturf ground for girls in Khunti, he added.Jharkhand has a glorious hockey tradition, and both boys and girls are fond of the national game. But its the girls who have shone on the bigger stage.We are confident at least three players from Jharkhand will play in the next Olympics, state hockey association president Bholanath Singh predicted.Thats what the Hesal girls are working so hard for."
